1
00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:02,757
This is where you will get the answer.

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:04,525
Commission for what?

3
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:06,853
A commission for making her disappear!

4
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:10,117
She was being a snob and wearing black gloves.

5
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:12,741
It wasn’t Pi.

6
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:14,389
I can remember now,

7
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:16,389
who it was.

8
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:33,165
(Humans are not afraid of committing a sin.)

9
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,549
After the job is done,

10
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,613
you need to pay the rest of the fee.

11
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,997
(But we are afraid of paying for our sin.)

12
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:45,597
Chatfah.

13
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,677
Chatfah?

14
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:54,429
We've got to go.

15
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:57,429
What about Pi?

16
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:58,893
Someone will help her.

17
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,525
We can’t let them catch you right now.

18
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,357
Come on.

19
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:20,285
Look.

20
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,229
In this area, this is the only place.

21
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:24,197
Let’s go.

22
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,021
You can’t go in.

23
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:48,197
But my sister is in there.

24
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:49,629
The police are working in the building.

25
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,181
[Chat’s phone is found here.]
[I’ll go check it first.]

26
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,517
We don’t let anyone go in.

27
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:04,205
What the heck!

28
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,189
(No matter what we have been taught.)

29
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,245
(But in the end,)

30
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:16,829
(the only thing that is passed on to us
is the survival instinct.)

31
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:27,661
(That’s why we need
to stay calm and composed.)

32
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:28,541
Bua.

33
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:31,837
Chompoo.

34
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,123
(The reason is, if we mess up one day,)

35
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:42,381
(we will be calm enough
to figure out how to get off the hook.)

36
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,149
Inspector.

37
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:56,237
Don’t say anything.

38
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,397
I’ve worked hard on the case.

39
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:01,277
I know.

40
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:03,381
But we received a tip that

41
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:06,437
you are involved with one of the suspects.

42
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:11,133
You know that this is a high-profile case.

43
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:14,589
I think it’d be better for you
to step away from the case.

44
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,197
Before things get out of hand.

45
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:20,437
And I have to impose disciplinary action on you.

46
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,517
I got it, Inspector.

47
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,061
Picha is in a hospital.

48
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,061
Team B found her unconscious
in the abandoned house

49
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,381
where the phone’s signal was tracked.

50
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:00,701
How did she get there?

51
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,093
Only the members of the team know about this.

52
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,663
I think you would want to know it.

53
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,397
Why are you telling me?

54
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,753
Because I know you would want to visit her.

55
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,365
Actually, I’m not telling you anything.

56
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:20,989
I’m reading a report and
you accidentally see the name of the hospital.

57
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:29,829
Thanks.

58
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,789
Chompoo.

59
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,933
Picha was discharged from the ER.

60
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:46,805
The doctor said she only passed out.

61
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,597
When she wakes up,
they’ll transfer her to an inpatient room.

62
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,709
Doing okay?

63
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:05,861
Yes.

64
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,381
The doctor said her condition is not serious.

65
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,877
I’m talking about you.

66
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:13,153
Are you okay?

67
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:16,541
Yes.

68
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,405
Chompoo, did you see who attacked Picha?

69
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,197
Bua.

70
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:44,581
I saw Bua running out of the house with a man.

71
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:58,269
I backed up data from Chatfah’s phone.

72
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,365
It’s downloading.

73
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:04,789
I wiped our fingerprints from her phone.

74
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,141
Even if the police find it,
they cannot trace it to us.

75
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:11,205
Hey.

76
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:13,645
What are you thinking?

77
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:16,063
Why did Chat do this?

78
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:19,893
Are you sure…

79
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,533
the woman who met with the hitman
was Chatfah?

80
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,713
Then…

81
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,703
there’s only one reason.

82
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:38,965
Chatfah wanted to disappear.

83
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:41,365
Yes.

84
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:43,885
Then what?

85
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:47,077
Why did she do that?

86
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,837
What is she going to do next?

87
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,389
I think we might find the answer in there.

88
00:07:56,513 --> 00:08:00,685
There must be something
that she hid and never told anyone.

89
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,829
She might be fooled by someone.

90
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,013
She was fooled?

91
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,085
There’s no way she was fooled.

92
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,813
Stop thinking so highly of her.

93
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:15,365
Why?

94
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,003
Why do you love her this much?

95
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:22,365
Is it because she saved your life?

96
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,021
That’s why you love her?

97
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,629
My sister is not as innocent as you think.

98
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,013
Everything that she did was for her own benefit.

99
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,485
You are her sister.

100
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:37,605
You are her family.

101
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:44,445
You are only the few people in this world
who can help her.

102
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,549
Why do you think poorly of her?

103
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,181
Because I’m her sister.

104
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:53,829
That’s why I know what she is capable of.

105
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:56,421
What would you know?

106
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:02,421
Now, I get it,

107
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:05,325
why Chatfah wanted to disappear.

108
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,093
Because she has a sister like you.

109
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,325
It means she has no one.

110
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:18,309
Your family is not a family.

111
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:22,093
All of you only care about yourself.

112
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,101
Does it mean that

113
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:44,989
Bua is not in danger after her disappearance?

114
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:47,181
I…

115
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,021
I’m not sure.

116
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,541
I don’t know why she was there.

117
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:59,605
I don’t want to believe
that Bua and that man attacked Pi.

118
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:05,821
But I don’t get why she was there.

119
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:06,917
Calm down.

120
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:10,183
We don’t have any evidence to support it.

121
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:13,213
I was dismissed from the investigation team.

122
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,381
I don’t have any updates on the case.

123
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,663
Then what are you doing here?

124
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,285
The patient is sent to an inpatient room.

125
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,253
You can visit her now.

126
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,293
We searched the crime scene.

127
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,629
No traces of forced entry were found.

128
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,757
Neither are the traces of a struggle.

129
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:05,973
We believe that he was shot by his wife.

130
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,613
Nothing was missing from the crime scene.

131
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,381
What about my dad’s golden watch?

132
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,581
The pocket watch?

133
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:25,213
My dad told me to get it cleaned.

134
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,141
I put it back on the desk in his workroom.

135
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,461
I was looking for it, but I couldn’t find it.

136
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,917
It was not in the box either.

137
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,693
If that’s what you think of her,

138
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,965
you are as dangerous to her as her attacker.

139
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:20,285
Pi.

140
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:23,197
I’m sorry that I went there too late.

141
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,293
I hope you’ll be alright.

142
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,797
I’ll stay with her tonight.

143
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:30,701
I’m worried about her.

144
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:32,861
I don’t feel good about this.

145
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,429
I can stay with her.

146
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,325
Captain Chain told me what happened.

147
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:50,323
I rushed here because I’m worried about her.

148
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,141
Thanks, Parn, for worrying about her.

149
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,261
But I don’t want to bother you.

150
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,021
Chom, we only have each other now.

151
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,629
We are the Bupphachindas.

152
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:12,253
Hello.

153
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:15,525
I’m sorry, Miss Chomchai.

154
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,013
It’s okay, Captain.

155
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,663
I’ll take care of it.

156
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:37,125
Aunty Chom.

157
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,541
I’ll help you carry it.

158
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,101
You are acting strangely today.

159
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,221
Did you also get hit in the head like Picha?

160
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,893
No, Aunty.

161
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,093
I thought you might feel tired.

162
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,173
So I want to help.

163
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,245
It’s okay, Miss Chom.

164
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,885
I can do it.

165
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:58,053
You’ve been with our family for a long time.

166
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,981
I never saw you leave the house.

167
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:02,085
This is probably the first time I've seen it.

168
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,661
I don’t like going out.

169
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:06,501
It’s unfamiliar to me.

170
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,701
I’ve lived with your family for a long time.

171
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:11,381
I love and stay loyal to your family.

172
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,893
The house became my home.

173
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:18,541
Do you also think
the belongings in the house are yours?

174
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:24,013
I know…

175
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:28,069
you have something that doesn’t belong to you.

176
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:32,325
Isn’t this considered a theft?

177
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,429
I can fire you for that.

178
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:39,925
If that thing is yours, then you’re right.

179
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:44,741
But does what I have belong to you?

180
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:48,389
I don’t think it’s yours.

181
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,349
How did you know that it went missing?

182
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:57,477
You can report it to the police if you want.

183
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:02,221
But what do you want me to tell the police
where I found it?

184
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:05,821
If I tell them that I found it under your bed,

185
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,861
you might get into trouble.

186
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:13,781
How much do you want?

187
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:18,421
You should ask me what I want.

188
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:23,989
I’m sick of the lies in your family.

189
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:26,421
My family?

190
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,629
My family has been taking good care of you.

191
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,221
Are you sure about that?

192
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:35,381
I don’t want to talk about this anymore.

193
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:37,753
I have many things to do.

194
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:41,197
I’ll put it this way.

195
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,703
What I want is not something you can give.

196
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:46,053
Wait.

197
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:47,925
You’ve been living with us for a long time.

198
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,845
You were close to my dad.

199
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:51,429
He trusted you the most.

200
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:52,805
How can you do this to me?

201
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:57,333
How could you and Mr. Nathat do that?

202
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:01,141
He’s your sister’s fiancé.

203
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:06,301
We all have our own reasons.

204
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:10,477
The only thing we have in common is

205
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,181
that we do everything for our own benefit.

206
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,973
I found your booze in the cabinet.

207
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:39,709
Can I drink it?

208
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:41,773
But you are drinking it.

209
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:51,749
Do you want to drink with me?

210
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,813
Are you telling me to drink my own booze?

211
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:02,549
Here.

212
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:10,797
I’ve been thinking.

213
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,517
What you said is true.

214
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:19,085
I have never been a good sister to Chat.

215
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,701
It’s not surprising…

216
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,909
that she would hire someone
to orchestrate her disappearance.

217
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,557
My family is weird.

218
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:45,349
We were taught

219
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:48,421
that we need to prove that we are worthy of it.

220
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:51,789
But actually,

221
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,793
we should have received it unconditionally.

222
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:55,229
What is it?

223
00:17:58,353 --> 00:17:59,493
Love.

224
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:07,549
We were taught to be good people,

225
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:11,053
if we want to receive love.

226
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:16,501
We needed to be daughters
that our parents could be proud of.

227
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:19,037
The daughters who deserved their love.

228
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:21,997
The daughters who were worthy.

229
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,253
But in fact,

230
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:29,653
love should be a fundamental part of a family.

231
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,213
They used love as leverage.

232
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:41,429
So we would be obedient to them.

233
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:44,725
They used hope…

234
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,917
to turn us against each other.

235
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,423
The more hope we got.

236
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:56,869
The more we unknowingly hurt each other.

237
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,981
But the truth is…

238
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:06,661
our family should have been our safe zone.

239
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:10,421
They should have loved us unconditionally.

240
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,423
Anyone can be a parent.

241
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,541
But not everyone can be a good parent.

242
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:44,821
What you should do is
not pass on this wound and pain to others.

243
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:50,581
As a daughter…

244
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,213
and a sister,

245
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,117
I think you’re doing your job well.

246
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:18,909
Your glass is empty.

247
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,253
I’ll get it refilled.

248
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,333
Pi, you are awake.

249
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,117
Chat, you are back.

250
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,477
I’m back.

251
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:55,997
Where have you been?

252
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:58,317
Everyone was looking for you.

253
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,109
We only miss someone…

254
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,633
when they are away.

255
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:09,869
It’s strange.

256
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,593
When I was around,

257
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:14,143
You guys always made a fuss.

258
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,349
What are you talking about?

259
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,933
I’m happy that you are back.

260
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,813
I’m really glad that you are back.

261
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,805
Pi, aren’t you mad that I betrayed you?

262
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:31,597
No.

263
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,277
I’m not mad at you anymore.

264
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,781
It’s not a big deal, compared to your safety.

265
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:42,701
Now I realized
our family is the most important thing.

266
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:47,309
All I want is for you and Bua to return safely.

267
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,333
Are you acting fake?

268
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,381
Think carefully.

269
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:07,709
What is the cause of everything that happened?

270
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:14,173
How did it start?

271
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:17,405
If you figure it out,

272
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:19,773
you will stop acting fake.

273
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,233
Because the truth is…

274
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:28,829
we always put ourselves first.

275
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:43,829
Picha.

276
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:45,733
Picha.

277
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:47,253
You are awake.

278
00:22:52,513 --> 00:22:53,757
I…

279
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:55,753
You don’t need to say anything.

280
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:57,605
You should rest.

281
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:58,821
Tomorrow morning,

282
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,823
police will come here to interview you.

283
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:07,669
No.

284
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,461
I have to say it.

285
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:11,733
I have to tell someone.

286
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,965
My family has too many secrets.

287
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,101
I’ll tell you everything.

288
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:22,473
This whole family is full of liars.

289
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,421
If this ring falls into the hands of the police,

290
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:37,605
your daughter will be in big trouble, Mr. Asok.

291
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:14,837
Aunty Chom.

292
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,645
Miss Chompoo, when did you get here?

293
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,285
Why didn’t you tell me?

294
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,021
I just got here.

295
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:26,157
I came to get Pi’s clothes.

296
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,553
Do you really need to come here to get them?

297
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,421
Yes.

298
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,141
I've got to go.

299
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:37,925
Where are her clothes?

300
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,333
I just remember
that she doesn’t need them yet.

301
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:49,245
Does lying run in your family?

302
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:52,189
Mr. Asok, Mrs. Pimol,

303
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,405
and Miss Chompoo all do it.

304
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:55,773
Aunty Chom!

305
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,613
You take someone else’s belongings.

306
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:00,973
Although I’m just a house helper,

307
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:03,605
I don’t think you should do it.

308
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:06,493
So what?

309
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:09,813
It’s actually mine.

310
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:11,349
It was in my room.

311
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:13,325
You are the one who took it.

312
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:16,373
But it’s Nathat’s engagement ring.

313
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:19,653
How could it be in your room?

314
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:21,973
Tell me.

315
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:24,797
Admit it.

316
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:27,629
You had an affair with Chat’s fiancé.

317
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,821
Are you out of your mind?

318
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,869
So what if I was his lover?

319
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,205
What would you do about it?

320
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:40,253
I can’t do anything to you.

321
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:43,869
Even a bigger scandal can’t do anything to you.

322
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,013
You are the hardest one to handle.

323
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:52,837
But Nathat is not like you.

324
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:56,141
If I tell the police about it,

325
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,093
It will be a turn of events.

326
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,389
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,765
Do you miss Dad so much
that you become delusional?

328
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,293
You are the crazy one!

329
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:10,157
Among the members of your family,

330
00:27:10,181 --> 00:27:11,997
I hate you the most.

331
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,029
You, crazy bitch.

332
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:15,973
No, you are the crazy bitch.

333
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:17,093
Where are you going?

334
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,485
You, witch!

335
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:31,597
Bitch.

336
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:37,557
Bitch.

337
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:40,837
Bitch, let me go.

338
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,581
You, crazy bitch.

339
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:57,805
What took you so long?

340
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:58,981
Did you get the ring?

341
00:27:59,013 --> 00:27:59,885
Yes.

342
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:00,573
Let’s go.

343
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,501
Wait.

344
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,461
Bitch, you are fired.

345
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:21,973
Be gentle.

346
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,893
Damn!

347
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:30,603
I know that she is weird.

348
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:32,373
But I never thought she was a psycho.

349
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:36,493
How did I live with her for many years?

350
00:28:37,223 --> 00:28:38,101
You’re right.

351
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,381
She is so creepy.

352
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:41,965
Hey.

353
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:45,653
Is it possible that Chatfah was stabbed…

354
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:48,141
by her?

355
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,213
No.

356
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:52,717
I need to tell the police about this.

357
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:54,003
You can’t do that.

358
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:57,383
What if they ask you about the ring?

359
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,469
It will trace back to Nathat.

360
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,269
Right?

361
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,353
Then all I can do is fire her?

362
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:06,141
She tried to kill me.

363
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,403
I’m not saying that
you should let her get away with it.

364
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:12,069
But…

365
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,261
I want you to think carefully.

366
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:20,141
What are you going to tell the police
about Nathat?

367
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:27,197
I don’t know.

368
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,005
Things are getting out of hand.

369
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:33,629
It started with covering up a lie.

370
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:36,463
Now, it spirals to a dozen lies.

371
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,653
I don’t want to create another problem

372
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:41,581
I want to fix it.

373
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,877
But some of the problems

374
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:47,485
you aren’t the only one who started it.

375
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,513
Thank you for coming to see me.

376
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:03,429
It’s your request.

377
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,797
Of course, I have to come.

378
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:11,157
I found it.

379
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:14,397
The only evidence…

380
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:17,221
proving that you were at the house that night.

381
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:25,421
I’m sorry.

382
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,597
But I can’t return it to you.

383
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:30,885
Why?

384
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:35,493
Like I told you.

385
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,845
I trust no one.

386
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:41,669
But I want you to trust me.

387
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:46,341
I will do my best to keep this secret,

388
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:50,789
if you do what I tell you.

389
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:54,661
Chom.

390
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,973
Are you blackmailing me?

391
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:00,933
You can see it that way.

392
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:04,405
But I’ll call it…

393
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:08,261
our mutual benefits.

394
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:16,621
Fine.

395
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:20,277
What do you want me to do?

396
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,437
Protect me.

397
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:33,853
There’s a secret…

398
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:36,717
that no one in my family dares to talk about.

399
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:39,149
Secret?

400
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:41,125
What secret?

401
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:50,285
Why did my mom shoot my dad?

402
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:56,981
Then she shot herself.

403
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,389
We are all curious about it.

404
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:05,869
But none of us talks about it.

405
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:07,501
Because we are afraid to know the answer.

406
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:10,597
Except Chatfah.

407
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:15,237
She was the only one
who had been trying to find the truth.

408
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:18,621
On that night,

409
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,621
she also asked us this question.

410
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:26,069
In exchange, she would share
a part of her inheritance with us.

411
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:33,573
My family always lies to each other
like it’s normal.

412
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,685
For our survival,

413
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:38,861
we put ourselves first.

414
00:32:40,413 --> 00:32:43,205
We choose to hide problems,
rather than fixing them.

415
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,117
That’s what our parents taught us.

416
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:54,021
Lying our way out of it,

417
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,669
that’s what we need to do.

418
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:05,381
We didn’t tell Mom that we would come home.

419
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:06,509
Do you think she will be home?

420
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:11,773
Mom is home.

421
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:13,221
Let’s prank her.

422
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:14,053
Keep quiet.

423
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:38,433
Why didn’t you tell me
that you’re coming home?

424
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:41,397
We went to the gym.

425
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:43,221
We stopped by to take a shower.

426
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:48,773
This is Mr. Chad.

427
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:53,333
He was the chief engineer at our farm.

428
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:54,669
He moved to America.

429
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:55,805
But now, he has moved back.

430
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:03,845
Hello.

431
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:07,473
Hello. Nice to meet you.

432
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:10,805
I think I should go.

433
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,133
I’ll come to meet Mr. Asok another time.

434
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:17,437
I’ll walk you out.

435
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:27,909
Did you see what I saw?

436
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:31,397
Is it what I think?

437
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,421
It can’t be anything else.

438
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:36,485
We were not two-year-old kids
who don’t know what that is.

439
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:40,805
But that’s our mom.

440
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,205
Because she is our mom.

441
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:44,965
Bua.

442
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:46,909
Why are you so quiet?

443
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:48,021
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

444
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:50,821
Think what?

445
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:52,061
I’m not thinking anything.

446
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:54,757
You’re not thinking anything?

447
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:55,797
How could you do that?

448
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,549
It was nothing.

449
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,349
He just moved back from the U.S.

450
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,621
He’s probably still used to
the Western way of greeting.

451
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,757
Which Westerns greet others by…

452
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:12,829
The way he did.

453
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:14,861
I ask you for real.

454
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:19,869
We didn’t see anything.

455
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,477
Stop talking about this.

456
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:33,861
An engineer at a flower farm
was killed in an accident.

457
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,003
This is not true.

458
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:50,573
No.

459
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:52,485
This is not true.

460
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:54,621
This is not true.

461
00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:57,773
Mom, what happened?

462
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:00,869
It cannot end like this.

463
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,703
It cannot end like this.

464
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:05,933
Mom, what are you talking about?

465
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:08,733
It’s not an accident.

466
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,213
Your dad.

467
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,637
Your dad killed him.

468
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:19,229
Mom.

469
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:20,925
What happened?

470
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,621
I’ll make him pay for it.

471
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,885
I’ll make him pay for it.

472
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:40,829
That incident is probably
the beginning of these tragedies.

473
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:43,757
No.

474
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:47,445
Something else might happen before that.

475
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:50,413
But I don’t know about it.

476
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:57,757
Do you know who he was?

477
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:00,593
This is all I know.

478
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,061
If you investigate it,

479
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:06,781
you may get new information.

480
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,629
Are you saying…

481
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,341
your mom killed your dad because of this?

482
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,221
But I still don’t get it.

483
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,997
Why does Chatfah think someone else killed your mom?

484
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,733
She probably knew the whole truth.

485
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,605
I think Chatfah suspected that…

486
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:35,793
among her three sisters,

487
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:39,029
Bua,

488
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,109
Chom,

489
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:43,221
and I,

490
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:52,045
who told Dad about Mom’s affair partner?

491
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:59,045
Someone told Dad this secret.

492
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:03,485
Then Mom decided to kill Dad.

493
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:05,677
Because her affair partner was dead.

494
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:09,965
It must be one of us.

495
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:27,477
Thank you for today.

496
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:33,149
For everything.

497
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:35,973
I…

498
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,957
You owe me again.

499
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,253
What do you mean?

500
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:02,405
I destroyed all the evidence for you.

501
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:04,485
So…

502
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,853
your life is now in my hands.

503
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,733
You can’t leave me.

504
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:19,213
This is the only way…

505
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:21,333
to keep you with me.

506
00:39:23,473 --> 00:39:24,445
Nathat.

507
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:27,621
He can’t do this.

508
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:31,229
No one can.

509
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,589
DON’T FORGET
A MEETING WITH UNCLE KAJORN.

510
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:33,365
Hey.

511
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:35,605
I know…

512
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:39,005
you will find that in Chatfah’s phone.

513
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:41,661
But I can explain it.

514
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,405
Then explain it.

515
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:46,773
Hey.

516
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:50,725
Can you put the gun down first?

517
00:40:51,443 --> 00:40:52,373
No.

518
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:56,565
I trust you way too much.

519
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:02,533
You know that
I know a lot about you and your sisters.

520
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:04,029
Right?

521
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:06,677
Yes.

522
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,021
But I never thought
you knew that much about us.

523
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:14,045
What about Uncle Kajorn?

524
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,485
Why did you go to meet him?

525
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:19,621
Please put the gun down. Okay?

526
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:20,501
No.

527
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,333
If you put the gun down,

528
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:26,083
I promise I will tell you everything.

529
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:26,805
Please.

530
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:43,069
Then let’s start with this.

531
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,661
My dad’s watch.

532
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:53,533
Why do you have it?

533
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,021
My dad loved this watch.

534
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:02,633
On the day he was killed,

535
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,637
we all searched the whole house.

536
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:05,893
But we couldn’t find it.

537
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,365
Why do you have it?

538
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:08,213
Okay.

539
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:09,757
Answer me.

540
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:10,397
Hold on.

541
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:13,669
I promise…

542
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:16,213
I’ll tell you everything.

543
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:18,813
But you need to calm down.

544
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:20,613
Please.

545
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:22,797
Put the gun down.

546
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:24,773
We can talk.

547
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:26,165
Explain it.

548
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:31,549
Then I’ll decide whether I should calm down.

549
00:42:33,623 --> 00:42:37,373
Chatfah sent this watch to me.

550
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:44,861
Mom.

551
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,917
(It’s scary to pay for our sins.)

552
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:13,885
(So we try to do good deeds
as much as possible.)

553
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:15,869
Does it mean…

554
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,197
Chat was there when it happened?

555
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:29,989
Why?

556
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:36,789
Why did she pretend like she knew nothing?

557
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,285
(So we can get away with it?)

558
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:45,981
Stop.

559
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:46,853
Let me go.

560
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:48,853
(But I think it’s too late.)

561
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:49,965
Calm down.

562
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:51,653
Stop acting crazy! So we can talk.

563
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:53,005
Talk about what?

564
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:55,365
How can I believe anything you say?

565
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:57,493
You have lied to me so many times.

566
00:43:57,757 --> 00:43:58,813
Okay.

567
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:01,949
I’ll let you go.

568
00:44:02,783 --> 00:44:04,477
Then I’ll explain everything.

569
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,029
I won’t hide anything from you.

570
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:09,213
Okay?

571
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:26,443
(My solution is…)

572
00:44:27,903 --> 00:44:30,029
(I need to live a long life.)

573
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:34,205
(This way, I can postpone
paying for my sins for a while.)

574
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:36,983
Then let’s start with this one.

575
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:42,501
Who exactly are you?

576
00:44:47,003 --> 00:44:48,021
Tell me.

577
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:50,421
Tell me who you are.

578
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,477
I have no one I can trust.

579
00:44:58,509 --> 00:44:59,677
Then believe in yourself.

580
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,557
Let’s end your family’s curse here.

581
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:03,837
What do I need to do?

582
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:07,029
I’ll help you find the truth.

583
00:45:07,803 --> 00:45:09,613
Who sent the flower basket to me?

584
00:45:09,903 --> 00:45:10,933
Was it this woman?

585
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:12,485
I think so.

586
00:45:13,513 --> 00:45:15,725
I’m taking you with me.
