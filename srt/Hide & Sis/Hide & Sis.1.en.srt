1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,585
(Every family has secrets.)

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,356
(The secret that only the family members know.)

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,585
I knew you would be the first one to come here.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,000
(There’s a reason it is kept a secret.)

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,621
(The moment the secret is exposed.)

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,403
(Family might no longer be a family.)

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,276
(To protect the important thing, )

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,680
(How far are you willing to go
to keep the secret?)

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,669
(Will you lie?)

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,698
(Will you cover it up?)

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,898
(Or will you even kill?)

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,527
Picha.

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,727
Are you ready to answer my questions?

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,829
What happened?

15
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,036
I…

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,843
My sister’s name is Chatfah.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Chat.

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,890
Chat.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,189
When I got there,

20
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,810
Chatfah was lying on the ground.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,010
Chat.

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,047
Bua.

23
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,570
Chat.

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,540
Chom.

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,803
Chom, call the police.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Blood.

27
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,854
There was blood everywhere.

28
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,047
I don’t know what happened.

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,425
Was Chatfah dead?

30
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,310
Chom.

31
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,480
Chom.

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,167
Go help her.

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,840
Chom, help me stop the bleeding.

34
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,840
(911, what’s your emergency?)

35
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,610
My sister.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,378
My sister was stabbed.

37
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,270
I’ll get a towel to stop the bleeding.

38
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:52,458
Take care of her.

39
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,392
(Pi, I’m waiting for you.)

40
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,770
(Do you have any idea
who attacked your sister?)

41
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,058
I heard you guys were very close.

42
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,785
We…

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,356
We were close?

44
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,218
12 HOURS EARLIER

45
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,083
(Pi, I’m waiting for you.)

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,749
Miss Pi.

47
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,283
Here is your purse.

48
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:28,421
Are you going to Bupphachat Mansion?

49
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,450
Yes.

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,927
My family has an important gathering.

51
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,036
Actually, I don’t want to leave the shooting.

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,014
It’s a new collection for this year.

53
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,170
Please take a look.

54
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,570
Do you like it?

55
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,145
I want the logo to be more prominent.

56
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,403
Can you adjust the color tone…

57
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:46,763
Miss Pi.

58
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,058
God Gem just launched their new collection.

59
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,705
It looks exactly like ours.

60
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,836
They launched it before us.

61
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,600
They will accuse us of copying them again.

62
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:04,210
BUPPHACHINDA IS A MURDERER.
Tell them to come out and talk to us.

63
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,586
Come out now.
STOP USING PESTICIDE!
YOU’RE KILLING THE COMMUNITY

64
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,821
No one responds to our contacts.

65
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,727
Come out.

66
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,110
Mr. Kajorn.

67
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,450
Mr. Kajorn, don’t ignore us.

68
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,768
The villagers are sick because of the chemicals used on your farm.

69
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,494
My oldest child is sick at home because
the water is contaminated with pesticides.

70
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,014
Please help us.

71
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,556
Our legal team is informed about it.

72
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:31,345
But we never received any contact from them.

73
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,780
They will contact you soon.

74
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,356
We will sue you.

75
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,040
Especially those who accuse our company without evidence.

76
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,356
Villagers are gathering at the entrance.

77
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:55,032
Do you want to use the back entrance instead?

78
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,050
No.

79
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,670
This is a good chance for us.

80
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,298
Mr. Kajorn.

81
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,341
Mr. Kajorn.

82
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Mr. Kajorn.

83
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,152
Please help us.

84
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,243
Don’t sue us.

85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,112
Mr. Kajorn.

86
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,130
Mr. Kajorn.

87
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,152
Mr. Kajorn.

88
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,440
Mr. Kajorn, please don’t sue us.

89
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,476
Mr. Kajorn.

90
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,232
Are you alright?

91
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,643
Your shoe.

92
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,010
It’s okay.

93
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,327
Take her child to the hospital.

94
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,160
I’ll cover the medical bills.

95
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:35,327
Yes.

96
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,923
Everyone, don’t worry.

97
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,796
Bupphachinda will do its best
to compensate those who are affected.

98
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,032
Here are your shoes, Miss Bua.

99
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,305
The compensation budget
that you approve to create a false image.

100
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,036
No, to create an alliance.

101
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:29,140
That’s a lot of money.

102
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,207
I have been dealing with crises
even before you were born.

103
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,800
You should let me
and the executive board handle it.

104
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,250
Miss Bua, please let us handle it.

105
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,432
Okay. This is it for today.

106
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,618
Thank you, everyone.

107
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,349
Bua and I have family matters to discuss.

108
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,276
Please excuse us.

109
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,981
Bua, you can go by yourself, right?

110
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,250
Or do you want to ride with me?

111
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,407
I can go by myself.

112
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:13,156
Bupphachat Mansion is my house.

113
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,970
Who knows?

114
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,087
When the will is revealed,

115
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,763
the mansion might no longer be yours.

116
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
I’m kidding.

117
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,250
It’s just a joke. Don’t take it seriously.

118
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,105
He’s so cocky.

119
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:41,898
He gets too big for his boots.

120
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,123
I hope the shares I will get from my dad’s will are larger than Uncle Kajorn’s total shares.

121
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,356
Miss Bua, the art department said
the photo is ready.

122
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Here.

123
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,520
The executive board is siding with my uncle.

124
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,869
But the public is on my side.

125
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,105
Post it.

126
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:17,312
Yes.

127
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,094
IS SHE THE OLDEST DAUGHTER?
SHE’S THE MOST TALENTED.

128
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:25,190
SHE’S MUCH BETTER THAN
THE MALE EXECUTIVE.

129
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:26,397
REMEMBER THE 2ND SISTER, CHOMPOO?
SHE’S SUCH A BRAT.
WE SHOULD WAIT AND SEE.
DON’T CRITICIZE ME YET,
BUT I THINK THIS FAMILY IS SLY.

130
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:30,181
SHE’S THE GEM OF BUPPHACHINDA.
SHE’S SO KIND.
SHE DOESN’T CARE THAT
SHE RUINS HER EXPENSIVE SHOE.

131
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,461
Great.

132
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,505
Okay.

133
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,549
Good job.

134
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,570
Thank you.

135
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:48,800
Goodbye.

136
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,538
The client said your body looks amazing.

137
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,076
That’s right.

138
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,360
Her body looks amazing.

139
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:02,349
Especially in the video clip.

140
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,789
But it’s not a photoshoot video.

141
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:07,520
But I can’t say what kind of video it is.

142
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,734
We always need to improve ourselves.

143
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,460
You too.

144
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,410
You need to take better care of yourself.

145
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,378
You always eat junk food.

146
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,012
Stylists need to resize your outfits several times.

147
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,178
I feel bad for them.

148
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,436
We should go.

149
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:33,687
Let’s go.

150
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,054
Use only the photos
in which she wears a mask.

151
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,029
I don’t want our client to know
that the model is her.

152
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Hey!

153
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,770
Excuse me.

154
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,906
If it’s because of the scandal,

155
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,218
then why did you hire me?

156
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,414
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

157
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,610
Nathat.

158
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,270
Chom.

159
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:12,552
I’m here to try my wedding tuxedo.

160
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,563
Your wedding is coming soon.

161
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,749
You must be busy.

162
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,750
Yes.

163
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,940
I have a meeting later with my wedding planner.

164
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,145
I have a lot of things to do today.

165
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:28,007
So I can’t go to Bupphachat Mansion.

166
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,483
I don’t know if Chat will be mad at me.

167
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,821
Mr. Nathat.

168
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:38,356
Please come into the studio.

169
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,709
I got to go.

170
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,330
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

171
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,069
Thana.

172
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,698
Picha.

173
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,400
I’m sorry.

174
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,803
The canvases block my rearview mirror.

175
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,556
I didn’t see that your car was coming.

176
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,979
Fortunately, we can avoid the accident.

177
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:32,705
But you need to be careful next time.

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

179
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,636
It’s been a long time since I last saw you.

180
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,934
How are you doing?

181
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,970
I’m doing fine.

182
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,305
I got to go.

183
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:45,883
We have a family gathering today.

184
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,949
So…

185
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,334
Everyone will be there, right?

186
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,141
I mean your sisters.

187
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,780
Are you asking about Chatfah?

188
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,469
Yes.

189
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,170
Miss Picha.

190
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,592
Are you alright?

191
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,261
The bird hit my windshield and died.

192
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:48,341
This happens a lot
during the bird migration season.

193
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,207
It probably saw the reflection of the sky
on your windshield.

194
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,930
So it flew into it.

195
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,650
Please go inside.

196
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,570
It’s almost time.

197
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,429
I’ll have someone clean your car.

198
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:05,520
Please come in.

199
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,901
I knew you would be the first one to arrive.

200
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Why?

201
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,272
You are attached to this house the most.

202
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,770
I hope you will have it.

203
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,585
What about you, Chat?

204
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,796
Is there anything that you want?

205
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,429
Family.

206
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,556
I always want to be a part of the family.

207
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,650
I think you understand me the most.

208
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,669
My sister…likes attention.

209
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,687
Her favorite game is…

210
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,370
Hide and Seek.

211
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,723
It’s an ordinary kids’ game.

212
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,807
But my sister…

213
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,192
She plays it differently.

214
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,745
She sent letters to all of us before the game.

215
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,229
Whether we wanted to play or not.

216
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,967
PI, I’M WAITING FOR YOU.

217
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,836
Tada!

218
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,701
I told you not to take your sister into the woods.

219
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,010
Why didn’t you listen to me?

220
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,338
If something happens to her, I’ll kill you.

221
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:02,770
I didn’t mean it. I’m sorry.

222
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,058
You are the only one
who went out to look for me.

223
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,389
I’m sorry.

224
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,414
The house is so damn far.

225
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,578
Pi.

226
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
You’re here.

227
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,378
Why do we need to
have a meeting at this house?

228
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,352
No one lives at our family’s house.

229
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,578
None of us lives here either.

230
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,970
Do you want to go to our family’s house?

231
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,458
Here is fine.

232
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,905
Chatfah is here.

233
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,763
I don’t want to know.

234
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Cousins.

235
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Hello.

236
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,069
I told Aunt Chom to prepare rooms for you.

237
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,900
Who said I would spend the night here?

238
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
I did.

239
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,605
You don’t have to work tomorrow, do you?

240
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,265
Why do you want to drive back at night?

241
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,938
No, I don’t but this house doesn’t have Wi-Fi.

242
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,703
Who would watch my live streaming?

243
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:29,727
Ghosts?

244
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,832
Why don’t we sleep in the same room?

245
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,418
Just like we did when we were young.

246
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Parn.

247
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,900
Do you have over-attachment issues like Chat?

248
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,978
Everyone loves their siblings.

249
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Do you love your youngest sister?

250
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,458
I haven’t seen you guys for a while.

251
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:55,912
You are still the same.

252
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,741
I went to get my wedding invitations.

253
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,807
I’ve chosen the wedding date.

254
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,814
You are such a good daughter.

255
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,346
You chose to hand out the invitation
on the 100th day of Dad’s and Mom’s deaths.

256
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,781
I actually wanted to wait.

257
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,989
But Nathat’s family rushed me
about the wedding.

258
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,392
The invitation card is beautiful.

259
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:46,770
Did you design it yourself?

260
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,018
I put my best effort into it.

261
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,872
Next week, I’ll take you to a dressmaker shop.

262
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Yes.

263
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,160
Do you guys have a dress for the ceremony?

264
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,763
I’ve ordered my tailored dress.

265
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,014
Do you want to show it to me first?

266
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,186
I don’t want you to wear the same dress
as the groom’s family members.

267
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,210
Chat.

268
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,138
I’m going to wear a black dress.

269
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,196
Will someone else wear it?

270
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,727
You should save it for your event.

271
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,178
Maybe you will need it soon.

272
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,321
With your sharp tongue, I don’t think
you will live until your wedding day.

273
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:30,345
Chom.

274
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,643
Today, we will find out who Dad loved the most.

275
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,352
Dad’s love has nothing to do
with how he divided his assets.

276
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,240
He divided them in the way
that he thought was best for us.

277
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,545
Bua, are you sure that’s what you really think?

278
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,112
If you find out that he didn’t think you were important to him,

279
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,850
he didn’t view you as family,

280
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,818
Will you really be okay with it?

281
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,461
We have always said
family is the most important thing.

282
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,567
Today, we will find out what is really important.

283
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Everyone is ready.

284
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,560
Please go in.

285
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,916
Since you are all here.

286
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:35,629
I’ll begin reading
the will of Mr. Asoksapun Bupphachinda.

287
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,363
It was written before his death.

288
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:46,029
Do you remember the details in the will?

289
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,058
Disaster.

290
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:56,574
I, Mr. Asoksapun Bupphachinda,

291
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,661
write this will to declare my intentions

292
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:06,952
regarding the distribution of my assets
upon my demise.

293
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,269
1. The cash in my bank account
worth 300 million baht,

294
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:18,683
and my 50 percent of Bupphachinda Company’s shares, I leave them to…

295
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,636
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda solely.

296
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:42,530
2. The house and real estate in my name,

297
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,050
I leave them to…

298
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,327
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda solely.

299
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,370
3. Bupphachat Mansion, I leave it to…

300
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:11,258
Picha, do you see this?

301
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:14,200
This is our flower farm.

302
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,658
This is Bupphachat Mansion.

303
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,898
You were born here.

304
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,523
The first time I held you in my arms,

305
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,454
you looked so innocent and pure.

306
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,781
That’s why I named you Pudpichaya.

307
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,109
It means pure flowers.

308
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,523
One day,

309
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,032
this house will be yours.

310
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,334
Bupphachat Mansion, I leave it to…

311
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,185
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda solely.

312
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,967
Dad, are you mad at Uncle Asok?

313
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,083
It’s what I have expected.

314
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,440
I didn’t expect to get anything
from a guy like him.

315
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,963
Do you know why he did that?

316
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,185
How would I know?

317
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,563
No one could understand
what was on his mind.

318
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,349
I know that Chatfah was his favorite child.

319
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,832
But don’t you think
it’s unfair to his other daughters?

320
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Parn.

321
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,229
We all love ourselves the most.

322
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
Hey!

323
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,381
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,527
The person you should ask that question
is Dad.

325
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,670
Dad, why the f*ck did you do that?

326
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,952
Chom, you are drunk.

327
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,560
The person who should feel upset the most
is you.

328
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,061
You are the only one who was born here.

329
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,200
This mansion should be given to you.

330
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,963
He often said that he would give it to you.

331
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Chompoo.

332
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:44,967
You too.

333
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,330
You work your butt off for the company
but you get nothing.

334
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,792
I know that among us, I was his least favorite.

335
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,163
But you two,

336
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,192
I don’t get it.

337
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,429
How could he pull this shit on you!?

338
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,650
Why did Dad leave everything to you?

339
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,585
You knew that he would do this, didn’t you?

340
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,847
He must have his reason.

341
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,490
Reason?

342
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,083
The reason is that you are a weasel.

343
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,178
Am I right?

344
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,203
You are a weasel.

345
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,005
You manipulated him and betrayed your sisters.

346
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,738
Because you wanted to get everything.

347
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,556
Are you happy now?

348
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,629
The mansion, his assets, and the man,
you want them all.

349
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:04,312
Have you ever seen us as your sisters?

350
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,370
I thought you would be the least upset
about getting nothing.

351
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,378
Unexpectedly,

352
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,174
You are the most upset.

353
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:14,710
I’m not saying this for myself.

354
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,458
I’m blasting you because you took everything
that was supposed to be theirs.

355
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,290
Why?

356
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,934
Do you have to always win?

357
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,410
Do you need to always act superior?

358
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,883
Chompoo.

359
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:24,676
What the hell is wrong with you?

360
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:25,316
Chompoo.

361
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:26,087
Get a grip!

362
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:26,858
Chompoo.

363
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,090
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

364
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,390
See?

365
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,832
I told you.

366
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,192
When you realize
that you aren’t that important,

367
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:40,780
None of you can accept it.

368
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,792
Chompoo!

369
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:47,280
Come here.

370
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:48,538
Chompoo, stop it.

371
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,025
Stop.

372
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:49,505
I’ll hit her.

373
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,225
Stop it.

374
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:50,807
You, b*tch.

375
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:51,843
Stop it.

376
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,367
This is too much. Stop it.

377
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,505
This is enough.

378
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,865
Bua, you too.

379
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,487
You act like a big sister who knows everything.

380
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,207
But actually, you know nothing.

381
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,236
Chat!

382
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,116
I told you.

383
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Today, we would find out…

384
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,770
who Dad loved the most.

385
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,007
How is it?

386
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,232
Being betrayed by your own family.

387
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,970
When being betrayed by the enemy we hate,

388
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,985
It doesn’t hurt as much as
being backstabbed by our own family.

389
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,305
The truth is…

390
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,865
Sisters are enemies given by my parents since I was born.

391
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,090
Chompoo.

392
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:45,883
Chom.

393
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Let me go.

394
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:47,970
Chom.

395
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:48,992
Ouch!

396
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,381
Pi, I’m sorry.

397
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,410
It’s okay.

398
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:55,840
Chom, are you hurt?

399
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:57,723
It’s not time to worry about me.

400
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,436
Let’s get your wound treated.

401
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,563
Tonight at 9 pm.

402
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,614
At the viewing room on the third floor,

403
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,898
where I often go to enjoy the view

404
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,541
If any of you think it’s unfair,

405
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,349
and you want me to give anything back,

406
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:21,738
I’ll do so.

407
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:27,570
If you only tell me who killed Mom.

408
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,570
After treating the wound,
don’t forget to put a bandage on it.

409
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Thank you.

410
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,378
What Chat said is like lines from a soap opera.

411
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:57,781
Does she want to be an actress?

412
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,170
Stop drinking.

413
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,363
Just let me drink.

414
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:05,963
Otherwise, I’ll chew her out.

415
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,083
What are you going to do?

416
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,730
Will you go meet her?

417
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,436
You can go if you want.

418
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,792
But if I have to get down on my knees
and beg her,

419
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:18,000
No way.

420
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:19,570
I think she just said it.

421
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:21,410
If we go, she’ll laugh at us and backtrack.

422
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:24,470
What she said is strange.

423
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,676
What does she mean?

424
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:29,230
Who killed Mom?

425
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,545
Can we admit the truth?

426
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,960
The police already told us who did it.

427
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:38,000
We need to stop beating around the bush
and avoiding the topic.

428
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,185
Stop talking.

429
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,378
But she said one of us did it.

430
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Maybe…

431
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,374
She knows something we don’t.

432
00:30:49,418 --> 00:30:51,105
What else could it be?

433
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,170
We saw what happened that day.

434
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
They were alone in the house.

435
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,730
One of them must have done it.

436
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,090
Was there someone else in the house?

437
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,483
Besides Dad and Mom.

438
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,243
I told you.

439
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,760
Chat probably made it up,
so she doesn’t need to give us anything.

440
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,790
Pi.

441
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,560
If you want the house,

442
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,690
you should go ask her.

443
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,163
You are closest to her.

444
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,574
Am I?

445
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,200
I’m not sure anymore.

446
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,465
I think you should go.

447
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,236
If it is you, she might listen.

448
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:01,854
Assets are merely external things.

449
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,250
Even Dad and Mom don’t give us anything.

450
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:07,389
We can acquire it by ourselves.

451
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,578
But Chat was right.

452
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,170
We don’t want his assets.

453
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,545
The truth is we just want to know…

454
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:20,385
how much he loved us.

455
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:46,792
I’m drunk.

456
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:48,603
I’m going back to my room.

457
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Chom.

458
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,556
You are not going to see Chat, right?

459
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,203
I will never go.

460
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,440
If I have to beg her, I’d rather kill myself.

461
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,730
What is this?

462
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,538
I brought work to do here.

463
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,734
Go back to your room.

464
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Fine.

465
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,174
Pi, I’m sorry.

466
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I was drunk.

467
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,847
It’s okay.

468
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,494
I think I should go back to my room too.

469
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
See you.

470
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:00,727
MR. ASOKSAPUN BUPPHACHINDA.
THE PROBABILITY OF PARTENITY IS NONE.

471
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:55,258
Uncle Kajorn.

472
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,510
Sorry.

473
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:59,658
I secretly drink your dad’s whiskey.

474
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
It’s okay.

475
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,443
The executive board will call for a meeting soon.

476
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,570
Uncle.

477
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,556
About the company’s shares…

478
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:20,232
I know what you are trying to do.

479
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,516
Today, you saw that
your effort isn’t appreciated.

480
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,578
You own fewer shares than me.

481
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,661
You have less influence in the executive board.

482
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,316
I think you should give up.

483
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,247
The company will never be yours.

484
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,825
If I ask Chat to sell her shares to me,

485
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,963
things will be different.

486
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,541
Someone like you,

487
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:47,150
Can you really beg your sister for help?

488
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,894
If I don’t have other choices,

489
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,550
it’s not a bad idea to give it a try.

490
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,600
It seems like
I don’t know you as well as I thought.

491
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,996
But I think I know Chatfah well.

492
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,600
Now, she has the shares worth a fortune.

493
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,750
She won’t give them to anyone easily.

494
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,400
If you want them,

495
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:19,560
you’ll need to beg your sister.

496
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:16,701
Nathat.

497
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
Chom.

498
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,963
I heard what happened.

499
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,349
Are you okay?

500
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,690
I…

501
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,963
I’m okay.

502
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:34,429
I know it’s useless to say it now.

503
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:36,632
I’m sorry.

504
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,538
I’m sorry for everything I did to you.

505
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,858
I…

506
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,170
CHAT, I’M GOING TO MEET YOU.

507
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,570
Chat.

508
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,625
I’m here.

509
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,530
We are police officers.

510
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,538
We received a report
that someone fell from a building.

511
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,450
Where is the victim?

512
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,683
Your sister disappeared?

513
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:18,410
When we came back,

514
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,850
Chatfah was gone.

515
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,883
We tried to find her.

516
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,625
We looked for her everywhere.

517
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,770
But we couldn’t find her.

518
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,465
Chat, where are you?

519
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:37,280
(How important is your family to you?)

520
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:38,349
Chat.

521
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,830
Chat.

522
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,745
When Chatfah fell down,

523
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,516
What were you doing?

524
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I…

525
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,810
I was sleeping alone in my room.

526
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,763
(Are you willing to risk your life to protect it?)

527
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:00,989
Did you go to meet her?

528
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
I…

529
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,149
I didn’t go.

530
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:08,480
PI, I’M WAITING FOR YOU.

531
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:11,210
(Will you make someone disappear for it?)

532
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,760
Are you sure you told me everything?

533
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,590
Yes.

534
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,105
I’m sure.

535
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,563
(For me, humans cannot be trusted.)

536
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,490
Do you think who the suspect is?

537
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Bua.

538
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,970
(Although we were born in the same family.)

539
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:37,738
(We grew up together.)

540
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:38,781
Picha.

541
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:42,290
(We say how important our family is to us.)

542
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,563
Chompoo.

543
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,785
The person
who wants the company’s shares the most

544
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,858
That person is Bua.

545
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,101
Picha wants Bupphachat Mansion the most.

546
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,760
Because of Nathat,

547
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,676
she can kill Chatfah.

548
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,865
(But in the end, )

549
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,385
(everyone puts themselves first.)

550
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,578
Why did she run into this place?

551
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,643
You haven’t told us where you were.

552
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:22,450
What about you? Where were you?

553
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,261
It’s not important.

554
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:25,170
What about you?

555
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,490
I told you.

556
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,672
I went to get a towel to stop the bleeding.

557
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:31,061
Dad, you knew it, right?

558
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,032
If you did this,

559
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:35,780
our family would never be the same.
