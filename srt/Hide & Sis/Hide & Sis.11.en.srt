1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,990
That watch.

2
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:02,896
Keep it.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,024
Don’t give it to anyone.

4
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:07,180
That watch must have more significance

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,128
than its monetary value.

6
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,576
That Uncle Kajorn of yours
didn’t meet up with me that day

7
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:14,936
because someone lured him into the woods.

8
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,928
And that someone killed him.

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,384
(The truth is…)

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,768
(humans can be scarier than ghosts or demons.)

11
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,432
I called the police.

12
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:26,928
How is Chat?

13
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,040
Where is Chat?

14
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,560
(Ghosts and demons, )

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,344
(when they appear in front of us, )

16
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,968
(all they can do is scare us.)

17
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,464
(But those whom we trust, )

18
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:08,880
(they might seem harmless.)

19
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,096
What is that?

20
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,670
Hey.

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,968
It’s a piece of cloth.

22
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:20,590
Cloth?

23
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,616
What cloth?

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,224
Get it closer so we can see.

25
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:24,248
Put it here.

26
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,872
(The next thing you know, )

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,376
(you are either deceived into despair, )

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,608
(or you may turn into the next demon.)

29
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,448
Hey, hey!

30
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:39,312
It’s a dead body.

31
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,344
7 HOURS BEFORE THE BODY IS FOUND

32
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,184
No.

33
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,256
CHOMPOO’S BIRTHDAY 24.03
PICHA’S BIRTHDAY 07.25

34
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
Hey.

35
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,288
Your guess might be wrong.

36
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,664
We tried all the possible combinations.

37
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:13,432
We still can’t open it.

38
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:17,928
Then why did your mom want to hide it
if it was just an ordinary watch?

39
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,952
She didn’t want you and your sisters to have it.

40
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:24,056
She also didn’t want it to fall into
the hands of the police and Uncle Kajorn.

41
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,760
There’s only one way left.

42
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,288
I need to break it.

43
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,184
No.

44
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,536
I can’t let you do that.

45
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,664
Do you want to know the truth?

46
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
The truth is right in front of you.

47
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:44,288
But you are afraid to open it.

48
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,888
I will open it.

49
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:48,928
But…

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,744
But this watch was very important to my dad.

51
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,856
He is dead.

52
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,968
I don’t know what to do.

53
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
Fine.

54
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,696
Open it if you want.

55
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:18,944
You can use any method to open it.

56
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:19,968
Do it.

57
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,744
It might be the one way to save my family.

58
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,400
It’s just a watch.

59
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I don’t care.

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Open it.

61
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,184
Wait.

62
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Wait.

63
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,216
What?

64
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,368
Let me give it one last try.

65
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,864
Picha’s time of birth.

66
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,140
Are you a ghost and trying to scare me?

67
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,168
Whether you are a ghost or a human,

68
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,328
you never leave me alone.

69
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,100
I’m just worried about you.

70
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,000
You are not happy, right?

71
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,344
Why don’t you come with me?

72
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,320
The world of the dead is very peaceful.

73
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,600
It’s not chaotic.

74
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,256
You won’t have any sufferings.

75
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:12,980
You did everything you could.

76
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,920
You must be very tired.

77
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,840
What are you waiting for?

78
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,760
Come to live with me.

79
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,736
My life isn’t perfect.

80
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,320
Things turn out this way

81
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,160
because I chose it.

82
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,664
If I could turn back time,

83
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,736
I would still do the same.

84
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,416
I believe…

85
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,840
though my life is a mess,

86
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,464
there is someone out there…

87
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,984
who tries to do everything to get to where I am.

88
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,656
You too.

89
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,152
You once said you wanted to be me.

90
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,736
If this is the end of my life,

91
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,740
why don’t I fight for it?

92
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,192
Why don’t I fight for myself and be proud of it?

93
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,584
It’s you.

94
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,168
You always run away.

95
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,056
You run away from your life.

96
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,776
Because you want to be someone else.

97
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Chat.

98
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,360
When will you stop playing hide and seek?

99
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,240
Just come out and tell everyone the truth.

100
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:15,184
It’s you who sent the flower basket to threaten us.

101
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,576
You are also behind all the disasters
that happened to us.

102
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:25,288
Why did you orchestrate your missing, Chat?

103
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:26,760
I don’t get it.

104
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,560
Why did you do that?

105
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,016
Chat.

106
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:33,904
Chat.

107
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,030
Chat.

108
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,136
Chat, answer me.

109
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:38,144
Chat.

110
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,730
Chom.

111
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Chom.

112
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,160
No, I want to talk to Chat.

113
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:12,280
Talk to whom?

114
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,072
Chat.

115
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,136
She was right here.

116
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,024
Let me go.

117
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,256
Chom, you are drunk.

118
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,296
No, let me go.

119
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:21,904
I’ll talk to Chat.

120
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,376
Chom, I’ll give you a ride home.

121
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,408
I don’t want to go yet.

122
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,232
I need to talk to Chat.

123
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,570
Chom.

124
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,456
You are delusional.

125
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:32,888
Chat went missing.

126
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,160
We still can’t find her.

127
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:35,328
It’s not true.

128
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
She was right there.

129
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,384
Chat never went missing.

130
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,636
She has been with us all this time.

131
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,088
She has been haunting us
and ruining our lives.

132
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,776
Chom.

133
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:44,792
Stop it!

134
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,184
Chat went missing for a while.

135
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,560
Stop blaming her.

136
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,272
She might start this chaos.

137
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,544
But we all play a part in this disaster.

138
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,312
We are blaming each other,
and things get messy.

139
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,144
It’s too late…

140
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,280
to fix anything.

141
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:16,688
I agreed to marry Chatfah,

142
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,184
because she had the video
from your birthday party.

143
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,470
The night that the nightclub burned down.

144
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,208
She used it to blackmail you?

145
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,376
Why didn’t you tell me?

146
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,232
I didn’t know what else she would do to you.

147
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,360
I wanted to set you free from it.

148
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:48,110
The result was worse than I thought.

149
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,096
I tried to protect everyone.

150
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,648
But I ended up hurting everyone.

151
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,496
Have you ever seen this before?

152
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,040
No.

153
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,760
Never.

154
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,160
I think this is the plan of the secret basement
at your flower farm.

155
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,328
Do you think…

156
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,080
the secret basement has something to do
with everything that happened?

157
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,640
Mrs. Pimol.

158
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Miss Picha is having a seizure again.

159
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:16,528
Picha, sweetie.

160
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,070
Picha!

161
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,096
Just let her lie here.

162
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,344
She will get better soon.

163
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,384
Where is Mr. Asok?

164
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,160
He isn’t back yet.

165
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,912
He attended a dinner gathering
with his employees.

166
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,360
I’m going to a party, too.

167
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,672
I’ll go get changed.

168
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,360
What if Picha’s condition gets worse?

169
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,728
She will be fine.

170
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,448
You just stay with her.

171
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,704
What if Mr. Asok asks?

172
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,016
Miss Picha is this sick.

173
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,288
But you choose to go out.

174
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,296
I need to tell him the truth.

175
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,590
Fine.

176
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,360
I won’t go.

177
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,048
I’ll go get a cold towel.

178
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,176
It’s your fault.

179
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,040
That’s why I'm stuck here.

180
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:45,248
Picha.

181
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Are you okay?

182
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,488
Why are you sweating?

183
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,450
I just had a nightmare.

184
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
Chom?

185
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,096
Where is she?

186
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,624
Can you call her for me?

187
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Miss Picha.

188
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,912
You need to answer our questions.

189
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Pi.

190
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,808
Is it really Chat?

191
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,160
Didn’t the police search the stream?

192
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,184
From what I heard,

193
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,080
her body was stuck
between the rocks under water?

194
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,608
It was raining hard the other night.

195
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:52,008
So there was a landslide.

196
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,032
Her decayed body slipped out of it.

197
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
It could be anyone.

198
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,968
Anyone besides Chat.

199
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,248
That’s what Chatfah wore
on the night she went missing.

200
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,576
It’s just a dress.

201
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,496
I don’t believe it.

202
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,368
I met her last night.

203
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,952
The CCTV footage that I found,

204
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,832
It showed that
Chat sent the flower to threaten us.

205
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,424
There are other things as well.

206
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:49,896
There’s no way it’s Chat.

207
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,290
No.

208
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,656
It’s not true.

209
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,770
Hey.

210
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
What’s wrong?

211
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:44,360
I probably mistook it.

212
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,384
I’ll go get things ready.

213
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Hey.

214
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Have you been here long?

215
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,616
I came to help her.

216
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,760
I feel bad for her.

217
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,400
She’s probably still in shock.

218
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,904
Weren’t you transferred to work on another case?

219
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,160
Yes.

220
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,368
But I’m not busy.

221
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Why?

222
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I actually have something to tell you.

223
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,464
(Picha hired me to send a threat to her.)

224
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,608
(She hired me to fake her hit-and-run accident.)

225
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
I...

226
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,536
- Khem.
- It’s about…

227
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,192
Can you help me carry things?

228
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,070
Yes.

229
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,712
I’ll talk to you later.

230
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,536
The police confirmed
that the body was Miss Chatfah.

231
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,672
Since she didn’t have
any offspring or living parents.

232
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:17,976
So her next rightful heirs
are her biological sisters.

233
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,248
Can we talk about this
when Bua comes back?

234
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Yes.

235
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,752
It’s weird.

236
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:50,350
When we didn’t receive anything from the will,

237
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,440
we questioned…

238
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,048
why we didn’t get anything.

239
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,056
But now we are getting everything,

240
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,944
we also question…

241
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,352
why we are receiving it.

242
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,152
Because it is traded off with our loss.

243
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,050
If I could choose,

244
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,380
I would choose to receive nothing.

245
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,944
The only thing that I wanted,

246
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,120
I wanted our family to go back
to what we used to be.

247
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,280
I wished that everyone in our family
were together again.

248
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:41,968
I don’t want to lose anyone again.

249
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,776
Cousins.

250
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,120
I’ll go to Chat’s funeral first.

251
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,208
I don’t want her to be alone.

252
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,248
Sure.

253
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,712
Thank you so much.

254
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,968
What happened to your hand?

255
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,904
I helped our worker trim bushes.

256
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,216
That’s how I got these scratches.

257
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,552
Since Dad was gone,
no one told our worker to trim them.

258
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,640
Excuse me.

259
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,510
Yes.

260
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,120
You held each other that night.

261
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,320
The next morning, Chatfah’s body was found.

262
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Do you know?

263
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,408
This will be great material
for the media to attack us.

264
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,712
Who sent them?

265
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:10,768
You don’t need to know.

266
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,384
What you should ask is
how these photos will be used?

267
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,560
Even if the photos are leaked to the media,

268
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
it’s okay.

269
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,848
I won’t run away anymore.

270
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,576
I want to tell the truth.

271
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,464
Even if it means I will be condemned
or criticized by the public, so be it.

272
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:29,984
We cannot change what happened.

273
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,832
You have been thinking this all this time, right?

274
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,344
You don’t care
who will be affected by your action.

275
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,430
The effect of telling the truth,

276
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,864
it’s not as scary as the result of telling lies.

277
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,130
So what?

278
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,120
You want me to do nothing
when your scandal is spreading…

279
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,520
that you and this brat conspired

280
00:24:53,552 --> 00:24:56,360
to kill your fiancé so you can be together?

281
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,816
Are you crazy?

282
00:24:58,856 --> 00:25:00,288
Are you out of your mind?

283
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,936
It’s not true.

284
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,168
We don’t need to be afraid of it.

285
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,368
It’s true that we were together.

286
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,200
But we didn’t kill Chatfah.

287
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,112
When the investigation is completed,

288
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,672
we will find the real murderer.

289
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
The public will know that we didn’t do it.

290
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,760
We didn’t do anything wrong.

291
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,952
We don’t need to be afraid.

292
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,928
Those who keep lying
and running away from the truth,

293
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,744
They are the ones who should be afraid.

294
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,080
You’ve lived for only a few decades.

295
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,728
How dare you think you know the world
better than me?

296
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,104
I will never stand by
and let you ruin my family’s reputation.

297
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,056
If you feel embarrassed
that I used your family name,

298
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,952
I’ll change to my mom’s last name.

299
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
You.

300
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,432
You said it yourself.

301
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,530
Is it hurt?

302
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:14,696
Why did you say that?

303
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,760
I’m tired of it.

304
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:22,270
I want to be happy now.

305
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,560
How can we be happy?

306
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,152
Who knows what secrets about your parents
your grandma might use to threaten you?

307
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,570
Don’t worry.

308
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,024
All we need to do is find the murderer.

309
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,152
So my grandma will see you in a different light.

310
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,672
There’s only a thin line

311
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,780
between being optimistic and being foolish.

312
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,360
I’m suspecting someone.

313
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,350
Who?

314
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,432
Miss Parn, are you okay?

315
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:31,536
I’ll help you.

316
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,168
I’m okay.

317
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:35,170
I just misstep.

318
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,232
What are you doing here?

319
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:43,624
Why don’t you take a seat?

320
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,110
Pi.

321
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,928
What I’m about to tell you,

322
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,736
it might sound crazy.

323
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,928
Have you ever thought this?

324
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,896
The woman who pretended to be Chat
and sent the flower to threaten us.

325
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:59,260
The person who tampered with your brake.

326
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,800
The woman who encouraged me
to commit suicide.

327
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,528
They could be someone close to us.

328
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,152
Chom, what are you trying to say?

329
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,008
I’m just thinking…

330
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:13,430
the person who is the most likely culprit,

331
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,576
I think I know who that person is.

332
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:18,608
Who?

333
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,816
Who do you think that person is?

334
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,450
I think…

335
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,304
Picha!

336
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,280
Do you think you can hide from me?

337
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:31,712
Give me my money back, bitch!

338
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,024
What the hell is wrong with you?

339
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,264
You’re drunk.

340
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:36,336
Go away and leave my sister alone.

341
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,160
Your sister hired me to send her a threat.

342
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:42,504
She also hired me
to fake her hit-and-run accident.

343
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:45,540
She pretended to be a good girl.

344
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,944
She stole my pay.

345
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,224
I got hit by a car and almost died.

346
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:51,560
Where is my damn money?

347
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,580
What the hell are you talking about?

348
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,664
Why don’t you ask her if what I said is true?

349
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,624
What are you going to do, liar bitch?

350
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:04,920
Give me my damn money.

351
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:06,000
Give it to me.

352
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:06,624
Calm down.

353
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:08,080
What the hell?

354
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:10,080
Give me my money.

355
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,340
You can get it at the police station.

356
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,590
Picha.

357
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,224
Is what he said true?

358
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,200
Yes and no.

359
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:43,770
The threat note in my car,

360
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,264
I did it.

361
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,248
But I didn’t send the flower to threaten us.

362
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,544
Why did you do that?

363
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,832
I’m sorry.

364
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,600
What I did was wrong.

365
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,216
I was only thinking about
how to clear my name from being a suspect.

366
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,720
Did you hire him
to fake your hit-and-run accident?

367
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Huh?

368
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,760
You staged the accident to fool us?

369
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,536
Bua and I were so damn worried about you.

370
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:39,576
But you used our trust to betray us?

371
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,144
Pi, you know what?

372
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,310
You are not different from Chat.

373
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,056
Please don’t go.

374
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,456
Chom.

375
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,568
I heard about Picha.

376
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,688
I don’t get it.

377
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,152
When I thought
I had finally found someone I could trust,

378
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,304
I was always hit by the reality…

379
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,960
that I have no one I can trust.

380
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,536
Me.

381
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,184
I am someone…

382
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
you can trust.

383
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,800
What kind of trust do we share?

384
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,552
The trust based on our backroom deal?

385
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,530
The trust comes from blackmailing each other?

386
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,568
That…

387
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,240
The trust that…

388
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,128
I can do something for you that no one can.

389
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,272
Not even Nathat.

390
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,792
It doesn’t matter anymore.

391
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,576
Things are coming to an end.

392
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,460
Sarah’s friend will gain consciousness soon.

393
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,264
Then the police will know

394
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:41,784
that I started the fire at the nightclub.

395
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,392
Neither you nor Nathat can help me on this.

396
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,896
This is my fight.

397
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,000
What if…

398
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,704
I can help you?

399
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,264
If I can help you on this,

400
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,424
will l…

401
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,912
be ahead of Nathat?

402
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,672
Chompoo.

403
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,728
Are you going back to Bupphachat Mansion?

404
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,008
I need a ride home.

405
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,296
I’m not going back to the house.

406
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:33,424
But I will give you a ride.

407
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Alright.

408
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,768
Chompoo, did you talk to Picha
about the man at the funeral?

409
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:07,152
Yes.

410
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:10,170
She admits it’s true.

411
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,176
Really?

412
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,072
Why did she stage the accident?

413
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,256
I don’t know the details.

414
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,536
She was probably scared of being the suspect.

415
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,760
That’s strange.

416
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,560
If she didn’t do anything wrong,

417
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,560
why did she feel afraid of being a suspect?

418
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,488
Although we grew up together,

419
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,360
it doesn’t mean we know each other well.

420
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,304
I recently realized that.

421
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,780
Especially Chatfah.

422
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,160
I can’t believe someone would want
to hurt a nice girl like her.

423
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,848
Parn, you know what?

424
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,712
You are the only one

425
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,680
who says only nice things about Chatfah.

426
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,420
She was nice to me.

427
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,824
How are your legs?

428
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,410
Can you get up?

429
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,368
No.

430
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,480
I can’t barely move them.

431
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,896
I just remember.

432
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,384
I forgot something at the sermon hall.

433
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,400
I’ll go get it.

434
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,224
Parn, can you wait here?

435
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:12,256
Yes.

436
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,880
Chom.

437
00:35:28,904 --> 00:35:30,104
Chom!

438
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,208
Miss Chompoo.

439
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,456
I saw you intentionally push
Parn’s wheelchair to the road.

440
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
Are you accusing me?

441
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,752
I don’t know how you grew up.

442
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,360
If you hurt Parn again, I won’t let it slide.

443
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,584
Are you saying that as an officer
who works on our case or something else?

444
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,104
Whatever your relationship with her is,

445
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:18,600
I want to warn you.

446
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,312
Don’t trust anyone in my family too much.

447
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,264
They might be fooling you right now.

448
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:44,024
Khem.

449
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:48,220
I sent a message to you.

450
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,640
Did you see it?

451
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,328
I was busy all night.

452
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,856
It’s okay.

453
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,968
I understand.

454
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,100
I just want to tell you that
I came here for the police’s interview.

455
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,690
Yes.

456
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Khem.

457
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,776
If you don’t have any plans after work,

458
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,848
can you go and have dinner with me?

459
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,408
I have something to tell you.

460
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,580
I’m sorry.

461
00:37:14,136 --> 00:37:16,140
But I don’t feel comfortable
meeting you anymore.

462
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,552
If it’s about that, I can explain it.

463
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,344
I don’t want to hear it.

464
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,940
I don’t want to listen to your lies anymore.

465
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Okay.

466
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,488
I admit it.

467
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,432
I admit that I lied about the threat.

468
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:34,450
But not everything I told you is a lie.

469
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,768
My feelings for you are real.

470
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,071
Save it and tell the police.

471
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:43,072
Don’t tell me.

472
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,640
These are evidence and updates
about this case that I’ve gathered all night.

473
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,880
I promise that
my relationship with her has ended.

474
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,880
And I will stay away from her from now on.

475
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,968
Please reassign me to the case, Inspector.

476
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,168
His conditions are improving.

477
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,184
He will be able to talk to you soon.

478
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,064
Thank you, Doctor.

479
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,616
We need his testimony.

480
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,336
This is a high-profile case.

481
00:38:34,384 --> 00:38:36,888
If you have any updates, please let me know.

482
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,960
Of course.

483
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,288
Have a good sleep.

484
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,264
What is this?

485
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:35,820
That’s Uncle Kajorn’s handwriting.

486
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,976
It looks like a chemical experiment record.

487
00:41:45,512 --> 00:41:47,510
He wanted the memory card in the watch.

488
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,184
Because he wanted to keep the secret
to himself.

489
00:41:56,608 --> 00:42:01,160
It looks like your company bought
a large amount of pesticide.

490
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,424
But it wasn’t only used
to control insects on your farm.

491
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,648
What was it used for?

492
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,488
They are materials
for producing low-quality drugs.

493
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,880
These are the drugs.

494
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,368
This means…

495
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Yes.

496
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:43,568
It means your dad and uncle
opened the flower farm as a cover.

497
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,088
They hid a drug lab in it.

498
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,920
This is the list of major drug traffickers,

499
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:58,736
who had been doing business with your dad
for a long time.

500
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,390
No wonder…

501
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,568
why your dad was so wealthy.

502
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,880
This is probably the drug lab.

503
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,864
Maybe the chemical leaked from our farm,

504
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,344
it was used to produce drugs here.

505
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,752
Mr. Kajorn.

506
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,144
What are you doing here?

507
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:50,944
Mr. Kajorn,

508
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,192
is this the drug our workers are taking?

509
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,040
Did no one tell you
not to touch anything in this room?

510
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,472
No. I’m sorry.

511
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,190
Wait.

512
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,648
Put it back where you found it.

513
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Yes.

514
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,592
Mr Kajorn, please open the door.

515
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Mr. Kajorn.

516
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,992
What is this smoke?

517
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,976
F*ck.

518
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,848
What the f*ck did my dad do?

519
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,944
Did your mom know about this?

520
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,344
Of course, she knew.

521
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,360
Otherwise, she wouldn’t tell Chatfah
to keep the watch.

522
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,776
Today, I finished clearing the chemical storage.

523
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,216
No traces of the med lab are left.

524
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,552
Mr. Asok, please keep your promise.

525
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,620
Please divorce Pimol.

526
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:42,790
It was not an accident.

527
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,360
(Demons.)

528
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,176
(They might be something
that humans created.)

529
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,280
(So they can fool themselves
that they are scarier things than humans.)

530
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,640
(Because they don’t want to admit
how evil they are.)

531
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,592
Like I told you,

532
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,712
I admit that I staged my accident
to make me look like a victim.

533
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,056
Today, I will tell you the truth about everything.

534
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,624
Then where shall we begin?

535
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,168
The dream that has been haunting me
all this time.

536
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,176
The body in the well.

537
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:44,780
(But we forgot something.)

538
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,384
(We are the scariest thing.)

539
00:46:49,952 --> 00:46:51,192
I think…

540
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,944
she was murdered by my father.

541
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,392
I think that it was the cause
of everything that happened.

542
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,392
(Ghosts and demons can scare people.)

543
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,470
Parn.

544
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,168
Parn, you killed Chat, didn’t you?

545
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,080
(But only humans are crazy enough
to lie to themselves.)

546
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,168
From our initial examination,

547
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,560
the blood on the scissors is confirmed to be Chatfah’s.

548
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:41,896
Besides Chatfah’s fingerprints,

549
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:44,832
we also found Chompoo’s fingerprints on it.

550
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:48,000
Those who know best about the scissors are your family.

551
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:51,088
Chompoo didn’t stab Chatfah. I can prove it.

552
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,728
Go get your revenge in hell.
