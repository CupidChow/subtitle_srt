1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,392
Did you happen to have seen

2
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:02,992
who hurt Picha?

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,040
Bua

4
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,880
Chat was there when it happened?

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,280
The one who told Dad about this secret

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,864
must have been one of the three of us.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,648
I destroyed all the evidence for you.

8
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:16,520
your life is now in my hands.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,448
It is expected that the manufacturer
will triple its orchid orders, Dad.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,936
You have such a sharp vision

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,528
for steering the company in this direction.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,384
Then we might have to expand our farm.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,248
I thought about that.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,200
It’s in the next file.

15
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:50,184
You can have a read.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,936
And…

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,976
May I present this at the meeting?

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,368
Yes.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,744
You’ve become much better.

20
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:01,430
You learn to plan for the long run.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,968
Look at Bua as an example.

22
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,670
You guys will have to be like her one day.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,264
Because one day,

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,000
everything I have will become yours.

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,808
If we’re only going to talk about business,

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,072
then this shouldn’t be called a family dinner.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,360
It should be called a meeting.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,072
Business and family

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,568
are the same thing.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,176
That’s true.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,872
I forgot.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,328
That’s what our family always does.

33
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,312
We never care about feelings.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,600
We only care about benefits.

35
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:50,744
Chompoo.

36
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,176
We don’t get to be all together like this very often.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,256
I’m begging you, just for today.

38
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,496
Don’t stir any drama.

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,240
Drama?

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,176
Who was the one

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
that made me not want to come home?

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,480
If you want to cut ties with me over Nathat

43
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,496
then so be it.

44
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,424
But you can’t cut ties with this family.

45
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:21,544
I’m so sorry.

46
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,560
Fine.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,008
If everyone’s going to act
like nothing’s happened

48
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,720
and want me to back down,

49
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,152
then I’ll back down.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,984
But don’t force me

51
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,440
to feel or not to feel a certain way.

52
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,144
If everyone’s going to be this fake,

53
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,480
then go ahead!

54
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,168
But don’t count me in.

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,896
Chom!

56
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:46,736
What?

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
You can’t accept the truth when I say it?

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Chompoo.

59
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,032
Get back to your seat.

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,360
I’ve never expected you guys to be good parents.

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,704
But at least,

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,144
can you pretend to love your children?

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,936
You missed, Dad.

64
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,976
Enough!

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,736
I’ve never thought a man could turn you so insane

66
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,512
that you can’t tell what’s right or wrong.

67
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,096
What about you?

68
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,568
Do you know what’s right or wrong?

69
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,070
(Reacting with emotions )

70
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:01,540
(can be more powerful than you think.)

71
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,808
You shouldn’t lecture me on that.

72
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,920
You’re not so good at holding yourself back either.

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,472
(It can turn a situation)

74
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,360
(from good)

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,760
(to bad.)

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,176
(Or even ruin a person’s life.)

77
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,912
An engineer at a flower farm
was killed in an accident.
- It’s not an accident!

78
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,816
Your dad

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,408
killed him.

80
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:58,768
I gave Mom some sleeping pills.

81
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,624
She’ll probably wake up tomorrow around noon.

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,296
You and the other sisters already knew, right?

83
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,168
Knew what?

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,472
You know what I’m talking about.

85
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,720
So what is it?

86
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,248
Tell me what you’re talking about

87
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,584
so I can tell you

88
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,184
whether I knew about it or not.

89
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:21,424
The way Chom said it that day,

90
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,536
you guys must have known, right?

91
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,752
Does that mean,

92
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,552
you already knew?

93
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,304
Then you should tell me what you know first.

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,680
It’s not important how much I know.

95
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,488
What’s important is whether Dad is aware of it.

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,040
What does this have to do with Dad?

97
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,056
Then tell me whether Dad knows!

98
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,670
Dad knows about Mom, right?

99
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,760
Chat, if you don’t tell me what you know,

100
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,776
I won’t tell you.

101
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:05,352
(This is the reason why)

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,816
(you should think carefully before saying it.)

103
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,208
You don’t understand.

104
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:12,880
Our family’s going to have nothing left.

105
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,040
(To ensure that)

106
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,784
(every word said)

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,936
(can actually kill someone alive.)

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,480
That day, Chatfah already told me everything

109
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:35,928
but I didn’t understand.

110
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,592
Had I figured it out earlier,

111
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,400
things wouldn’t have turned out like this.

112
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,304
Dad, Mom, and Uncle Kajorn wouldn’t have died.

113
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,056
Chatfah wouldn’t have disappeared.

114
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,770
Bua wouldn’t have become this way.

115
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,888
Do you think your older sister

116
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,576
is the one who made your younger sister disappear?

117
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,400
I don’t want to think that way

118
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,776
but I can’t find any other reasons.

119
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,952
Don’t think about anything anymore.

120
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
You should rest.

121
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,888
Tomorrow morning,

122
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:22,144
police will come here to interview you.

123
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,160
How can one live

124
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,008
when there’s no one else you can trust?

125
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,000
Just trust in yourself.

126
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,480
The only one

127
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,104
who will never betray us

128
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,728
is ourselves.

129
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,064
You still have me.

130
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,544
So you’re not alone.

131
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,096
Tell me.

132
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,424
Who actually are you?

133
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,632
The engineer

134
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,430
who died at your farm

135
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,536
was my father.

136
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:43,030
He wasn’t just an employee.

137
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,904
But he’s also my Mom’s lover.

138
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,568
Are you here to take revenge on us?

139
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,360
I don’t want revenge.

140
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,540
I want to know the truth.

141
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,056
Whether it’s actually

142
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,760
like what Chatfah suspected.

143
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,864
Chatfah suspected that

144
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,488
your father’s death

145
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:20,290
was because of my dad?

146
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,944
Try and admit the truth for once.

147
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,264
Deep down inside,

148
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,952
you also believe so.

149
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,128
I admit that my dad might not be the best person.

150
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:46,104
But he’s not so horrible as to kill a man.

151
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,760
Are you sure

152
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,496
that you know your dad well?

153
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,560
But

154
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,120
the investigation concluded that

155
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,664
it was an accident.

156
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,408
Was it an accident

157
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,072
or was it a setup

158
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,240
to make it seem like an accident?

159
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:17,340
I want you to fix

160
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,224
the chemical treatment system

161
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:22,584
which has always been an issue for our farm.

162
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,408
You have to go into the chemical storage room

163
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,416
at the back of the farm.

164
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,608
But that room has been locked away long ago.

165
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:37,610
Ever since someone died there.

166
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,456
He’s the one who laid out the system from the start.

167
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,240
So he should know it better than anyone.

168
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,328
After that incident,

169
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,848
I’ve already taken the responsibility

170
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:49,990
Then this time,

171
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,768
Then this time,

172
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,064
you must fix it properly.

173
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,368
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,472
It’s a great loss for our company

175
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,624
since Mr. Chatchai is an important engineer for us.

176
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,176
And is it true that he’s the cause

177
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,160
for the chemical spill

178
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,200
that the company is being criticized for?

179
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,656
Where did you get that news?

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,080
Is the source reliable?

181
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,584
A dead man can’t speak for himself.

182
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,368
Before you accuse him that way,

183
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,400
have you thought about his family

184
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:23,944
and how they would feel?

185
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,928
You intentionally took him in again

186
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,208
to kill him.

187
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,928
Why should I kill him?

188
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,384
What crime did he commit?

189
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:46,568
Hmm?

190
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:49,552
You tell me.

191
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,032
What did he do

192
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,440
that I had to kill him?

193
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Don’t cry so much.

194
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,944
People would get the wrong idea

195
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,144
that the dead man

196
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,176
was your husband

197
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,368
and not an employee.

198
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,000
Mom.

199
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,336
Remember.

200
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,176
Never trust anyone,

201
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,536
except yourself.

202
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,528
Never trust anyone,

203
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,672
especially

204
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,760
the people in this house.

205
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,664
Got it?

206
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,272
Do you understand?

207
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
You knew everything, right?

208
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,536
We’ve been married for a long time.

209
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,968
Do you think I wouldn’t know

210
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,824
what kind of person you are?

211
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,848
We have been married for a long time.

212
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,448
Of course, you would know

213
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,328
what kind of person I am.

214
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,920
But you still don’t know me well enough.

215
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,024
Mom!

216
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,008
What are you doing?

217
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,456
That watch.

218
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,896
Keep it.

219
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,168
Don’t give it to anyone.

220
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,216
I’m sorry.

221
00:15:59,330 --> 00:15:59,824
No!

222
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:00,368
No!

223
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,176
No!

224
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,504
Mom!

225
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,472
Mom!

226
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,080
My family is like

227
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,960
it’s been cursed.

228
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,568
Are there any other families

229
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,368
that siblings, father, and mother

230
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:48,376
kill one another like this?

231
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,192
I used to think

232
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,752
that I was so damn lucky

233
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,976
to be born into a rich family.

234
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,816
A famous one.

235
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,360
Everyone wants to have my last name.

236
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,256
But does it have to come with this much loss?

237
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,600
There’s nothing worse

238
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,760
than being hurt

239
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,120
by someone who’s supposed to love you.

240
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,336
Do you know

241
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,384
what riles me up the most?

242
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,808
It’s me.

243
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,790
I’m so selfish.

244
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,000
Only focusing on myself.

245
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:03,180
Only thinking about myself.

246
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,976
And ignored those little cracks.

247
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,432
And today…

248
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,320
Everything has broken down.

249
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,456
I freaking failed at everything.

250
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,272
As a leader of the family.

251
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,320
As an older sister.

252
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,648
As a daughter.

253
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,344
I freaking suck.

254
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,856
My dad often says that

255
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,936
what will always haunt you

256
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,928
is not the mistakes you did

257
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,128
but the results of the actions

258
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,560
that impacts you and the others.

259
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:02,920
Stop blaming yourself.

260
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,984
You can’t fix it anyway.

261
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,288
Everything happened

262
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,920
even before you could do anything.

263
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,776
My mom had been

264
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,648
having an affair with your dad for a long time, right?

265
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,024
The reason why my mom often went to America

266
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,856
was to meet your dad, right?

267
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,112
And you…

268
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,160
met Chat there.

269
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,136
Yes.

270
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,096
That’s funny.

271
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,664
The parents had an affair

272
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,096
while the kids fell in love with each other.

273
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,264
Life’s just funny like that.

274
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,760
So you don’t have to stress over it.

275
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,016
You can dwell in sadness

276
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,336
but don’t take too long.

277
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,496
Because you deserve to be happy.

278
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,704
Me?

279
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,040
This me?

280
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,000
The one who ruined this family?

281
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,190
I deserve to be happy?

282
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:57,432
I don’t even know

283
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,264
if I deserve to continue living.

284
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,736
No one gets to dictate your life

285
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,456
except you.

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,632
If you think

287
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,488
everything you’ve done was a mistake

288
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
then fix it and get it right.

289
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
End the curse of your family.

290
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,608
What should I do?

291
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,800
You have me right here.

292
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,544
I’ll help you find out the whole truth.

293
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,800
Aunty Chom.

294
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,728
Aunty Chom, where are you?

295
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,944
Aunty Chom?

296
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,736
Aunty Chom?

297
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:23,712
Aunty Chom?

298
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,968
Aunty Chom?

299
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,176
Mr. Chain.

300
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,816
I’m sorry I let myself in.

301
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,552
I happened to drive by a famous porridge place

302
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,560
so I got a take-out for you.

303
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,560
Porridge?

304
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,544
I figured you live alone, so I was worried.

305
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,120
The police have increased the manpower

306
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:55,880
but it’s still not enough.

307
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,568
Oh, I forgot you have a maid.

308
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:04,072
You must have already eaten.

309
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,288
Then, it’s fine.

310
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:06,344
I can take this home.

311
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,512
It’s okay.

312
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,336
Aunty Chom has been missing since the afternoon.

313
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,088
She must have gone out for groceries
and hasn’t returned.

314
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:13,560
I was getting hungry.

315
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,424
Here you go.

316
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,008
Thank you.

317
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,176
If it weren’t because of you,

318
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,584
I would have to cook some instant noodles.

319
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,488
It’s totally alright.

320
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,968
Then shall we…

321
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,800
exchange numbers?

322
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:31,472
Just in case there’s anything,

323
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:32,640
you can just contact me directly.

324
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,768
Yes?

325
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,424
Yes?

326
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:45,672
PARN.

327
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,584
I’ve just scolded Khem on this.

328
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,808
Did I become one just like him?

329
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,016
[I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you in person.]

330
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,024
[I am quitting]

331
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:32,672
[because I can no longer work in a house]

332
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,232
[that is filled with the death
of my beloved boss.]

333
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,056
[I hope you understand.]

334
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:43,984
[Take care, Miss Parn.]

335
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,536
She quit?

336
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:56,136
Without any words?

337
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
(That’s all that was written in the letter.)

338
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:02,300
Yeah, Aunty Chom is probably sad.

339
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,520
Just let her go.

340
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:06,552
I’ll get you a new maid and caregiver.

341
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:07,864
Are you okay with living alone?

342
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:09,248
Do you want me to come over?

343
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,256
(It’s alright, I’m fine alone.)

344
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,080
Okay.

345
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,888
Then I’ll get back to work.

346
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,728
Let go of me!

347
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,152
Let go of me!

348
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,816
Why are you capturing me?!

349
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:22,328
Damn you people!

350
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:23,000
Damn you!

351
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:23,712
Let go!

352
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:24,160
Let go!

353
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:24,880
Let go!

354
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,400
Who are you guys?!

355
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,152
Damn you!

356
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:27,848
Damn you!

357
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,832
Damn you!

358
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,200
Hey!

359
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,024
Who are you guys?

360
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:39,688
Why are you capturing me?!

361
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
You don’t have to know.

362
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:42,744
Just know that you’re fired.

363
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,896
Get lost and never come back.

364
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,120
Not unless you want to die.

365
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,256
It’s taken care of.

366
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,848
Would that be enough?

367
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,464
What if she comes back?

368
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,312
No matter how much of a psycho she is,

369
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:16,110
I think she probably still fears death.

370
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:19,160
She has also worked for my family
for a long time.

371
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:22,616
I don’t want to go further even if I could.

372
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:30,672
This is the best solution.

373
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,680
If you have anything for me to help

374
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:33,784
then just let me know.

375
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,960
Yeah.

376
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,128
Ouch!

377
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,280
Are you okay?

378
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,856
It’s nothing big.

379
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:55,752
I’m alright.

380
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Are you thinking about Bua?

381
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,952
Yeah.

382
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,088
I have been thinking about that all night, too.

383
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,376
I couldn’t sleep.

384
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,088
I’m sorry

385
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,432
I haven’t been here to take care of you

386
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:25,160
and had to make Captain do it instead.

387
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,752
I told him everything.

388
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,376
How much is ‘everything’?

389
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,432
Don’t worry.

390
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,368
I didn’t mention anything about you.

391
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,304
I just told him about our family

392
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,160
and about Dad and Mom.

393
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:49,750
But there’s one thing

394
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:52,490
that I’ve never asked you.

395
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,584
What is it?

396
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,368
Were you the one who told Dad

397
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:57,920
who Mom’s affair partner was?

398
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,216
I didn’t tell him.

399
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,820
I had no intention of doing that either.

400
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,584
I didn’t tell him either.

401
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,928
But I believe you.

402
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,752
There’s no reason for you to do that.

403
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,712
Then there’s only one suspect left.

404
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,328
Do you mean Bua?

405
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,424
I don’t know.

406
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,624
Bua!

407
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,024
For the case of Dad and Mom,

408
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:50,240
I’m not sure about the motivation.

409
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,688
But for the cases of Chatfah and Uncle Kajorn,

410
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,512
we both know the reason.

411
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,616
Excuse me.

412
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,696
A flower delivery for Miss Pudpichaya.

413
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,616
Did you tell anyone you were hospitalized?

414
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,304
I didn’t tell anyone.

415
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,792
IF YOUR SIBLINGS CAN’T BE TRUSTED,
WHY DON’T YOU HAVE THEM ALL DEAD?
SO YOU CAN BE THE ONE AND ONLY FAVORITE CHILD.

416
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,224
Does it hurt?

417
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,512
Miss Nurse,

418
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:37,510
who was the one who sent this flower?

419
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,952
Hello.

420
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:54,824
Hello.

421
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:57,408
I’m the sister of the one who received the flower.

422
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:58,496
I made a call.

423
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,632
I’m truly sorry.

424
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,840
The client said

425
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:03,192
she was pulling a prank on her friend.

426
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:05,808
I didn’t know it was an actual threat.

427
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Do you have the information about the sender?

428
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,360
What’s the name?

429
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,288
She didn’t tell us her name.

430
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,008
I only know she’s a woman.

431
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,560
A woman?

432
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,192
Yes.

433
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:18,904
Would you like to check the CCTV?

434
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:19,440
Yes.

435
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:20,816
Just a moment.

436
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,848
Excuse me.

437
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,792
Is this the one?

438
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,168
May I?

439
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,704
Probably yes.

440
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,832
Are you sure it’s really her?

441
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,610
I meant this person.

442
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,744
Here’s the video from the CCTV.

443
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,680
About…

444
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,968
About last night.

445
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,968
I…

446
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,760
You what?

447
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:44,544
I think

448
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,272
we were both drunk

449
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:50,384
so can you

450
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,600
pretend nothing happened?

451
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,448
The thing is…

452
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,568
Last night I…

453
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,512
I got carried away because

454
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,896
I couldn’t think straight

455
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:08,192
because of the things about my family.

456
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,272
You couldn’t think straight?

457
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,990
So you ended up sleeping with me?

458
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,700
If I had been in my right mind,

459
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:22,220
I wouldn’t have taken my sister’s man.

460
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,232
Fine.

461
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,784
I will pretend nothing happened,

462
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:29,968
as you wish.

463
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,880
But…

464
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,528
I still want us to work together

465
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,576
to find out the truth.

466
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,352
So,

467
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,640
if anything’s unimportant,

468
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,800
just forget about it.

469
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,136
Deal.

470
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,736
I have something to ask you.

471
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,848
Why did Chat give you that watch?

472
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,632
As I told you.

473
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:10,920
Your mom told her

474
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,416
not to let the older sisters know.

475
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,360
You should ask yourself

476
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:16,000
why your mom would’ve said that.

477
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,064
I tried to think, but nothing came to mind.

478
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,576
That watch must have more significance

479
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:28,250
than its monetary value.

480
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,312
Of course.

481
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:34,656
Because even your uncle wanted it.

482
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,000
Do you mean Uncle Kajorn?

483
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:42,408
The reason why I ran into you that night

484
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:43,728
was because of this.

485
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,416
How did you get it?

486
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,270
I was there that day.

487
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:00,848
The day Mom shot Dad.

488
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,280
I don’t know who to rely on.

489
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,392
The only person I could trust is you.

490
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,800
What about your older sisters?

491
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,368
Can’t you tell them?

492
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
No one can be trusted.

493
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,936
Maybe they’re the ones who told Dad the truth.

494
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,520
I’m just curious.

495
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,440
Why did Mom ask me to keep it?

496
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:29,780
Ever since it went missing,

497
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:31,632
Uncle Kajorn has been looking for it.

498
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,584
Uncle Kajorn?

499
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,976
Mr. Asok’s younger brother?

500
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,880
Yes.

501
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,816
She asked the maid to turn the house over

502
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,600
to find this watch.

503
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,584
I think there has to be a reason

504
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:46,976
but I don’t know how to investigate

505
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:48,792
without Uncle Kajorn knowing that I have it.

506
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,840
If he’s looking for it,

507
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,608
then let him find it.

508
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,544
[Unknown: I have something you want.]

509
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,480
[K: How did you get it?]

510
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,488
[Unknown: You don’t have to know.]

511
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,144
[K: How can I be sure it’s the real one?]

512
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,704
[K: Let me see the back of it.]

513
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,216
[K: How much do you want?]

514
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:44,696
Why is he not here yet?

515
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:10,040
Where did he go?

516
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,864
That Uncle Kajorn of yours

517
00:38:02,888 --> 00:38:04,320
didn’t meet up with me that day

518
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:07,656
because someone lured him into the woods.

519
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,360
And that someone killed him.

520
00:38:12,312 --> 00:38:15,536
Then, can I see the watch?

521
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,608
There has to be something more to it.

522
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,920
Something that makes Uncle Kajorn want it.

523
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,560
Something that is a secret

524
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:53,380
that even Mom didn’t want anyone to know.

525
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,760
Oh?

526
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,336
Hey.

527
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,336
Is the watch broken?

528
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:09,872
Why are the handles not moving?

529
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:10,888
Open it up and see.

530
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,024
Hey!

531
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:13,456
Are you going to open it up yourself?

532
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:14,984
You’re not wearing any gloves.

533
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:17,352
Do you know how much this watch is worth?

534
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:18,240
Yeah.

535
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,728
And what are we going to do?

536
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,848
Do you want to have a shop open it for you?

537
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,352
Do you want to tell everyone

538
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,856
that we have this watch?

539
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,072
Then

540
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,960
do it carefully.

541
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,624
Hmm.

542
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,560
By the way.

543
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,168
The weight of this watch is odd.

544
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,360
It’s not like normal watches.

545
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,080
What do you mean?

546
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,928
Do you know what time your dad was born?

547
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,248
Why?

548
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,808
Are you going to check his horoscope?

549
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:03,600
Yeah.

550
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,392
No!

551
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,536
When I was stealing gold,

552
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:10,130
I used to come across these watches.

553
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,528
To open the back of it up,

554
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:17,976
you have to turn the handles to specific numbers.

555
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,488
Like a password.

556
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,952
Then there will be a space

557
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,864
where you can open and hide small stuff.

558
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,768
Maybe,

559
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,660
the thing that Uncle Kajorn wanted

560
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:34,296
and your mom wanted to hide

561
00:40:34,336 --> 00:40:35,992
wasn’t just the watch

562
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:38,590
but what is inside.

563
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,456
Parn, I have found you a new maid.

564
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,560
She also has experience in patient care.

565
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,560
I think she’s really good.

566
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,576
I’ll talk to you later, Parn.

567
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,024
Officer!

568
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
Yes?

569
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,752
Are you the one who handles Sarah’s case?

570
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,320
Yes.

571
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,144
I’m Sarah’s friend.

572
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:16,784
We met at the temple.

573
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,288
I haven’t been in contact with Sarah’s Mom

574
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:21,968
so I don’t know how the case has progressed.

575
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:25,400
I’m actually here about that case.

576
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,264
The bystander has just woken up from a coma

577
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:29,952
so I’m paying a visit.

578
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,008
I think the interrogation can start soon.

579
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,976
It’s a good thing.

580
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,528
If we can get more interrogation done,

581
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:39,112
then the case can be concluded soon.

582
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:40,736
Yes.

583
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,528
If there’s nothing else

584
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,656
then I’ll excuse myself.

585
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,960
Yes.

586
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,592
[Thana: Where are you?]

587
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,632
[Thana: Are you drunk?]

588
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,408
(Chom, where are you?)

589
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,440
At our usual place.

590
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:32,568
(Our usual place?)

591
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,120
(That bar?)

592
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:35,304
Yeah.

593
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,168
How much courage do you think it takes

594
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,736
for a person to kill themselves?

595
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,568
Fire!

596
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,568
(What are you talking about?)

597
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,984
Nevermind.

598
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,832
You don’t have to understand.

599
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,264
(It’s those who decide to fight and live on)

600
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,736
(who are courageous.)

601
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,432
(Listen to me, Chom.)

602
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,520
(If this world is actually fair,)

603
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:17,136
(no one would have died out of hopelessness.)

604
00:43:17,176 --> 00:43:19,140
(So the ones who put up a fight)

605
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,160
(even when it’s hopeless)

606
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,780
(are the true courageous ones.)

607
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,640
(No one wants to be a fool)

608
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,232
(who gets tricked by sweet words.)

609
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,224
(Picha hired me to send her a threatening message)

610
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:35,312
(and also hired me to graze her with a car.)

611
00:43:35,424 --> 00:43:36,776
YOU’RE NEXT.

612
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,280
(But sometimes…)

613
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,096
(The truth hurts too much.)

614
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,096
It’s easier to die, right?

615
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,470
Are you here as a ghost to haunt me again?

616
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,264
No.

617
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,872
I’m here to take you with me.

618
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,880
(That’s why people get enchanted by lies)

619
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,376
(just to stay longer in their dreams.)

620
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,960
(Even when they’re well aware)

621
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:38,990
(that whenever they wake up,)

622
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,440
(disaster is what awaits.)

623
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,040
Hey!

624
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,528
Dude! Dude!

625
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,728
A corpse!

626
00:44:53,768 --> 00:44:54,392
A corpse!

627
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,896
Would this secret chamber

628
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:04,568
have anything to do with all the secrets?

629
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,440
It really wasn’t an accident.

630
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,336
Rest in peace.

631
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:12,584
I won’t stay still.

632
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,168
Please let me handle this case again.

633
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,256
I’ve decided to tell the whole truth today.
