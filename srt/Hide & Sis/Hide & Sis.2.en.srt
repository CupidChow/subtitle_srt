1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,716
Tonight at 9 pm.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,410
At the viewing room on the third floor.

3
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:06,167
If any of you think it’s unfair,

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,541
and you want me to give anything back, I’ll do so.

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,978
Your sister disappeared?

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,698
When we came back,

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,494
Chatfah was gone.

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,450
I’M WAITING FOR YOU

9
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:21,127
Who do you think is the suspect?

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Bua.

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,730
Picha.

12
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,727
Chompoo.

13
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,680
(Everyone might have been fooled all along.)

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,636
8…9…10.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,785
Got you, Chom!

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,341
Come on!

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,552
I’m the first one found again?

18
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,178
Well, you keep hiding in the same places.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,618
Got you, Bua!

20
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:06,872
Oh no! I almost got you.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,669
I’m the best seeker among us.

22
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,185
But Chat is the toughest one to find.

23
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:15,010
She likes to hide in strange places.

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,323
We could never find her.

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,043
Why don’t we pretend to stop seeking?

26
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,767
She will come out eventually.

27
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:23,578
What if she doesn’t come out?

28
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,725
Who would have to take responsibility?

29
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:26,087
I would be in trouble again.

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,280
What can you do about it?

31
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:28,727
You’re born a sister after all.

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,687
So damn unfortunate.

33
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,454
Why are you swearing, Chom?

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,490
Don’t let mom catch that.

35
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,061
Where are you, Chatfah?

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,596
Come out! I’m freakin’ hungry.

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,229
(Actually, life is just a game.)

38
00:01:57,272 --> 00:01:58,814
It’s been raining pretty hard,

39
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:00,210
she couldn’t have gone very far.

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,007
If she was by herself,

41
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:03,363
then she can’t have gone too far.

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,374
What I’m afraid is

43
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,705
someone took her.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
The damned rain even washed all the footprints.

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,200
Do you think her sisters are weird?

46
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,309
Their testimonies were odd too.

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,470
We’ll have to see during the investigation.

48
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,320
Captain, please come this way.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,219
There are blood stains and a footprint.

50
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:36,552
She must have come this way.

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,385
Only one footprint?

52
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,145
Then she must have been here alone.

53
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,250
No one else was with her.

54
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,109
I have only found one footprint for now.

55
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:45,887
(A game, )

56
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,963
(that even though you don’t want to play, )

57
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,909
What made her run away that way?

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,876
(you can’t afford to lose.)

59
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:57,112
(Since your life's on the line for it.)

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,203
Please say something.
Please make way.

61
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,385
Please calm down.

62
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:01,694
Please make way!

63
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:03,858
Easy there.

64
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,534
Miss Picha!

65
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:06,681
Officers, please let us ask one question.

66
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:07,927
Miss Bua, is it true that

67
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,941
Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda is gone

68
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,600
and the police still can’t find her.

69
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,232
That’s true.

70
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:17,149
Oh!

71
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,281
See? She actually went missing.

72
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:21,658
But we can’t answer anything for now

73
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:23,660
since we’re worried about Chat’s safety.

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,396
Let’s leave it to the police for now.

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,280
Is it true that Miss Chatfah is gone

76
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:30,341
after the will has been revealed?

77
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:31,452
Is it true that Miss Chatfah’s been given

78
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,450
everything of Mr. Asok's legacy.

79
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:35,149
Do you think this is a murder case?

80
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,476
Hey!
Is it true?

81
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:36,516
What’s the deal here?

82
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:37,632
Please answer the question.

83
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:39,512
Hey, if you don’t have any ethics,

84
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,996
then have some manners.

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
My sister has just gone missing.

86
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:43,906
How can you spit out such words?

87
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,901
Listen to the questions you’ve asked.

88
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,128
If I were you, I wouldn’t dare ask.

89
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:47,510
It’s not hard to find a manners guidebook,

90
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:49,650
why don't you get one and have a read?

91
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,687
Urgh!

92
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,309
We’re just doing our jobs.

93
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:54,290
So that means it’s true?

94
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,136
So what’s going to happen to the Buppha Company?

95
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,840
Is Miss Bua going to step up as the CEO?

96
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:00,472
Wait, did you listen to what I said?

97
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:01,494
Move!

98
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:02,596
Chom…

99
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,350
Right now…

100
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,379
Right now, me and my family are not ready

101
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,149
to answer any questions.

102
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,607
Because the only thing

103
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,949
that I and my family are concerned about

104
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,130
is Chat’s safety.

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,061
What I hope for the most is

106
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,040
to have all family members together again.

107
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,654
Which is more important than the company

108
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,730
or even my title.

109
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:56,540
I could tell you were putting on a show.

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,101
If I don’t get to be the CEO,

111
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,614
I’ll turn to politics.

112
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,000
You’re just going to

113
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,436
start building up your support now?

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,597
You’re turning the disappearance of your sister

115
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:08,909
into a show?

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,200
It’s turning a crisis into an opportunity.

117
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:12,494
That's what Dad taught us.

118
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:16,130
Wow, you’re the real daddy’s girl.

119
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,854
I’m so confused,

120
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,614
why didn't Dad give you the company?

121
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,334
You're exactly who Dad wanted you to be.

122
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,276
You didn’t get it either.

123
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,852
And the reason why you didn't get it

124
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:28,036
was because you’re so confrontational.

125
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,136
If you don’t have any consciousness

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,643
then have some IQ.

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,061
Who would be a genius at pretending like you?

128
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,880
A sister went missing

129
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:38,807
yet you have the gut to worry about your image.

130
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:39,843
Sorry?

131
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,432
Didn’t she go missing because of you?

132
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,530
You’re the one watching her last.

133
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,701
Where did you go then?

134
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,018
You were the first one who fled.

135
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,134
I went out to take a call.

136
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,181
Are you sure?

137
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,085
Did you go and hide something?

138
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,505
Just say what you meant to say.

139
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:58,167
What did you hide?
Hide what?

140
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:00,130
Why would you keep secrets with me?

141
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:00,676
That’s you!

142
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,721
- What would I have hidden? - Why would you keep secrets with me?

143
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:03,083
Please stop that.

144
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,709
Aren’t you guys stressed out enough already?

145
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,220
I’m most worried about Chat right now.

146
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,309
Please don’t fight,

147
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,345
I’m begging you.

148
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,778
(This might be the only thing)

149
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,210
(that Chatfah didn’t lie about.)

150
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,578
What the hell was that?

151
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,396
The police are having a search.

152
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:51,774
Please wait in the room we’ve arranged for you.

153
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,850
The maid has got your clothes prepared.

154
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,898
Excuse me, we didn’t give permission.

155
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:00,341
Especially for our private rooms.

156
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,607
The circumstance shows that

157
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,590
this place is a crime scene

158
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,963
so the police have the right to search.

159
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,610
(Our family is so good)

160
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,392
(at pretending and playing games.)

161
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,578
Stabbed

162
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,178
and fell down from here.

163
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,970
All 3 sisters have testified.

164
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,632
They all said they didn’t see

165
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,414
when she was stabbed or disappeared.

166
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,927
Who else was there in this mansion?

167
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,985
Apart from the 3 sisters, there are

168
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,363
the maid, uncle called Kajorn,

169
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,360
and Uncle Kajorn’s daughter.

170
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,490
Kajorn said he went to the orchid garden

171
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,930
during the time of the crime.

172
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,610
He said the system had a malfunction.

173
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:13,309
As for the maid,

174
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,792
she said she took sleeping pills.

175
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,581
We’re trying to verify that.

176
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,447
Lastly, Kajorn’s daughter is…

177
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,865
Any news? What did the police say?

178
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,570
You can’t get anything from them.

179
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,483
We went because

180
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,178
they wanted the answers from us.

181
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:49,180
They also asked me lots of questions.

182
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,861
But I was only in my room,

183
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:54,550
I have no idea what happened.

184
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,989
Would you like to have some rest, Parn?

185
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,618
I’ll take you inside.

186
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,141
I’m worried about Chat.

187
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,570
How would she be doing now?

188
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,327
When she went missing,

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,112
it was raining and so dark.

190
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,978
I don’t know if anyone would ever find her.

191
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,032
The police are spreading out to search.

192
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,530
I hope you will look out for the news.

193
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,756
Did you really not see the suspect’s face?

194
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,207
I can’t be of any help at all!

195
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,963
All these times,

196
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,710
Chat has been so nice to me.

197
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,349
But when she needs help,

198
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,930
I couldn’t do anything for her.

199
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,250
I couldn’t be of any help!

200
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,069
Parn, Parn.

201
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,020
I couldn't be of any help!

202
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,429
Trust in the police.

203
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,352
They will find Chat soon.

204
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,381
Is the bitch Chat that Parn was talking about

205
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:38,910
the same as the one we know?

206
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,080
Pi, I can’t trust anyone.

207
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,483
Someone must have done that to Chat.

208
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,763
Why are they so hateful to Chat?

209
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,047
Chat has been good to me

210
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,265
and to everyone all along.

211
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,629
This leg…

212
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,985
If it weren’t for Chat,

213
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,192
I would have been dead.

214
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,510
Parn…

215
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,820
I can’t say anything for now.

216
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,356
But if I know anything,

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,778
I will let you know right away.

218
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,916
Miss.

219
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,770
Sorry for surprising you.

220
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,621
I think you’d better wait

221
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:43,620
in the area we’ve sectioned out for you.

222
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,530
I’ve already told your two sisters

223
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:47,665
to go and wait there.

224
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,090
I’m just drinking some water in my house.

225
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:52,552
That should be okay, right?

226
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,240
I think you had better go and wait.

227
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,607
Let me ask you something.

228
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,505
When you ran through the woods

229
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,763
to try and find your sister,

230
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,636
didn’t you notice anything strange there?

231
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,301
I believe I’ve already told

232
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,170
the investigators everything.

233
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,341
Probably so.

234
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,770
But sometimes.

235
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,214
People forget little details.

236
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:31,294
Otherwise, they left it out intentionally.

237
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,414
My sister is missing.

238
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,458
Why would I hide anything?

239
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:38,556
I don’t know.

240
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,989
You should tell me.

241
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,701
I think the questions you asked me

242
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:45,549
were very rude.

243
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,949
Especially to the family of the deceased.

244
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,905
We haven’t found the dead body.

245
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,472
How did you know she’s dead?

246
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,167
Sorry, I used the wrong word.

247
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,756
I haven’t been in my right mind these days.

248
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,970
It’s alright.

249
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,214
It’s normal that,

250
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,210
after a traumatic experience,

251
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,490
people would say

252
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:17,214
or do weird things like this.

253
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,250
What’s going on?

254
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,487
This is the middle one?

255
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,087
Yes, the one closest to the missing sister.

256
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,076
Dad, you knew it, right?

257
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,621
If you do this,

258
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,745
our family would never be the same.

259
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Why would they put up so many barricades?

260
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,323
I don’t feel so well.

261
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:46,763
I’m worried about my sister too.

262
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,850
They’re probably looking for evidence.

263
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,120
They’d probably take it

264
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,156
if they have found one.

265
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,389
Damn it.

266
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,501
I’m hungry.

267
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,637
Didn’t you say you’re worried about your sister?

268
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,770
How could you be in the mood for that?

269
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Why?

270
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,945
I can’t freaking eat?

271
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,221
I’m not a prisoner just yet.

272
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,749
Well, if you had watched over her,

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,389
we wouldn’t end up in this situation.

274
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,672
Would you stop blaming me?

275
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,749
Where did you go?

276
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:35,127
You haven’t told us where you went.

277
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,305
How did Chat end up like that?

278
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,887
I don’t know either.

279
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,600
But you should hurry and leave for now.

280
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,950
I’m not leaving.

281
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,370
I’m not leaving you here alone, Chom.

282
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,625
Please leave.

283
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,458
Things will get messier with you here.

284
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,487
No!

285
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,952
That happened to Chat

286
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,763
and you still want me to run away alone?

287
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,563
Then what do you want me to say?

288
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,407
That I was fucking you?

289
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,730
That I was fucking my sister’s fiance

290
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,520
when she was in that state?

291
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,010
I know what would be on the news.

292
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,683
I know what people are going to say about me.

293
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,174
I know what they would think of me.

294
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Both of us won’t be able to face the world.

295
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,876
People would even think we cooperated on this.

296
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,952
Just trust me and go for now.

297
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,898
I never care

298
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,094
about what people think of me.

299
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:55,432
But the only one I care about

300
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,930
is you, Chom.

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,643
If you care about me

302
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,090
Then just trust me and leave

303
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,112
before anyone sees you.

304
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:47,003
I’ve called the police.

305
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,480
How is Chat doing?

306
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:01,898
Where did Chat go?

307
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,120
I told you,

308
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,669
I saw a shadow of someone

309
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:07,450
walking into the kitchen

310
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,820
so I went after it to check,

311
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,334
What if that was the suspect?

312
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,130
Stop pretending.

313
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,807
You were shaking in fear.

314
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:18,414
You can’t have the head to do anything.

315
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,232
I had it together more than you think.

316
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,992
You are my sister,

317
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,378
don’t you think I can’t tell when you lie.

318
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,680
If you’re not going to believe me

319
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:30,509
then why did you bother asking?

320
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:31,905
But I do believe you.

321
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,630
I found a man’s footprint

322
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,930
running out of the back of the kitchen.

323
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,963
What do you mean?

324
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,003
It means that last night,

325
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,454
there weren’t just the 3 of us.

326
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,189
What happened?

327
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:13,607
I’m a childhood friend of the girls from that family.

328
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:16,138
If you guys are really friends,

329
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:18,140
you must have known what happened.

330
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,059
We were friends when we were so young.

331
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,363
We haven’t talked for so long.

332
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,534
Last night, a suspect got in

333
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:24,480
and stabbed the owner of the mansion.

334
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,694
A suspect went in?

335
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,803
That’s all we know for now.

336
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,985
Do you happen to know

337
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:32,363
where the woods end?

338
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,156
The woods is connected to

339
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,967
the Bupphachinda orchid garden.

340
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,363
It belongs to the Buppha Company.

341
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,160
Shall I guide you the way?

342
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,963
Thank you.

343
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,890
We’re not so familiar with the route here.

344
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:45,247
My pleasure.

345
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:09,578
I told you

346
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,978
that I wasn’t the one who stabbed Chat

347
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,200
and I’ve never planned to do anything to her.

348
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,614
I might hate her

349
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,156
but she’s still my sister.

350
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,720
Chom!

351
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,247
No one’s saying that you did.

352
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,570
I just feel like

353
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,210
you’re hiding something.

354
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
There.

355
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,567
Don’t they mean the same thing?

356
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,174
What about you?

357
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,440
Where did you go for so long?

358
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,563
My…

359
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:00,585
My sister…

360
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,683
My sister was stabbed.

361
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,403
Nothing much.

362
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,149
I just

363
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,160
lost my mind

364
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,836
and couldn’t communicate with the police.

365
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,432
You?

366
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Lost your mind and you couldn’t communicate?

367
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,170
Well, it’s not like my sister got stabbed

368
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,780
and fell down on a daily basis.

369
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
What about you?

370
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,640
You left me and where did you go?

371
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:27,060
I told you.

372
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,781
I went to find a towel to stop the bleeding.

373
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,810
PI, I’M WAITING FOR YOU.

374
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,290
(IPHONE IS DISABLED, TRY AGAIN IN 1 MINUTE.)

375
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Well I…

376
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,123
Took too long to find the towel

377
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,990
and Chatfah was already gone.

378
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,570
Okay.

379
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:36,390
Then I’ll trust you guys

380
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,589
if you guys trust me.

381
00:24:40,218 --> 00:24:41,218
What do you mean?

382
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,927
I was born your sister,

383
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,930
I know it when you’re lying.

384
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,905
But like I said,

385
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,370
I will trust you guys,

386
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,349
if you guys would trust me.

387
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,370
Isn’t that how our family was taught?

388
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:05,200
Since we’re family,

389
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,156
we must trust each other

390
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:09,861
and we must protect each other.

391
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,985
The older has to take care of the younger

392
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,370
and the younger has to listen to the elder

393
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,739
because nothing is more important

394
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:21,820
than our family.

395
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,741
Even if you have questions,

396
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,498
don’t ask.

397
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,341
Because it’s the only way

398
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:35,450
to keep our family alive.

399
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
So what do you say?

400
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Deal?

401
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,600
Then from now on,

402
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,101
we have to say the same thing.

403
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,425
Our sister is gone

404
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,898
and the 3 of us

405
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,956
are not involved at all.

406
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,374
As I mentioned,

407
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,563
I’m worried about the river in the woods.

408
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,248
Especially during monsoon season,

409
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:18,960
there can be flash floods.

410
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
No matter how good a swimmer you are,

411
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:22,945
you can’t resist the flow of the water.

412
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,869
Thank you so much.

413
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
My pleasure.

414
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,570
Hello.
Hello.

415
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:39,861
You can’t enter at the moment.

416
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,167
He’s the fiance of my sister.

417
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,869
Why are you here?

418
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,549
I told you not to come for now.

419
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,367
How can I just stay home

420
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,770
and listen to the news?

421
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I don’t want you to go through this alone.

422
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:11,952
Thana.

423
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,007
Um, I was showing the police the way

424
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,392
it might help with the search.

425
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,163
Chatfah is missing

426
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:22,465
so I got kind of worried too.

427
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,185
I want to help with whatever I can.

428
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,250
Okay, thanks.

429
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,865
Chom.
Yeah?

430
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:39,440
Let’s go. Get in the car.

431
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:40,887
Okay.

432
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,745
You must be Nathat,

433
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,000
Chatfah’s fiance, right?

434
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,392
Your girlfriend has gone missing,

435
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:51,890
so you must be so worried.

436
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,590
Yes.

437
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,712
Thank you for helping me find Chat.

438
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
My pleasure.

439
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,032
Uh, this is Thana.

440
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:02,290
He’s Chat’s friend.

441
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,163
They used to play together often

442
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:04,185
when we were young.

443
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,380
Thana.

444
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,054
I’ll get going.

445
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:10,192
See you around.

446
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Alright.

447
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
What?

448
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,098
Chatfah agreed to be the brand ambassador

449
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:38,520
for my competitor brand?

450
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:39,790
That’s right, Ms Pi!

451
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
When they found out through the news

452
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,312
that Miss Chat is missing,

453
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:44,640
they went chaotic.

454
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:46,305
I heard a rumor that

455
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,538
they might postpone the launching.

456
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:52,792
BLOODY LEGACY!

457
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:56,149
(GREAT SHOCK! INVESTORS POINT OUT THAT CHATFAH’S SCANDAL MIGHT AFFECT BUPPHA’S STOCK.)

458
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,367
How are you doing, Bua?

459
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,749
As you can see.

460
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,578
How is it going out there?

461
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,483
Forget about the things outside for now,

462
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,992
let’s focus on us.

463
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:22,029
I want you to avoid the press for now.

464
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,567
Don’t answer any questions from anyone

465
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:25,985
and tell your parents so too.

466
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,163
No problem.

467
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,986
I’ve already talked to my parents

468
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,152
and my grandmother.

469
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,941
You don’t have to worry.

470
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,030
For now, Chat’s safety comes first.

471
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,676
Chompoo, you too.

472
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,829
You should keep some distance

473
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:53,985
with Nathat for now.

474
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,637
Especially when there's a scandal about Chat,

475
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,963
people might make a fuss

476
00:29:57,985 --> 00:29:59,098
about you and Nathat.

477
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,850
Come on.

478
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,425
Who would think I would kill my sister

479
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,461
for a guy?

480
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,181
But is that possible?

481
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,585
(From the news, )

482
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:16,152
(the public should be able to judge)

483
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,941
(the true color of people.)

484
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
(Chat is a good girl.)

485
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,065
(That’s why my grandson)

486
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:23,980
(had decided to marry her.)

487
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,149
(A good person will be blessed.)

488
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,694
(While people with evil intentions, )

489
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,756
(thirst)

490
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,407
(and greed, )

491
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,749
(will have to pay for their sins one day.)

492
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:44,138
Hey, was she targeting you?

493
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,800
That hag was spitting all that,

494
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:48,290
who else could it be?

495
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,170
We’ve been searching for 12 hours now.

496
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,214
Still, there’s no clue at all.

497
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,472
A petite girl

498
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:05,687
and even injured.

499
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,170
How did she manage to go so far?

500
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,570
The injured part is one thing,

501
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,501
but why would she run here as an escape?

502
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,949
Is this the river he mentioned?

503
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
What was his name?

504
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,190
Thana.

505
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:24,650
He said he was Chatfah’s childhood friend.

506
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,356
By the way, you’re from here too, right?

507
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,610
About Chatfah’s household? Do you know anything

508
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,741
I’m not quite from here.

509
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,643
I just used to live here

510
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,840
while my dad was still alive.

511
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,163
Only rich people live here.

512
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,632
If it wasn’t because my dad worked here,

513
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:39,814
I would never have been here.

514
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,563
Captain!

515
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,781
The 3 sisters are about to

516
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,330
head back to Bangkok.

517
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,356
Wait a minute.

518
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,509
You shouldn’t be going anywhere yet.

519
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,236
I think I have done everything to cooperate.

520
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,866
Is there an order from the court

521
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,785
or any law that can confine me?

522
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,618
Your family is quite odd.

523
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,756
Your sister went missing

524
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:24,186
but everyone is able to focus on their jobs

525
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,607
like nothing happened.

526
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,276
You’re rude to me yet again.

527
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,378
Your family might think otherwise

528
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,003
but in my family,

529
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,792
this is how we were taught.

530
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,130
Also,

531
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,156
no matter in what ‘role’

532
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,872
you’ve returned to this place.

533
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,076
I still stand that,

534
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,185
our families are not the same.

535
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,127
Dad!

536
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Hang in there, dad!

537
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,370
Dad!

538
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,170
Dad!

539
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,690
Regardless of whether it is really a coincident

540
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:26,690
that you’re responsible for this case or not,

541
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,480
if you have a bias from the past,

542
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,320
I will report it to your commander

543
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:36,509
to remove you from this case immediately.

544
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,145
I hope you’ll work hard,

545
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,614
Captain.

546
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,050
Hello.

547
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,025
Why did you bring Chom with you?

548
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,916
I asked to come along.

549
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,632
I wanted to explain this to grandma myself.

550
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,970
Where is Grandma?

551
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,145
I will talk to her myself.

552
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:18,952
How dare you set foot in my house?

553
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Nathat.

554
00:34:21,832 --> 00:34:23,830
You can never think for yourself.

555
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:26,490
Don’t you know that when you do this,

556
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,320
things would get more troublesome?

557
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,320
I’m sorry, grandma.

558
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,170
If you are really sorry,

559
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,680
then you would never have done all this.

560
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,301
Who sent these pictures to you?

561
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,367
Doesn’t matter who sent them.

562
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,360
What matter is

563
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,360
who have seen these pictures.

564
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,647
If someone can send me these pictures,

565
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,294
then they could send it to the press too.

566
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,512
So what would you say to the press now?!

567
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:08,814
Mother!

568
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:11,294
There was nothing between us that night.

569
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,390
I got drunk and I went home.

570
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:13,648
Nathat got drunk and he went home.

571
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:15,476
The truth is not like what you think.

572
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,989
Who cares about the truth?!

573
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,229
People only care about

574
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,047
whether it can become a scandal

575
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,487
or whether it can make Nathat a suspect.

576
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Hello?

577
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,950
Picha.

578
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,418
Can you stop the car?

579
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,069
What are you talking about?

580
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:00,603
I’m not stopping the car.

581
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,887
You can’t stop me from going anywhere.

582
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,232
I’m not stopping you.

583
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:05,989
I’m asking if you’re able to stop your car.

584
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,370
The brake fluid of your car was leaking.

585
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
What?

586
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
Hey!

587
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,290
Hey!

588
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,818
I can’t brake.

589
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,090
Okay.

590
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,189
Calm down.

591
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,767
Do as I say.

592
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,363
Don’t hit the accelerator anymore.

593
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,341
Turn on the hazard lights

594
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:29,738
and slowly let the car decelerate.

595
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,040
Honk to alarm the car in front of you

596
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,069
every now and then.

597
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,556
There’s no car in front of me.

598
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,956
What should I do next?

599
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,603
Slowly pull the car over on the left.

600
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,501
You can do it, right?

601
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,269
Okay, I probably can.

602
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:45,025
Okay.

603
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,305
I’ll try.

604
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:16,990
YOU’RE NEXT.

605
00:37:25,992 --> 00:37:26,992
I’m sorry

606
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,701
to make you witness such a scene.

607
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,280
It’s alright.

608
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,520
I’m more worried about you.

609
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,534
I’m fine.

610
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,570
After you go home,

611
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,927
Grandma didn't bother me anymore.

612
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,305
Good.

613
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,390
I’m still worried about you.

614
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Chom.

615
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:55,803
My engagement ring!

616
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:34,909
Captain, here’s your coffee.

617
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:37,109
Thanks.

618
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,665
The press is lurking around these days.

619
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,141
Do not let them in.

620
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:42,178
Yes, sir.

621
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:03,585
Hey, wait!

622
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,163
How did you find me?

623
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,160
I saw your car

624
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,680
so I went to check

625
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:13,127
but didn’t find anyone.

626
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,207
So I kept looking for you

627
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,567
and found you looking suspicious.

628
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,167
So why did you pull me into the woods?

629
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,421
Because I don’t want to see you

630
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,385
getting arrested for trespassing your own house.

631
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,261
Are you trying to sneak

632
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,469
into your own house?

633
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,389
It’s not even my house.

634
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,614
Aren’t you curious

635
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,756
why I’m trying to get in?

636
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,898
You’re all dressed up like this

637
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,152
I assume you’d never tell even if I asked.

638
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,170
You seem so well-versed.

639
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,069
But if you really want to get into the mansion,

640
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,770
I know a way.

641
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,356
Where are you taking me?

642
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,094
Well, the way into your house.

643
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,123
What?

644
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Here?

645
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,767
Yes, Chatfah told me herself.

646
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,821
When we were young,

647
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,734
Chatfah were so good at hide-and-seek

648
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:12,730
that even you guys couldn’t find her.

649
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,003
So I cheated by not closing my eyes

650
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,378
and just followed Chatfah.

651
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,501
My!

652
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,287
Hey! Why didn’t you tell me

653
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:28,650
if you’re going to stop.

654
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,590
We’ve arrived.

655
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,607
This is where Chatfah was hiding

656
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,110
and you guys couldn’t find her.

657
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:41,640
It’s also a path into your house.

658
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,756
After you.

659
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,083
Hello, where did you put the ring?

660
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,498
Don’t tell me you went there.

661
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,581
Hurry up and tell me

662
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:11,941
where you put the ring.

663
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,269
On the table on the left.

664
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,778
I can’t find it.

665
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Or…

666
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,821
Did the police take it already?

667
00:41:32,843 --> 00:41:34,203
If I weren’t mistaken,

668
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,465
at that time…

669
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,283
(If it is a game)

670
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,570
(it’s probably a game you can never win.)

671
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,898
Hey, I’ll hang up for now.

672
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,850
(Because in this game, )

673
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,476
(the enemy might be someone you love)

674
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:56,181
(who set a trap using trust.)

675
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,356
(The only way to win this game)

676
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,010
(is to love no one)

677
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,545
(other than yourself.)

678
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,000
I will keep it a secret between us.

679
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
What do you want?

680
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,469
I want to know

681
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:35,898
whether you love yourself

682
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:37,541
more than you love Nathat.

683
00:42:37,563 --> 00:42:38,632
Are you sure that

684
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:40,283
when your sister was stabbed,

685
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,181
she really get stabbed?

686
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,836
Mangkorn…

687
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:47,520
If you’re too confident in your intelligence,

688
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,170
you will become

689
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
a fool.
