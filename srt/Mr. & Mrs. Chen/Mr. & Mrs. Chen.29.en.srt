1
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,640
Hello?

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,519
This is Underhill.

3
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,959
Five minutes from now,

4
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,120
the phone booth across from Sheng Leather Goods Store.

5
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,959
If you are late,

6
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,640
the deal is canceled.

7
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,599
Follow me.

8
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Here I am.

9
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,039
Is it ready to trade?

10
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,719
If you are late for Lüban Road,

11
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,759
If you are late,

12
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,840
cancel the deal.

13
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,039
What are you doing?

14
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,400
What...

15
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,680
Luban Road,

16
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
alright.

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,039
Please be seated.

18
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Hurry.

19
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,759
You two go this way.

20
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,199
And we are over there.

21
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,719
Come on.

22
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,280
The martial man of the mountain must want to know

23
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
the person who traded with them.

24
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,439
Whether it's his men or him,

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,319
will definitely set an ambush.

26
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,319
As long as we get the box,

27
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,199
he'll find a way to track us.

28
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,439
I keep changing the trading place to

29
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,600
to get rid of those who were tailing me.

30
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,240
What if it's impossible?

31
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,920
Then you should be on the stage.

32
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,839
Bro, that's a good plan.

33
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,120
But the last call

34
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
to a phone booth on Luban Road,

35
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,279
around 3: 10 p.m.

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Why?

37
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,920
Stop.

38
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,480
Alright.

39
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,639
How many more places do I have to run?

40
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
There will be a rickshaw

41
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
when you get out of the phone booth

42
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,360
you threw things into the back of the rickshaw

43
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
you fooled me for a long time

44
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,319
when will you give me the formula?

45
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,639
After I confirm the number of gold bars,

46
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,160
after I confirm the amount of the gold.

47
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,360
Also,

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
please continue to wait

49
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,920
continue waiting at this phone booth.

50
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
Why should I believe you?

51
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,120
The gold strip is given to you,

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,600
but the formula?

53
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
You can choose not to believe me

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,519
but I don't think

55
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,800
you have no other choice.

56
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,600
Alright.

57
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
I trust you.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,639
But I don't have time to wait for you.

59
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,519
Call me later

60
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,199
to Ju Chuan Ri Qiao store.

61
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,319
Alright.

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,680
Got it.

63
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,560
They fooled us.

64
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,519
Turning around Luban Road, you'll need to take Shanxi Road.

65
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,319
3: 10 p.m. then.

66
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,600
It was a shift change at Tong Xing Motor Company.

67
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,720
Many cars were there.

68
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
It's no use cleaning.

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,600
Alright, alright.

70
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,639
The Chinese gold

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
should return to the Chinese.

72
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,000
What do you think?

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,519
Enough.

74
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,279
Don't bite it.

75
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,040
Come on, count.

76
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,160
See if the number is right.

77
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
Don't blame me.

78
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,360
I dare him to lose one.

79
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Count it.

80
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,920
How can you make fun of him?

81
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,079
Will you give him what he wants?

82
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
Will you give him the thing he asked for?

83
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't believe you're here.

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,160
It's you who made a deal with him

85
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,680
but if he can't get the formula,

86
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,279
a lot of people investigate it.

87
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,000
This will surely suspect us.

88
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,519
But forget about it.

89
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,079
Don't give it to me.

90
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,759
Otherwise,

91
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,639
stop. Stop.

92
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Otherwise, I have to see him off again.

93
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,399
Four. Five.

94
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
It's business.

95
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,240
We pay the debts.

96
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,920
Eight.

97
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't really use the formula of the coin paper.

98
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,279
How about this?

99
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,000
Give it to the Commander.

100
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,679
You should send him there.

101
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,600
Where to send him to?

102
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,120
There's a phone booth

103
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
there's a phone booth on Xiafei Road.

104
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,159
I will call

105
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,120
I'll call Kikukawa Riqiao's store.

106
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,679
Put this in the booth

107
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
In the back of the phone in the phone booth

108
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,519
remember that

109
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,200
you must leave the store quickly before 6: 00 a.m.

110
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,840
Ju Chuan Ri Qiao Store.

111
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,720
Right.

112
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,879
At that time,

113
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,919
he should be with his fiancée.

114
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,960
Alright.

115
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,840
Got it.

116
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,960
Don't move.

117
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,360
Don't you believe me?

118
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,639
Yes, I will.

119
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,840
The more you trust me,

120
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,679
you?

121
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,679
What about

122
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,399
we'll carry out the original plan.

123
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,279
The writing is obviously different.

124
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
And the ingredients and ratio are different.

125
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,080
This formula is fake.

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,799
Was Luo Guanqun testing me?

127
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,440
Nice to meet you.

128
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,879
Mr. Yamashita,

129
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,159
welcome

130
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,559
where is Cold Dew?

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Cold Dew is having the kimono set

132
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,799
they are trying on the kimono.

133
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,399
The cloth bag Luo Guanqun gave me

134
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,000
Into the phone booth on Xiafei Road.

135
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,519
It will return to him eventually.

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,519
At that time, if the formula

137
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
the one who put the mask

138
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,559
I must be the one who switched the formula

139
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,519
luo Guanqun must have put the real formula

140
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,399
somewhere else.

141
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,039
He'll call Yamashita at 6: 00

142
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,840
And tell him where the formula is

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,879
that will be my last chance, too

144
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,639
mr. Yamashita,

145
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,440
come and have a look!

146
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,799
The elegance of Miss Han Lu

147
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,440
that's why

148
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,919
I chose the royal style with the halo around it.

149
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,840
What about

150
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,720
gorgeous!

151
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:55,919
Gorgeous.

152
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,039
I don't want to be flattered.

153
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,080
I thought this outfit is too magnificent.

154
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
Hello. How can I help you?

155
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,960
On your wedding day,

156
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,240
to the wedding.

157
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,360
Yes

158
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,559
miss Zuo.

159
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,919
It's a phone call for you.

160
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,919
It's Japan's boss, Dongtian Jun.

161
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll pick it up.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,600
Alright.

163
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,600
Hello?

164
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,039
Hello, it's me.

165
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,799
It's Lord Dongtian.

166
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,159
Hello

167
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:52,840
we will receive a call

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,159
we received a call down the mountain

169
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,759
the phone will send an address down the mountain.

170
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,480
You and Han Lu must find a way

171
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,399
get this address.

172
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,440
I want to prepare Japanese style snacks

173
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,600
at the wedding.

174
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,759
Zuo Shuangtao got in touch with the restaurant

175
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,360
they're in a hurry to decide the type of dessert.

176
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
So I asked them to call me.

177
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,519
It bothered you.

178
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,320
It's my pleasure.

179
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,080
You mean the boiled sheep soup?

180
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,200
Is it right?

181
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
That's right.

182
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,720
I want it.

183
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,240
CAUTION

184
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,480
alright.

185
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,440
See you later.

186
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey.

187
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,320
Second best.

188
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,039
Get someone to pretend to be debt collectors?

189
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:48,159
No. 32 in the Gu House at 6: 00 a.m.

190
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
Debt collector?

191
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,240
No need to play.

192
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I know a lot of them.

193
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Lord Dongtian

194
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,240
Is really long-winded.

195
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,679
But I've already told you.

196
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,679
Thanks to you.

197
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,039
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able

198
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,039
I can't handle all these by myself.

199
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,639
Miss Han Lu.

200
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,720
I chose a Hakata band for you.

201
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,120
I think it will look better with it.

202
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,279
Shall we try it again?

203
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
What do you think

204
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,960
I'll give it a try.

205
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,519
Give it to me.

206
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,679
I can handle it.

207
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,679
We will receive a call at 6: 00 p.m.

208
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,639
The phone will tell you the address down the mountain.

209
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,320
We must get the address first.

210
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,720
What should I do?

211
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,039
Take it easy.

212
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
Do as I say.

213
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,320
The cold dew.

214
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,120
It's getting late today.

215
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
The halo brocade kimono you tried on

216
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,159
Is settled then.

217
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,559
Oh, right.

218
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,600
You were busy choosing a kimono for me today,

219
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,759
we haven't picked one for you yet.

220
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,399
I'm not in a rush.

221
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,879
Today we're mainly trying for you.

222
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,679
Another thing

223
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,080
I have something to do.

224
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,200
Six o'clock.

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,240
It's only 5.30 a.m.

226
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
You can make it.

227
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,399
When you were not here,

228
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,000
shuangtao and I selected one for you.

229
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,039
Try them on.

230
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,080
Is meticulously picked by Miss Han Lu.

231
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,960
For me to pick the Hakama.

232
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,679
I'll go fetch it.

233
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,720
Just have a try.

234
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,120
They still

235
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,600
see how you act as the groom.

236
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,279
All right?

237
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,360
Alright.

238
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,200
Here it is.

239
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,519
Go try it on.

240
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,279
Go try it out.

241
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,000
Manager Luo.

242
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,279
What about

243
00:16:59,279 --> 00:16:59,799
we got it!

244
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,919
Come and have a look.

245
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,480
What about

246
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,000
he hasn't changed either.

247
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,839
He didn't change his body?

248
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,480
Where?

249
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,599
My friend here

250
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,519
the gambler who owes money

251
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,519
Is upstairs.

252
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,319
Gambler!

253
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,119
Come down.

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
Come down.

255
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,920
Gamblers with debts come down?

256
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,839
Who are you?

257
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,799
Get down. Hurry up.

258
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,480
The cold dew.

259
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,440
What about

260
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,519
It's a bit different from what I expected.

261
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,720
Left Shuangtao, what do you think?

262
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:56,799
There might be

263
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,440
Is it the fabric?

264
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
And it is too soft.

265
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,640
The body features of Mr. Yamashita

266
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,519
the physical features of Mr. Yamashita.

267
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,079
I think it's fine.

268
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,519
Oh, right.

269
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,200
Do you remember the other outfit we chose?

270
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,920
That's right.

271
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,559
Is brocade fabric.

272
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,160
That one is stiff.

273
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
That's more suitable for Mr. Yamashita.

274
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,880
I'll bring it over.

275
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,319
Alright.

276
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,200
Hurry up.

277
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,279
Wedding is a major event in a woman's life.

278
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,480
Every detail...

279
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,440
In every detail.

280
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,839
Don't be impatient.

281
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,960
How can I be impatient?

282
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,119
Alright.

283
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,799
I'll try to satisfy you.

284
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,680
Alright!

285
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
Gambler, come out now!

286
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,759
Come down.

287
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,279
Ignore them.

288
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,799
Come down and pay back the money.

289
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,799
Come down!

290
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,039
Get down and return the money.

291
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,839
The clothes are here.

292
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,839
Go try them on.

293
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,799
You have things to do later.

294
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,440
Hurry up.

295
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,039
Hurry up!

296
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,160
It should be Lord Dongtian.

297
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
He asked about your taste and taste.

298
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,599
I really don't know.

299
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,200
And sorry to bother you.

300
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
Miss Han Lu.

301
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
Go pick them up.

302
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,839
Alright.

303
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
I'll answer the phone.

304
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,759
Go on.

305
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,839
Go try!

306
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,599
Go try it!

307
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,119
Hello?

308
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,279
Is this Jun Dongtian?

309
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,839
Is this Ju Chuan Ri Qiao?

310
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,960
Yes

311
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
I'm looking for Mr. Yamashita.

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,920
Open the door!

313
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:06,960
Open the door!

314
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,440
Mr. Yamashita is trying on clothes.

315
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
May I ask who you are?

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
I made an appointment with Yamashita.

317
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,480
What are you doing?

318
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,519
Drive them out.

319
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,759
What's wrong with you?

320
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,200
Do you want the police to follow us?

321
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,799
He tried on kimono

322
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,039
and other accessories.

323
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,319
It might take some time.

324
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,640
Can you call back later?

325
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,160
Can you tell him to hurry up?

326
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,559
Come down.

327
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,359
Give me back my money!

328
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,319
Come down.

329
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,240
Do you hear me?

330
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,880
Hurry up.

331
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,519
Are you ready under the mountain?

332
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,279
The police are here.

333
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,480
The police is here, go.

334
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,319
Stop.

335
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:43,640
Go right now!

336
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,079
Stop!

337
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,119
Stop!

338
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,960
Tell him I can't wait.

339
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,240
The location is Sanguantang Road.

340
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,519
The sixth telegraph pole from west to east

341
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,599
the telephone booth across from it

342
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,240
It's behind the phone

343
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
got it?

344
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,279
Alright.

345
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,200
I'll write it down.

346
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,000
I will tell him.

347
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,039
Hurry up.

348
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Hello, Lord Dongtian.

349
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:12,920
Miss Cold Dew.

350
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,640
What about

351
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,119
did anyone there suspect you?

352
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,039
Ge Ying? No.

353
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,799
Change it to Da Fu scroll then.

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,920
Don't serve these common people's snacks.

355
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,680
Mr. Yamashita won't be happy about this.

356
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
Mr. Yamashita.

357
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Traditionally,

358
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,960
the kimono of the wedding should be made with Yuzhi.

359
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,000
Mr. Yamashita,

360
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,799
that's the last one.

361
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,079
Go try it on.

362
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,920
It won't take long.

363
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,440
Sanguantang Road from west to east

364
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,640
the phone booth next to the sixth telegraph pole

365
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,880
the thing is behind the phone

366
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:07,880
alright.

367
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,039
But I have to be there before I reach the mountain.

368
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,599
Compared to Japqiao Store,

369
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,880
compared to Riqiao Store,

370
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
It's further away from Sanguantang Road.

371
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
You must find a way to hold the mountain back for me.

372
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,039
Alright.

373
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,160
Miss Cold Dew.

374
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,839
Are you all right?

375
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,440
Chen Jiaping asked us to hold the mountain

376
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,279
miss Cold Dew.

377
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,920
It hurts to walk in a kimono.

378
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,759
Right.

379
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,319
I almost tripped and fell.

380
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,599
The brocade kimono with feather boa

381
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,000
the brocade kimono and Yuzhi.

382
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,079
Zuo Shuangtao, what do you think?

383
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,720
I think so too.

384
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,839
This outfit really makes Mr. Yamashita

385
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,319
taller and more formidable.

386
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,559
Oh, right.

387
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,640
Why did the phone ring twice just now?

388
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,440
After answering Dongtian's phone,

389
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,680
then I received another one.

390
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,160
Whose call?

391
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,480
It's for you.

392
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:18,960
It's for me.

393
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:19,960
Who is it?

394
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,440
He didn't say anything.

395
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,920
That man is acting strange.

396
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,519
But he left you his address.

397
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,559
His address?

398
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,880
The location?

399
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,160
You were trying on the kimono?

400
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,640
It's not six o'clock yet.

401
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,759
You're hurting me!

402
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,079
Why is my watch slow?

403
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,480
Did you accidentally touch the watch

404
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,079
you bumped into the watch?

405
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:55,720
Cold Dew.

406
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,440
What about the address?

407
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,160
The address?

408
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,960
The address on a note.

409
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,759
Where's the note?

410
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,839
Don't yell at me.

411
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,680
You dare to yell at me?

412
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,160
I...

413
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,559
Less would occur to me.

414
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,279
Think it over.

415
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,559
Think it over?

416
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,200
I...

417
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,960
It's in my bag.

418
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,039
I'll...

419
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:12,880
I'm going to look for you.

420
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,079
I'll look for him.

421
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,960
It's here.

422
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,400
Where is it?

423
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,400
I...

424
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
It's impossible.

425
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,519
It's here.

426
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,359
Here's the address.

427
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,200
I clearly remember it.

428
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,160
Hold on.

429
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,039
Hold on.

430
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,920
I've discussed with Zuo Shuangtao just now.

431
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,039
Since it's a Japanese wedding,

432
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,039
you should wear the most traditional pure white kimono.

433
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,440
Look at this one.

434
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,200
Cold Dew.

435
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,519
I'm looking forward to seeing you in White Unsullied.

436
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,680
But I have something very important

437
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,599
I need to leave now.

438
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,759
Don't leave.

439
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,240
If you don't finish fitting this kimono with me,

440
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,960
I won't marry you.

441
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,559
Miss Cold Dew.

442
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,079
How long does it take to go to Sanguantang Road?

443
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,079
Five minutes.

444
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,839
Hurry up!

445
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,640
Are you all right?

446
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:04,839
How long do I need?

447
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,359
And you'll just turn around.

448
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,799
Faster!

449
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,519
Don't you think

450
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,640
I still have to be a concierge.

451
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,839
Reflective.

452
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,559
Glass

453
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,559
It's reflective.

454
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,759
Sorry.

455
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
I didn't do well enough today.

456
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,640
You've done well enough.

457
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,680
I'm so worried about you.

458
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,559
There's an old fox under the mountain.

459
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,079
I know how to deal with him.

460
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,759
When I changed

461
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,200
when I helped you change your clothes,

462
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,599
when I got changed.

463
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,279
Does he always treat you badly?

464
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,079
That's a real devil.

465
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
It's too painful for you to stay like this.

466
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,240
You should leave him as soon as possible

467
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,599
as soon as possible.

468
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,119
Before I finish

469
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,079
what I think I should do,

470
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,440
until I finish what I'm supposed to do.

471
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,720
But you are just walking on thin ice.

472
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,119
Think of it as a thriller.

473
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,559
I acted in love,

474
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,880
comic,

475
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,160
and historical costumes.

476
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,759
We haven't done any thrilling movies yet.

477
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,759
Just like Robin Hood.

478
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,720
It's fun to think about it.

479
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,759
You have to promise me that

480
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,240
you and Chen Jiaping

481
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,480
will always live happily ever after

482
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,160
In the future.

483
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,440
I can't be happier.

484
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,160
So, as long as you two are happy,

485
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,000
that's a satisfaction.

486
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
What did you say

487
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,079
the formula was not in the phone booth on Sanguantang Road

488
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,640
that's right

489
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,240
there's just a button

490
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,839
there's only one button.

491
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,279
Is there a mystery

492
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,759
Inside the button?

493
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,000
I've checked.

494
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,880
There is nothing.

495
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,240
Just an ordinary button.

496
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,359
These aren't buttons.

497
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,119
They're sleeve buttons.

498
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,559
The sleeve buttons!

499
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,680
Will the formula be taken away by Yamashita ahead of time?

500
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,319
That's not true.

501
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,960
I saw with my own eyes that someone from the mountain was later than me.

502
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,279
So Luo Guanqun lied to him?

503
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,720
I don't think that's possible.

504
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,000
If Luo Guanqun wants to trick him,

505
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,680
he can escape once he gets the gold.

506
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Why did he have to wait until 6: 00 a.m.?

507
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,720
That was unnecessary.

508
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,039
What exactly happened then?

509
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,519
I don't know either

510
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,240
this is strange.

511
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,400
To think it over.

512
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,519
In any case,

513
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,039
you've done a great job today.

514
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,359
And Cold Dew.

515
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,640
I just didn't expect that

516
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
the first time we really worked together

517
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,880
for our first real cooperation.

518
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,319
This matter is not over yet.

519
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,240
Yamashita didn't get the formula.

520
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,920
Without the formula.

521
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,160
You too.

522
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,160
You're so careless.

523
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,680
You didn't recover last time.

524
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,839
Now I'm injured again.

525
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,200
The iodine is gone. I'll buy some

526
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,440
no, please

527
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,759
the pharmacy is closed.

528
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,720
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

529
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,640
In my office.

530
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,680
In my office.

531
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
I'll go with you.

532
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,680
Don't go.

533
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,799
Stay here.

534
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,880
I'll be back soon.

535
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,119
Be careful.

536
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,079
Forty-five.

537
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,039
Forty-six.

538
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,200
Mr. Lin.

539
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,920
Off work.

540
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,839
Is anyone still upstairs?

541
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,799
No one. They all left.

542
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,640
Alright.

543
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,759
Is anyone still upstairs?

544
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,799
Miss is here.

545
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,119
Here you are.

546
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,559
Thank you.

547
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,799
Officer Uchida.

548
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,079
Those who subscribe to Liangyou Magazine

549
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:04,599
and

550
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,640
with glass top.

551
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,720
With glass tops.

552
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,760
However

553
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,920
we're the only one

554
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,000
Is Ms. Luo's only room.

555
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,960
Now I can confirm that

556
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
this photo...

557
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,400
In Mr. Luo's office.

558
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,400
So I was sure that

559
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
that the letter to Mr. Yamashita

560
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,079
must have been sent by Mr. Luo

561
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,400
or his subordinates sent it.

562
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,679
The formula must be in Mr. Luo's hands

563
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,239
jia Ping.

564
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,679
Jiaping.

565
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,320
Have some fruits.

566
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,760
Luo Guanqun,

567
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,159
he's done for.

568
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,000
What do you mean?

569
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,119
Uchida already knew.

570
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,360
Luo Guanqun was the one who made the deal with Underhill.

571
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
How did he know?

572
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,480
He asked Qian Xiucai to investigate this matter secretly.

573
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,679
When I was getting you the medicine,

574
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,400
I heard Qian Xiucai reporting to Ueda.

575
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,000
If Luo Guanqun collapses,

576
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,360
we'll be screwed.

577
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,000
Ueda also said that

578
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,920
to tear Luo Guanqun and his men into pieces.

579
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,920
We have to leave as soon as possible.

580
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
Don't think about it.

581
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,960
No way.

582
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,159
Why not?

583
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,760
Did Luo Guanqun leave any clues

584
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,960
In this phone booth?

585
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,079
Only he knows

586
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,519
and only he has the clue

587
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,800
If we run away now,

588
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,039
all the clues are gone.

589
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,199
What's your plan?

590
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,519
You're here.

591
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,440
What's up

592
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,280
It is over.

593
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,880
What is that?

594
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,960
Uchida already knows

595
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,760
It was you who traded with Military Master Yamashita.

596
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:05,840
Shu Yun!

597
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,559
Please leave us.

598
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,960
I need to talk to Jia Ping.

599
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,159
She's here.

600
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,320
Sister-in-law.

601
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I will leave you two alone.

602
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,679
How did he know?

603
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,280
Ueda arranged Qian Xiucai

604
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,480
to investigate this secretly.

605
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,480
Qian Xiucai found the reflected glass

606
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,039
the glass

607
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,679
In your office.

608
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,840
Qian Xiucai?

609
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,039
That jerk.

610
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,679
He is just a harmless person,

611
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,880
he actually had sinister intentions.

612
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,320
And ambitious.

613
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,519
How do you know that?

614
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,519
Zuo Shuangtao, get me the medicine from the firm.

615
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,199
She watched your room with the light on,

616
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,599
she went to check what happened.

617
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,559
And I overheard their conversation.

618
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
You

619
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,920
and all your subordinates

620
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,760
and kill them all.

621
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
Old Luo,

622
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,000
we can't stay in the business anymore.

623
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,639
We can only run.

624
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,079
You can only run for your life.

625
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:05,760
Do you know

626
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,880
let me think.

627
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
What are you thinking about?

628
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,880
Can't you have a place to hide yourself?

629
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,280
The commercial firm is a place

630
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,360
Is fraught with trouble.

631
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,519
I thought there would be such a day.

632
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,719
But I never thought it would happen so suddenly.

633
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,639
What about you?

634
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,119
What should you do?

635
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,360
Zuo Shuangtao's aunt found us a place

636
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:40,920
to hide for a while.

637
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,639
Alright.

638
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,440
Jiaping.

639
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,679
I got you into this.

640
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,639
Don't you want to drag me down in vain.

641
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,960
Where are my gold bars?

642
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,480
She doesn't know about this.

643
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,679
I asked Dashao

644
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,400
to take Shuyun there first.

645
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,400
I'll get things ready.

646
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,719
I'll go with you.

647
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,159
And I'll send you there.

648
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,840
It seems that you don't trust me.

649
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,280
Right?

650
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,039
If it's Ueda,

651
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,719
act as if you don't know.

652
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,119
Hey,

653
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,840
officer Uchida.

654
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,159
I'm off.

655
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,239
What's the matter?

656
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,360
Alright.

657
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:41,840
What did they say?

658
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,320
Asked me to go to Military Police Headquarters

659
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,559
they said it was an emergency meeting.

660
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,239
He never made it back.

661
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,679
Mrs. Luo,

662
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,360
don't worry.

663
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,280
That place is still safe.

664
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,119
Where are we going?

665
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,119
Long Wu Li.

666
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,199
No. 315.

667
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,679
Working for the Japanese?

668
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,199
This is the end of the day.

669
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,440
Luckily, Manager Luo has a keen insight.

670
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,199
He has arranged the way to Hong Kong long ago.

671
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,360
Look at the current situation.

672
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,119
You still worry about your wife.

673
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,280
What a romantic scene.

674
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,840
And ended up in the world.

675
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,360
Only Shuyun can keep me company.

676
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,360
What about you?

677
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,679
Where are you going?

678
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm going to...

679
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,199
To Yan'an?

680
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,480
What?

681
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,280
The Japanese and the National Army won't spare me.

682
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,639
I could only go to Yan'an and join the Communists.

683
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,800
Looks like a Communist too.

684
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,920
That's right.

685
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,880
How come Uchida told Zuo Shuangtao

686
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,000
he didn't get the formula at all?

687
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,840
That's impossible

688
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,079
I put the formula

689
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,159
at the phone booth on Sanguantang Road.

690
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,880
The phone booth in Sanguantang Road.

691
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,400
Isn't it Xiafei Road?

692
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,519
That was a test drive.

693
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,840
Zhao An accepted the sin of being the five of hearts.

694
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,880
The five of hearts are still in the trading house.

695
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,119
It was Dazao's idea.

696
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,519
It really has nothing to do with me.

697
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,760
Alright, alright.

698
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,679
Release your anger in the way you want? Come on.

699
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,559
Alright.

700
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:49,400
Anyway,

701
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,440
our era is over.

702
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,159
Let me ask you something.

703
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,639
Why didn't he get the formula?

704
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,320
I don't know.

705
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,920
If you don't know, who does?

706
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,239
Why are you so concerned about the formula?

707
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,519
Don't tell me you're really a communist?

708
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,519
That's crap!

709
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,440
I was doing well at the commercial firm.

710
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,400
It's all your fault.

711
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,159
I've become a rat everyone detests now.

712
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,199
You refused to give him Underhill's formula.

713
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,400
That's why he was angry.

714
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,480
You've gotten too many gold bars!

715
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,239
That's enough!

716
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,280
What should I do?

717
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,039
What about me and Zuo Shuangtao?

718
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,119
What do you want to do?

719
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,199
Patrol.

720
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,800
You scared me.

721
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:44,440
Did you hide the formula?

722
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,079
Do you still have a chance to cash in?

723
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,039
I don't have one.

724
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:50,880
Luo Guanqun,

725
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,920
now you want to enjoy the exclusive food.

726
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,639
Right?

727
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,960
I swear that

728
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,559
I really didn't!

729
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,199
You know what?

730
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,360
Tell me the truth.

731
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,519
The patrol was on the edge.

732
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,519
I drive the accelerator

733
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,239
neither of us can get away.

734
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:00,920
Alright, alright.

735
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,360
I really swear

736
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,320
I didn't!

737
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,239
If I lied to you,

738
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,239
I want my wife to cuckold me again.

739
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,039
Alright?

740
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,320
When did you

741
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,079
you hid the formula in the phone booth?

742
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:19,880
Last night

743
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,039
I went there alone.

744
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:22,840
Alone?

745
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:24,599
No one followed him.

746
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,239
No one

747
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,480
this way, Mrs. Luo

748
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,880
slowly.

749
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,079
This is not easy.

750
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,199
You can't drive in here?

751
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,559
You can't drive in here.

752
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,719
Over here.

753
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,119
Why is it so smelly here?

754
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,119
We are an escape now

755
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:53,920
mrs. Luo,

756
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:59,480
at first, I thought I could pay the debt,

757
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,440
I thought it was pretty,

758
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,480
I don't want to mess with the devil.

759
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
I don't give him the formula, why?

760
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,199
These are not buttons.
