1
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,719
At first, I thought I could pay the debt,

2
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,599
I thought it was pretty,

3
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,640
I don't want to mess with the devil.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,959
I don't give him the formula

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,519
alright

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
It seems that you really didn't lie to me.

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
Why would I?

8
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,560
We're brothers.

9
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,319
When we get to the place,

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,519
can I give you two more big yellow croaker?

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Half an hour has passed,

12
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,840
and I haven't gone to the military police headquarters.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Uchida must suspect me.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Be gentle, Mrs. Luo.

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,639
The soundproof here is bad.

16
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,159
A big spoon.

17
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,039
This is no place for humans.

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,280
Make do with this?

19
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,039
Come on.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,159
Mrs. Luo

21
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,199
have a seat there

22
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,159
It seems that

23
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,039
has been obtained by Zhang Shuyun.

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,199
If we let Luo Guanqun join her,

25
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,520
If we let Luo Guanqun join her.

26
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,080
What's up

27
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,039
didn't you see two people

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,639
two figures ran past.

29
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,080
Figures?

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,039
Is there anyone?

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,759
Who?

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Could it be a Japanese secret agent?

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,719
Is it safe for you to find that place?

34
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,240
Of course it's safe.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Are you sure about that?

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,919
It's not.

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,919
You can't.

38
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,800
Please,

39
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,520
wait here.

40
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,599
I'll check it out for you.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,840
Give me the gun.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,520
Alright.

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,639
If there's any problem, I'll shoot.

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,879
Drive away when you hear the gunshot!

45
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,800
Watch out

46
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,199
oK.

47
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,439
Got it.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,159
I'm leaving now.

49
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,280
Who's that?

50
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,400
I think Mr. Luo has arrived.

51
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,800
How can he be so fast?

52
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,439
Who's that?

53
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,040
Who?

54
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,800
Who is it?

55
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,839
This is bad.

56
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,199
It's too late.

57
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,399
The Japanese must have taken the formula

58
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,399
what about

59
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,160
are you all right?

60
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm too nervous.

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,399
I got it wrong.

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,240
That's good.

63
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,120
Old Luo.

64
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,519
You can just walk in.

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,240
Aren't you going to see me off?

66
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,360
The road is too narrow inside.

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,240
It's hard to drive in there.

68
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,480
Besides, Zuo Shuangtao and I need to escape.

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,879
Leave me the gun.

70
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,120
Do you still have it?

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,839
Alright.

72
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,040
The gold bars.

73
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,040
I'll come and get it from you tomorrow.

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,079
Aren't you afraid that I might sneak away?

75
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,360
If you can escape,

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,360
hide here.

77
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,600
Alright.

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,519
With the Imperial Household Department.

79
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,000
Old Luo.

80
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,680
Do you have other things to do?

81
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,120
I've been with you for so long.

82
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,519
I part ways right away.

83
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,399
What kind of person do you see me?

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,240
It's hard to say.

85
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,240
I have to think about it.

86
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,040
I'll tell you tomorrow.

87
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,759
OK. Tomorrow.

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
I'll tell you tomorrow.

89
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,319
Let's stop here.

90
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,079
Who's that?

91
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,439
It's me.

92
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,680
Open the door.

93
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,079
Old Luo.

94
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Please don't blame me.

95
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,759
I had no choice.

96
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,720
I thought you hadn't forgiven me

97
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,879
what happened last time.

98
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,560
Could you have gone to another woman?

99
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,959
So I followed you all the way

100
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,240
all the way to the phone booth on Sanguantang Road.

101
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,199
I saw you take out your colorful Phoenix Tail Pen

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
and put it behind the phone

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,160
and put it behind the phone.

104
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,439
I don't know what you want to do.

105
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
I wanted to know

106
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,839
I'll take away what you've hidden.

107
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,800
I studied it for a long time when I was home.

108
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,399
I couldn't understand it.

109
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,839
So I didn't pay much attention to

110
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,319
only tonight,

111
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,319
after hearing your conversation with Chen Jia Ping

112
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,879
what you've hidden

113
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,439
officer Uchida.

114
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,320
The thing they've been looking for

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,039
If you take me with you to run away,

116
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,080
I thought

117
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
why do men always

118
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,919
and run away with a woman all the time?

119
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
You think I'll be moved?

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,039
Did you ask about my intention?

121
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,399
I don't want to run.

122
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,519
Anyone leads me to run,

123
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,840
I won't run away.

124
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,679
So,

125
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,120
why did you ask Dashao

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm the one who called Uchida.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
And I gave him the stuff.

128
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,279
Uchida said that

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,679
and won't convict me

130
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,600
It won't condemn me.

131
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,159
All right.

132
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,360
I've told you everything.

133
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,080
Death comes to all.

134
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,799
It is a worthy death

135
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,480
Is worthwhile.

136
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,240
Old path...

137
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,279
No matter where you are in the future,

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,759
we will continue to fight together

139
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,480
for the communist belief.

140
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,120
Thank you so much, Mrs. Luo.

141
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,879
Officer Uchida,

142
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,559
that's very kind of you.

143
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,639
In fact, in the future,

144
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,559
In the future.

145
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,519
I prefer to call you Mrs. Luo.

146
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,440
Don't worry.

147
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,399
Don't worry.

148
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,919
So the formula

149
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,879
zhang Shuyun took the formula.

150
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,759
But when I saw Big Diao's body,

151
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
I knew

152
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,440
that Uchi was lying in wait.

153
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,559
So I had to give up.

154
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,879
Get into Neitian's hands.

155
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
Luo Guanqun deserves what she got.

156
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,360
On my way here,

157
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,960
I passed by Yumo Calligraphy and Painting.

158
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,399
Unfortunately,

159
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,279
I can't take care of Luo Guanqun.

160
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,399
But he must be

161
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,679
must be very bloody by now.

162
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,679
Officer Uchida.

163
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,639
What do you want me to dig for?

164
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,600
Manager Luo,

165
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,360
do you know

166
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,039
are they familiar?

167
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,320
Zhao An.

168
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,840
You also have today.

169
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,960
You also have today.

170
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,879
You'll also suffer the same fate.

171
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,399
I've already told Chief Ueda.

172
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,879
That you framed Zhao An.

173
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,200
And buried him alive here.

174
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,240
Manager Luo,

175
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,159
there are too many

176
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,679
are too numerous to record.

177
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,799
Zhang Shuyun.

178
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,080
Zhang Shuyun.

179
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,919
You're smelly.

180
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,080
You stink.

181
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,320
Keep scolding her.

182
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,720
Do you want to hit me again?

183
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,600
If you dare to continue,

184
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,159
I think you are more respectable.

185
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
From now on,

186
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,840
from today on,

187
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,039
I'll say goodbye to my past

188
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,279
from my past.

189
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,519
From your past.

190
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,559
To the past.

191
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,639
So you

192
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
you scoundrel!

193
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,039
You dirty woman!

194
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Officer Uchida.

195
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,240
Without this coat,

196
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,480
without this coat.

197
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
Please let me go.

198
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm worse than a pig or a dog.

199
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,200
Why did you kill a beast?

200
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,840
Please.

201
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,240
Please spare me.

202
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,279
Shuyun,

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,360
for the sake of us as husband and wife,

204
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,799
please help me!

205
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,759
Please help me.

206
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,399
Break his incantation, break the trap,

207
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,000
lift the barrier of untimely death

208
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,320
and save all grievances.

209
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,679
And have a clear and bright future.

210
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,440
Mrs. Luo,

211
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,559
It's up to you

212
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,600
Is up to you.

213
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
Shu Yun!

214
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Sook Yun.

215
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,159
Shu Yun.

216
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,240
Come on.

217
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,399
It's too cold here.

218
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Great kindness

219
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
great kindness

220
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
great kindness

221
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,879
great kindness

222
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,440
great kindness

223
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,519
great kindness

224
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,599
great kindness

225
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,720
great kindness

226
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,519
I've got the formula now.

227
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,039
The mission

228
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,799
the mission that Lao Lu gave me before his death.

229
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
I'm not willing to leave like this.

230
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,960
I think we'll make it to the end.

231
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
Do you have any plans?

232
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,839
I will have a meeting with my superior in three days.

233
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,400
One is the copper plate handover.

234
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:37,839
Second,

235
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,599
Is to explore the current situation.

236
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,640
And analysis.

237
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,640
And make a decision later.

238
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,480
In the next few days,

239
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
uchi Tian will definitely purge

240
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,960
a good cleaning.

241
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,559
But how can Chengzi help us find this place?

242
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,079
They are safe

243
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,039
In French Concession.

244
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,079
We should hide here for a few days

245
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,519
and try not to go anywhere.

246
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,799
You can deal with Zhao An and Luo Guanqun

247
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,440
but here comes Qian Xiucai.

248
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,720
Actually, his eyes are always on us.

249
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,160
Morning.

250
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,079
Morning.

251
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,200
You're here to work.

252
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,720
Those eyes hidden behind the reception office

253
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,559
are like the vultures hovering in the sky.

254
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,359
Dapu brother.

255
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm here to talk to you again.

256
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,359
The ant is hungry.

257
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,279
I'll give them some.

258
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,880
Brush it.

259
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't move.

260
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,079
The more you move,

261
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,759
the more severe the ant bites you.

262
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,079
That's right.

263
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,279
Don't move.

264
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,880
Slowly.

265
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,079
Slowly.

266
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,119
Although

267
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,640
tell me.

268
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,119
You have told me everything you know.

269
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,400
But what if

270
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,799
Is there anything you haven't told me?

271
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm a person who

272
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,559
I don't have many virtues,

273
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,720
but meticulous.

274
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,920
Who goes to work by what time?

275
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,279
What time do you get off work

276
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,880
what mail did you receive,

277
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,000
received and visitors.

278
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,279
Every guest.

279
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,400
Just a little more. Just more.

280
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,440
After investigation,

281
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,960
the cotton yarn that Zhao An was framed by

282
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,480
luo Guanqun also purchased cotton yarn from stores in Shanghai.

283
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,039
Cotton

284
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,640
and rare items like western medicines

285
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,039
without the permission

286
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,079
without the permission of the military police headquarters,

287
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,000
to the northern Zhejiang area without permission.

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Some of them traded in tung oil and wood

289
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,480
and then shipped back to Sunan in Hangzhou to resell.

290
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,920
Some of them used cash directly.

291
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,839
Amount of money.

292
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,000
It's staggering.

293
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,680
These are the hearing records and account books.

294
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,200
The shelf of Taihe Trading Firm is now empty.

295
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,160
Someone should step forward

296
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,720
right. Right.

297
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,960
Oh, right.

298
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,839
What's the name of that janitor you mentioned

299
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,279
In the Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou States?

300
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,079
Hou Ying.

301
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,519
It was him

302
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,359
that offered Lord Xinling the talisman to save Zhao.

303
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,319
It seems

304
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,440
If you want to be something like Hou Ying,

305
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,039
I dare not.

306
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,119
Although you contributed a lot this time,

307
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,640
as a result,

308
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,960
to promote you to the manager of the business.

309
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm afraid you won't be convinced.

310
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,960
Yes, you are right.

311
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,200
But I hope

312
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,200
I hope you can give me a chance

313
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,279
to serve the Japanese empire again.

314
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,519
What else can you do?

315
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,000
I heard from the officer that

316
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,920
the great plan of Mr. Yamashita

317
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,960
except the copper coins.

318
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,960
That's a pity.

319
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,039
After we knew

320
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,079
wang Dapu's real identity,

321
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,640
he has already escaped.

322
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,279
Besides, I heard that there are two lurking persons

323
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,400
In our business.

324
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,519
Four of clubs and five of hearts from Juntong

325
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,720
yes

326
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,839
we should arrest the people inside the business.

327
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,720
Or arrest them.

328
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,640
Those who should be escaped have escaped.

329
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,519
But this Heart with Clubs of Clubs

330
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,559
who exactly

331
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,279
remains a mystery.

332
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,559
According to the information we received,

333
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,960
their motive

334
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,920
Is the secret plan

335
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,319
that Mr. Yamashita has tried his best to make.

336
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,680
If we can't catch them,

337
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,240
until they're caught.

338
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,119
Officer.

339
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,039
I...

340
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,200
I, Qian Chengyi, hereby request a token.

341
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,359
One is to seize the copper board of the coin

342
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,279
to kill four of clubs and five of hearts.

343
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:36,680
You

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,720
see you tomorrow.

345
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,640
I have something important to talk to Mr. Yamashita.

346
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
Wait here.

347
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Why are you back?

348
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,559
Look at my brain.

349
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,039
I've forgotten one thing.

350
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,519
Lord Qingshan.

351
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,519
It suddenly reminds me that

352
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,720
I had a pre-filed file on epidemic prevention.

353
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,559
I forgot to file this.

354
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,799
I have to go back.

355
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,720
Now, every month

356
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,119
more than 5 million counterfeit

357
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,000
have exceeded five million.

358
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:36,960
The legal tender issued by the Chongqing government

359
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,319
Issued by the Chongqing government last year.

360
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,279
The legal funds flowing into the Kuomintang-controlled areas through Plan Shan

361
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,160
has reached 5% of the total circulation rate.

362
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,799
The inflation in the areas under the kuomintang

363
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,680
thus greatly accelerated.

364
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,759
Not only that,

365
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,000
we also have cities in Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi

366
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,519
In Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi and other unoccupied regions

367
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,680
In the unoccupied areas.

368
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
Through it,

369
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,119
and the counterfeit money were sold to the market.

370
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,240
At the same time, we have set up two companies, Yu Sheng

371
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,720
yu Sheng and Min Xing in Chongqing.

372
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,720
We used the counterfeit money

373
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,759
bought a lot of strategic supplies.

374
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,559
Now that

375
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm more confident

376
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,000
the Shan Project.

377
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:18,920
Thanks.

378
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,119
Qingshan, I'm sorry.

379
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:22,960
As for epidemic prevention,

380
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,920
It's at No. 3 Library.

381
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,839
This is No. 2.

382
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,440
How troublesome.

383
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,440
Thank you.

384
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,680
The Communist Party

385
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,759
a financial system under which overall planning and expenditure were established.

386
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,359
And abolished many miscellaneous taxes.

387
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,920
The Border Region has developed rapidly.

388
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,359
Who are you?

389
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,279
I came with Officer Uchida.

390
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,200
What can I do for you?

391
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
I'd like to know

392
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,519
anyone in Library No. 3?

393
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,359
Yes, there is.

394
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,000
What's up

395
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,920
I heard something strange

396
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,160
I heard some strange sound.

397
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
Any strange sound?

398
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,880
It's just a sound.

399
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,759
I don't know what happened.

400
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,200
Maybe I dropped the file box.

401
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:12,920
Oh, right.

402
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,160
I also heard the swish swish sound.

403
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,240
It seemed like she was ripping paper.

404
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
She heard it right.

405
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,200
Absolutely not.

406
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,759
I'll go check it out.

407
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,279
The Chongqing government

408
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,680
has now intensified

409
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,920
has tightened the overall blockade on the border region.

410
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,079
It shows that

411
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,480
chongqing has already caused the panic.

412
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,559
Even so,

413
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,640
It hasn't caused a fatal blow.

414
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,720
So,

415
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,759
the second phase of Plan Shan

416
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,519
Is to disrupt and destroy the economy

417
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,839
the economy of the border area.

418
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
The second phase of Plan Shan

419
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,000
for the second phase of development

420
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,519
In the new ground.

421
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,319
Who's that?

422
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,839
It's Lu Fangfang!

423
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,839
Are you in there?

424
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,799
Yes

425
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,079
I'm here.

426
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,200
What's the matter?

427
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,279
Open the door!

428
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,839
My hands are full of documents.

429
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,079
Please wait a second.

430
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,599
Why can't it be opened?

431
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,519
It's probably stuck.

432
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,759
Please wait a second.

433
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,240
Xiucai Qian.

434
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,200
Are you alright?

435
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,839
I'm alright.

436
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,720
Lord Qing.

437
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,240
What exactly happened?

438
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,559
Did you tear any files?

439
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,680
The files?

440
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,039
How is that possible?

441
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,000
I didn't do that.

442
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,759
If you suspect me,

443
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,599
you can check every document here

444
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,319
for signs of damage.

445
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,920
And search me.

446
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,680
Come on.

447
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,079
I know the rules of Military Police Headquarters.

448
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,880
Open them.

449
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,039
Really?

450
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,920
Did you hear me clearly?

451
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:35,720
I will...

452
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,279
Qian Chengyi

453
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,279
I'm right here.

454
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,319
Why did you go there?

455
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,359
Come in.

456
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,000
The second phase of Plan Shan

457
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,799
for the second phase of development

458
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,039
In the new ground.

459
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,480
New ground?

460
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,559
Could it be a place?

461
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,039
Come.

462
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,079
Sir.

463
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,400
Slowly.

464
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,240
Slowly.

465
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,400
Sir.

466
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,559
Slow down.

467
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,680
It's you.

468
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,039
Why are you following me?

469
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,519
Captain Liu is dead.

470
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,680
What?

471
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,640
Chen Jiaping killed Captain Liu.

472
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,400
You also caused his death.

473
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,519
It's impossible!

474
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Chen Jia Ping told me that Captain Liu saved him

475
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,960
and I told him a secret passage to avoid the manhunt.

476
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,200
Captain Liu wanted to save you

477
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,279
he never wanted to save Chen Jia Ping

478
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,160
he only wanted to get back the copper plate.

479
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,000
But Chen Jiaping killed him.

480
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,680
I don't believe it.

481
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,519
Don't be so naive.

482
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,119
How could Captain Liu

483
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,519
helping a Communist?

484
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
You are cheated by Chen Jiaping

485
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,440
how did you know?

486
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,720
I was not far from Captain Liu...

487
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Chen Jia Ping shot him.

488
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,640
When he shot him.

489
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,880
But I was so scared back then

490
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,880
I didn't go forward.

491
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,759
I couldn't save Captain Liu either.

492
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,359
It's impossible

493
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
jia Ping isn't that kind of person

494
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,279
Impossible?

495
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,400
I saw that with my own eyes.

496
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,359
Director Jiang is right.

497
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,839
You have already been transformed

498
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,000
to be brainwashed.

499
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,759
Captain Liu.

500
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,119
Where's the corpse?

501
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,160
Captain Liu.

502
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,680
Although you are strict,

503
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,400
there is light in your heart,

504
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,480
I can feel it.

505
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
A shiny thing

506
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,079
actually,

507
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,920
I also have something to tell you.

508
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,599
But today is not the right time.

509
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,000
Another time.

510
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,159
Now, do you believe it?

511
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,239
Sorry,

512
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:42,960
captain Liu,

513
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,679
what took you so long?

514
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,360
I thought you like fried dumpling

515
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,159
I visited so many stores.

516
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,239
Did anything happen to her?

517
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,400
Nothing.

518
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,119
I have something on my mind.

519
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm just a little worried.

520
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,760
I don't know what to do in the future.

521
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,119
Do you remember the last sentence

522
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,039
that I told you?

523
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,559
Let's fight side by side.

524
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,920
As long as we are fighting together,

525
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,800
we can overcome any difficulty

526
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,039
and fight side by side.

527
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,679
What's with

528
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,440
why does she have a monthly pass card of Bund Park?

529
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:52,400
Could it be that the Bund Park

530
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,840
for the next station.

531
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:13,960
Chief Chen

532
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,480
what are you doing here?

533
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,039
Are you Qian Xiucai?

534
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:18,599
Over there.

535
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,679
The fountain is over there!

536
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,559
Washing my car is cheap and clean.

537
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,360
Could it be...

538
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,480
The person that Lu Fangfang

539
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,800
In Bund Park is the person who came in contact with

540
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,639
four of clubs. Chen Jiaping.

541
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,159
Have a look, sir.

542
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,280
Which one do you like?

543
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,719
This is the letter Captain Liu wrote to you?

544
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
Actually,

545
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
captain Liu,

546
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I've noticed a change of heart.

547
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,480
He was too merciful to you.

548
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,119
Otherwise, he wouldn't have ended up like this.

549
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,039
Five Commissioners of Hearts

550
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,280
I noticed that you wavered in faith recently

551
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,400
and lacked ideal,

552
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,920
make me anxious and terrified.

553
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,719
To gather our will

554
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,360
and defend as a leader,

555
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,719
that I defend the leader.

556
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,519
The policy formulated at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang

557
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,679
formulated at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang.

558
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,119
Which must be resolutely implemented.

559
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,119
We must not be bewitched by the words of the CCP.

560
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,079
No more acts of defiance.

561
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,320
Otherwise,

562
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,039
the great achievements you've made

563
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:40,920
your great achievement will be wasted.

564
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,800
Remember that.

565
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,679
What about

566
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,679
have you regretted

567
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
for what you have done?

568
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,480
Now thinking about it,

569
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,360
how pure and

570
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,760
and you're so childish.

571
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,639
Let me tell you that

572
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,079
In this world,

573
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,360
he is as noble

574
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,039
as noble as you think.

575
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,960
Loftier doctrine.

576
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,920
We are not

577
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,719
he is not a Communist, either.

578
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,480
It's for their own gains.

579
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,559
For their own benefits.

580
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,599
Use unscrupulous divisive tactics

581
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,920
our people have found out

582
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,639
the connection between Chen Jiaping and his superior

583
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,719
bring the copper plate back

584
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,000
and give it to me.

585
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,280
For Liu Wuchang,

586
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:43,960
to avenge Liu Wuchang.

587
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,320
What should I do?

588
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,679
Do you know what you should do?

589
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,239
Is it a problem that you killed Chen Jiaping?

590
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,519
Old fellow,

591
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:25,960
thank you

592
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,000
lu Fangfang,

593
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,199
what took you so long?

594
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:51,519
Lu Fangfang, you came so late!

595
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:51,800
What are you doing?

596
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,119
Don't move.

597
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,039
I'm a parrot.

598
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,039
Embrace me.

599
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,360
This is an order

600
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,360
do not turn around.

601
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,719
There is a sniper

602
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,280
there are snipers aiming at you.

603
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,199
The contact target has appeared.

604
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,599
Ready to fire.

605
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,880
Hold on.

606
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,599
That woman doesn't seem to be here for a rendezvous.

607
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,039
Why didn't you evacuate when you knew it was dangerous?

608
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Why didn't you evacuate when you knew it was dangerous?
