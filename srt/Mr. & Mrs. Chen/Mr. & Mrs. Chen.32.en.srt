1
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,000
Mr. Yamashita

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,760
both swords

3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,400
you have a bad habit of stealing things from women.

4
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,239
It's yummy!

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
Mr. Yamashita,

6
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,400
today is a day with something great.

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
Please don't shoot.

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,959
Please.

9
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Don't kill Little Bean.

10
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,199
Don't hurt it.

11
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,319
Please.

12
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,080
Please.

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
Please.

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,719
Stop shooting.

15
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,759
Little Bean!

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Hurry!

17
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Hurry!

18
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
You followed the right person.

19
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
He's a kind man.

20
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,480
Uncle Hai.

21
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,560
I've got the key.

22
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Is everything going well?

23
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,199
One of my friends was sacrificed.

24
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,839
Today

25
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,959
will be a very long day,

26
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,199
right.

27
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
It will be a very long day today.

28
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,319
Come on! Hurry up!

29
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,759
Come on! Hurry up!

30
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on.

31
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:09,839
Hurry!

32
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,199
Hurry!

33
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,879
Hurry up!

34
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,040
Hurry up!

35
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,879
Hurry!

36
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,560
Come on.

37
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Hurry up.

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,759
Come on.

39
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,160
I never thought

40
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,720
to see the old men of Taihe Trading Firm again.

41
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,600
What a surprise and emotion!

42
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,120
I didn't expect that

43
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,759
you are the one

44
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,240
who has the last laugh.

45
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,920
To take the advantage of the situation

46
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,319
to take advantage of the opportunity.

47
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,639
We all have our fate.

48
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,040
By the way, Miss Shuyun,

49
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,519
with Officer Uchida?

50
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,519
I'm completely

51
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,439
a lonely man now.

52
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,439
The Japanese.

53
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
Take cities and seize territory

54
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
be fond of the new and tired of the old

55
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,519
I'm lucky to be alive.

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,439
I really don't know

57
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,000
who's going to be able to

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
manage to win Miss Shuyun's heart?

59
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,199
Speaking of that,

60
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,360
It suddenly occurred to me that

61
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
the other day,

62
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,959
I obtained an autograph in Jing'an Temple.

63
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
And they wrote

64
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,600
"It's like holding a lamp to look for fire.

65
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,360
Is better than destroying my heart.

66
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,079
Do you mean that

67
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,519
will I meet new people

68
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
In such a chaotic time?

69
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
I don't understand either.

70
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,000
Then

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,759
let me think about it.

72
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't know

73
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,879
how to describe your beauty.

74
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,199
Mr. Yamashita,

75
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,600
you may now enter the stage.

76
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,040
I'm looking forward to the moment

77
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
the moment the veil is lifted,

78
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,040
the admiration and admiration

79
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
In the audience.

80
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,319
I'm looking forward to it, too.

81
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,079
Mr. Yamashita,

82
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,319
I'm the head of the military police in charge of wedding security.

83
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,039
The wedding security.

84
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,919
Commander Hata

85
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,960
will arrive at the wedding venue at around eight.

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,120
Hold the ceremony

87
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,399
Immediately after the wedding.

88
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
The greatest day of my life

89
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,279
In my life is coming today.

90
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,679
New comer,

91
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,399
there are more here?

92
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,399
Wash them.

93
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,120
Alright.

94
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you have a solution

95
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,360
the two issues I mentioned?

96
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,200
Uncle Hai.

97
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,879
There are more problems than just those.

98
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,559
Have you ever thought about that?

99
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,960
Even if the rescue was successful,

100
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,240
and destroyed the counterfeit factory,

101
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,879
but the copper plate and the formula

102
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,279
Is still in his hands.

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,759
Plan Shan will come back to life again.

104
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I also want to get the copper plate back.

105
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,039
But we have no chance to do it.

106
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,879
The wedding is our only chance.

107
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,559
The wedding?

108
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,360
Right.

109
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,480
After Yamashita signed the agreement with Junliu Hata,

110
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,799
the printing of the coins will be officially started.

111
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,360
So the copper plate would be taken to the wedding.

112
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,080
You want to get the copper plate back in the wedding?

113
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,440
I not only want the copper plate back,

114
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
I also want to kill the warrior under the mountain.

115
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,000
To kill the assassinator here.

116
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,879
Who would do it?

117
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,440
The only person who can assassinate him

118
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Is someone who must be close to him.

119
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,759
This man

120
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
only the bride

121
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
left Pair of Peaches.

122
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,960
Right.

123
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,240
She is the most suitable candidate.

124
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,720
And

125
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,600
although he has committed heinous crimes,

126
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,759
but assassinating him during the wedding

127
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,480
won't that reveal our actions too soon?

128
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
I pondered for long

129
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,960
this is the only feasible plan.

130
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,840
Blast and rescue.

131
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,120
To assassinate Shangyi School

132
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,279
and take the copper plate.

133
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,879
We must carry out these tasks at the same time.

134
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,720
Even one second more.

135
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,559
I need someone to

136
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,000
to cut off the electricity to the wedding.

137
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,879
When I robbed Fujita of the box,

138
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
zuo Shuangtao and I

139
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,919
will escape from the wedding

140
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,279
In the darkness and chaos.

141
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,480
Then meet at the venue

142
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,120
on Anfu Road.

143
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,039
According to our information,

144
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,360
the backup electricity for the wedding

145
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,000
will be activated in two minutes.

146
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,519
You might not have time to evacuate.

147
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,320
Uncle Hai.

148
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,039
Two minutes is enough.

149
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,039
I can't.

150
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
It's too risky.

151
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,879
I was walking on thin ice.

152
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,639
Uncle Hai,

153
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,240
we're used to walking on thin ice.

154
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:19,960
Miss Cold Lu.

155
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,759
Are you all right?

156
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes, I am fine.

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,519
Go and look for the cleaner.

158
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
And the janitor too.

159
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,080
Ask her to give me the key to the dressing room.

160
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
I saw some reporters outside the door.

161
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,240
They're very versatile.

162
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,080
Steal the key and break in.

163
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,759
Alright.

164
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:46,960
Hello

165
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,399
help me clean up 201.

166
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,559
Go to the dressing room of 206.

167
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
What do you mean?

168
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,759
And unlock the signature for you.

169
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

170
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,000
next, our grand wedding

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,360
has its brightest moments.

172
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
Let's welcome the groom,

173
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,960
mr. Yamashita's Martial Master

174
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,279
thank you all

175
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,720
for attending my wedding with Miss Han Lu.

176
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,360
Thank you very much.

177
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,279
Sorry

178
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
sorry.

179
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
Double-peach.

180
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,039
How come you...

181
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,759
Sorry.

182
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,360
I will help you.

183
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,600
Listen to me.

184
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,120
Leave now.

185
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,960
I'll take care of this.

186
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,039
Shuangtao.

187
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,759
You must stay alive

188
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,559
take care, too.

189
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,480
Hurry.

190
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,480
Miss Shu Yun!

191
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,279
Miss Shu Yun!

192
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,039
Miss Shuyun.

193
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
Miss Cold Dew.

194
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,200
You can get ready now.

195
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,680
Miss Cold Dew.

196
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,319
Miss Cold Dew?

197
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,039
Miss Cold Dew?

198
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
Miss Cold Dew, are you OK?

199
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,480
Miss Cold Dew.

200
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,759
Miss Cold Dew.

201
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,480
I'm coming in.

202
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,440
Miss Cold Dew.

203
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,359
Are you all right?

204
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,799
We're waiting.

205
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,839
Let's go now.

206
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,640
It's the time.

207
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,759
Let's invite our beautiful bride

208
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,640
to invite the beautiful bride.

209
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,119
Now, please uncover the bride's red veil.

210
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:27,839
Hold on.

211
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,000
Ms. Han Lu specially told us

212
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,359
to remove the veil at seven sharp.

213
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,079
She said

214
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,079
7 p.m. is her lucky time.

215
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,359
Zhang Shuyun.

216
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,200
Zhang Shuyun.

217
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,960
Zhang Shuyun.

218
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,720
Zhang Shuyun.

219
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,240
What happened?

220
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,519
Who tied you up?

221
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,880
I don't remember.

222
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,079
Not remember.

223
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
Think about it.

224
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,319
Think about it.

225
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,480
(Sorry.)

226
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,039
I really forgot.

227
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,200
Are you going to tell me or not?

228
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,599
Are you going to tell me or not?

229
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,799
Are you going to talk?

230
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,880
Are you going to speak or not?

231
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
Left.

232
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,079
Left.

233
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,039
Left Pair of Peaches?

234
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,160
Let's look forward to

235
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,000
to this happy moment.

236
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,119
Mr. Underhill.

237
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,160
Mr. Yamashita.

238
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,039
Mr. Yamashita.

239
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,799
The bride is not real.

240
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,559
It's Chen Jiaping.

241
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,480
Mr. Yamashita,

242
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,039
chen Jiaping wants to take away the Box

243
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,400
protect the box!

244
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Come on.

245
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Go right now!

246
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,799
Hurry!

247
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,319
Hold back!

248
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,319
Hurry.

249
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:44,960
Go right now!

250
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,640
Hurry!

251
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,519
Move it!

252
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:47,759
Follow me!

253
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,480
Hurry!

254
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,480
The box!

255
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,200
Mr. Yamashita,

256
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,079
are you all right?

257
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,240
Hold this.

258
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,680
Just now,

259
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,960
where did it explode?

260
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,599
It's the underground banknote factory.

261
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
This was all premeditated.

262
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,559
This is Fu'an Jianyi.

263
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,559
Yes

264
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,480
lead the troops to the underground banknote factory immediately.

265
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,119
Yes

266
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,440
hurry.

267
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,039
Take this.

268
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,680
Bon voyage

269
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,559
take care.

270
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,319
Hurry!

271
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
There's an ambush in the north!

272
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,960
Go to the west.

273
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,880
Hurry and go!

274
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,680
Come on!

275
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,119
Gao Fang.

276
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,640
By the time we arrived,

277
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,160
all the attackers had evacuated.

278
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,079
All the experts and workers have been rescued.

279
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,640
However,

280
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,720
all the equipment of the factory and the counterfeit money

281
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,799
are intact.

282
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,279
What about the safe?

283
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,720
Safe and sound

284
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,640
maybe they thought there was no time,

285
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
and run away after I saved him.

286
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,279
Not really.

287
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,279
I have a feeling that

288
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,160
the Chinese Communist Party won't give up.

289
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,000
Do you think

290
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,359
the CCP will take the next step.

291
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,559
This place is too dangerous.

292
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
Open the safe now.

293
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,880
And put the copper plate in it.

294
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,160
Go on.

295
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,880
Arrange a team

296
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,519
to the underground factory.

297
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,119
Yes

298
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,200
neitian!

299
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,200
Close the door.

300
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,119
Yes

301
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,519
the experts and workers were rescued by the CCP.

302
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,799
Although my plan

303
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,119
has been disrupted,

304
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,200
however,

305
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,559
the copper plate and formula are still in our hands.

306
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,440
Aren't they afraid of me making a comeback?

307
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,200
In any case

308
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
the copper engraving is absolutely safe here.

309
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,680
In fact, it's just a trap

310
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,240
Is just a trap I want to set up.

311
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,920
So it wasn't the real assassination.

312
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:55,680
That's right.

313
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,839
The purpose of doing this

314
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,240
even if we get the copper plate,

315
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,920
but many fake coins that had been printed before

316
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,960
and printing equipment.

317
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,480
Plus, the formula for the paper

318
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,720
remains intact.

319
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,400
But we have no time

320
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,359
and the safe couldn't be exploded.

321
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,559
What kind of explosives

322
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,200
what kind of explosives

323
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,160
that can cause a fire after an explosion?

324
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,519
TNT can be mixed

325
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,160
Into TNT explosive.

326
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,039
The oxidant can burn

327
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:20,960
without oxygen.

328
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,880
The explosion increases the outside pressure,

329
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,400
which greatly increases the speed of the combustion.

330
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,119
The site will immediately be in flames.

331
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,799
What we can't do,

332
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,559
what we can't do.

333
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,160
Rescue, blasting and assassination,

334
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,119
and snatching the copper plates

335
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
all these actions

336
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
will upset the mountain.

337
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,599
So only by putting it in the safe

338
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,480
will they feel safe

339
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,759
understood!

340
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,119
In the swapped boxes,

341
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,519
was equipped with an explosive device carefully designed by me.

342
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:48,759
That's right.

343
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Another new painting?

344
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,680
Mr. Liu,

345
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,759
here you are.

346
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,200
How is the sales?

347
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,279
It hasn't been open for days.

348
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,319
Please take good care of it.

349
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,839
Mr. Liu,

350
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,599
look at this.

351
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,680
This is a painting I designed recently.

352
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,400
A picture of the fog mountain and the sea of clouds.

353
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,559
Look at the majestic fog

354
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,640
It's magnificent.

355
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,680
Seems to have turned the tide

356
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,759
I have the potential to change the world.

357
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,160
Look how miserable you are.

358
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,240
How can you change your life here?

359
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,039
You can't say that

360
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,359
I once knew a guard

361
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,680
pretending to be what one is not

362
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,960
than a dog.

363
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,880
He's now a high-ranking official,

364
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,079
and is loved by the Japanese.

365
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,720
Stop

366
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,440
what is this Picture of Mist Mountain and Sea of Clouds?

367
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,359
How much is it?

368
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,519
Eight yuan?

369
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,440
No, it won't.

370
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Six yuan.

371
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,119
I can't sell it if it's one less.

372
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,160
Just three.

373
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,240
Love or not.

374
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,880
Mr. Liu,

375
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
I feel proud, right?

376
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,640
I won't.

377
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,119
That was too harsh.

378
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,279
Can you add one more?

379
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,920
All right.

380
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,640
Alright.

381
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,279
I'll wrap it up for you.

382
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,359
Hold on.

383
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,000
Hold on.

384
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,319
Don't be anxious.

385
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,039
My friend is coming.

386
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,839
He wants to see your painting.

387
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
When will he come?

388
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,599
Coming.

389
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:20,759
Manager Qian,

390
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,039
slowly.

391
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,160
Slowly.

392
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,960
This way.

393
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,640
Isn't this Ms. Luo?

394
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,079
Ms. Luo?

395
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
You don't know me?

396
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,759
Am I a manager?

397
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,720
That should be you!

398
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,279
You too!

399
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,759
I'm your junior.

400
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,039
I have to learn from you.

401
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,559
Now I

402
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,720
who sells paintings.

403
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,279
Stupid artist?

404
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,440
Manager Qian,

405
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,960
this painting is called "Fog Mountain and Sea of Clouds."

406
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,279
Look at the mist.

407
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,880
Of great momentum

408
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,680
this is

409
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,839
he has the potential to turn the tide.

410
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,640
He said that?

411
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,599
Manager Luo,

412
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,599
what day and place

413
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,680
and now?

414
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,480
Or change the tide?

415
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,799
Nothing.

416
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:19,680
I sell paintings.

417
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,240
I...

418
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,599
I lied.

419
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,519
It's not true.

420
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,599
Nonsense.

421
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,599
I don't think so.

422
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,559
This...

423
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,279
The person is exactly like his painting.

424
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,200
The painting is just like the person.

425
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,039
Am I right, Manager Luo?

426
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,039
No, I don't.

427
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,279
I'm selling my paintings now.

428
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,000
Think about it.

429
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,240
Instead of being a beggar,

430
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,599
drag out an ignoble existence

431
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,759
drag out an ignoble existence

432
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,519
this is

433
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,359
of Fog Mountain and Sea of Clouds.

434
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,480
I'll take it.

435
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,039
How much is it?

436
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,759
The price is 180 yuan.

437
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,160
But since you like it,

438
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,599
I'll take charge.

439
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,640
120 is enough.

440
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,519
Give me the money.

441
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,519
Thank you.

442
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,000
Wrap the painting quickly.

443
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,039
Mr. Liu,

444
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,359
these are two different things.

445
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,799
You have to

446
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,279
you still have to give him

447
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,759
nice to meet you, Comrade Jia Chan.

448
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,920
I'm the fourth of clubs.

449
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
This is the fifth of hearts.

450
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,079
Hello

451
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,640
hello

452
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,119
according to the instruction of our superior,

453
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,160
to infiltrate the financial system

454
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,680
to work in the financial system of French Concession

455
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,079
to prepare for the future war

456
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:07,759
yes

457
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,480
but before carrying out the latent mission,

458
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,280
we may have another task

459
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,480
that I can entrust to you.

460
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,679
Can I?

461
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,320
Probably.

462
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,519
Come on.

463
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,599
Let's drink together.

464
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,360
Drink up!

465
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,400
Cheers, cheers!

466
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,519
That's great.

467
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,119
Alright.

468
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,599
This gentleman,

469
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,239
you've left me ten rounds.

470
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,639
Will you follow me or not?

471
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,920
Let's have three drinks together, okay?

472
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,440
We can't come back tonight.

473
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
We won't return.

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,480
If the card is bad, how can I follow you?

475
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,320
About the same.

476
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Waiter/Waitress

477
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,079
what can I do for you?

478
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,119
A bottle of champagne.

479
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,480
Alright.

480
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,079
Please wait a moment.

481
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,760
Sir,

482
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,960
won't you follow this round?

483
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,440
Follow him?

484
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,320
I'm so sorry.

485
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Miss Jia,

486
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,119
we have to

487
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,320
stay till drunk.

488
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,159
Manager Qian is drunk.

489
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,639
Take a rest.

490
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:47,960
Miss Li,

491
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,639
I'm going to the bathroom.

492
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,880
Sorry.

493
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,280
Waiter/Waitress

494
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,440
come and clean the place.

495
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,800
Alright.

496
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,480
Ma'am, it's your turn.

497
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,519
What is this?

498
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,239
You believe in this?

499
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,559
I don't believe in this!

500
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,880
When you were bored,

501
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,199
to hang out in the opposite

502
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,800
he saw a crazy woman

503
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,159
told a fortune for everyone she met.

504
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,719
She forced me into this?

505
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:58,840
It's her.

506
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,119
Did she watch it?

507
00:37:59,119 --> 00:37:59,559
Do you know her fortune?

508
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,320
We don't count.

509
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,880
It really worked.

510
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
Please trust me.

511
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,639
Honey.

512
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,960
Miss.

513
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,599
No. No.

514
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,440
Don't trust men.

515
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,360
Never trust men.

516
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Please trust me now.

517
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,960
I see.

518
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,239
I'm telling you, it really works.

519
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,159
Trust me. Try it.

520
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,760
Honey.

521
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,039
Do you want to try it on?

522
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:20,719
Try it on.

523
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:21,880
Have a try!

524
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,159
Isn't that Mrs. Luo?

525
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,559
Sister-in-law!

526
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,559
Is she your acquaintance?

527
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,239
How is French Concession recently?

528
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
In a complete mess

529
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,079
the French know that

530
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,239
It's inevitable that the Japanese will start a war with the Americans.

531
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,599
Looking for a backup plan.

532
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,559
Even if the Japanese occupy the French Concession,

533
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,519
they will still keep a large number of Chinese agents

534
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,360
you have to find a way to stay

535
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,920
this is very important.

536
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,920
Don't just assign me tasks.

537
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
I've handed in the application

538
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,039
to join the Party for a month.

539
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,280
Has received no news.

540
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,360
The discipline of the Party organization is very strict.

541
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,800
An application for Party membership must be approved by the general meeting of the Party branch

542
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,480
and the approval of the higher Party organization.

543
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,800
Xiaoqin.

544
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,400
You're talking more like Chen Jiaping now.

545
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,639
Oh, right.

546
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,159
To arrange a female colleague

547
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,679
to infiltrate the financial system of French Concession

548
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,079
to prepare for the Japanese's work

549
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,440
after the Japanese occupied the concession.

550
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,559
Based on

551
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,280
your identity

552
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,920
and our networking in the concession.

553
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,280
The organization has decided

554
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,639
to pretend to be a married couple with her.

555
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,400
You

556
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,360
wait. What are you doing?

557
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,679
I won't accept it.

558
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,880
It's you who reject it?

559
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,519
It's an order from the organization.

560
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,639
What's more,

561
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,320
they're just pretending.

562
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:53,840
No, it's not.

563
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,599
I can follow

564
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,159
the Party organization.

565
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,079
But I only hope

566
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,960
her personality and temper.

567
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,039
Please don't look like

568
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,039
don't be like anyone.

569
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:05,760
I won't.

570
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,280
Definitely not.

571
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm relieved then.

572
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,840
It's nothing.

573
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,440
Nothing.

574
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,159
Chen Jiaping,

575
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,400
what did you mean

576
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,800
you said "no?"

577
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,480
No one.

578
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,960
Hurry up.

579
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,239
I don't want to.

580
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,760
Do you think I have a bad temper?

581
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,039
That's not what I mean.

582
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:39,440
Very well.

583
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,880
Oh, right.

584
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,280
When are you two going to Hong Kong?

585
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,800
Going to Hong Kong.

586
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,039
Right. When are we going to Hong Kong?

587
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,400
Aren't you going to Hong Kong with me?

588
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,800
I won't.

589
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,119
If you don't go to Hong Kong, I will...

590
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,079
I would have

591
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,880
a lesbian in the disguise?

592
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,199
Hey!

593
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,320
To strangle you.

594
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,280
It's my fault.

595
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,519
Don't sway the car.

596
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,480
Sit tight.

597
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,079
I'm sorry.

598
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:12,840
Mister.

599
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,480
Your Ladyship,

600
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,280
which fabrics would you like to see?

601
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,360
The fabric for clothing.

602
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,400
What kind of clothing?

603
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,119
He made noodles with German greens.

604
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,199
With assorted white bread.

605
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,639
We don't have German Green Shop.

606
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,440
I would recommend a Yin Dan Shilin Cloth to you.

607
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,079
I don't want the faded ones.

608
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,679
Its color will never fade no matter how much sun or rain.

609
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Hello

610
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,920

you will use a new code name.

617
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,679
What code name?

618
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,519
Now that you're in Hong Kong,

619
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,960
I should do as the Romans do.

620
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,800
Your new code name is

621
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,119

Is a small gift from us.

The next task...

625
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,400
Is all there.

626
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,480
Thank you.

627
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,440
Let's take a look there.

628
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,840
Alright.

629
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Welcome both of you.

630
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,679
Come inside and have a look

631
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,840

632
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,960
Check the place across there.

633
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,000
Not here?

634
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,760
Not here?

635
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,159
It's not good.

636
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,239
Welcome next time.

637
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,960
Wish both of us get rich.

638
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,079
Wish you prosperity.

639
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,079
You're good with words.

640
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:48,639
That's for sure.

641
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:49,280
I'll accept it then.

642
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,400
You keep all the money originally.

643
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,480
You want to be money-obsessed?

644
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,639
That's right.

645
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,679
This new mission is so exciting.

646
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,239
Really, it's so exciting.

647
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,159
I didn't expect that

648
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,599
when did

649
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,400
our organization should be tasked

650
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
of the next generation.

651
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,239
We're developing new employees, right?

653
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:14,280

Don't you want to?

655
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,400
Don't you want to?

656
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,760
We need continuity.

657
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,599
Chen Jiaping.

658
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,559
