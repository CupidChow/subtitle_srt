1
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,760
And Tao from the left.

2
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,040
Insists on working in this firm.

3
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,799
Could it be that she wants to sneak into the firm?

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,400
But my existence

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,079
Is the biggest threat to her.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,760
Left Shuangtao wants to kill you.

7
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,640
He didn't want to kill me.

8
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,079
If that's the case,

9
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,159
she has too many chances.

10
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,000
Why did he do it at the cinema?

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
And the most important thing

12
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,840
what?

13
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,680
Intuition.

14
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,599
I trust my intuition.

15
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,640
Zuo Shuangtao isn't trying to kill me.

16
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,719
I know your feelings for Zuo Shuangtao.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
But you shouldn't let your feelings

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,079
affect your judgment.

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,639
Experienced.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,479
I trust my judgment.

21
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,159
You're in a very dangerous situation right now.

22
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,280
The organization is reinvestigating Zuo Shuangtao's background.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,439
We have no result so far.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Once it's verified,

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,960
she belongs to our group.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,800
You must evacuate Taihe Trading Firm immediately.

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,919
Evacuate?

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,759
How can that be?

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,919
Now Shan Plan is getting somewhere

30
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,479
and regarding the negotiation,

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
what secrets are hidden behind those scenes?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,759
There are so many fog.

33
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,800
Take a heavy burden and embark on a long road

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,280
how can I evacuate at this moment?

35
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:38,879
If we don't evacuate,

36
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
how can your identity be secure?

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,759
Even if Zuo Shuangtao knows about my identity,

38
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,199
she'll never betray me.

39
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,039
This concerns not only your personal safety,

40
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,000
but also the information,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
and the organization's safety.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
How can you guarantee that the information you get

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
won't be discovered by Zuo Shuangtao?

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
If the intelligence falls into the hands

45
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,280
gets hold of the organization behind her,

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,800
how can you guarantee that

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,479
nothing will be against us?

48
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,159
And

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,560
we still don't know

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,599
who they are.

51
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,879
The Central Command

52
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
the anti-Japanese anti-espionage group.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
These organizations have a very complicated

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,240
with the enemy.

55
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,039
There are many

56
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,879
and double-faced.

57
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,960
Juntong has sold out

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
to No. 76.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,280
You should know.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,120
Even if Zuo Shuangtao doesn't betray you,

61
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,199
but her organization...

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,199
Previously, I...

63
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,199
And the most important one is...

64
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,840
This is an order

65
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,039
yes

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
mrs. Chen,

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
with Chief Chen?

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
You're a newcomer.

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
She just started to work.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
Of course I had to come earlier.

71
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,879
It's not like him.

72
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,879
Old fox.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,039
You

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,680
did you come to work

75
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,919
Is Ms. Luo here?

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,960
Yes, I'm here.

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,840
Alright.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,680
I'll talk to him.

79
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,759
To work?

80
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,439
Come here.

81
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:25,879
Manager Luo.

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,639
Manager

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,319
fangfang,

84
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,480
from today on,

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,800
you don't have to work so hard.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm holding two jobs.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,040
You'll only be in charge

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
of the archive room

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,040
please?

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,879
What?

91
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,279
From now on,

92
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,360
miss Zuo is the accountant

93
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
of the Finance Office?

94
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,839
What?

95
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,560
Why?

96
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,079
She studies finance in the university

97
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,839
we need an accountant too.

98
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,079
This is something called

99
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,480
life is at its best.

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,879
You should put your knowledge to use.

101
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,879
I don't agree.

102
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,160
You didn't ask her to do the accounting.

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,680
I don't think I need your approval for this, right?

104
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,120
No, Luo Guanqun.

105
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,120
I was doing well.

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
Why should she replace me?

107
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,439
Right, Manager Luo.

108
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,240
You asked me to

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,120
to work with Fang Fang?

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,639
Why am I replacing her?

111
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,360
Don't pretend.

112
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,560
I think you're the one

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,920
to use your uncle's benevolent influence

114
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,439
to pressure him.

115
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,839
I can...

116
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,560
That's right.

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,759
I am here to replace you.

118
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,480
You're not convinced?

119
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,519
Alright, alright.

120
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,160
You see, we haven't worked together yet.

121
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,680
That's it.

122
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Will I let you work together?

123
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,439
Make sure to finish this handover

124
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,160
before you get off work.

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,959
How come Captain Zhao

126
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,680
become Commander recently?

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,120
But I can't see Erban Dao and Feng Qi either.

128
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,680
Feng Qi seems to be on a secret mission.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,120
Even Second Boss went out.

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,040
I don't know where she went.

131
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,879
He just came back.

132
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,800
Xiucai Qian,

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,759
aren't you usually holding your

134
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,399
of the Eastern Zhou States?

135
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,600
So clear on the traces

136
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,560
the people in the firm?

137
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,000
Isn't this small business

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,879
Is just a book of the states of Eastern Zhou Dynasty.

139
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,199
Did you not expect that

140
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,959
that I'd be sitting here having dinner?

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,120
To understand what Captain Zhao is talking about.

142
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,279
I know you're scared.

143
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,920
It's fine.

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,839
I just want to tell you that

145
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,800
I, Zhao An,

146
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,680
I won't fall so easily.

147
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,199
Mrs. Luo.

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
-Mrs. Luo. -Mrs. Luo.

149
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,079
Take your time then

150
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,279
I'll leave now.

151
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,279
Our firm...

152
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,440
The canteen's food was delicious back then,

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,399
but after Mr. Luo's relatives signed the contract,

154
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,919
as before.

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,279
That's why

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,519
those who rely on themselves

157
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,200
to squeeze others out.

158
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
He's the most disgraceful.

159
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
Who are you talking about?

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Pointing finger at someone while hinting another person.

161
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,000
Make it clear!

162
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,360
Alright.

163
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,559
It's you.

164
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,320
Your grades of finance major in university

165
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,519
how could I not know?

166
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,759
How could you not pass the exam?

167
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,840
Why did you replace Lu Fang Fang?

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,639
He used to be in charge of the concession affairs

169
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,120
so as long as we follow the clue Cold Dew

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,919
of Cold Dew

171
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
chief Chen

172
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,200
why aren't you eating?

173
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,639
Switch tables?

174
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,799
Captain Zhao.

175
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,960
Do you want some advice?

176
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Advice?

177
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,840
My piece of advice is,

178
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,960
never trust a woman before marriage.

179
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,279
Everything cast before marriage is cute.

180
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,000
After marriage, it's all wild

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,559
chief Chen

182
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,360
don't worry

183
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,600
captain Zhao doesn't date women before he got married,

184
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
shut your mouth.

185
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Who are you calling wild?

186
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,279
I'm chatting with Captain Zhao here.

187
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,360
Why did you interrupt?

188
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,039
Besides, did I scold you?

189
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,600
Captain Zhao, enjoy the meal.

190
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,519
I'm leaving.

191
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,440
Don't leave.

192
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Why won't I leave?

193
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,440
I haven't made that clear yet.

194
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,320
Don't bother you with my steps.

195
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,279
I'll follow you.

196
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,200
The cold dew.

197
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,360
What are you on your business trip?

198
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
How come Cold Dew is involved?

199
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,840
Shuangtao, I'll leave now.

200
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,480
See you tomorrow.

201
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Miss Zuo.

202
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm glad to be your colleague.

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm new.

204
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,000
Please help me in the future.

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,919
How can I help you?

206
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,759
I heard

207
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,480
you quarreled with Chen Jiaping.

208
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,399
What?

209
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,639
Isn't it normal

210
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,879
for a couple to quarrel?

211
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,240
Miss Zuo.

212
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,759
Actually,

213
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,240
It's late. Why are you still working?

214
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,519
Miss Zuo.

215
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,919
In fact, my love for you

216
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
has never changed.

217
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,240
Are you alright?

218
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,120
Although

219
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,720
have you got married?

220
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,879
But that's OK.

221
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,799
We can still start over.

222
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,080
Do you think that's possible?

223
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,080
Nothing is impossible

224
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
nothing is impossible.

225
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,279
You two, wait up.

226
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,240
What are you doing?

227
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,600
It's an emergency.

228
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,039
Hold on, hold on.

229
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,919
Why are you running?

230
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,080
No, sir.

231
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,440
Do we have any problem?

232
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,840
Not at all.

233
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
I happen to be on patrol

234
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,440
and I was just passing by.

235
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,240
I want to remind you two,

236
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,840
to stop running in the French Concession

237
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,000
In case you might frighten the other citizens

238
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,720
the French Concession is not safe anymore

239
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,120
they are indeed safe

240
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,600
but I don't think

241
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,480
to you two.

242
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,480
Please leave.

243
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,679
Do you know them?

244
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,759
I know them very well.

245
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,279
One of my colleagues in the firm

246
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,399
one's called Feng Qi.

247
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,480
The other is Chen Gangmu.

248
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,679
He works for Zhao An.

249
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,759
What are you going to do next?

250
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,279
Come on.

251
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Chen Jiaping,

252
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,720
you robbed banks and stole documents

253
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,519
I believed you when you said you were going to fight against Japan.

254
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,159
How is it anti-Japanese to stalk a female star?

255
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,399
Last time, Feng Qi wanted to assassinate

256
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,519
the Japanese delegate to the secret peace talks.

257
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,200
Now he followed Han Lu.

258
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,120
Does Cold Lu have something to do with the secret peace talk?

259
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,639
She's back.

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,919
What brought you here?

261
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,960
I'm here to see you.

262
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,399
Have a seat.

263
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,879
What's the matter?

264
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,399
I came here

265
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,679
to get your forgiveness.

266
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,919
It doesn't matter.

267
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,360
Even now, I don't think it's important.

268
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,279
Besides, in your life,

269
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
love is only seasoning.

270
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,679
To climb the official ladder

271
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,879
Is your main course.

272
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,759
What a surprise.

273
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,919
You've never changed

274
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,559
for all these years.

275
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,120
The way you speak.

276
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,360
When you speak.

277
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,039
What do you want me to say then?

278
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,960
You said you would love me for the rest of your life,

279
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,440
but once I became a director,

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
you can leave me when I'm sick

281
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,399
from Shanghai to Nanjing overnight.

282
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,279
Listen to my explanation.

283
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm tired.

284
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,200
If you don't have anything else,

285
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,960
I want to take a shower.

286
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,960
I want to ask you a favor.

287
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,200
What's it?

288
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,759
Rent an apartment for me.

289
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,399
Why me?

290
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,759
Because you

291
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,200
the one I trust the most

292
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,279
In my life.

293
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,759
You know what?

294
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,320
Every time

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,279
each and every little thing between us,

296
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,679
I still feel that

297
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,600
It's the happiest

298
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
the happiest

299
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,480
the happiest moment

300
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,919
tomorrow at 9 p.m.,

301
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,360
and I will call you there.

302
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,400
Are we fighting the war

303
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,759
or newspaper reporters?

304
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,359
There are so many people going in and out.

305
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,599
See that?

306
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,960
That man

307
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,519
from Han Lu's house.

308
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,599
What brings you here?

309
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,720
Miss Cold Dew.

310
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm very sorry.

311
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,119
For showing up so suddenly.

312
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,599
However,

313
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,720
for the sake of your safety,

314
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,839
I hope you can answer me a question.

315
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,920
Did your an important friend

316
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,079
who visited you?

317
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,559
No, I didn't.

318
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,759
After I came back from the filming site,

319
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,160
I've been staying home alone.

320
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,000
The thing is, Miss Han Lu.

321
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,599
What about you and your friend?

322
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,039
Might be in danger.

323
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,000
So, only if you tell me his identity

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,079
his purpose of coming to Shanghai

325
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,759
and where I can find him.

326
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,680
Can I help you.

327
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,839
I told you that

328
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,160
no friend has ever come to see me.

329
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,079
I hope you can

330
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,839
can trust me as before.

331
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,480
Sorry.

332
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm really tired today.

333
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,279
I want to rest.

334
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,000
Is there anything else?

335
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,480
Can you sign it for me?

336
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,039
Of course, please.

337
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,039
Thank you.

338
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,079
Where is he running wild?

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,359
You are back so late.

340
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,359
Since you can decide your own things,

341
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,319
and not listen to me,

342
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,599
then where should I go?

343
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,319
Do I not have to report to you?

344
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,599
That's my question.

345
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,559
Hey!

346
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,559
Get out of here.

347
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,079
Where did you go?

348
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,559
Why did you come so late?

349
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:04,880
Get out of the way.

350
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,839
I want to sleep.

351
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,400
I won't sleep in the room.

352
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,640
I'll sleep on the sofa.

353
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,319
You went to look for Cold Dew?

354
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,559
The nation is in peril.

355
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,759
And families are at odds.

356
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,519
Only unreal idol stars

357
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,240
can bring me any happiness.

358
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,559
Shameless!

359
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,920
Coward!

360
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,039
And have no taste.

361
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,640
Shame on you!

362
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,480
If Zuo Shuangtao was really a lurker,

363
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,079
every abnormal behavior of mine

364
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,200
for every slight abnormality of mine.

365
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,359
If there's a flaw in the secret,

366
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,480
she'll eventually find the flaw.

367
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
Would we have to

368
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,440
give up the mission and leave?

369
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,759
Or is there any other way

370
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,200
to make Guoguo leave voluntarily?

371
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,759
What exactly

372
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,359
that she has lurked in?

373
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,079
I'm here today

374
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,519
because I really don't know how to do.

375
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,599
But I didn't even have a man who was really honest.

376
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,039
The only mother I could trust.

377
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
When I was a teenager,

378
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,039
when I was a teenager.

379
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,720
The day after she passed away,

380
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
she sold me

381
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,599
she sold me to a landlord

382
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,599
to be his concubine.

383
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
I got pregnant with his child very quickly.

384
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,359
I think this is good.

385
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,000
We can be with each other as mother and son

386
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,400
and live the rest of our life like this.

387
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,720
And steady.

388
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,960
But in order to run his business,

389
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,160
he forced me to abort the child.

390
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,519
And treated me as his little daughter

391
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,279
and gave it to Luo Guanqun.

392
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,119
I don't want anything else.

393
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,519
I'm alone in this world

394
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,759
I only want to live a stable life

395
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,200
In Shanghai.

396
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,839
I can marry anyone.

397
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,240
Miss Zuo.

398
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,200
Please call me Mrs. Chen.

399
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,880
In my heart,

400
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,599
you are always just Ms. Zuo.

401
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,400
Because I know that

402
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,960
that your so-called wedding

403
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,400
was just your way to get the secret letter

404
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,880
to get the secret letter in the button!

405
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,519
The button.

406
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,680
It's with me.

407
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,079
Mr. Yamashita.

408
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,799
Mr. Yamashita.

409
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,519
What's this?

410
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,720
The secret message for the button

411
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,319
was double-encrypted.

412
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,440
Even the Japanese secret service

413
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,559
were at a loss.

414
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,079
No one could decipher them.

415
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
No one can decipher it

416
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,400
so you knew about my identity.

417
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,440
From the day you found out I hid the telegraph,

418
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,519
I knew that

419
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,599
I can't accept that

420
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,720
I'm as stupid as Chen Jiaping.

421
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,960
To be cheated by you.

422
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,720
You're so full of yourself.

423
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,079
You used to be,

424
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,920
and still is.

425
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,119
That's why

426
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,119
I admired you more.

427
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,559
So that's how you express your admiration?

428
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:29,960
I know that

429
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,240
the way I'm doing it now,

430
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,839
you'll think

431
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,279
to threaten you.

432
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,480
But I have to do it.

433
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
Only then

434
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,000
can we have more time together.

435
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,319
I don't want to lose you.

436
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,279
I won't miss you either.

437
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,480
You said so much.

438
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,960
Tell me your conditions.

439
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,720
Very simple.

440
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,200
And divorced Chen Jiaping.

441
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,880
It's impossible.

442
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,000
Why is it impossible?

443
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,160
Your marriage was a fraud!

444
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,920
You don't love him at all.

445
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,599
If you can get the contents

446
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,960
obtained the contents of the secret letter,

447
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,279
you would've abandoned him and left.

448
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:09,880
Am I right?

449
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,119
If I divorce Chen Jiaping,

450
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,319
I must arouse Zhao An and Luo Guanqun's suspicion.

451
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
You don't want them to get me, do you?

452
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,039
That's right.

453
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,400
However,

454
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,720
we can still be together

455
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,480
we'll still be together.

456
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,640
We can date secretly.

457
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,799
How do you want to have a date?

458
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,799
I want something

459
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,640
slowly.

460
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,160
And gradually.

461
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,720
I don't just want a

462
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,559
the result.

463
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,119
I want the whole process.

464
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,400
From the first encounter

465
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,480
to knowing each other,

466
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
♪ We know each other ♪

467
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,279
♪ And finally fall in love ♪

468
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,160
As long as you follow my instructions,

469
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,240
I will give you the thing you want.

470
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,640
You will

471
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,640
and you will fall in love with me.

472
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,880
But why should I believe

473
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,920
that it's in your hand?

474
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,240
Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon,

475
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,079
qin Card Cafe on Xiafei Road,

476
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,799
this is

477
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,839
Is a special place.

478
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,279
I will bring the things you want

479
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,160
and wait for you there.

480
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,599
Don't tell anyone that

481
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,200
I've told Lu Fangfang about this.

482
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,279
Why did you tell her?

483
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,519
Don't be angry.

484
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,759
If I didn't tell Lu Fangfang,

485
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,079
If I didn't tell Lu Fangfang?

486
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,079
Gao Fang has a crush on Zuo Shuangtao?

487
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,720
Besides that,

488
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,079
I only said that I saw them being together.

489
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
They are dating again

490
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,319
tomorrow in the cafe.

491
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,839
Then I'll stop talking.

492
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,680
Did you hear what Gao Fang

493
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,079
gao Fang threatened Zuo Shuangtao with something?

494
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,000
He saw a snake

495
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,839
and there appeared a snake

496
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,079
I was so scared to death.

497
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,920
So I didn't hear clearly

498
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,559
I didn't hear it clearly.

499
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,640
Maybe I know

500
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,920
what it is?

501
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,720
Lu Fangfang,

502
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,400
for which month's statement do you want me to check?

503
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,880
Why close the door?

504
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,920
Sit down, I have something to tell you.

505
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,400
Have a seat.

506
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,119
What's the matter?

507
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,519
So mysterious.

508
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,359
Did you have a quarrel with your wife?

509
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,200
How did you know that?

510
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,640
Let me tell you something.

511
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,440
Don't blame me for talking too much.

512
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,839
What is it?

513
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,200
This morning,

514
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,559
zhaofeng Park.

515
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,519
Your wife?

516
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,640
With Gao Fang on a date.

517
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,039
You saw that?

518
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,039
I heard it.

519
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,480
Who told you that?

520
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Zhang Shuyun saw it with her own eyes.

521
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,359
What?

522
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,440
Why do my wife stay with Gao?

523
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,680
Anyway,

524
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,119
gao Fang held your wife's hand.

525
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,799
He even held my wife's hand.

526
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,200
She didn't resist.

527
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,519
Well, they even...

528
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,799
Even said anything about it?

529
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,559
I don't know.

530
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,400
Zhang Shuyun told me that.

531
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,599
I'm not trying to incite you.

532
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,880
I think

533
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,079
I don't think these peaches are too extravagant.

534
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,519
She's probably mad at you.

535
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,319
Please talk to her nicely.

536
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,519
That's how women are.

537
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,720
To give her an out.

538
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,880
Otherwise,

539
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,000
this fake play

540
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,559
might be real.

541
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,039
Gao Fang.

542
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,039
Hey.

543
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,759
Hey!

544
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,960
Is this Chief Chen?

545
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
Who is this?

546
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,279
I'm from Yumo Calligraphy and Painting.

547
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,119
My last name is Lu.

548
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,839
Boss Lu,

549
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,839
nice to meet you.

550
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,680
Nice to meet you.

551
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,359
The Dragon Tail Inkstone Platform you urgently needed

552
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,519
has arrived.

553
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,200
Alright.

554
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,119
I'll get it right away.

555
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,400
No one

556
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
Is this information accurate?

557
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,319
This is the information

558
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,359
from Juntong.

559
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,200
Is accurate.

560
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
Left Shuangtao was born in the 28th year of the Republic

561
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,119
the Military Su Zhe Action Committee

562
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,720
this was the introducer.

563
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,559
The Liu Wuchang.

564
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,839
Her mission to Shanghai this time

565
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,559
to kill the warrior under the mountain.

566
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,920
In fact,

567
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,440
there was a secret letter

568
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,640
fell into the hands of the martial man of the mountain.

569
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,839
I should have thought of it.

570
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,519
Those assassinations at the railway station and wedding

571
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,720
and Zuo Shuangtao did all these.

572
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,440
All kinds of doubts about her before

573
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
have an explanation now.

574
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,480
I thought I used her to cover me.

575
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,960
But she was also using me

576
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
to cover herself.

577
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,559
Don't blame yourself.

578
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,079
Now all you have to do is evacuate immediately.

579
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,680
I know

580
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,519
you're unwilling.

581
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,680
But we need to consider it.

582
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,920
I need to find a right reason

583
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,279
for you to leave.

584
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,839
So that when there's an opportunity in the future,

585
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,480
you can return to the firm.

586
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,799
What's the reason to leave?

587
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,920
You need to make Luo Guanqun think it's reasonable

588
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,599
and to ensure that Guoguo is not suspected.

589
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,960
What about this place?

590
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,839
Come on.

591
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:16,680
Watch this.

592
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,599
Do you think Gao Fang

593
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,960
will threaten Zuo Shuangtao?

594
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,839
Threaten him?

595
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,880
Is it a romantic photo?

596
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,119
Kimura once said that

597
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,279
after Colonel Shanxia was assassinated,

598
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,480
the secret letter he always carried

599
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,599
disappeared.

600
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,440
They thought Kun took it.

601
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,319
But now

602
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,039
and be not so

603
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,039
captain Zhao.

604
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,319
What happened?

605
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,519
Was assassinated.

606
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,039
Then ask for help!

607
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,599
I'll stop the bleeding.

608
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,640
Hurry up.

609
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,960
Zuo Shuangtao might have taken the secret letter.

610
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,119
But then

611
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,759
something happened.

612
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,279
Are you suspecting that Gao Fang threatened Zuo Shuangtao's things?

613
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,519
It's Juntong's secret letter.

614
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,200
I wanted to hear Kimura's message,

615
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,640
don't look into Zuo Shuangtao anymore.

616
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,079
But you know what?

617
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,119
I'm like a shark in the deep sea.

618
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,480
I could smell the blood

619
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
I can smell blood wherever I swim.

620
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,640
And the smell of blood

621
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,839
left Shuangtao around the smell of blood.

622
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,960
Would I be willing to die?

623
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,119
Got it?

624
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,159
Got it?

625
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,320
Repeat.

626
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,840
After meeting Gao Fang at Qinka Cafe,

627
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,360
first confirm the secret letter in your hand.

628
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,880
And find a chance to poison the coffee.

629
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,639
This medicine

630
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,000
and works 5 minutes after taking it.

631
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,280
The symptom is like a heart attack.

632
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,760
You just have to wait for the poison to take effect,

633
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
take him to the hospital.

634
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,039
In this case, even if someone sees you dating Gao Fang,

635
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,639
you won't be a suspect for murder.

636
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,000
Why?

637
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,920
What?

638
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,639
Why do you have to solve

639
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,800
solve every problem?

640
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,960
When you first suspected Chen Jia Ping,

641
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,000
In the beginning,

642
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,760
but in the end,

643
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,599
because of Gao Fang.

644
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,599
Now he knows Gao Fang has the secret letter,

645
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,480
and killed them without hesitation.

646
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,440
You want to disobey orders again, right?

647
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll go to the cafe today.

648
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,440
If anything happens,

649
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,760
I'll help you in time.

650
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,079
That's spying on me.

651
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,519
Is it really that nice?

652
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:31,800
Waiter/Waitress

653
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,280
take the order.

654
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,079
Brother,

655
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,199
both of them are here.

656
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,840
If it's the secret letter in Gao Fang's hand.

657
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,199
The truth will be revealed soon.

658
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,000
Hello, sir.

659
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,639
Two cups of latte, please.

660
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,079
Alright.

661
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,920
The latte here is excellent.

662
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,519
However,

663
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,679
I haven't been here for a long time.

664
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,079
I wonder if the smell has changed.

665
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,239
Did you bring the secret letter?

666
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,119
Now you believe it?

667
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:15,800
Brother,

668
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Is that paper the secret letter?

669
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,440
I couldn't read it clearly

670
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,639
but I think

671
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,559
yes

672
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,159
should we arrest him?

673
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
What's the hurry?

674
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,000
They can't run away.

675
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,239
Let's see what they are doing.

676
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,679
You didn't change at all.

677
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,880
Sir, here's your coffee.

678
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,440
Thank you.

679
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,800
It seems that you and this cafe have many stories.

680
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,000
My first love.

681
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,920
She loved the latte from this restaurant.

682
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,960
We often come here together.

683
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,239
But that

684
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,480
that was three years ago.

685
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,280
You loved her very much.

686
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,760
I'm willing to die for her.

687
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,920
Then why aren't you

688
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,400
you two stay apart?

689
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,039
She died.

690
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,840
I was willing to die for her.

691
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,320
But I've never expected

692
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,559
she died because of me.

693
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,599
It's my fault.

694
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,320
That I had built myself

695
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,360
I used the listening device I made

696
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,199
to eavesdrop on the Japanese.

697
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,480
They will launch an air raid on Shanghai three days later.

698
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,639
That's my first love.

699
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,880
They planned to evacuate the same night.

700
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,239
But she firmly believed

701
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,559
the code I decoded,

702
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,679
and postponed the evacuation plan.

703
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,679
But on the night,

704
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,280
the Japanese conducted air raid on Shanghai.

705
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,360
I first loved them.

706
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,079
Her death was due to me.

707
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,199
You must hate the Japanese.

708
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,960
Why do you work for them?

709
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,440
I don't work for the Japanese.

710
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,199
I just want to learn the most advanced decoding technology

711
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,599
so you like me

712
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,159
Is it because I look like her?

713
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,000
Yes

714
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,039
you both are very similar.

715
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,360
Because of my family,

716
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,480
I used to be a taciturn person.

717
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,159
But after I met her,

718
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,119
she told me

719
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,119
to be happy in life.

720
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,800
And spread it

721
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,880
and spread it to those around me.

722
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,920
I won't make the same mistake twice.

723
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,039
I will protect you.

724
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,800
You don't show love to me,

725
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,159
It's self-redemption.

726
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,519
That's love.

727
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,639
I know it better than you.

728
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,599
Sorry.

729
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,760
I'm going to the bathroom.

730
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,360
Brother.

731
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,599
Arrest them?

732
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,800
What are we waiting for?

733
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,079
Do you think if Gao Fang really threatened Zuo Shuangtao?

734
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:12,079
Left Shuangtao would be captured?

735
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,199
With our style,

736
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:18,119
we'd surely kill them to keep them quiet.

737
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,639
So it's no rush.

738
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,960
Maybe there's a big surprise later.

739
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,480
This medicine

740
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,800
and works 5 minutes after taking it.

741
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,239
The symptom is like a heart attack.

742
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,400
To be honest,

743
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,000
I don't like their latte.

744
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,760
It's a little bitter.

745
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,760
How about

746
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,519
let me put in a piece of candy for you.

747
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,960
Did you see what

748
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,679
what is in Zuo Shuangtao's hand?

749
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,679
I saw it.

750
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,199
It should be candy.

751
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,679
Besides candy?

752
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,559
Other than candy?

753
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,559
There's more.

754
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,199
Drink it quickly.

755
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:35,920
It's getting cold.

756
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,519
See?

757
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,639
I don't like latte in their shop.

758
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,360
So your first love and I

759
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:01,199
two completely different people.

760
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,159
I know a Cantonese sugar-water shop nearby.

761
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,000
The food is very delicious.

762
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,119
Actually, I prefer the one with rock sugar and snow pear today.

763
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,000
Sorry.

764
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,480
I want to stay a little longer.

765
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,079
It's strange.

766
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,760
Why is it so quiet?

767
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:18,920
Brother.

768
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,400
It seems Zuo Shuangtao

769
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,280
left Shuangtao didn't do anything to resist.

770
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,280
Be ready to arrest them.

771
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,360
If five minutes have passed,

772
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,800
gao Fang still hasn't released his poison,

773
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,320
liu Wuchang will surely take action.

774
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,559
Gao Fang can't escape this fate.

775
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:10,840
We must take Gao Fang out of the cafe first.

776
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,039
While Liu Wuchang is hesitant,

777
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
gao Fang has the chance to escape.

778
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,239
Gao Fang.

779
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,599
If you really want to start a relationship with me,

780
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,239
you should not let us indulge in the memories

781
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:22,960
with the memories of your first love.

782
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,679
You are right.

783
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,360
Waiter/Waitress

784
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,960
bill, please.

785
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:38,800
Brother,

786
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,440
they're leaving.

787
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,280
Arrest them.

788
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:45,760
Miss Zuo.

789
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,239
Wait for me.

790
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:15,320
Gao Fang!

791
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Get out of here!

792
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,519
Alright.

793
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Alright.
