1
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,159
Without a passport,

2
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,640
and attempted to bribe the public servants

3
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,680
I suspect you are scheming

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,879
engage in illegal activities

5
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,319
come!

6
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,599
Bring them down.

7
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,159
Search them.

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Get down. Come down.

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,480
Come down.

10
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,359
Two knives have been found.

11
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,879
Captain Zhao,

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,079
and brought an unregistered firearm.

13
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,239
You are doubly guilty

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,519
detective

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,680
you know my job

16
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,439
It's for self-defense

17
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,400
we never cause trouble in the concession.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,039
Captain Zhao,

19
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,319
you don't know anything?

20
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,680
French Concession is flooded with guns recently

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
many murders recently.

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Wen Wei Wei's Evening News,

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,199
got thrown by hand grenades.

24
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,360
How come you brought so many weapons?

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,919
How can you say that you're not here to make trouble?

26
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,240
It was done by No. 76.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,879
It has nothing to do with us.

28
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm a businessman.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
I can do small business.

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,039
For business.

31
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,120
That won't be a problem.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,479
Come with me

33
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,120
come with me to the police station to register

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
you can get a passport

35
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,599
It's urgent.

36
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,719
Just a excuse.

37
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,520
You'll need me next time.

38
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,680
Make an exception.

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,120
Thank you.

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,879
Alright.

41
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,479
Thanks.

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Brothers.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,759
Listen up, I'll tell you.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
This is my good buddy.

45
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
Don't handcuff them later.

46
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,319
Got it?

47
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,759
Got it.

48
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,639
You are accommodating enough?

49
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,680
Take her away.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,520
Just go.

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,319
I'll leave on my own.

52
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,840
Come on.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
Take them inside.

54
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,840
Hello

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,759
sheriff Clement.

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,479
Come on.

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,919
Brother.

58
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,840
I think I've seen this foreigner before.

59
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,560
Come to register.

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,319
Whose dagger is it?

61
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,439
It's mine.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,840
What's your name?

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,639
Two Swords.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,719
Wang Hanlong!

65
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,800
Where's the spear?

66
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,719
Zhao An.

67
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,400
Captain Zhao.

68
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,680
Your bag.

69
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,759
There are personal letters inside.

70
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,879
Please take them.

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,759
This place is much safer than a bank.

72
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,599
Don't worry.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,240
Hurry up!

74
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Take you to the detention room.

75
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,840
Go, please.

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
Watch this.

77
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,680
Where's the tag?

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Why are you pushing me?

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Are you out of your mind?

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,519
Here you are.

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,519
Great.

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,639
This is broken.

83
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,800
This is sealed with pewter wax.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,000
How long will it take?

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,879
Melt and take photos before cooling.

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,360
40 to 50 minutes.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,959
I can hang on for 30 minutes at most.

88
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,519
Do it as soon as possible.

89
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,959
Captain Zhao.

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,279
To fill out this form.

91
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,040
And after that,

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,639
you can leave with a seal

93
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,480
and you can leave.

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,160
Come on.

95
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,959
What do you mean?

96
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,839
Where is the pen?

97
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,920
A pen.

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,079
Pens?

99
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,199
You didn't bring any pens?

100
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,759
You've collected the things

101
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,759
oh, Detective Ye

102
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,600
don't you have any pens?

103
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,879
Sorry about that.

104
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,160
Then...

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,199
What should we do?

106
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,560
I'll go and find you

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
thank you for your hard work.

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,759
Serving the public

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,519
hurry up!

110
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Captain Zhao.

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,000
Hold on.

112
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,240
Captain Zhao.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,160
What do you mean?

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,800
Where is the water?

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Water?

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,439
There's no water.

117
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,920
There's no water.

118
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,680
We had water in the morning.

119
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,759
We really ran out of water.

120
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,560
There was still water in the morning.

121
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,839
Stop it.

122
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,000
There's only one pen.

123
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,519
Wait. That's impossible.

124
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,639
There must be water.

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,720
Get another pen.

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
Get another pen.

127
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,519
Get a few more pens.

128
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,079
Pens and caps.

129
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Thank you.

130
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,199
Captain Zhao.

131
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,839
Hold on.

132
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,079
What kind of pen is this?

133
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,079
That's right.

134
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,560
What pen?

135
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,879
I'm sure it's good this time.

136
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Hurry up.

137
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,159
There, there.

138
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,159
This...

139
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Detective

140
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,759
this is not something we should fill out

141
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,320
aren't you going to stay in French Concession temporarily?

142
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,759
Who's staying here?

143
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,080
Why are we staying here?

144
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,480
Detective

145
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,799
just passed by?

146
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,679
Just passed by in 20 minutes.

147
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,639
Just passing by.

148
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,879
Just 20 minutes?

149
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,000
Just 20 minutes?

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,080
Please, please.

151
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,440
It's okay if you don't want to stay.

152
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,200
There's something wrong.

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
Sorry.

154
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,480
Don't fill this out.

155
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll get a stamp from the traffic department

156
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,840
and get a seal on it.

157
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,639
Stop being embarrassing, okay?

158
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,360
Can you hurry up?

159
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,519
Brother.

160
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,120
Scram!

161
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,919
Stop pacing in front of me.

162
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,039
Alright?

163
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,600
All right.

164
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,960
Alright?

165
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,480
Scram!

166
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,720
Chief.

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,320
Hold on.

168
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,600
What?

169
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,159
-Don't touch me, right? -Is that enough?

170
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,159
Alright, alright.

171
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,159
Don't talk to me!

172
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,720
Do you have guns?

173
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,000
You just left?

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,600
That's right.

175
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,279
Captain Zhao. Leader Zhao.

176
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,519
You reminded me, Captain Zhao.

177
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,480
If you bring guns,

178
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,759
you have to fill in

179
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,120
weapons Permit Application Form. Captain Zhao.

180
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
Do you think that's enough?

181
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,000
Chief Zhao.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,080
Please wait.

183
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,360
Wait!

184
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,039
I'm running out of time.

185
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,000
If this goes on,

186
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
If we can't make it to the meeting,

187
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,279
If we can't

188
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,080
hand the file to Kimura,

189
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,360
we will be dead.

190
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,480
Please.

191
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,320
It's not our brothers.

192
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,559
It was you.

193
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,320
Brother.

194
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,480
Aren't you my younger brother?

195
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,960
Tell me that

196
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,480
Is he really my brother?

197
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,279
That's right.

198
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,120
If you deny it,

199
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
I'll shoot you to death.

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,799
It's my fault.

201
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,919
That's right.

202
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,039
Darn it!

203
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,720
Captain Zhao.

204
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,799
I followed the rules.

205
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,159
Don't be angry with me.

206
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,919
That's useless.

207
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,759
Keep that in mind.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,399
Seal it

209
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,639
on the ceremony.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,519
Almost done

211
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,000
or is she really shy?

212
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,240
This application form

213
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,200
needs Chief Li's signature

214
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,879
but Section Chief Li is not here

215
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
you'll have to wait a bit.

216
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,519
It'll be soon.

217
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,519
Hold on.

218
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,519
Brother.

219
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,799
That's not right.

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
Something is wrong with him.

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,279
That's right.

222
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,039
He's got serious problems.

223
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,240
We're working for the Japanese,

224
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,639
and he works for the French?

225
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,639
Are all dogs.

226
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,360
Why are you making things difficult for us?

227
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,759
Brother,

228
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,720
I remembered that

229
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,360
where I met that foreigner.

230
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,799
How is it?

231
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,080
The horse is riding.

232
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,279
They can't be suppressed.

233
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,200
Waiting for it to cool down.

234
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,919
A few minutes.

235
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,960
This is the French Concession,

236
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,559
you can't go in there

237
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,840
get out of our way.

238
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,080
Captain Zhao

239
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,159
section Chief Li will be right back

240
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:07,960
captain Zhao.

241
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Inspector Clermont.

242
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm from Taihe Trading Firm.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,679
You may not know me,

244
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,799
but I know that

245
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,960
you bought two boxes of opium ointment from me.

246
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,840
Near the Archbishop Road.

247
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,559
Do you remember that?

248
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,919
Sheriff Clement.

249
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,799
The man broke into the concession with a weapon

250
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,919
I am going through the formalities for him.

251
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,559
Close the door.

252
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,440
Yes

253
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,639
this is Captain Zhao.

254
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,879
He is my good friend.

255
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
You're mistaken

256
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,960
return his things to him immediately.

257
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,279
And send him back to the parking lot.

258
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,720
Yes

259
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
thank you, Clement.

260
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,519
Sheriff Clermans.

261
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,240
I'll get the car key in my room.

262
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,639
Captain Zhao is in a rush.

263
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,200
Drive my car.

264
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,320
And help him clean it up.

265
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,039
Come on.

266
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,720
Take out my things.

267
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,279
Hurry up!

268
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,480
Return Captain Zhao's things to him.

269
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,559
Thank you, Clement.

270
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,279
Captain Zhao.

271
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,080
Take a look

272
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,000
are your things still there?

273
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,159
They are.

274
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,080
Captain Zhao.

275
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,360
When were you early?

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,720
Two o'clock.

277
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
We'll be late. Let's go!

278
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,480
Brother!

279
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Gun. Gun.

280
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
It won't be as fast as my car.

281
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,840
Hey!

282
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:48,679
Here they are.

283
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,360
Captain Zhao.

284
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,120
Where's the car?

285
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,639
Slowly.

286
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,159
Can I drive?

287
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,159
Captain Zhao.

288
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,000
See you later.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
See you later.

290
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,480
Captain Zhao.

291
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
The bride's feet can't touch the ground.

292
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,440
The groom has to carry the bride off the carriage.

293
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,559
Good.

294
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,799
I can carry everything.

295
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,680
What do you mean by "carry everything"?

296
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,480
As if I'm so fat.

297
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I didn't mean that.

298
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,400
I was wrong.

299
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,200
I hope my bride

300
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,599
could give me a lifetime

301
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,440
to make up for my mistakes.

302
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,039
What are you doing?

303
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,480
I want to hold you.

304
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,240
And if I do not see your face

305
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,759
If I don't see your face.

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,079
From now on,

307
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,440
I don't want to miss every expression on your face.

308
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,000
I will share your happiness

309
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,079
and sorrow,

310
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,480
with you,

311
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,839
and sorrow.

312
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,319
Married!

313
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,759
Have you got a plan?

314
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,799
How do you plan to kill the warrior under the mountain?

315
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,839
A serrated knife.

316
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,880
The warrior will be killed with a serrated knife.

317
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,920
What's the plan?

318
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,960
Where is the knife hidden?

319
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200
When to start it.

320
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
And how to evacuate later.

321
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,680
Don't worry.

322
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,119
I've arranged everything.

323
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,480
After your operation is successful,

324
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,519
go to Pier 16

325
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,519
I'll wait for you there.

326
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,200
I'll arrange the boat

327
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,559
and send you to Jiaxing for temporary shelter.

328
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
When you finish the mission,

329
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,319
you can kill this traitor!

330
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,359
Brother!

331
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,240
Where's Kun?

332
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,759
He's locked in the storage room on the second floor.

333
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,039
There is a window there

334
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,559
where you can overlook the whole scene.

335
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,000
Take me there.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,640
Alright.

337
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Kun!

338
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,920
Later you'll see

339
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,200
your beloved woman

340
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,319
Is going to marry another man.

341
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,559
A traitor and dog you hate the most.

342
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,799
It's fine.

343
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,279
When you see it,

344
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,440
you think about it if it's worth it?

345
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,920
You protected

346
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,279
to protect a woman

347
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,359
a woman who betrayed your faith?

348
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,720
To betray your people?

349
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,720
The Commander below the mountain.

350
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,559
Kun was taken to the wedding venue by us.

351
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,759
If Kun and Zuo Shuangtao are together,

352
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,279
left Shuangtao must have had contact with you at the scene.

353
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,200
That's why...

354
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,119
We've placed the snipers on the second floor

355
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,799
keep an eye on Left Shuangtao at all times

356
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,519
to make sure you're not in danger.

357
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,599
You still need to be aware of

358
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,000
for Shan Ren.

359
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,079
That day.

360
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,319
And there are reporters on the scene.

361
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,079
It's a bad influence to us.

362
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,000
Once we confirm that Left Shuangtao is the assassin,

363
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,680
settle it after the wedding.

364
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,640
Yes

365
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,880
there's one thing.

366
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,319
I don't know if you've heard.

367
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,559
The Prime Minister of the Guards

368
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,880
seeking peace talks with Chongqing.

369
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,880
Peace talks?

370
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,240
Chiang Kai-shek has retreated to Chongqing.

371
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
He can't compete with us at all.

372
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,920
We can negotiate under such circumstances.

373
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,200
If we want to continue our war in East Asia,

374
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
and then a war against the US will be inevitable.

375
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,680
The Prime Minister is under pressure

376
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,440
to end the East Asian War as soon as possible

377
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,759
and keep what we've achieved.

378
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,799
In that case,

379
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,920
the influence of our military

380
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,079
our military's influence.

381
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,640
Exactly.

382
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,440
We must try our best

383
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,240
to make the peace talk end in failure.

384
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,559
I leave the task

385
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,839
Is entrusted to you.

386
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,039
Yes

387
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,000
today, I, Chen Jiaping,

388
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,160
officially marries Zuo Shuangtao.

389
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,200
I will always be loyal to you,

390
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,400
love you, believe in you,

391
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,720
to take care of you.

392
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,960
Come here.

393
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,799
And take care of you.

394
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,920
And be with each other for the rest of our lives.

395
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,000
Come.

396
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:32,960
This way, please.

397
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,480
Officer Kimura.

398
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,079
Let me report something to you.

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,480
What you ordered

400
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,000
I've arranged it.

401
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,519
We must keep this

402
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,880
you must keep this a secret.

403
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,839
Don't worry.

404
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,079
Feng Qi is reliable

405
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,200
and tight-lipped.

406
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,720
Have mutual affinity

407
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,200
section Chief Chen

408
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,559
captain Zhao.

409
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,400
What are you doing?

410
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,880
I'm a little nervous.

411
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:53,960
Are you memorizing lyrics?

412
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,079
Thank you.

413
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,039
It's a wedding

414
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,720
chief Chen, seriously

415
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,359
you look like a decent man

416
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,920
In this suit.

417
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,960
Right?

418
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,240
Right.

419
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,440
That's right.

420
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,799
What Captain Zhao

421
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,119
I always learn about

422
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,319
has always been what I learn from.

423
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,079
And good taste.

424
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,200
Thank you, Captain Zhao.

425
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,160
The banquet is about to begin.

426
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,079
I'm not hungry.

427
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
OK.

428
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Alright.

429
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,240
It hasn't started yet.

430
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,319
Why are you drinking?

431
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,720
Fang Fang,

432
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:03,720
I'll drink with you.

433
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,279
She's beautiful

434
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,119
section Chief Chen is so lucky

435
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,920
any woman is beautiful

436
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,359
every woman is not beautiful.

437
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
That's not necessarily the case.

438
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,480
Sometimes,

439
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,200
It's more important to get married than to dress nicely

440
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,720
than a beautiful bride.

441
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,440
Did you see that?

442
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,599
Have you seen Zuo Shuangtao?

443
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,759
This is the woman you love.

444
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,519
Right?

445
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,960
Who are you referring to?

446
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,400
I don't know her at all.

447
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
Such an act?

448
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
You know what?

449
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,759
This woman is going to sleep

450
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,279
Is going to sleep with another man tonight.

451
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:03,680
I don't believe that.

452
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,000
That you don't have any feelings at all?

453
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,799
Go out and have a drink.

454
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,039
I'll watch the movie with Kun.

455
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,119
Next, let the groom

456
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,079
and bride

457
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,440
exchange rings

458
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
from today on,

459
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,240
I will be loyal...

460
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,079
To love you forever,

461
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,880
and to trust you

462
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,279
to help you,

463
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,160
and take good care of you.

464
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
What about you?

465
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,279
Is indeed imperfect.

466
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,519
But of course,

467
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,519
I'm not perfect either.

468
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,000
But the two of us will

469
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,680
that'll be perfect.

470
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,359
Alright.

471
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:01,680
Master.

472
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,039
The boat is ready.

473
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,079
We are ready.

474
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,079
We can leave any time.

475
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,720
Alright.

476
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,400
When will the person you are talking about come?

477
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
She will come.

478
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,279
Kun!

479
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,640
Are you feeling pain right now?

480
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,200
And shamed?

481
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Take this away.

482
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,799
Are you still going to protect this woman?

483
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't want to see it anymore.

484
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,319
Please.

485
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,200
A serrated knife.

486
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,640
There's no serrated knife.

487
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,480
Next, I'll have the bride and groom

488
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
to cut the cake for you.

489
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,279
He shared their sweetness

490
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,160
to everyone here.

491
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,440
On such an important occasion,

492
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
we'd like to invite Mr. Murayama

493
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,880
to cut the happy cake with us.

494
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,039
Kun.

495
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,960
I can understand you.

496
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,000
Just tell me

497
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,079
If Zuo Shuangtao is

498
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,200
and assassinate Martial Master of the Mountain Below?

499
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,319
I promise

500
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,880
to spare your life.

501
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,759
That's not right.

502
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,279
Not only will I spare your life,

503
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,440
I can't forgive

504
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,519
for the past.

505
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,960
Alright?

506
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,799
Alright?

507
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,720
Let bygones be bygones

508
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
I want to see the warrior under the mountain.

509
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,640
It's the same if you told me.

510
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,359
I want to see the warrior under the mountain.

511
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,079
I want to see him alone.

512
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,920
This way, please.

513
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,079
The Grand Commander of the Lower Hill.

514
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,079
I'll be at the gate

515
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,599
call me anytime.

516
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,519
Now we're the only two left.

517
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,319
What do you want to say?

518
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,160
What is it?

519
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,079
Untie me first.

520
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm already in this state.

521
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,359
You have a gun,

522
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,559
It is your men outside.

523
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,839
You still worry that I'll kill you?

524
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,640
All right.

525
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,160
What do you want to tell me?

526
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,400
What's it?

527
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,720
I told you.

528
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,240
What's in it for me?

529
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,480
You can get some reward.

530
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,599
And leave here safely.

531
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,599
Certainly,

532
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,640
If you're willing to give it up,

533
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,519
you can be

534
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,759
you can be the team leader.

535
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,519
At the same time, you'll receive a large settlement fund.

536
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,319
Dear guests,

537
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,480
It's almost eight o'clock.

538
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,359
The most exciting moment

539
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,319
of the wedding.

540
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,559
Please raise your head and look to the sky now.

541
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,279
The firework show.

542
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,519
Mr. Kun.

543
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,240
The Chief of Shanghai District, Wang Tianmu,

544
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,759
zhao Gangyi from Qingdao Station

545
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,240
and Pei San of Tianjin Railway Station.

546
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
Their level is much higher than yours.

547
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,279
That's why they're alive.

548
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,759
We're the same, aren't we?

549
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,720
What are you worried about?

550
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,079
Why don't you leave Shanghai?

551
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,759
When I close my eyes,

552
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,000
I was seeing Xiao Hu and Da Xuan.

553
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,359
How am I supposed to leave?

554
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
I want to stay to take revenge.

555
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,000
And kill them.

556
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,359
To get the secret letter back.

557
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,279
But I don't know what to do.

558
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
Can you help me think of a way?

559
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,279
I have one solution,

560
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,000
however...

561
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,519
What?

562
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,920
Requires you to make a huge sacrifice.

563
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,319
I'm not afraid to die.

564
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,199
Tell me what to do.

565
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,800
First, you need to be caught by Zhao An.

566
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,079
And make sure they don't suspect

567
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,880
of your arrest.

568
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,039
What about after he was arrested?

569
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,559
Did you see the number on it?

570
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,320
Zhao An read my information.

571
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,199
He will definitely find out

572
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,400
has something to do with

573
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,159
he will suspect

574
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,840
why is my birthday engraved

575
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,360
on the pendant you carry?

576
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,840
The only explanation

577
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,679
Is that you like me.

578
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,480
Then we can get the hook.

579
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,119
Alright.

580
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,559
But you have to remember,

581
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,519
don't do anything until eight o'clock.

582
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,159
What's wrong, Guoguo?

583
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Give me a hug.

584
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,480
Don't speak.

585
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,159
Just for a while

586
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,360
jiaping,

587
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,039
I need to use the bathroom.

588
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,880
Okay, I'll go with you.

589
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,760
No need.

590
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,199
You have to take care of everyone here.

591
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,079
Alright.

592
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,400
Go and be back quickly.

593
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,320
Mr. Yamashita.

594
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,760
Mr. Yamashita.

595
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,840
Mr. Yamashita.

596
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,079
What's wrong?

597
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,000
Mr. Foot the mountain.

598
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,960
Mr. Underfoot.

599
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,599
Captain Zhao.

600
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,199
Captain Zhao.

601
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,079
Commander Yamashita.

602
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:28,920
Under the mountain

603
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,760
captain Zhao.

604
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,760
What's wrong with Mr. Yamashita?

605
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
He was assassinated.

606
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,159
Commander!

607
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,719
Then ask for help!

608
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,199
I'll stop the bleeding.

609
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,840
Hurry.

610
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,159
Got stabbed.

611
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,519
Hurry to send her to the hospital for rescue!

612
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,599
First aid?

613
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,320
Jerk!

614
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,360
Go after Kun now!

615
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,039
Yes

616
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:12,840
come on.

617
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,159
What's going on?

618
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,239
I didn't know.

619
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,320
I saw him like this the moment I came.

620
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Left Pair Tao.

621
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,480
Why are you here?

622
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,599
I went to the bathroom

623
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,920
I heard gunshots

624
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,159
and someone's shouting.

625
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,159
I came running right away.

626
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,559
Why did it go faster than us?

627
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
The toilet is close to here

628
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,920
aren't you afraid of gunshots?

629
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,039
And you'll come back?

630
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,280
Officer Kimura.

631
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,920
This is my wedding.

632
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
The most important moment in a woman's life.

633
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,559
Someone fired shots in my wedding.

634
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,239
Should I hide?

635
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,559
Or rush at him and kill him?

636
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,400
Officer Kimura.

637
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,320
This may be a misunderstanding.

638
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,480
Cordon off the scene

639
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
no one is allowed to leave.

640
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:04,760
Yes

641
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,679
are you all right?

642
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,239
Hide in the utility room on the first floor

643
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,559
I hid my military uniform there.

644
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,719
Nobody move!

645
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,320
I will kill whoever moves.

646
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,639
Just now Colonel Yamashita

647
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,880
he lost

648
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,719
a very important item.

649
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,039
Every one of you is a suspect.

650
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,280
Search!

651
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,159
I really don't have one.

652
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,440
No, I...

653
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,920
Do you still want to take off your clothes?

654
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,440
I took nothing.

655
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,599
Don't look at them.

656
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,119
I told you.

657
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,199
I'll kill whoever moves.

658
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,679
Left Shuangtao.

659
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,840
You were the closest to Commander Shanxia.

660
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,039
Who are you

661
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,639
I'm on a mission with Zuo Shuangtao.

662
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,000
My name is Kun.

663
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,960
We're on a mission together.

664
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,639
Where is Left Shuangtao?

665
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,599
She asked me to come and find you

666
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,519
you will arrange for me to evacuate.

667
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,639
Have you completed your mission?

668
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,519
I already killed Yamashita.

669
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:23,920
Where is she?

670
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,400
Although Yamashita died,

671
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,960
I didn't get the secret letter yet.

672
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,119
We know her well.

673
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,920
She won't leave.

674
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,280
This is outrageous.

675
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,519
She still has no discipline in her eyes

676
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,639
Is she organized?

677
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,920
But I have to say that

678
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,360
zuo Shuangtao is very predictable.

679
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,880
Both Yamashita and Zhao An were tricked by her.

680
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,159
I can arrange for you to hide in a safe place.

681
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,599
We'll meet Zuo Shuangtao when she gets the secret message.

682
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,199
And find a way to leave Shanghai.

683
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:58,840
Hand...

684
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,039
Stretch your hands.

685
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,079
Officer Kimura.

686
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,280
Nothing.

687
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,719
Take off your clothes.

688
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,320
This...

689
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:33,440
Officer Kimura.

690
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,239
The thing you mentioned

691
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,159
Is definitely not with Zuo Shuangtao.

692
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,440
As your family.

693
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,840
Can you make an exception?

694
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,320
Zuo Shuangtao and I

695
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,800
got married today.

696
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:44,079
As a husband,

697
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,159
I also want to save my wife's face.

698
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,760
I will serve the empire twice in the future.

699
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,480
Home safety! Home safe!

700
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,360
Take off your clothes!
