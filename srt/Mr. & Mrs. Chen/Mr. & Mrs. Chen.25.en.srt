1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,040
Class.

2
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,719
Today we have invited a special expert

3
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,920
to give you a lecture.

4
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,840
Let's welcome

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,920
good morning, class.

6
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,680
Before we start,

7
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,879
I want to ask you a question.

8
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,400
What on earth

9
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,560
of revolution?

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,359
Many of you may say that

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
Is on faith.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,439
And weapon.

13
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,599
There is nothing wrong.

14
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,800
But today I want to tell you

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
a very important thing,

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,280
Is the economy.

17
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,400
Without financial support,

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,039
without money,

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
you couldn't do many things.

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
Where will you get the money?

21
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,039
Development finance.

22
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,439
Many of you will ask

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,280
so what is finance?

24
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,080
Let's start from

25
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,719
let's start with this silver dollar

26
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,680
silver coin circulated in the base.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Hey.

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Come with me.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
Go to a tea house

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,639
at Bali Bridge Road.

31
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,599
I'll wait for you here.

32
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,280
Quickly.

33
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,520
What's the matter?

34
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,479
You'll know when you're here.

35
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,080
Don't forget to

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
don't let Zhao An's men see you.

37
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,879
Zhao An's men!

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,759
Why is he bothering me again?

39
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,439
Just remember that

40
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,479
don't let Zhao An's men see you.

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Alright.

42
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,479
See you later.

43
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,360
See you there.

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,719
Hey.

45
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,520
Guoguo.

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,680
I'm going out later.

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,199
Didn't you say that you wanted to buy stationery?

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll give you a ride.

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,639
Alright.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
I'll meet you at the parking lot.

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,280
Alright.

52
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,319
Hurry up.

53
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,199
Why is Chen Gangmu following us?

54
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,079
It's me.

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
Catch you!

56
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,920
He might be caught by the Japanese.

57
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,839
And he might have betrayed me.

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
How did you know that?

59
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,439
Luo Guan Qun and Zhao An were called

60
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,720
to the Military Police Headquarters.

61
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,279
I think Uchida must have given them the order

62
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,279
to arrest me.

63
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,000
I never thought Director Jiang would be someone like that.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,720
And betray me.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,959
To protect you

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,759
and to protect you.

67
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,480
You can use the Japanese to kill me.

68
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,079
In that case,

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,639
I'll run with you.

70
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,720
I asked you to come out,

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
not escape with me.

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,319
Nothing won't be solved by running away with me.

73
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,199
On the contrary, Luo Guanqun, the cunning fox,

74
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,319
than Luo Guanqun.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
To lure me out on purpose.

76
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,360
To keep you from falling into Zhao An's hands,

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,360
I will show him some respect.

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
And leave me to him.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,759
Is there no other way?

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,079
What should I do?

81
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,560
I watched you being arrested.

82
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,759
Guoguo.

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
Maybe only you can save me.

84
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,000
How can I save you?

85
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,759
I haven't thought

86
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,759
you'll go on as usual.

87
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,879
And buy your school supplies.

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,000
What if...

89
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,199
What if

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,439
they kill you?

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,519
I thought it over.

92
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
That Jiang Zhao Guo could only

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,639
I'm too close to Han Lu.

94
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,360
Although this reason is a little far-fetched,

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
but before they had concrete evidence,

96
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,639
I can resist them for a while.

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I can't.

98
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,000
You can do it.

99
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Believe in yourself.

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
After this,

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,839
promise me one thing

102
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,040
you will continue.

103
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,959
In your heart

104
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,879
In peace

105
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,000
In peace.

106
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,079
No matter I am useless or not,

107
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,839
I will be safe and sound.

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,199
Get out of the car. Hurry.

109
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,879
Pick me up personally?

110
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
Go to Military Police Headquarters with me.

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
Promotion or pay raise?

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
You'll know when you get there.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,399
I really can't help you this time.

114
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,680
Is Mr. Luo back?

115
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,800
No, she's not.

116
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,279
The car is parked downstairs.

117
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,240
She still hasn't come back.

118
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,680
He...

119
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,480
Really didn't come back?

120
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,399
No one's there?

121
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,799
Miss Zuo.

122
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,919
Miss Zuo.

123
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
Manager Luo,

124
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,879
why hide from me?

125
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,879
Broach.

126
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
Are you blind?

127
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm right here.

128
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,919
I didn't notice that.

129
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,639
What's the matter?

130
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,279
I heard that you arrested Chen Jia Ping

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,679
yes

132
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,039
follow orders.

133
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,279
I had no choice.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
Feel as if a knife were piercing one's heart

135
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,360
you should at least defend him.

136
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,480
Right?

137
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,600
Miss Zuo.

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,919
You don't know?

139
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,759
That our Manager Luo

140
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,600
Is about to burst his bubble.

141
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,320
I can't help it.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
The Japanese have the evidence.

143
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,840
What evidence?

144
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,919
Quickly pour the tea.

145
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,799
I'm sure you've heard about it.

146
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,519
Yesterday, a special agent from the Military Command

147
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,360
attacked the Japanese military clothing factory.

148
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,840
They were headed by Chongqing.

149
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
But he's still a senior official.

150
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,879
We found a labor card on him.

151
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,600
He said Chen Jiaping gave it to him.

152
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,639
Zhao An is the only one

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
Is Zhao An, right?

154
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,360
Yes

155
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,120
then Chen Family Ping stole it

156
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,039
It's not important.

157
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,519
It's all about the testimony.

158
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,559
He said

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,039
It's Chen Jiaping who colluded with me

160
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
Instead of mentioning Zhao An,

161
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,480
and you bought it?

162
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,399
The Japanese bought it?

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,799
They rummaged through our house

164
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,759
and Chen Jiaping's office

165
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
had been rummaged inside as well.

166
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,639
No evidence of collusion with Chongqing.

167
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,919
You could catch him

168
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,440
catching him?

169
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,360
Miss Zuo.

170
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,960
Please have some tea.

171
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,639
Miss Zuo.

172
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,639
Please don't be angry.

173
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,159
A Japanese?

174
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,879
Don't even think it's just a confession,

175
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,120
there was just a look in his eyes.

176
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
You could convict him.

177
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,320
And now

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,240
not only the

179
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,720
but the labor card.

180
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,679
The Japanese said they had information.

181
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,399
A secret agent named Five of Hearts

182
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,399
Is lurking in our store.

183
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,240
The Japanese suspect that Chen Jia Ping

184
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,120
Is five of hearts.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,519
This is impossible.

186
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,159
I think it's impossible too.

187
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,679
He got four of clubs

188
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,440
and now a five of hearts.

189
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,960
How about this?

190
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,879
Ask them all to come here

191
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,399
to play poker here.

192
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,399
Endless

193
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,799
manager Luo,

194
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,159
chen Jiaping has been with you for so long.

195
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,120
Everyone in this business

196
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,080
know that they're with Mr. Luo.

197
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,759
Have you ever thought about it?

198
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,600
Maybe someone tried to frame Chen Jia Ping

199
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
to drag you into this?

200
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
I have clean hands.

201
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,879
No one can drag me down.

202
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
You won't save me then.

203
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,120
Left Shuangtao.

204
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,879
I worry about

205
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,840
jia Ping's safety in my heart.

206
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,559
Manager Luo,

207
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,080
I can only ask you now.

208
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,759
Please.

209
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,799
Please save Chen Jiaping.

210
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,240
Manager Luo,

211
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,399
I have a dinner to attend.

212
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,279
Alright.

213
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,320
Left Shuangtao.

214
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
Don't worry.

215
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,919
I'll surely beg the Japanese

216
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,519
the Japanese.

217
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,360
You should

218
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,519
to figure out a way.

219
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's work together

220
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,600
and to return the family's innocence.

221
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,399
Walk him out.

222
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,799
Miss Zuo, take care.

223
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,360
Don't worry.

224
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,879
Let's think of a way together.

225
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,159
To exonerate Chen Family Ping

226
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,840
to exonerate the Chen Family

227
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,519
Is to find someone to take the blame.

228
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,679
Ever since Zhao An became the Japanese's lackey,

229
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,320
he killed so many patriots.

230
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,639
Be guilty of the most heinous crimes

231
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,840
one's crime deserves more than death

232
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,559
the other thing is,

233
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,639
zhao An repeatedly suspected me of my identity.

234
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
If I didn't get rid of him,

235
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,440
with this business,

236
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,279
I'm still in danger from now on.

237
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,960
And frame Zhao An.

238
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,159
I can't do it alone.

239
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,720
You have to find a way to persuade Luo Guanqun to join you.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,000
The batch of goods

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,440
was dispatched from Wuxi.

242
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,080
It will arrive in Shanghai in two days.

243
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,759
Put the goods in the warehouse

244
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,120
don't move for now.

245
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,320
Why not?

246
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,120
It's the right time to sell it at a higher price.

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,279
Kimura is dead now.

248
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,559
Don't you know

249
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,639
the Military Police will make trouble next.

250
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,960
We must be cautious at this time.

251
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,919
Where the smuggled materials are.

252
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,559
How can we kidnap the smuggled goods?

253
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,799
How to get the smuggled goods into Zhao An's hands?

254
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,679
And wait for Luo Guanqun to take the bait.

255
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,679
Right.

256
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,240
There is a batch of cotton yarn

257
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,440
to Ms. Luo.

258
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,200
Double-peach.

259
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,360
Why do you suddenly ask this?

260
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,759
Aunt, you don't know

261
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,480
something happened to Jiaping?

262
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,320
Someone accused him of colluding with Chongqing.

263
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
The Military Police Command arrested him.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,559
He's dying.

265
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,320
How could this happen?

266
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,200
That's why I'm here to inquire about

267
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,240
to see if there was any

268
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,120
between uncle-in-law and Manager Luo?

269
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,480
I'll ask Manager Luo to plead for her.

270
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,399
In my heart.

271
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,320
Shuangtao.

272
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,480
Go and ask Mr. Luo for permission.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
If he's not willing to help,

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll ask your uncle to look for him.

275
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,200
It's better not to tell his uncle.

276
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,080
Why?

277
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,279
With his identity,

278
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,600
It's hard if he doesn't show up.

279
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,039
And offend the Japanese.

280
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,919
Don't give him a hard time.

281
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,279
I'm going to plead with Mr. Luo.

282
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,440
He will be fine after some time.

283
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,360
Double Peach.

284
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,360
You are becoming more and more sensible.

285
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,399
Don't worry.

286
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sure Jiaping will be fine

287
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,159
look at you, so thin.

288
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,559
Latte with sugar.

289
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,120
With sugar.

290
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,840
Thanks.

291
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,879
How's it going?

292
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,039
I helped Luo Guanqun build

293
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,679
built for Luo Guanqun before.

294
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,080
The frequency is 11671.

295
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,919
So I quickly found

296
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,120
the champion horse in every day.

297
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,240
That's right.

298
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,440
This number

299
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,559
correspond to these English letters.

300
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,960
The message will be solved

301
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,400
the message will be solved.

302
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,720
I've completed the task

303
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,839
I've completed it.

304
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,839
Last night,

305
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
I asked a few men to

306
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,680
berth No.9 of Puxi Wharf.

307
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,000
That's a small cargo ship.

308
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,079
Their defense was lax.

309
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,920
We didn't take much effort.

310
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,680
We seized the ship.

311
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,279
And transported the ten boxes of goods we grabbed overnight

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,640
to the warehouse

313
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,279
the warehouse on the east bound

314
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,799
this

315
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,599
this is the cotton yarn in that batch.

316
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:41,920
That's right.

317
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,039
It's this cotton yarn.

318
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,039
This medium yarn of 26 yarn

319
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,480
can only be made in Shanghai.

320
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,240
This year, Japan found

321
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,519
cotton yarn being sold in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

322
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,440
They thought they were smuggled from Shanghai.

323
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,960
They are being investigated recently.

324
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,119
It means,

325
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,680
there's hope to save Chen Jiaping.

326
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,519
To save Chen Jiaping

327
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
but things

328
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,039
starts to go the way we expected.

329
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,039
Alright.

330
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,319
OK then.

331
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,400
It's fine.

332
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,119
Don't be anxious.

333
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,079
Mrs. Chen.

334
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,519
Mrs. Chen,

335
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,039
I've followed your orders

336
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,160
I accidentally found the batch of cotton yarn

337
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,680
on the batch of cotton yarn in the warehouse of eastbound

338
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,599
and I reported it to Captain Zhao in time.

339
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,200
What did he say?

340
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,720
Eastbound Warehouse is Captain Zhao's turf.

341
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,519
Cotton yarn is in demand.

342
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,720
They can even focus on

343
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,400
of course he can!

344
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,400
Does he know whose goods it is?

345
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,640
He's been searching around the black market these days.

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,359
The black market these days.

347
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,640
He suspects it's Luo Guanqun's cargo.

348
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,480
You've robbed them?

349
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,759
That's for sure.

350
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,240
Did he suspect anything?

351
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,160
Why Luo Guan Qun's goods

352
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,480
In his warehouse?

353
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,480
I heard that a boat sank at Puxi Pier.

354
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,720
Captain Zhao speculated that it must be Mr. Luo's boat.

355
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,000
He didn't have time to place the cargo.

356
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,720
They'll just stand there for a few days.

357
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,119
Nice job.

358
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,440
Have you found any information on the cotton yarn?

359
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,400
Do you know where the cotton yarns were transported?

360
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,279
Lin'an.

361
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,720
There's a trading place over there.

362
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
The Japanese are investigating

363
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,000
the smuggled goods.

364
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,039
Including Hubei and northern Zhejiang

365
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,480
we have found a clue.

366
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,559
Is cotton yarn.

367
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,079
If the Japanese know this,

368
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,720
they can't protect my position,

369
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,680
even my head was injured.

370
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,079
The robber stole this batch of cotton yarn,

371
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,720
I think the most that would be

372
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
to sell them on the black market.

373
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,400
The Japanese might not know.

374
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,440
I hope so.

375
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,759
So please remember

376
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,480
who has the drugs?

377
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,519
You must find them.

378
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,519
It doesn't matter if you can't find it back.

379
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
We can't let the Japanese know

380
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,799
yes

381
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,240
oK.

382
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,200
I'll try to find out again.

383
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,920
Did you hear it right?

384
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
I heard it clearly.

385
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,640
That's what Second Dao said.

386
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,079
How did you come across Erdao?

387
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
I was thinking about something.

388
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So I found a restaurant and had a drink.

389
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,160
Then I saw Second Blade come in.

390
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,480
I'm sitting in the corner.

391
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,559
That Second Dao didn't see me.

392
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,319
And then I saw Second Dao

393
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,680
after a few drinks,

394
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,279
after a few drinks.

395
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,519
You even bragged to that man

396
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,039
you said that he helped Zhao An

397
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,920
you helped Zhao An to get a batch of cotton yarn.

398
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,319
The goods he mentioned

399
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,359
just mentioned?

400
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,519
Right.

401
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,440
He said that

402
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
they were from Zhao An's enemy.

403
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,720
That would be you.

404
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,519
He even said that

405
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,759
how would Zhao An reward him?

406
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,279
How did Zhao An know?

407
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,119
How did you know that?

408
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,519
I went to the black market to find out.

409
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,160
And Zhao An got to know it.

410
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,319
He guessed it was your cotton yarn.

411
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,319
Are you stupid

412
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:15,880
you are a pig!

413
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you pigs?

414
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,559
This is bad.

415
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,200
Haven't you thought about it?

416
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Maybe someone tried to frame Chen Jia Ping

417
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,079
and then drag you into this?

418
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,480
This is bad.

419
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,960
This is broken.

420
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,920
What's the noise?

421
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
It's the middle of the night.

422
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,119
Come here.

423
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,119
What's up

424
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,680
why were my goods robbed again?

425
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,880
Why was Zhao An the one who robbed them?

426
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,160
Did you and him...

427
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,279
With him again?

428
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,359
What does that have to do with me?

429
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
If you don't want to go to bed,

430
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I'll go to bed first.

431
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,559
Let go of me!

432
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,319
You're crazy!

433
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,039
Lao Luo, you want to hit me again?!

434
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,799
Am I right?

435
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,000
Hold on.

436
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,000
Chen Jiaping isn't here,

437
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,200
no one bought the Xuan Paper for me.

438
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,880
Do you think

439
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,440
he really is five of hearts?

440
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,799
It doesn't matter if he is the one.

441
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,119
Someone should take the blame for Chen Jiaping.

442
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,599
For his crimes?

443
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,119
Then...

444
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,480
Who can be the scapegoat?

445
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,359
Think about it.

446
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,920
How Jiang Zhao Guo got the labor license?

447
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,960
Zhao An's

448
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,400
you mean Zhao An should

449
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,680
I don't think so.

450
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,319
Then

451
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,839
the Japanese would never believe

452
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,400
zhao An was the five-star one.

453
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,079
The Japanese won't believe it,

454
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,079
then try to make him believe it.

455
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
No matter Chen Jiaping or not,

456
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,319
you can't trust him anymore.

457
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,200
If you don't trust him anymore,

458
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,720
If you don't trust him.

459
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,279
You think I saved him?

460
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,640
I'll save myself.

461
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,960
This time, I'll fight with her back to the wall.

462
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,480
Me and Zhao An

463
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,200
either fish will die,

464
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,000
or the net will break.

465
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,160
Then

466
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,400
Is there any way

467
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,519
to make Zhao An the top five?

468
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,160
Manager Luo,

469
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
have you already got a plan up your sleeve?

470
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,599
I've discussed with

471
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,200
with Tongji Company in Chongqing.

472
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
After Jia Ping was taken to the Military Police Headquarters,

473
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,039
uchida Naoki interrogated him in person.

474
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,279
Jiaping insisted that

475
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,440
to blame Jiang Zhaoguo

476
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,599
his relationship with Han Lu

477
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,720
and framed him out of jealousy.

478
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,599
But the Japanese

479
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,240
don't believe that at all.

480
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,839
Aside from Jiang Zhaoguo's statement,

481
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,480
besides Jiang Zhaoguo's statement.

482
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,920
I heard

483
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,720
luo Guanqun pleaded for Jia Ping.

484
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,319
The Japanese didn't torture him.

485
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,039
Then they transferred him to the detention center.

486
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,039
Detention facility

487
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,640
Is actually the prison of Military Police Headquarters.

488
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,160
It's not far from Huasheng Road.

489
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,240
Where's Jiang Zhao Guo now?

490
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,119
Jiang Zhao Guo is under house arrest

491
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,160
In the guest house of Military Police Headquarters.

492
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,319
The Japanese want to overthrow him

493
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,599
thank you

494
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,920
to get so many information for me.

495
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,519
You must've taken a lot of risks.

496
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,519
Nothing.

497
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,720
I'm mainly in charge of organizing files.

498
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
When I get in and out of all departments,

499
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,599
without arousing suspicion.

500
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,640
Double Peach.

501
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,839
Are you able to save Jiaping?

502
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm still working on it.

503
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:48,799
Come and wash my feet.

504
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,640
New here,

505
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,039
It's your turn to wash Boss's feet today.

506
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,119
Go there.

507
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,480
I asked you to wash your feet for dignity.

508
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
I will punch you to death!

509
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,799
Brat,

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm convinced.

511
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,799
You're convinced.

512
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,440
Convinced.

513
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,359
You deserved this beating.

514
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,799
Wash my feet.

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,920
Wash, wash.

516
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,519
Hurry up.

517
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,440
He's coming.

518
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,960
Hurry up.

519
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:47,920
Come on.

520
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Brother.

521
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,079
Is it comfortable?

522
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,160
That's more like it.

523
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:58,920
You know what?

524
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,000
I only wash my wife's feet, understand?

525
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:08,799
Chen Jiaping,

526
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,839
how many times have you caused trouble?

527
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,839
Three times.

528
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,039
She got into trouble for three times

529
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,200
within a few days.

530
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,079
Are you asking for death?

531
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,119
Officer.

532
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,079
I'm accused.

533
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,920
Everyone here is claiming to be wronged.

534
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,160
From today on,

535
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I'll transfer you to cell 206.

536
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,079
Pack your things and come with me.

537
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,039
Come on.

538
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,480
What happened to your face?

539
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,680
It was Luo Guanqun.

540
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,480
Can you please take me away now?

541
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,599
I don't want to be with that devil anymore.

542
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,079
Luo Guanqun,

543
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:15,839
how about this?

544
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,640
You move to Pudong for a while.

545
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,680
What does that mean?

546
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,200
You want to be with me forever, right?

547
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
We will always be together.

548
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,680
It's almost time.

549
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,039
I don't want to hear it. It's too fast.

550
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,559
I have heard it many times.

551
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,400
You're lying.

552
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,759
I, Zhao An,

553
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,440
lie to everyone in the world,

554
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,279
I will never lie to you, Zhang Shuyun.

555
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,920
When will

556
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,119
when will you take me to Pudong?

557
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,240
9 p.m. tomorrow night,

558
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,119
wait for me at the No. 7 ferry of the Huangpu River.

559
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:58,960
Remember that

560
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,240
don't let Luo Guanqun arouse suspicion.

561
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,640
Pack your things.

562
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,000
Go on.

563
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,519
Come in.

564
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,559
How is it?

565
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,839
Yes, I have.

566
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,720
His name is Hou Si,

567
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,880
he is a smuggler.

568
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,759
How could he know

569
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,680
I have cotton yarn?

570
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,799
I got someone to tip it about the black market.

571
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,720
He found me following it.

572
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,640
How much did he pay?

573
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,519
One hundred yuan for a packet.

574
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,359
It's over 70 yuan for one on the black market.

575
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,599
He would give me 100.

576
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,640
He knew about my background.

577
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,519
He won't lie to me.

578
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,000
1,400 bales of cotton yarn.

579
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,319
That will be

580
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,720
one hundred and forty thousand.

581
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,839
But Marquis Si said that

582
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,680
such a large quantity of goods

583
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,759
can't be transported out of Shanghai.

584
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,960
We need to figure it out ourselves.

585
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
He's waiting for me outside the capital.

586
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,960
You should use your brain as well.

587
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,480
This is easy.

588
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,279
The Japanese are asking us

589
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,480
to transport opium to the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

590
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,359
We have the pass to leave the city.

591
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,119
Chen Jiaping,

592
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,000
you know what?

593
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,920
A crazy man is staying in room 206.

594
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,960
There are three people who live with him.

595
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,799
Was cut off his eyeball,

596
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,000
one of them was bitten off an ear.

597
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,640
The other one's hand

598
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,319
the other guy's entire hand was bitten off.

599
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,400
Go on.

600
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,720
Wang Dapu,

601
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,039
this is Chen Jiaping.

602
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,319
He'll live with you.

603
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,720
Be nice to him.

604
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,519
Welcome.

605
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
My name is Wang Dapu,

606
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,759
chen Jiaping,

607
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,759
what do you think of this movie?

608
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,319
The story is boring.

609
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,160
The rhythm is dragged.

610
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,039
And pretentious acting.

611
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,559
Nobody would spend money to watch such a bad film.

612
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,440
That's right.

613
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,359
No wonder the movie tickets

614
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,799
are given away for free.

615
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,000
Once you get into the cinema,

616
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and doesn't leave the table,

617
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,440
and get one yuan for free.

618
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,440
This is exactly a bad movie!

619
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
I'm here

620
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,839
for Du Fei.

621
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,720
But he was only out for one minute.

622
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,000
From a to z

623
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,559
I watched Han Lu's face

624
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,720
flashing her face

625
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,920
I'm really annoying.

626
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Do you know how capable Cold Dew is?

627
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,440
So many pop stars are matching her.

628
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
The big boss

629
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,440
the big boss must be supporting her.

630
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,440
Really?

631
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,000
I heard from the man sitting next to me that

632
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,359
almost no one

633
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,920
bought a ticket to get in today's cinema.

634
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,279
That's true.

635
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,519
90% of the clients

636
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,359
came here just like us.

637
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,079
I think

638
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,200
these are the money that the big boss spent.

639
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,319
To make Han Lu happy.

640
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,839
Exactly.

641
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,839
Let's go back.

642
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,680
Go get your money.

643
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,880
It'll be too late.

644
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,880
Alright!

645
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,559
Wait for me!

646
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,559
There are many people here today.

647
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,000
It's very grand.

648
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:24,799
I...

649
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,240
I don't want to go.

650
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,559
I just came to tell you

651
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,319
I'm a little tired.

652
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
I'd like to go back and rest.

653
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,359
Miss Han Lu.

654
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
You'd better attend

655
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,440
for today's press conference.

656
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,880
Because I have something very important

657
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,359
In front of all the reporters.

658
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,880
That concerns you and me.

659
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,039
What is it?

660
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,400
I want to propose to you

661
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,279
In front of all the reporters.

662
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,519
You should know

663
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,920
I'm sure you know that.

664
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:06,920
Don't.

665
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,360
Mr. Yamashita,

666
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
sorry.

667
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:10,960
I...

668
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Ms. Han Lu.

669
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,559
I don't like to force you.

670
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,880
How about this?

671
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,280
Think about it.

672
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,360
I will deal with

673
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,239
handle the reporters.

674
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,199
I'll be waiting for you.

675
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,239
Ms. Han Lu.

676
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,639
Do you know Jiang Zhaoguo was caught?

677
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,280
What did you say

678
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,920
I think you've already known that

679
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,400
mr. Yamashita is not an ordinary businessman.

680
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,280
He's doing something great

681
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,920
for the Japanese empire.

682
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,199
He is a very powerful man.

683
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,920
As long as Ms. Han Lu is willing to marry Mr. Yamashita,

684
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,440
he can do anything for you.

685
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Miss Han Lu.

686
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,039
You're the only one

687
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,960
can keep Jiang Zhaoguo alive.

688
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,800
You can think about it.

689
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,760
But we don't have much time.

690
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,840
Mr. Yamashita and the reporters are waiting.

691
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,000
This is your last chance.

692
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,920
What else do you want to say?

693
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,920
I've told you who the five of hearts is.

694
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,320
You know

695
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,880
we want more than this.

696
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,239
What's your mission to Shanghai?

697
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,920
Why are you so interested in the Chinese Communists' borderlands?

698
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,039
Alright.

699
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:30,760
I said that

700
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,920
boss Dai,

701
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,880
has sent two spies

702
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,039
that lurk in the financial system in the CPC border region

703
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,719
the code names are Magpie and Dayan.

704
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,760
Before their identities were revealed,

705
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,320
they had got the formula of the coin paper

706
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,400
and the copper engraving of the coin.

707
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,840
After that, they fled from Yan'an.

708
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:10,880
They fled from Yan'an.

709
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,800
I came to Shanghai this time

710
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,199
to meet up with them

711
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,280
and bring them back to Chongqing.

712
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,599
Why do you want them?

713
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,880
The Chongqing government has launched

714
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,119
a secret plan to counterfeit money

715
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,920
to destroy the Chinese Communist Party's Border Region economy

716
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,840
magpie is the person I want to meet in Da Hua Hotel.

717
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,960
I was being followed by your people.

718
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,519
So we didn't meet each other.

719
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,719
After that,

720
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,079
he died mysteriously.

721
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,840
I haven't got the formula of the coin paper either.

722
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Where's Dayan?

723
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,880
They are missing.

724
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,639
I can't reach him.

725
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,360
Help

726
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,679
help

727
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,320
sir, please help!

728
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,360
What's up

729
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,679
sir. Sir.

730
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,000
Please help!

731
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,719
He wanted to cut my nose.

732
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,599
My nose is gone.

733
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,199
If my guess is right,

734
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,679
are you trying to escape?

735
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,719
I don't understand what you mean.

736
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,360
You've made six keys in total.

737
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,800
The key to the cell.

738
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,639
The keys to the corridor

739
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,079
and all the stairways.

740
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:30,840
Am I right?

741
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,480
Why did you poach others' eyes

742
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,719
and bite people's ears?

743
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,320
Because you don't want anyone to stay with you.

744
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,039
Interfere with your making the key, right?

745
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,519
I'm very curious.

746
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,440
How did you figure it out?

747
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,480
You first tell me

748
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,760
how did you make it?

749
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
What do you think

750
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,079
I have observed

751
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,719
the key to the waist of a Japanese soldier.

752
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,760
Remember the shape of each key.

753
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,280
Then draw it out.

754
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,519
And make the key

755
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,119
and then the key.

756
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,840
The material to make the key

757
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,960
should be the metal hinge on the bed.

758
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,159
My bed

759
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,039
my bed was rickety.

760
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,599
That's also another problem

761
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:25,480
you don't want

762
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,920
not want to live with anyone.

763
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,360
You are smarter than all the previous ones.

764
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,400
But if one is too smart,

765
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,960
for both good and bad.

766
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,119
They might just lose their eyes and ears.

767
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,639
As for you,

768
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,679
might be your life.

769
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,639
I don't want the key.

770
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,639
Where's the key?

771
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,000
Go look for it.

772
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,000
I've never left the room.

773
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,800
The key is still in this room.

774
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,960
Give me the key.

775
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,599
Put the knife down.

776
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,119
What exactly do you want?

777
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,400
I want nothing.

778
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,719
I just want to

779
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:19,519
one eye

780
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,559
the missing ear.

781
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,440
Scaring my wife again.

782
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,840
Give me the key.

783
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,559
I won't touch you.

784
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,400
Why should I believe you?

785
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,400
What do I need before you give me the key?

786
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,760
When I get out,

787
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,960
I'll give you the key when I'm out.

788
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,519
You can't.

789
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,199
I'm too late.

790
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,760
I have to get out of here tomorrow.

791
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,360
Why does it have to be tomorrow?

792
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
There will be a condolence show tomorrow night.

793
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,599
At that time,

794
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,639
the Japanese guards were the weakest.

795
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,599
That would be the best chance.

796
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,039
You might not be able to get out then.

797
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,119
I haven't had the time to leave yet.

798
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,840
Give me the key.

799
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,159
I will escape with you.

800
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,079
I'll escape with you.

801
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,719
What kind of joke is that?

802
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:19,280
I can't go out with you.

803
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,239
I was framed.

804
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,159
Then I will be released.

805
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:24,800
I ran out with you.

806
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,039
It's even harder for me to explain.

807
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,039
I've stayed here longer

808
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,039
for longer than you.

809
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,159
I've only seen one enter.

810
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,360
But I've never seen one go out.

811
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:35,800
But I've never seen one go out.
