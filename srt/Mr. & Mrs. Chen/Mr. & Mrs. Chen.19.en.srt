1
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
I went to Yumo

2
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,480
Is to pass him a message.

3
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,879
To connect with each other.

4
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,719
And today,

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,879
we worked together

6
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,400
to identify the two drug dealers

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,159
he did this

8
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,319
to gain time for the CCP

9
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,680
to gain time to escape.

10
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,079
Also,

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,239
the four of clubs is me.

12
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,840
Me is the four of clubs.

13
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,760
Old Luo.

14
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Check it out carefully.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,560
You are a bastard if not.

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,439
You are so impatient.

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,239
Brother,

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
you're no better than Zhao An.

19
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,639
A narrow-minded person.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,479
Manager Luo,

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,439
what should we do with him?

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Hang him until he's dead

23
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,759
until he's dead

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,080
chief Chen

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
musket pistol

26
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,599
It weighs about 1100 grams.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,639
The weight after loading is about 1,350 grams.

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
The weight of the gun

29
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,120
around 1200 grams.

30
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,360
It's neither fully loaded

31
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,280
nor empty.

32
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,080
There's one possibility

33
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,759
several rounds were fired.

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,800
But the center of gravity of the pistol seems to be wrong.

35
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,039
So,

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,759
several rounds were not fired,

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
It was filled with blanks.

38
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,919
You must find a way to visit a calligraphy shop.

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,120
I will.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,719
The room upstairs

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,360
block 7 in the middle of the floor

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,879
I hid some documents and data.

43
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,159
Pick something worthless

44
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
and give them to Luo Guanqun.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,039
The rest must be dealt with.

46
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,560
Alright.

47
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,000
On the second floor balcony,

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
I put a pot of yellow chrysanthemums in it.

49
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,400
Which is the safe signal.

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Change yellow chrysanthemum into purple chrysanthemum.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
It means there is something wrong.

52
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,960
And most importantly,

53
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,879
the four plum blossoms.

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,120
Make sure you get to the bottom of Plan Shan

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,560
and destroy it completely.

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,159
I will.

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,280
Alright.

58
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,439
I've told you everything.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,720
Death comes to all.

60
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,519
It is a worthy death

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,279
was worth it.

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,720
I...

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,720
I will find a way...

64
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,600
I will find a way to kill you.

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
No need.

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,839
I can handle it.

67
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,480
I heard

68
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,279
when a man is about to die,

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,319
they see the people they want to see

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,839
they would see those they want to see the most.

71
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
What are you going to do

72
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
I'm not afraid of how long it'll take to die.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
Because they are with me.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,600
My old path...

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,759
No matter where you are in the future,

76
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,279
we will continue to fight together

77
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
for the communist faith.

78
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,000
And fight side by side.

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,240
Come.

80
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,399
Xiaotao,

81
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
sweet porridge and fried wonton are the best.

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
Hurry to have a try.

83
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm really

84
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
I'm a little hungry now.

85
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,519
Enjoy yourselves.

86
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,560
What about

87
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,160
I used to eat with him after work

88
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,759
after I was off duty.

89
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,959
You have a younger brother.

90
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,639
But he died before he lived to be 18.

91
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,319
How?

92
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,079
Two years ago at one night,

93
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
when he picked me up from work,

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,399
he ran into a group of drunk Japanese soldiers.

95
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,279
Flirting with me.

96
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,160
And he was jealous of me.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
My younger brother is young.

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,279
He's just mad.

99
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,920
So I had to reason with them.

100
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,920
My belly was pricked

101
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
with their bayonets.

102
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,040
(Daddy is fond of him.)

103
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,120
Selling candied porridge.

104
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,840
3kg of peach and 4kg of shell.

105
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,519
This ballad was my brother's favorite

106
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,919
liked reciting this ballad the most.

107
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
You must hate the Japanese.

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
What's the use of that?

109
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Can I defeat them?

110
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,320
If you ever fight in a war,

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,000
will you give your life for your brother?

112
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,919
Sister Hong Ling.

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,799
Why are we taking this road?

114
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
It's dark.

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,320
This path is short.

116
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,399
Go through it.

117
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,879
My house is ahead.

118
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,559
What dance are we going to learn today?

119
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,559
Let me teach you today

120
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,840
the most popular Fox Trot in Shanghai Beach.

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
Foxtrot?

122
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,960
I've read a novel once

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
It's called Shanghai Foxtrot

124
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,200
It's about a murder

125
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
In a quiet road.

126
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,200
It's scary.

127
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,399
We don't have that many murders.

128
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,279
But rats are always on this road.

129
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,159
Xiaotao.

130
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,639
I'm afraid of rats.

131
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,519
Can you walk in front of me?

132
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,039
You follow me.

133
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,159
Hong...

134
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,120
Sister Hong Ling.

135
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,000
You

136
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,240
could you

137
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,799
why are you doing this?

138
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,159
You didn't expect this, right?

139
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,039
I poisoned your porridge.

140
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,399
What about

141
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,759
kill her.

142
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,200
How did he do this?

143
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,320
I'll hit the road

144
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
taking that path,

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
shot her twice in the back.

146
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,720
You're not lying

147
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,919
you probably heard gunshots, right?

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
But I heard gunshot for a long time

149
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,120
why are you back so late?

150
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,440
To deal with the body?

151
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,559
To dispose of the corpse?

152
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,000
Great!

153
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,559
Good job.

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,120
Did you take the medicine?

155
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
Yes, I have.

156
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,279
Have you changed the gauze?

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,799
Not yet.

158
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
Let me help you with that.

159
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,200
Alright.

160
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,440
Hongling,

161
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,120
shi Yang was entrusted by Chongqing Military Commission

162
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,120
to hide for a long time.

163
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,960
He got a piece of very important information.

164
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,480
But he didn't hand it in.

165
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,000
He absconded without permission

166
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,200
and threatened the headquarters to redeem the information.

167
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,360
What was the information?

168
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,440
The Japanese Army Ministry's plan to forge legal currency

169
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,279
without this information,

170
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,840
counterfeit money will spread in the areas under the Kuomintang control.

171
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,039
The financial system will collapse.

172
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,039
And the war's supplies will suffer.

173
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,279
Our victory is still in the future.

174
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
This is the price for your glorious

175
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,080
and a glorious future.

176
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,399
I just don't want to kill innocent people.

177
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
As for what he'd done

178
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
and how he got the money,

179
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,240
I don't care about that.

180
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
You care about it?

181
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,759
You and Shi Yang are not the same kind of person.

182
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,600
Your conscience?

183
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,080
And justice

184
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,960
have not extinguished

185
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,960
you will help me.

186
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
Why did you steal my pendant?

187
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,360
I was wrong.

188
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,720
I'm wrong!

189
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm asking why you stole my pendant.

190
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,159
The woman lied to me.

191
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,960
You didn't kill her.

192
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,120
Why didn't you kill her?

193
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,240
The woman told me that

194
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,360
as long as I give her the pendant,

195
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,080
she'll give me half the money.

196
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,840
It's all my fault.

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,960
You wretch!

198
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,679
Me?

199
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,919
How could you frame me behind?

200
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,919
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,480
I owe a gambling debt.

202
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,639
I can't even pay them back.

203
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,360
They'll kill me!

204
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,360
Please.

205
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,399
Please, it's my fault.

206
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,519
Don't kill me.

207
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,919
Where is she?

208
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,159
The old factory.

209
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,360
In the old factory?

210
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
Take me to her.

211
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,919
I will take you there.

212
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,960
I'll take you to her.

213
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,720
She's waiting for me.

214
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,919
You can kill her.

215
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,480
I will shoot you

216
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,080
I will shoot you.

217
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,879
She's in that old factory ahead.

218
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,080
Wait for me on the second floor.

219
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,080
Don't forget that

220
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,320
I have the gun at your back.

221
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,480
Got it?

222
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,559
She's very alert.

223
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,559
I'll calm her down.

224
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,720
Don't play tricks.

225
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,319
Xiaotao.

226
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,359
They spotted me.

227
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,480
Shi Yang is outside right now.

228
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,440
There is no information in the pendant.

229
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,319
He's lying to me.

230
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm here to tell you that

231
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,640
we can find another clue to him.

232
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,200
Shi Yang has heart disease?

233
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,160
On Thursdays,

234
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,599
ci'an Hospital for a doctor.

235
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
To collect some medicine called nitroglycerin.

236
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,759
Ci'an Hospital.

237
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,480
Leave now.

238
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,039
Just go!

239
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,039
How about you?

240
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,839
Don't mind me.

241
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,240
Just do it for my dear brother.

242
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,599
But I can't leave you behind.

243
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,359
Don't worry. He won't hurt me.

244
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,799
Just go. Hurry.

245
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,720
Whore.

246
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,720
Betrayed me?

247
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Get out of the way.

248
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,920
Go to hell!

249
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,720
If one day you fight in a war,

250
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,160
will you give your life for your brother?

251
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,599
Dad is back!

252
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,640
Son.

253
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,480
Father.

254
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,559
Are you well-behaved or not?

255
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,079
Nice.

256
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,359
Father.

257
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,000
Why did you come home so late again?

258
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I have many things to do.

259
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,839
Why are you still up so late?

260
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,960
He asked me to wait

261
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
he had to wait for you to finish your story

262
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,960
finish your story.

263
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:54,680
Alright.

264
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
I'll tell you a story.

265
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,680
What do you want to hear?

266
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,559
The tin soldier's story.

267
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,960
The one

268
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,000
a steadfast tin soldier.

269
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,559
The little tin soldier, right?

270
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,519
That's right.

271
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,759
Let me tell you.

272
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,160
Once upon a time,

273
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,160
there was a tin soldier.

274
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,960
Who always had a musket on his shoulder.

275
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,319
Brave and handsome.

276
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,039
Dad, I will have to carry a musket in the future.

277
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,000
Great!

278
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,640
In the future, our Fan Fan

279
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,440
will carry a musket on her shoulder.

280
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,440
Brave and handsome.

281
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,000
And there are many

282
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,039
there are many other toys.

283
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,759
There's a beautiful dancer made of paper.

284
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,599
She is wearing a

285
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,559
with her.

286
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,799
The tin soldier loves her very much.

287
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,960
He looks at her every day

288
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
and dreamed that one day

289
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,000
to be his bride.

290
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,079
But there's a little monster

291
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,480
hates Xibing very much.

292
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,480
I threw him into the fire

293
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,799
when he wasn't looking.

294
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,319
Does it hurt, the tin soldier?

295
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,680
Of course it does.

296
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,839
But Xibing is very brave.

297
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,559
Although the fire consumed his body,

298
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
and slowly melted his body,

299
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,119
he was still holding on

300
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,319
that Mauser Spear

301
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
at that time,

302
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,000
there is a gust of wind.

303
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,279
With the wind,

304
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,480
that beautiful dancer is flying.

305
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,000
He's flying.

306
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,519
So he's next to Xibing.

307
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,000
Brother.

308
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,200
Brother.

309
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,519
Look at this.

310
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
It seems Lao Lu is talking about something.

311
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,319
Come on.

312
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,559
Louder, please.

313
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,799
The dancer, stay.

314
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,759
The rose brooch.

315
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,519
What?

316
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,920
What rose brooch?

317
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,839
Could it be some important information?

318
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,039
He finally confessed.

319
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,279
Listen to more of them.

320
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,720
From now on,

321
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,039
they

322
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,319
be together forever?

323
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,519
Together again?

324
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,680
Which other communist were you with?

325
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,319
Confess.

326
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,759
Did your upline...

327
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,319
Say something.

328
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,319
She's dead.

329
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,559
She just opened her mouth

330
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,240
he died without saying anything.

331
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,200
Come on.

332
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,240
Death comes to all.

333
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,119
It is a worthy death

334
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,279
and worth it.

335
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,680
Place the bet. Keep your hands off.

336
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,440
Place your bet.

337
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,279
It's all in the dealer.

338
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,559
Big and small.

339
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,240
Make your bet. Keep your hands off.

340
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,160
Everyone, stand up and don't move.

341
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,799
Great Lord.

342
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,839
Look at that person.

343
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,759
He looks familiar.

344
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,480
You seem to

345
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,359
somewhat nervous.

346
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,279
Look at that.

347
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,559
You lost all your money.

348
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I can't explain to my wife and kids at home.

349
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,559
It seems

350
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,039
I think I have seen it before.

351
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,200
I remember now.

352
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,079
At Hai Ban Xian Tea House,

353
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,039
she was one of the tea drinkers in the private room on the second floor.

354
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:30,799
That's right

355
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,119
but I didn't suspect them at the time.

356
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,519
They were all released later

357
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,039
the military police must be looking for him.

358
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,240
Otherwise,

359
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,759
we'll report him

360
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,759
he'll be credited?

361
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,960
Idiot!

362
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,400
If he is taken away by the gendarmerie,

363
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,279
for us to gain any credit?

364
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,200
What can we do

365
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,200
boss Zhang

366
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,559
Is really lucky today.

367
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,359
Luckily,

368
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,720
you said you don't know how to play.

369
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,519
Come with me next time.

370
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,079
Jiaping.

371
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,799
I can't fall asleep.

372
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,799
You can't sleep either?

373
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,359
Do you know how to dance?

374
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,920
I think we've never danced before.

375
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,319
What do you think

376
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,759
what is it?

377
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,359
I can't touch it.

378
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,640
And you can't touch it.

379
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,359
It...

380
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
It exists.

381
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,839
Like many great things

382
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,200
great things in this world.

383
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,119
Even if it's gone,

384
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,119
It's still there.

385
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,279
I can feel it.

386
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,039
You are very sad today.

387
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,480
Right?

388
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,039
It means

389
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,400
you also feel sad.

390
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,920
Let's not fight today.

391
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Just stay with me like this, okay?

392
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,240
Alright

393
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:54,799
chief Chen

394
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,200
you went to work so early today

395
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,000
where's the newspaper?

396
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,480
Have we arrived?

397
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
We have arrived.

398
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,519
Come on.

399
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,160
Here are your new application documents and news reports.

400
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:03,759
Alright.

401
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,519
Thank you.

402
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,119
You're welcome.

403
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,960
The counterfeit money is called Plan Shan.

404
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,480
I heard that in addition to the legal notes,

405
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,759
the Japanese are still trying to forge

406
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,599
the Chinese Communist Party's Border Region.

407
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,519
Two secret agents lurking in Yan'an

408
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,640
they stole the copper plate of the coin

409
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,359
of the copper plate and the formula for the printing paper.

410
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,559
Magpie is from Juntong.

411
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Guoguo has been going to the ballroom these days.

412
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,119
Would it have something to do with this?

413
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,440
Recently, you asked me if there's any case

414
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,839
that is related to the ballroom?

415
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,000
I remembered that.

416
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,440
There was a murder two days ago.

417
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,160
The dead was a dancing girl.

418
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,319
The place of the crime

419
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,759
It's in an abandoned factory.

420
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,559
The victim's name is Cai Hongling.

421
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,599
She was a dancer of Xianle Ballroom

422
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,839
the cause of death is

423
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:38,920
shot dead

424
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:39,880
got 3 shots

425
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,480
he fell from the second floor again.

426
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
He died instantly.

427
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,079
This man...

428
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,400
Have you found this man?

429
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,000
He hasn't.

430
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,200
I saw traces of men's lives

431
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,440
the traces of a man's life.

432
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,480
But when I asked people nearby,

433
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,599
they didn't know

434
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,400
was staying at her place.

435
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,279
No wonder Guoguo is going to the ballroom these days.

436
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,680
It turns out that he's trying to get close to Magpie through Cai Hongling.

437
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,759
But why would Juntong look for

438
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,720
find one of their own?

439
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,640
Why are you so interested in this case?

440
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:12,960
I suspect that

441
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,240
my wife is involved in the case.

442
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,559
Your wife?

443
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,279
Has anything to do with the dancing girls?

444
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,519
You were so sad the other night.

445
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,160
Was Cai Hongling killed

446
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,319
for her?

447
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,039
Maybe Guoguo knows where Magpie is.

448
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,519
In this case, we can use Guoguo

449
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,200
through Guoguo.

450
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,559
What are you thinking about with such a frown?

451
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,039
What's wrong with your wife?

452
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,680
Did she fall in love with another man?

453
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,480
I shouldn't have given you the green sofa back then.

454
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,319
Go back to your car.

455
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,559
It's not easy to get married.

456
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,519
Fuck off.

457
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,680
It's good to be single.

458
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,519
On the balcony on the second floor,

459
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,680
I put a pot of yellow chrysanthemums in it.

460
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,799
Which is the safe signal.

461
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,839
Change yellow chrysanthemum into purple chrysanthemum.

462
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,079
It means something bad happens.

463
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,200
I have swapped the yellow chrysanthemum for the purple chrysanthemum.

464
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,279
Who put it back?

465
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,960
What's up

466
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,680
what are you doing?

467
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,039
I'm here

468
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,200
to buy something.

469
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,440
To buy something.

470
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,679
This store is closed.

471
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
It's still open.

472
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,280
Hold on.

473
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,760
The boss of this shop, Boss Lu,

474
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,360
he's a Chinese Communist.

475
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,280
He has been captured.

476
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,800
Got it?

477
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,800
Is anyone here

478
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,400
there must be someone pretending to be his old path

479
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,199
and lie in ambush here.

480
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,639
Who didn't know about our sacrifice

481
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
but how would this person know

482
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
for the safety joint?

483
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,599
You're a new doctor.

484
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,800
Your lipstick looks great.

485
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,079
Where did you buy it?

486
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,480
I bought it at a discount in Yong'an Mall.

487
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,440
I thought the color is too bright.

488
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,239
How come?

489
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,719
It matches your skin tone.

490
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,760
Really?

491
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:13,760
Oh, right.

492
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,480
The aspirin you want is in counter No.5.

493
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:16,920
Thanks.

494
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,119
Here is a medicine bag.

495
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,199
Thank you.

496
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,079
Take this.

497
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,039
Please sign here.

498
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,039
I also want to buy lipstick.

499
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,639
Let's go to the mall in a couple of days.

500
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,360
Alright.

501
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,239
You have such a good taste.

502
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,719
Please give me some advice then.

503
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,639
You're so handsome.

504
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,920
You will look good with everything.

505
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,159
It's done.

506
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,320
Alright.

507
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,840
See you later.

508
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,320
Miss, please wait.

509
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,000
What's up

510
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,800
miss.

511
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,960
Your scarf dropped.

512
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,199
Thank you.

513
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,559
Did Ci'an Hospital find a clue to the magpie?

514
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,039
Who is this doctor?

515
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,519
Come on.

516
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,679
Jia Ping.

517
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,480
Lu Fangfang,

518
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,280
It's been a while

519
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,239
I was transferred

520
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,159
the Planning Office of Military Police.

521
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,119
It's so busy

522
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,239
get rid of or get away form duties , pressure , etc

523
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,199
that's an important position!

524
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,920
What important job?

525
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,800
Temporary job.

526
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,719
Because I can speak Japanese,

527
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,480
I have to run between the military police headquarters and the business.

528
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,360
I was exhausted.

529
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,039
You

530
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,840
to do something.

531
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,840
Do you know

532
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,079
these people?

533
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,440
CCP members?

534
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,039
The military police has arrested

535
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,880
the military police have arrested a lot of people.

536
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,239
Then

537
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,639
where are they sent?

538
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,800
I heard they are sent to detention center.

539
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,519
He probably can't come back.

540
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,320
It's so scary.

541
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,159
The...

542
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,920
Working for the Japanese,

543
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,440
we still have to be more careful.

544
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,559
You too.

545
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,960
I'll go in then.

546
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,239
Sir, are you ready?

547
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,880
Thank you.

548
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,440
Alright.

549
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,039
Go back to your work.

550
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:01,639
Talk to you later.

551
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,119
See you later.

552
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,800
Luo Guanqun caught him.

553
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,599
You caught Huang Jinming?

554
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,360
Recently, your military exploits are so great.

555
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,159
Lu, Luo Guanqun isn't taking the credit from me.

556
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,119
He's a bully!

557
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,599
Luo Guanqun is something he can do.

558
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,199
You're something.

559
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,960
The greatest ability I have

560
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,119
Is to be loyal to Chief Mu Cun.

561
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,000
The greatest ability you have

562
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,840
Is that no matter it's to feed the horses

563
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,119
or the pigs,

564
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,280
you can hide all the things

565
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,519
cover it tightly.

566
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,920
Luo Guanqun couldn't put his fingers in.

567
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,159
I'm guarding your house.

568
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,519
Plan Shan is going well.

569
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Now it's gradually expanding.

570
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,559
The problem now

571
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,159
Is the lack of cash.

572
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,280
Although your previous fund-raising plan

573
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,800
was not adopted,

574
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,559
I'm always optimistic.

575
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,880
Officer Kimura.

576
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
I promise that

577
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,519
If we follow my plan,

578
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,079
I'll surely provide endless cash

579
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,400
for the Shan Plan.

580
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,480
Trust me.

581
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,199
Come on.

582
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,800
Officer Kimura.

583
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
I've been realizing a truth lately.

584
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:37,880
What is it?

585
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,559
Actually, people

586
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,360
Is the same as a horse.

587
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,599
What makes a good horse?

588
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,199
But if you look at its skin from afar,

589
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,079
but the feet and legs up close.

590
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,280
Before the chest is wide,

591
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,360
but at the buttocks.

592
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,400
Do you think...

593
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,480
Do I look like your Takeda Shinjunji?

594
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,920
Great.

595
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,760
Alright.

596
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,599
You

597
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,400
you're really talented.

598
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,239
Good morning, Xiucai Qian!

599
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,280
Good morning, Chief Chen

600
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,840
where's the newspaper?

601
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,079
Here it comes.

602
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,480
Here are your new declaration and news report.

603
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,079
Alright

604
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,280
chief Chen

605
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,360
I remember you

606
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,480
the new application forms before.

607
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,119
You always forget about them here.

608
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,760
The new application form

609
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,679
has serialized Wang Dulu's martial arts novels.

610
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,039
He startled Kunlun.

611
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,079
I think you're addicted to it.

612
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,840
Well, I'll check it next time too.

613
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,800
Haven't you read your annals of the Eastern Zhou States?

614
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,639
But how can you read this book?

615
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,719
Of the story.

616
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:42,880
I like the story

617
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,519
love the story of saving Zhao by stealing the talisman.

618
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,679
You mean the Hou Ying of Wei?

619
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,480
Right.

620
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,239
It's that Hou Ying

621
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,480
he used to be

622
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,800
used to be a janitor.

623
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,559
She's also

624
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,440
but then

625
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,599
he became the follower of Lord Xinling

626
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,719
of Lord Xinling.

627
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,639
It is unexpected that

628
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,400
qian Xiucai also has the same ambition.

629
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,719
What ambition do I have?

630
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:03,679
I'm just blind and blind.

631
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,360
Your eyes?

632
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,280
Alright.

633
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,000
Got to go.

634
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,119
Director Ding,

635
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,960
I can go home by myself.

636
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,840
That won't do.

637
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,679
Mr. Yamashita specially told you

638
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
to get you home safely.

639
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,199
Alright.

640
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,760
Wasn't the light on just now?

641
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:48,519
Why was it off now?
