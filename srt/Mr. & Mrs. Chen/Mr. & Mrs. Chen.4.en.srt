1
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Jia Ping.

2
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:34,920
Jiaping.

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,079
Miss Zuo, you are here.

4
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,680
You two...

5
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,159
What are you doing?

6
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,599
Miss Zuo.

7
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,400
You were also kept in the dark like us?

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,519
Your boyfriend, Chen Jia Ping

9
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,480
Is a Communist.

10
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,159
That's impossible.

11
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,359
That's bullshit!

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,879
Family. Family. Family.

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,040
Family please.

14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Let go of me!

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,280
Come here!

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Jiaping.

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Second best.

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
What are you doing?

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,519
You hit a girl?

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,439
Jia Ping.

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,640
None of your business.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,359
Don't move

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,840
jia Ping.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Chen Jiaping.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,639
As long as you admit it,

26
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,599
we promise we won't give you a hard time.

27
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,879
Look, Ms. Zuo is here.

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,080
Don't make her worry.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Your Highness.

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Let go of her.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,319
Jia Ping.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Chen Jiaping.

33
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,919
You lied to me.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,759
Plead guilty.

35
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Fang,

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
come closer.

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,879
Get closer.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,039
What are you doing?

39
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,039
Chen Jiaping,

40
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,719
confess or not?

41
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,879
Luo Guanqun,

42
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,960
don't you call him buddies?

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,439
Why didn't you save him at the critical moment?

44
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,080
An undercover of the Communist Party of China?

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,159
Who can help him?

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,840
Jia Ping.

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,479
Family Ping.

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
Jia Ping.

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
Chen Jiaping,

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
or he'll be dead.

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,520
He confessed.

52
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,319
Let go of me!

53
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Please... Please.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,400
She's confessed.

55
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,240
Confess.

56
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,360
What are you doing?

57
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,159
Jia Ping,

58
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,960
when did he join the CCP?

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,439
His potential mission is.

60
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,199
Speak it out.

61
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,960
Jiaping.

62
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,240
I confessed, Captain Zhao.

63
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,399
But he didn't say I was the fourth of clubs.

64
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,920
What do you plead?

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,519
I made a mistake.

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,680
What?

67
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,600
What's wrong

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,360
I made a very important mistake.

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,879
What does this mean?

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,279
Captain Zhao.

71
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,000
All of this

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,079
was just a joke

73
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,759
that was just a joke.

74
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,800
What nonsense is this?

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
What are you doing?

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,560
The commander of the army under the mountain is already dead.

77
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,839
Captain Zhao.

78
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,800
The Commander of Military Division under the mountain is very resourceful.

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,240
How could he be killed so easily?

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Mr. Fang,

81
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,319
you are not a defector from the CPC at all.

82
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I should call you

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
the Commander of the Mountain Warrior.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
It's him.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,839
But the commander of the mountain

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
you're making such a big joke out of me.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
Chen Jiaping,

88
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,199
about my identity

89
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,480
my identity?

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,959
The Colonel.

91
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,600
You are wearing Fang Hongnan's clothing

92
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,839
I noticed that his cuff

93
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,879
on his cuff

94
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,560
Introductions

95
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,399
fang Hongnan is left-handed.

96
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,560
But you were smoking with your right hand

97
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,879
with your right hand.

98
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,959
So I think

99
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
you are right-handed.

100
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
What if

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,160
fang Hongnan is wearing someone else's clothes?

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,160
Certainly,

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
Is there anything wrong?

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,920
But I noticed something about him.

105
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,800
Your foot isn't injured.

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I found the gap between your thumb

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,920
between your thumb and other toes

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,199
this is where

109
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,600
who often wear wooden shoes.

110
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,000
Therefore,

111
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,360
you

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,839
Is not Fang Hongnan,

113
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,199
I bet you're the Commander of the Mountain Warriors.

114
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,399
Great!

115
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,120
It is unexpected that

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,279
your business

117
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,560
with a person

118
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,160
and bravery in the world.

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
The Commander of the Mountain Warrior,

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,920
It's great to see you still alive.

121
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,319
Chen Jiaping,

122
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,720
he just

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,439
a little trick

124
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,959
he wasn't cleared of his crimes.

125
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,720
I think

126
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
continue the trial

127
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,800
brilliant!

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,199
The setup by the Commander

129
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,439
was truly brilliant.

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,920
Has ruined the assassin's conspiracy,

131
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,160
but also gave Chen Jia Ping

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
has been trained.

133
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,639
But this time he passed the test.

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,959
I think this matter

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,360
can be over now.

136
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
It can't be.

137
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,240
The truth hasn't been revealed yet,

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,759
how can it be easily ended?

139
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,639
Everyone knows

140
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,040
luo Guanqun and Chen Jiaping are close friends.

141
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,319
He's just shielding him.

142
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,560
I am shielding him?

143
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,319
I'm thinking for the big picture.

144
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,199
What, what did you say just now?

145
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,759
To promote China-Japan friendship,

146
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
what if this gets out?

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,399
Even the top brass of Military Police won't accept it,

148
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,120
right?

149
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,480
We won't be unhappy.

150
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,600
As long as we figure it out,

151
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,519
she won't be unhappy.

152
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,480
Please trust me.

153
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,360
The Grand Commander.

154
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,199
What is your opinion?

155
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,439
Chen Jiaping is indeed suspicious,

156
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,120
but we don't have any evidence.

157
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,720
We can't wrong a person

158
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
that's loyal to Japan.

159
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,839
I think

160
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,319
with a talent like this

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,439
I think

162
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,480
we should

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,040
and put them in a position of trust.

164
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,240
Manager Luo,

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:21,959
that's right.

166
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,439
Let them go.

167
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,079
Yes

168
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,720
captain Zhao,

169
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,600
we can't let them go.

170
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
Four murders of clubs.

171
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,559
The Train Station assassination.

172
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,039
I'll give you one more month.

173
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,519
If you still can't solve the case,

174
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,399
you can have a try

175
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,240
my horse!

176
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,919
Or I will.

177
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,360
A group of traitors.

178
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,759
They are cruel and heartless.

179
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,360
Hey,

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,960
scold them. Leave me alone.

181
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll take you with me.

182
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
Look at yourself.

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Be a traitor.

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
What didn't he get?

185
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,240
He tortured her and interrogated her.

186
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,639
Resulting in your death. Is it worth it?

187
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,879
Lower your voice.

188
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,159
Don't you think I have enough trouble?

189
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,120
Jiaping.

190
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,879
What brought you here?

191
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,879
Are you alright?

192
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,679
Just go.

193
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,559
It's fine now.

194
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,519
It's going to be fun.

195
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,480
Try it next time.

196
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,440
Look, you're angry with me.

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,279
Guoguo.

198
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,639
If Manager Luo hadn't

199
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,679
to speak for me today,

200
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,480
zhao An is not yet endless.

201
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,559
So we should thank him.

202
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,799
Right?

203
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,519
Alright,

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,039
alright. Alright.

205
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:15,919
Miss Zuo,

206
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,440
I want to talk about work with Jiaping

207
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
don't be angry?

208
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Don't be mad.

209
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,000
You feel the same as your girlfriend.

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,120
For not helping you.

211
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,879
Are you angry with me?

212
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,519
You can tell that.

213
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,879
I really didn't know

214
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,480
fang Hong, South is the mountain.

215
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,159
Don't you know?

216
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,039
I swear that

217
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,720
think about it.

218
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,039
Zhao An is from Mu Cun,

219
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,759
can you tell me about their conspiracy?

220
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
We are in the same boat.

221
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,200
In the same boat?

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,519
Are you trying to hit me when I'm down?

223
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm not hitting you when you're down.

224
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,360
When Mu Cun was here,

225
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
I could only do what he said.

226
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,639
All I was thinking about was how to save you.

227
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,519
Old Luo,

228
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,919
do you still suspect

229
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,120
I'm the four of clubs?

230
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,759
Are you trying to test me?

231
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,759
Tell me yourself.

232
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,840
How could I suspect you?

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,559
Alright.

234
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,519
Let me tell you something.

235
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,799
You'll know whether I suspect you or not.

236
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,279
I don't want to listen to my...

237
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,200
After Fang Hongnan was poisoned,

238
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,720
he spared no expense to save him.

239
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,799
Tell him

240
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,159
he has a list

241
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,960
a list.

242
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,679
What list?

243
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
The Chinese Communist Party's sleeper list

244
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,320
It's now in the French Concession,

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,519
In the safe of Lumiere Bank

246
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,159
understood.

247
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,799
You want me to

248
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,080
get the list back for you?

249
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,120
Zhao An will get it soon.

250
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,840
I hope

251
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,200
you can take the lead

252
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,679
you first get it,

253
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,360
and then catch all the CCP

254
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,919
the list.

255
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,279
You think Zhao An is stupid?

256
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,679
We went out of our way

257
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,840
to catch all these communist parties.

258
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,200
Won't Zhao An suspect that we have the list?

259
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,519
He'll report to Kimun again.

260
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,720
Will you get fired?

261
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,480
I've already thought about it.

262
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,279
I'll spread false information.

263
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
Tell them that

264
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,399
have something to do with this fake list.

265
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,000
By then, we'll claim credit

266
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
zhao An is guilty.

267
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,000
Satisfy both sides

268
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,879
all right, Lao Luo.

269
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,000
She's not stupid.

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
That's why

271
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,279
how can I suspect that you are the four of clubs?

272
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,799
Could I tell you about this?

273
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,519
Alright.

274
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,440
I'll trust you for this time.

275
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,559
I'm so worried about you.

276
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,480
Come on.

277
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,360
Brother.

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,960
I think

279
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,480
we won't be able to solve

280
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,080
with our ability,

281
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,919
we won't find out why.

282
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,039
But don't worry.

283
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,480
We will use the old method.

284
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,000
And make some noises.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,799
Beat gongs and sound drums

286
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
by beating the drum.

287
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm not worried about four of clubs.

288
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,840
What are you worried about?

289
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,360
Chen Jia Ping.

290
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,840
Chen Jiaping,

291
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,919
luo Guanqun is a coward now.

292
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,759
And he's still a green turtle.

293
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,519
Do you think Luo Guanqun

294
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
luo Guanqun wants to be just a decoration?

295
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,679
He is just lying down

296
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,519
and looking for an opportunity to stage a comeback.

297
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,399
I thought

298
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,840
there is no capable person under him

299
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,440
unexpectedly,

300
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,799
I looked down upon him

301
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,159
right.

302
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,320
He was able to tell out Mr. Yamashita's disguise.

303
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,279
His ability is extraordinary.

304
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
He failed twice.

305
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,240
Oh, right.

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,879
Recently, you helped me follow someone.

307
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,080
Who?

308
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,399
The French Concession,

309
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,159
the president of Bank Lumiere.

310
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,679
Figure out a way

311
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,440
to get something on him.

312
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,919
I didn't expect Martial Master to be so cunning.

313
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,159
We were all tricked.

314
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,480
He must still have the secret letter.

315
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,279
But we have no chance to kill him now.

316
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,399
What should we do?

317
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,720
Evacuate and leave Shanghai immediately.

318
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,600
No way.

319
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,159
In that case,

320
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,320
little Hu.

321
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm Mingxuan.

322
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,799
For nothing.

323
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,600
Here you are.

324
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,480
Thank you.

325
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,559
What would you like to have?

326
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Two little white clouds, short peaks.

327
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,480
I didn't expect so many accidents.

328
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,759
Although Fang Hong Nan is dead,

329
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,360
but if the list is exposed,

330
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,879
hong Nan might even be in trouble.

331
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
Can you get the list back?

332
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,639
I'll think of something.

333
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,879
No, think of ideas.

334
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,200
The list is related to

335
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,080
the organization's life and death in Shanghai.

336
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,960
Yes

337
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,240
I promise I will complete the task.

338
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,360
Left Shuangtao.

339
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
Suspect you?

340
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,120
No, probably not.

341
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,600
Did you suspect her?

342
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,080
I did suspect her.

343
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,120
But after I investigated,

344
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,960
It seems she has something

345
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,799
she probably had nothing to do

346
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,600
with the assassination of the warrior.

347
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,399
What's your plan

348
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,600
handle the relationship between you and her?

349
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,200
Let's keep our relationship as lovers first.

350
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,000
It'll be good...

351
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,240
It will be a protection

352
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
It's a kind of protection.

353
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,039
And I'll find a chance

354
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,960
to end the relationship.

355
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,360
What do you mean...

356
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,879
The public end?

357
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,799
Or is it the end of your heart?

358
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,759
Do I want to end something in my heart?

359
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,440
Is this important?

360
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,799
Very important.

361
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,000
I also

362
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,360
so does my heart.

363
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,399
Alright.

364
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,440
Before that,

365
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,879
you must protect your identity.

366
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,320
You mustn't let Zuo Shuangtao suspect you.

367
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,080
Understood.

368
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,799
By the way, Lao Lu,

369
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,159
do you know the Shan plan?

370
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,000
Plan Shan.

371
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,960
We can finally go home early.

372
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,720
That's right.

373
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,359
She's been waiting here

374
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,039
for about half a month.

375
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,319
Right?

376
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,599
He's dead.

377
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Keep your mouth shut!

378
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,319
Miss,

379
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,839
we're off duty now.

380
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,759
Come on.

381
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,079
Miss.

382
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,759
The weather is getting cold.

383
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,039
Drink some hot water to avoid catching a cold.

384
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,359
Thank you.

385
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,599
This is fate.

386
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't mind the things you've missed.

387
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,559
Although I don't know what happened to you,

388
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,799
but I suggest you get things over with.

389
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
Maybe she doesn't know

390
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
they may not even know

391
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,960
they may not care about it.

392
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,519
What do you think?

393
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,119
You are so young.

394
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,119
You still have a long way to go.

395
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,480
Do you mean the end

396
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,079
the public end?

397
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,200
Or is it the end of your heart?

398
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,400
My heart wants to be over too.

399
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,400
Who told you that?

400
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,519
When did you come?

401
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,400
Why did you write these?

402
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
I wrote these for myself.

403
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,079
I'm happy.

404
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,359
Those are the so-called youth

405
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,759
what is the so-called youth

406
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,319
I know that

407
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,440
that you have suffered a lot.

408
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,119
I'll finish the rest by tonight.

409
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,519
You may leave first.

410
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,880
Alright.

411
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,880
I'll come back tomorrow.

412
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,720
Uncle Hai,

413
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,799
four comrades have found out

414
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,880
the traitor is named Fang Hongnan.

415
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,400
Has succeeded in eliminating traitors.

416
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
Fang Hong Nan.

417
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,079
He's not that simple.

418
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,039
Four of clubs got an intelligence

419
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
fang Hong Nan has a file

420
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,920
of some of the names

421
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,599
of its lurkers in Shanghai.

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,559
It seems that Fang Hong Nan

423
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,960
has prepared himself

424
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,640
to negotiate with the enemy.

425
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,839
Where is the list now?

426
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,599
The Bank of Lumiere in the French Concession.

427
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,240
Even a Japanese wouldn't dare

428
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,480
to mess around in French Concession

429
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,400
that's right.

430
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,599
The list hasn't been leaked out.

431
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,039
But time is limited.

432
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,319
I've asked Plum Blossom Four to do everything possible

433
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,759
to get the list back

434
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,400
before the enemies start taking actions.

435
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,519
Four of clubs.

436
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,400
Are you sure about this?

437
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,839
She has slept for a long time

438
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,400
based on my judgment,

439
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,720
I have confidence in him.

440
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,119
I can only rely on him now.

441
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,000
If anything goes wrong,

442
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
we'll be swept away.

443
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,000
We'll meet at Bund 13,

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,440
across the Customs Building.

445
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,160
8: 00 a.m. for 3 consecutive days.

446
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,200
Be there or be square.

447
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,279
Are you alright?

448
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,519
Got shot.

449
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,319
The bullet passed through your waist,

450
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,160
It's unhurt. It won't kill me.

451
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,440
It's good to be alive.

452
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,279
We are really out of luck.

453
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,559
We ran into a traitor at the train station.

454
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,680
It wasn't misfortune.

455
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,680
We fell for it.

456
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,960
The warrior under the mountain wasn't the one who was poisoned.

457
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,839
The secret letter is completely lost.

458
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,119
What should we do?

459
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,880
I know where it is.

460
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,119
Where is it?

461
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400
When I saw the corpse

462
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,880
In the morgue,

463
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,400
I found a button on his coat

464
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,079
was different from the other buttons.

465
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,039
I thought it was strange at the time.

466
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,000
Then I remembered that

467
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
that day in the woods near the business,

468
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,079
In the woods near the business,

469
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,160
there was a button

470
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,720
Is different from the other buttons.

471
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,400
Do you understand

472
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,279
they exchanged buttons.

473
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,359
So I infer that

474
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,160
that button is very important to him.

475
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,319
He carries it with him

476
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,559
no matter what he changed.

477
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,960
Now we know...

478
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,640
To stay here now?

479
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,960
There is a place

480
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,000
where we may get information about the mountain.

481
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,119
I can try.

482
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,119
You're scared?

483
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,000
Now the entire organization

484
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
Is taking money as a backup plan.

485
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,720
To resist Japan and save the country becomes an empty talk.

486
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,640
Only you are still so serious.

487
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,680
I will find a way.

488
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,000
Leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

489
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,599
Good morning.

490
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,000
Scholar, I'm asking you this.

491
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,680
In the past year,

492
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,119
did Chief Chen receive

493
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,400
from Wuhan?

494
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,880
There should be.

495
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,920
You are a gate keeper.

496
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,400
As a gate keeper?

497
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,839
Do you want to become the emperor?

498
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,519
Stop checking.

499
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,599
To ask you something.

500
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,039
If you received a letter from Wuhan.

501
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,759
Really?

502
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,039
Chief Chen is in charge of marketing and general affairs

503
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,839
he's got money

504
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,039
has been transferred from him.

505
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,000
He has more letters than other people.

506
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,440
There are letters from Wuhan.

507
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,599
Certainly.

508
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,480
Help me look for it.

509
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Look for it.

510
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,599
Miss Zuo.

511
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:34,880
Morning.

512
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,640
Miss Zuo.

513
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,000
You can't go in there.

514
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,599
I'm really sorry.

515
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,119
Today,

516
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,519
I can't let you in anymore.

517
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,160
Yesterday...

518
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,720
It's special.

519
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,519
Under normal circumstances,

520
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,799
no outsiders are allowed in.

521
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,680
Why should I?

522
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,519
This is the rule, Miss Zuo.

523
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,440
What are the rules of your firm?

524
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,519
You wronged Jia Ping

525
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,200
she got hurt

526
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,359
I can't even change some medicine.

527
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,839
I really need to reason with your manager.

528
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,559
I'll report to him. Do you believe it?

529
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,400
Xiucai Qian?

530
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,160
Miss Zuo is not an outsider.

531
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,480
Let Ms. Zuo go up there.

532
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,279
I can vouch for her.

533
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:13,400
Then...

534
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
All right.

535
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,079
Don't, don't stay too long.

536
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,640
OK, I know. Go back to your work.

537
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
- Goodbye. - Bye.

538
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,799
Thank you

539
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:21,720
don't mention it.

540
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,359
The horse!

541
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,039
The spoon.

542
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,039
Miss Zuo, please.

543
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:25,880
This way.

544
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,480
You're still here?

545
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,319
Chief Chen, I have something urgent

546
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,480
please sign here

547
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
I told you before that

548
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,559
this is wrong.

549
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,119
I can't sign it for you.

550
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,599
What's wrong?

551
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,079
If anyone enters French Concession,

552
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,799
you should report to Military Police Command

553
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,440
military Police Command?

554
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,599
Why didn't I hear about it before?

555
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm guessing that Captain Zhao has never told you.

556
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,519
Let me tell you something.

557
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,160
Being in our field,

558
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,799
we need to use our brains

559
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,279
read the newspaper as much as you can

560
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,640
learn more about the current situation.

561
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,240
What time is it?

562
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,440
Now it's a Japanese

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,680
negotiating with the Americans.

564
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,480
In such a delicate situation,

565
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,200
any sign of disturbance

566
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,920
will affect the international situation.

567
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,400
Besides, think about it

568
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,400
now the Japanese must be cautious

569
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
before entering the French Concession.

570
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:32,799
They have no way for us to get in

571
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,759
how can we get in when we want?

572
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,839
To put in as much money as we want.

573
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,759
Right?

574
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,079
Chief Chen, please figure out a way

575
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,759
how about this?

576
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,079
Take this

577
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,279
back to Captain Zhao.

578
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,960
When are you getting in?

579
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,920
When are you going out?

580
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,839
Where to go.

581
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,680
Get it back and I'll sign it for you.

582
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,079
I can't sign it otherwise.

583
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,160
Brother.

584
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,039
I didn't ask for trouble.

585
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,039
Even if I sign it,

586
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,039
take this to the military police headquarters.

587
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,519
The Japanese won't give it to you.

588
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,240
Right?

589
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,119
Go on.

590
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,680
It's so troublesome.

591
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,920
That's right.

592
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,839
I'm waiting for you. Hurry up.

593
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,279
It seems that

594
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,799
zhao An has got through

595
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,319
the Bank Lumiere.

596
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,759
He must have gone to the French Concession

597
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,000
for the list mentioned by Fang Hongnan.

598
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,240
If I can't use this to get back the list,

599
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm afraid I'll have no more chances in the future.

600
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,519
To wave a chicken feather as your token of authority.

601
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,440
That's right.

602
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,759
That President Pierre...

603
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,240
That President Pierre,

604
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,720
we spent so much money.

605
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,160
We can't let this guy

606
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,240
affect our plan.

607
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,039
It's not about money at all.

608
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,640
This is information that

609
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,279
to get this information from the CPC.

610
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,359
Brother.

611
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,839
I don't think the martial man in the mountain is that ordinary.

612
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,599
Rack one's brains to

613
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,599
but the traitor of CCP was poisoned to death.

614
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,119
What do you see?

615
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,519
Don't underestimate the warrior under the mountain.

616
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:13,000
He colluded with the Juntong official

617
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,240
and sell dirt in the Guomindang area.

618
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,880
And made a huge fortune.

619
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,799
We need to learn from him.

620
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,319
Miss Zuo.

621
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,960
What are you doing here?

622
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm looking for Chen Jia Ping.

623
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,000
Chen Jia Ping's office is on the second floor.

624
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,680
Why are you on the third floor?

625
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,319
I know.

626
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,240
I can't find the toilet.

627
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,559
Why is it so hard to find the toilet here?

628
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,079
There are so many men here.

629
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,000
The ladies room is only on the fourth floor.

630
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,640
Got it.

631
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,960
Who is it?

632
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,559
What's the matter?

633
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,240
My letter is gone.

634
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,839
It's gone?

635
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,240
Where did you put it?

636
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,200
In the bag.

637
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,559
A total of 12 letters.

638
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,960
Where did I disappear?

639
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,240
I found it

640
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,839
why did you come here with the letter?

641
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,599
To give it to you.

642
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,480
Didn't I tell you I would get it?

643
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,119
Also,

644
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,680
why did you come to the firm?

645
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
I thought to change your dressing.

646
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,640
And I'll bring it to you.

647
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,359
Do you know what place this is?

648
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm surrounded by eyes and ears.

649
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,079
Think carefully.

650
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,319
Could the letter be lost on the way?

651
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,759
No, that's not true

652
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,319
when I entered the room, I took a look

653
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,839
back then, I was still

654
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,359
then it's very possible that

655
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,559
that they're from here

656
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,720
and stole your letter.

657
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,440
Who would steal it?

658
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,839
Think it over.

659
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,799
Has anyone ever

660
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,359
that has come into contact with you?

661
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,440
When I first came in,

662
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,960
when I entered the room.

663
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,119
Then Dashao said it for me.

664
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,319
That's why he let me in.

665
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,279
With the horse scoop.

666
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,240
You came here with Scoop?

667
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,720
Yeah, but there's a distance between us.

668
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,039
Then Tai Ma Shao stole your letter.

669
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,160
He used to be a famous thief

670
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,000
the time you got here

671
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,440
Is enough for him to attack.

672
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,000
It was him who suspected the letter

673
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,279
and suspected the letter yesterday?

674
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,880
What should we do then?

675
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,799
Don't be ridiculous.

676
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,920
Let me think about it.

677
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,319
Do you have the date on the letter?

678
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,799
According to the dates of last year

679
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,519
have you processed the ink stains?

680
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,559
According to what you said,

681
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
and baked it.

682
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,319
Did you fold the letter?

683
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,200
Didn't you fold two letters?

684
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,599
I also folded the rest.

685
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,000
There were a few letters

686
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,079
I deliberately folded it several times

687
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,720
which caused the effect of repeated reading

688
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,039
and the paper,

689
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,440
I bought them from flea markets.

690
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,160
Although we have no envelope and postmark,

691
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,480
they won't suspect

692
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,079
they won't notice.

693
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,039
Would it be fine then?

694
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,799
There is another thing.

695
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,160
You wrote all these letters to me.

696
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,039
Why are these still in your hands?

697
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,640
There is only one explanation.

698
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:24,960
These letters

699
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,640
back by yourself?

700
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,240
But why?

701
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,720
Why would I do this?

702
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,880
We had a fight.

703
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,079
And you want to break up with me?

704
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,960
Ask for all these love letters back.

705
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,720
What made you fight?

706
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,680
It's about Lu Fang Fang?

707
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,000
When you came to my office just now,

708
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,319
when you came to my office.

709
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,480
I have an appointment with Lu Fangfang at 9 a.m.

710
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,000
I will pay the bill this month

711
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,599
you pretended you never came here.

712
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,720
But I wasn't here when you came looking for me.

713
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,680
You asked everyone about my whereabouts.

714
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,400
And you found me in the accounting room.

715
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,119
And then I found out

716
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,119
that's right.

717
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,719
Today you wanted to

718
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,679
to have a good talk with me.

719
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,480
To give me another chance.

720
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,000
But we never expect that

721
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
they caught us in the act.

722
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,519
I'll be right there.

723
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,119
In five minutes,

724
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,639
come find me in the accounting office,

725
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,199
didn't you ask me to sign

726
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,679
you want me to sign?

727
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,480
When will he come?

728
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,159
I will find you later.

729
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,039
I'll wait for you.

730
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:21,960
Come in.

731
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,880
Manager Luo,

732
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,920
guess what I've got.

733
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,239
What?

734
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,320
The letters that Zuo Shuangtao wrote to Chen Jiaping in the past year

735
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,599
but I think

736
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,960
It's forged.

737
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,000
It's a fake?

738
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,920
Do you still remember it?

739
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,559
Yesterday, I accompanied them to Yu Mansion

740
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,800
but Zuo Shuangtao's aunt

741
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
said something very strange.

742
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,519
Go there.

743
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,679
Every letter of Shuangtao mentions you.

744
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,239
But in recent years,

745
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,760
he didn't mention it much this year.

746
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,440
I thought you two...

747
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:53,960
Touch wood.

748
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,559
Look at my mouth.

749
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,679
I stole these letters

750
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:59,239
I stole these letters from Zuo Shuangtao's bag.

751
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,280
Think about this.

752
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
This is Zuo Shuangtao's letter to Chen Jiaping.

753
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,400
How did it end up in Zuo Shuangtao's bag?

754
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,719
They must have noticed

755
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,119
that I suspect them

756
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,880
that's why I forged the letters

757
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,480
you mean,

758
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
they didn't contact any

759
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,440
In the past year.

760
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,039
Maybe they've broken up.

761
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,599
Meeting at the train station

762
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,719
that we met by chance.

763
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,880
That's right.

764
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,280
It also means they really have ulterior motives.

765
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,920
That's why they forged these.

766
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,199
Where's the letter?

767
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,320
It's not that.

768
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,559
I saw that I put it in this bag.

769
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,719
Let me think.

770
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,639
I stole Zuo Shuangtao's letter.

771
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,840
And then I went back to the office

772
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,480
there's no problem with a cursory glance

773
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,639
so I put it in the bag in case someone saw

774
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,840
so we went to find you.

775
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,960
That's why

776
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,480
I went to the toilet.

777
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
And then I went to the toilet.

778
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,679
I wanted to do a big one.

779
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,079
I was busy, so I...

780
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,079
I put it on the partition board

781
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:12,960
on the partition board

782
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,559
was swapped.

783
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:19,559
She can't.

784
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,400
No one was there when I entered.

785
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,000
Big spoon!

786
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,079
You were going to win credit.

787
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,519
But now you are ruined by a piece of shit.

788
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,000
Mr. Luo, talk to me.

789
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,880
The point is...

790
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,199
When

791
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,559
whenever you have to have a stomachache.

792
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,000
Not good enough now?

793
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The main point is

794
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,599
disappointed?

795
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Big scoop!

796
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,239
Chen Jiaping,

797
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,840
you don't have to deny it now, right?

798
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,800
Why should I deny it?

799
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,760
I didn't do anything.

800
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,800
How can I blame you?

801
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,599
Take off all your clothes.

802
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,000
You still said that you didn't do anything.

803
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,039
I told you.

804
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,159
I just tried on sweaters, right?

805
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,480
Lu Fangfang tried on the sweater for me out of kindness.

806
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:56,800
I tried on sweaters?

807
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,639
To knit.

808
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,480
Just keep making it up,

809
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,400
what am I going to make up?

810
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,440
What can I make up?

811
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,800
They all know it.

812
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,679
Nothing happened between Lu Fangfang and me.

813
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,960
Yesterday after we argued,

814
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,400
I want all the letters I wrote to you back.

815
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,360
I want to have them all burned.

816
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,800
I'm the one to blame.

817
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,239
I can't bear to part with her.

818
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,880
After all, it's about our memories.

819
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,920
That's why I'm here today

820
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,719
I still had the slightest illusion about you.

821
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,599
What about you?

822
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,800
In that woman's office,

823
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,360
he took off his clothes.

824
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,400
Didn't I tell you that

825
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,280
I took off my clothes to try on sweaters.

826
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,400
Then she got

827
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,480
what is she touching?

828
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,800
Slander others.

829
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,079
That was not touching.

830
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,400
She hugged me from behind

831
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,360
just to see my waist and chest size

832
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,880
you even got that back?

833
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,239
You're really something!

834
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,280
Chen Jiaping returned the letters to Zuo Shuangtao?

835
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,159
I don't care.

836
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,239
Guoguo, I'm telling you.

837
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,039
We agreed to meet today.

838
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:46,039
You must apologize to Lu Fang Fang later

839
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,639
If you don't apologize to her,

840
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,000
I can't work here. I'll...

841
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:48,599
You know?

842
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,760
Ask her to come down.

843
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Ask her to come down.

844
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,599
Why did she come down?

845
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,360
You should apologize to him.

846
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,719
Why did you ask him to come down?

847
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,480
Why should I apologize?

848
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,840
You scolded him?

849
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,920
You don't apologize to him.

850
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,000
Am I wrong then?

851
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,239
Fang Fang, go up there.

852
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,559
I must ask Zuo Shuangtao to apologize to you.

853
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,280
Miss Zuo.

854
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,199
You're mistaken

855
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,679
I didn't mean anything else.

856
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,960
It's just

857
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,400
to show my concern for Jiaping.

858
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,320
He always cares about me.

859
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,679
It's just that colleagues care about each other.

860
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,199
Listen to what he said.

861
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,679
Listen to what he said.

862
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,239
And look at your attitude.

863
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,280
Guoguo, quickly apologize to him.

864
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,960
After you apologize,

865
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,639
this matter will be over.

866
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,719
Alright.

867
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,920
I apologize to you

868
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,079
I'm sorry, Fang Fang

869
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,800
you're indeed better

870
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:39,760
It's my fault.

871
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,159
For not taking good care of Jianping.

872
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,199
You even knitted a sweater for him.

873
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,079
As for me,

874
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,480
I didn't even notice them.

875
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,360
It's getting cold.

876
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,800
He will need a sweater.

877
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,280
In the future,

878
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,199
with you by his side,

879
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,800
I'm at ease.

880
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,039
Zuo Shuangtao, don't cross the line.

881
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,760
You are getting excited!

882
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
Chen Jiaping,

883
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,920
with that kind of attitude,

884
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,480
from today on,

885
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,400
let's break up for good.

886
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:06,880
Check on it!

887
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,320
Come on.

888
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,760
It's fine to break up.

889
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,039
Can't you coax an angry girl?

890
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:13,760
I won't.

891
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,480
I'll coax her.

892
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,119
To...

893
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Just go.

894
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,440
Alright.

895
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,159
Go on.

896
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Luo Guanqun, are you really my eldest brother?

897
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,239
Guoguo, listen to me.

898
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,599
Listen to my explanation.

899
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,239
Right.

900
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
You'd still be angry

901
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,400
you should still be angry.

902
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Got it?

903
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,639
Then our play

904
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,639
has been played out completely, right?

905
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,960
We have been together for so many years.

906
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,519
To break up because of this?

907
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,719
Isn't enough.

908
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,159
But during this period, we need to keep the cold war.

909
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,159
Don't meet each other.

910
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,760
You shouldn't come to the firm to meet me.

911
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,679
You never wanted to see me anyway.

912
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,920
You got into character quickly.

913
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,119
Do you think

914
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,239
I got into character?

915
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,000
In short,

916
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,320
I'll find an opportunity

917
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,159
to make our relationship

918
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:26,519
to our relationship

919
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,199
In the future.

920
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,159
Then...

921
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,199
I haven't finished.

922
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,360
Don't follow me. Get lost.

923
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,840
Are they real?

924
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,119
They're both real and fake

925
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:05,639
chief Chen

926
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,519
where have you been? I've been looking for you all day

927
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,079
take a look at this.

928
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,000
Fill in the form.

929
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,559
The entry time is 14: 30 a.m.

930
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:17,320
And leave at 1510.

931
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,239
Alright, got it.

932
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,360
I'll get it stamped at the Military Police Headquarters.

933
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,159
Be sure to give it to me before noon.

934
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:31,960
Old Luo.

935
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,239
Can I ask for a leave?

936
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Where is Left Shuangtao?

937
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,639
Made up? You two?

938
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,639
Not at all.

939
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,360
I guess this time,

940
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,679
be ruined this time.

941
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,599
I want to ask for a leave.

942
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,400
I'm going to the military police headquarters

943
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,639
to get Erdao stamped.

944
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,320
After that,

945
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,719
I'll go find my girlfriend.

946
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,639
All right.

947
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,159
Go back to your work.

948
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,239
Go back to your work.

949
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,320
