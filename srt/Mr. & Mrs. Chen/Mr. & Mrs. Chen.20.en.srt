1
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,319
Jiang Zhaoguo.

2
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,719
Stop fighting!

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,879
Stop fighting!

4
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,719
Go get the knife!

5
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,319
The knife?

6
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,040
Get the knife!

7
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,799
Go get a knife!

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Why are you standing there?

9
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,719
The knife.

10
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,199
The knife is here.

11
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,919
Kill him!

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,919
Hurry up!

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,159
Kill them all!

14
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,479
Kill him.

15
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,400
Kill him now!

16
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,039
Hurry!

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,319
What are you waiting for?

18
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,080
Kill him now!

19
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,919
Hurry up.

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,919
Dispose of this corpse for me quickly.

21
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
What are you waiting for?

22
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,280
Hurry up.

23
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,439
Hurry up!

24
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,159
Get in the car.

25
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,599
Why did you come home so late?

26
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,759
Haven't you heard that

27
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,520
something serious happened to our firm recently.

28
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,840
I caught a faceless Communist Party member.

29
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,680
And he was the head of a traffic station.

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
That's quite a rank.

31
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,520
But I didn't expect that

32
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
the underground party member

33
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,039
Is the boss of Yumo Calligraphy and Painting, Boss Lu.

34
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,520
He's an underground member of the CPC.

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
What a surprise.

36
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
Underground CCP members

37
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,439
cPC spies are everywhere.

38
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,439
Since he's our leader,

39
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,120
he must have a lot of intelligence.

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
That will be another great merit

41
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,000
another great achievement.

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
What information?

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,199
For what?

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,839
To protect his fellows,

45
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,040
he didn't say a word.

46
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,199
Die rather than submit

47
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,199
I've heard that

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,839
the CCP people are all brave.

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,839
Watch.

50
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,399
These are the information of Mr. Lu

51
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,439
and hearing record

52
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,839
I have to sort them out.

53
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,120
I need to give them to Luo tomorrow.

54
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
How to do this?

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
I'll sleep for a while.

56
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,680
We'll talk later.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,959
Sleep early.

58
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,560
Why did you change your phone number?

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,199
I can't find you anywhere.

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,959
I don't want to see you again.

61
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,519
Why?

62
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,480
You ask me why?

63
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
Can't you see what you have done?

64
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,879
How long are you going to lie to me?

65
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,279
You

66
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,120
knew it?

67
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,439
I don't have any feelings for that woman.

68
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,800
She's the daughter of President Liu.

69
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
I just need her

70
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
to help me finish something.

71
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,800
You can say it so righteously.

72
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,160
The position I'm in now...

73
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I have to make good use of

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,040
power at my side.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,839
That I can't do anything about it.

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,639
You don't know politics.

77
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,360
You're too innocent.

78
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,360
However,

79
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,279
this is why I love you.

80
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,720
You love me?

81
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,879
You still say that now.

82
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,120
Isn't that ironic?

83
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,720
Can we not talk about this for now?

84
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,959
Ding Qiuyang works for the martial man under the mountain.

85
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm here on a top-secret mission.

86
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,959
If he finds out,

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,839
I'll know I'm in Shanghai.

88
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,480
Do you know

89
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,680
that should be enough.

90
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,560
Hold on.

91
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,800
How do you know that

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
working for the mountain?

93
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,879
When you introduced me to him,

94
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,879
you only told me that he's a director.

95
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,720
Let's get rid of the body first.

96
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,160
Alright?

97
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,079
It's not good.

98
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,000
I want you to tell me now.

99
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,360
Alright.

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
Let me tell you then.

101
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,040
That day at the Hollywood Bar,

102
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,120
I saw people under the mountain.

103
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,839
Why did you come there?

104
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
I was forced.

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,079
I had a very important document in my hand.

106
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,959
He said that if I brought you with me,

107
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,199
he would send me to the Military Police Headquarters.

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,399
So the truth is

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,560
you actually sold me.

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,079
Right?

111
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,439
What are you talking about?

112
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,480
How can I sell you?

113
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,160
I thought

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,959
you really didn't have a choice

115
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,480
that you can't take me away?

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
I didn't expect that it was a conspiracy you two discussed.

117
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,839
What conspiracy?

118
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,639
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
I know.

120
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,120
I know you won't give up your career.

121
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
Yamashita said I could help you with your career.

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
So I thought

123
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,639
It's a good thing

124
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,360
for you to stay in Shanghai?

125
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,399
You're shameless.

126
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,279
Cold Dew!

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,639
Cold Dew?

128
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,360
Cold Dew?

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,959
What are you doing?

130
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,159
Let go of me.

131
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,600
Why?

132
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Why?

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,519
Why do you hurt me like this?

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,279
Calm down, OK?

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,919
Let's get rid of the body first.

136
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,039
After I finish the body.

137
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,960
Please?

138
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,759
You know what?

139
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
If the Japanese know I'm coming to Shanghai,

140
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
they know I'm in Shanghai.

141
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,279
Got it?

142
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,120
You break my heart.

143
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,399
Lu Yousheng.

144
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,399
Right.

145
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,639
The way of light.

146
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,840
In 1927,

147
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,600
In 1927.

148
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
Why join the Communist Party?

149
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,679
For faith.

150
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,399
Do you know what faith is?

151
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,559
Of course I don't.

152
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Their names.

153
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,200
You think I'll tell them?

154
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,480
Of course I have family.

155
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Who doesn't have family?

156
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,600
It's just that I wasn't able to protect them.

157
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
I have a mission.

158
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,759
I have many missions.

159
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Since I believe in and ism,

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
what they believe.

161
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,519
I'll tell you something you can understand then.

162
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,759
My mission is

163
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,240
Is to make every Chinese

164
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,039
that when they come home,

165
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,919
they didn't see fear

166
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,840
nor despair.

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
Nor the cold corpses of his wife and children.

168
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
All he sees are the smiling faces of family.

169
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,679
He sees happiness.

170
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,399
And hope.

171
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,679
This...

172
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,279
Is my mission.

173
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,039
The task of every one of our Communists

174
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,120
got it?

175
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,159
The words I said?

176
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,200
Yes

177
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,000
I haven't waited for that day to come.

178
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,120
But someone will.

179
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,279
Four hundred million Chinese people will wait till that day.

180
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,840
That day

181
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,720
Is called new China.

182
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,759
Could it be that someone stole the corpse?

183
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,360
Ding Qiuyang didn't die at all.

184
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,120
I was too careless.

185
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,080
Why did you have to kill Ding Qiuyang?

186
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,360
I come to Shanghai this time

187
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,360
to negotiate

188
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
with someone named Magpie.

189
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,519
He has something that I want.

190
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
But the Japanese

191
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,279
the Japanese want that too.

192
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,440
The Japanese

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,200
In Chongqing.

194
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,360
So they already knew

195
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,039
chongqing sends people to Shanghai.

196
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,679
But they don't know

197
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,320
that I'm the one who sent her.

198
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,200
If Ding Qiuyang

199
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,039
my identity to the Japanese,

200
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,679
they even said

201
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
the Japanese found the Magpie before me.

202
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,840
Then my mission is a complete failure.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,080
I can go down the mountain to test it.

204
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,679
Test what?

205
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,320
Did Ding Qiuyang find Yamashita?

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
And if he knows all this.

207
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,000
You can't go.

208
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,399
That's too dangerous.

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,320
She won't.

210
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,159
Why not?

211
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
Because the mountain loves me.

212
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,720
What did you say

213
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,559
he loves me.

214
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,480
Maybe he

215
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,519
more than you do.

216
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,919
And Qian Xiucai?

217
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
The newspaper.

218
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,600
Come on.

219
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,320
A new application.

220
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,000
News report.

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,519
Got it.

222
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,279
Alright.

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
That's not right.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,399
Where is one page missing?

225
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,600
How could there be a page missing?

226
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,759
But the serialization page is missing.

227
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,039
Hurry.

228
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,840
Help me find it.

229
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,120
Let me look for her then.

230
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
This story is at the right moment.

231
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,840
Zhenfei wanted to kill Jiang Xiaohe,

232
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,279
jiang Xiaohe didn't know that he wanted to kill someone.

233
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,120
No, he didn't.

234
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,480
Nothing.

235
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,559
How about this?

236
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,519
I delivered the newspapers of Captain Zhao and Mr. Luo

237
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,759
I've brought them to their door.

238
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,879
Borrow it from them.

239
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,440
That makes sense.

240
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,200
You're finally back.

241
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,559
Captain.

242
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,519
I've cleaned the office.

243
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,919
We are returning to a new atmosphere.

244
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,080
Open the door to welcome the distance

245
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,519
chief Chen

246
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
what are you doing?

247
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,440
Captain Zhao.

248
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,440
You are back.

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,879
Surprise?

250
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,279
Congratulations.

251
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,159
Congratulations.

252
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll look for the newspaper here.

253
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
There's no need to find the newspaper.

254
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,480
The martial arts fiction published in the new application

255
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,639
the crane startled the Kunlun.

256
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,759
I don't know why the one I ordered isn't there.

257
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,720
Qian Xiucai said all the newspapers were here.

258
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,879
So I came to look for them.

259
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,720
Did you find it?

260
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,759
We found it.

261
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,840
It's here.

262
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,559
Look.

263
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,720
The crane startled Kunlun.

264
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
Since Captain Zhao is back,

265
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,639
I won't use the newspaper anymore.

266
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,480
I'll put it here.

267
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,720
Please let me know when you're done.

268
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,559
I'll come to get it.

269
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll leave now.

270
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,159
I'm off.

271
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Congratulations.

272
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,559
Boss, what do you want?

273
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,080
Take off your clothes.

274
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,200
Old Luo.

275
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,159
Old Luo.

276
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,639
How can you still sit?

277
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,679
What's up

278
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,559
zhao An.

279
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,799
You don't know that?

280
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,960
Of course I know.

281
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,519
We caught an important CCP figure.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,240
But we don't get any reward.

283
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,360
Zhao An is back to work.

284
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,200
Why?

285
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,559
I expected that.

286
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,200
Do you think Kimura will always let him raise horses?

287
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,919
You mean that

288
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,200
you know how to deal with Zhao An already?

289
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,240
And watch.

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,200
And see what happens.

291
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,639
Such a cunning fox!

292
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,559
Very cunning.

293
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,480
What are you looking for?

294
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,759
I found it. It's found.

295
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,679
There's another serial to watch.

296
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,399
What?

297
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,159
Zhenfei or can't he do it?

298
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,120
The suspense is about to be revealed.

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,960
I still don't feel like the taste here.

300
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,720
I especially opened the window and got some fresh air yesterday.

301
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,080
What's wrong?

302
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
Something's wrong.

303
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,240
It's not right

304
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,559
It just doesn't taste right.

305
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
There's no smell of horse manure.

306
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,720
You might not be used to it.

307
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,599
Brother.

308
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,599
Once we leave,

309
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
what will happen to Little Doudou in the future?

310
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,440
You can forget about Little Doudou.

311
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,319
Chief Kimura is going to ride it away.

312
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,079
It'll be a Japanese horse in the future.

313
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,079
It has a better life than us.

314
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,559
That won't do.

315
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,160
But how could the Japanese know Little Bean's habit?

316
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,359
The little bean likes to eat alfalfa.

317
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,559
It doesn't love beans.

318
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,039
It likes rubber horse brush

319
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,599
doesn't like an iron comb.

320
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,039
Then you can leave with them.

321
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,880
Cut the crap!

322
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,599
Horses make you bored.

323
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,720
What else can I do with you?

324
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:46,960
The tree trunk.

325
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,920
This time, Chuan and Laizi

326
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,079
this time.

327
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,640
I'll officially hire them.

328
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
I'll reorganize my team.

329
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:56,799
Yes

330
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
I slapped you.

331
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
I have never been humiliated like this

332
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
to be humiliated like this.

333
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,039
Or I'll beat myself up.

334
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,559
Luo Guanqun,

335
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,759
remember that.

336
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,119
To humiliate Luo Guanqun,

337
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,160
we have to start with Chen Jiaping.

338
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
He walked away at the teahouse,

339
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
and instigated the ambush at the bookstore.

340
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,279
And the way he caught the negotiators last time.

341
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,759
Every time when something bad happens,

342
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,720
there must be him.

343
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,119
By the way,

344
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,480
which paper did Tian publish

345
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,480
was published last time?

346
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,200
A new declaration

347
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,480
right.

348
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,640
The new declaration serial publishes martial arts novels.

349
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,680
The crane startled the Kunlun.

350
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,759
I don't know why the one I ordered isn't there.

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,839
Qian Xiucai said all the newspapers were here.

352
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,119
I'm here to look for it.

353
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,319
The missing person article

354
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,759
Is the secret code for the CCP.

355
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,960
That's why Chen Jiaping

356
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,039
find the new application?

357
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,559
Chuan told Laizi that

358
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,279
when they were squatting at Yu Mo Calligraphy Store,

359
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,440
chen Jia Ping also came.

360
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,519
He moved away some treasures of the Study

361
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,160
do you think he has some ulterior motive?

362
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,559
Ask Xiucai Qian to come here.

363
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,400
Yes

364
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,359
captain Zhao.

365
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,559
It's strange

366
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,839
chief Chen

367
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,880
never liked to read new applications before

368
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,400
they say it is all cliche.

369
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,759
But lately,

370
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,000
pay special attention to the new application.

371
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,000
He asks me if the newspaper is there as soon as it comes.

372
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,599
Got it.

373
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,720
Please leave.

374
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,759
Hold on.

375
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,480
Don't tell anyone

376
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,319
I asked you about.

377
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,079
Got it?

378
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,640
Got it.

379
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
Captain Zhao,

380
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,160
do you think my observation

381
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,480
good observation?

382
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,079
It's not bad.

383
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,119
Captain Zhao.

384
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,359
Although I'm just a concierge,

385
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,119
I'm able to do

386
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,160
and other things.

387
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,079
What else do you want to do?

388
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,680
You're the manager.

389
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,759
Such a joke.

390
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,720
Captain Zhao.

391
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,119
Just let me know if you need anything.

392
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:33,920
I'm leaving now

393
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,920
why did Chen Jiaping rush to read

394
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,720
the new application report these days?

395
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,480
Because Lao Lu is his superior.

396
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,440
When Lu's death,

397
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,880
a new superior will try to contact him

398
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,880
the secret code for the contact

399
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,200
was on the new application form

400
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,400
but these

401
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,119
notices, obituaries, statements...

402
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,920
I don't even know which one is the secret code

403
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,559
we can't read it.

404
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,319
We can't read it.

405
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,799
No one would.

406
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,960
It's an authentic Bordeaux wine.

407
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,599
It's been a while since I tasted it

408
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,319
captain Zhao.

409
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,640
Try it.

410
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,839
I don't want it.

411
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,240
If you like them,

412
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,559
I will have a few bottles sent here.

413
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,039
It's a deal

414
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,319
I've been staying here for several days

415
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,720
but we agreed that

416
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,279
kimura from the military police headquarters would come to see me.

417
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,279
We haven't seen him since then.

418
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,640
I've already told Chief Kimura.

419
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,200
It's just that...

420
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,599
Just what?

421
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,720
Brother Huang, to tell you the truth,

422
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
your gift is not sincere enough?

423
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,720
I have given you the list of No. 5 transit stop.

424
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,200
Isn't this enough?

425
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Although several people were arrested,

426
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,960
but they are just small potatoes.

427
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,400
The Military Police Command has a big appetite now.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,039
It's the code for Yumo Calligraphy and Painting Shop's security.

429
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,240
I've also given it to you.

430
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,640
No one was caught.

431
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,480
That's not my fault, right?

432
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
Four of clubs

433
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,200
have you heard of this name?

434
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,319
Four of clubs in clubs.

435
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,480
His Majesty?

436
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,640
This CCP whose code is four of clubs

437
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,240
has been lurking in Taihe Business for a long time.

438
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,240
I have

439
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,640
a clear target of suspicion.

440
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,319
As long as you help me find the evidence,

441
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,440
I promise

442
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,440
not only will you meet with Officer Kimura,

443
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,160
I'll fulfill all the promises

444
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,599
and I won't break my promise.

445
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,480
But I don't know him.

446
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,640
How can I help you?

447
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,400
Read the newspaper for me?

448
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
What do you mean?

449
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,039
The notice board...

450
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,200
This is the missing person article you are looking for...

451
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,119
Why?

452
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,960
To find my brother, to pay Danian

453
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,720
are our secret code.

454
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,079
Go on.

455
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,960
We've arrived in Shanghai for several days.

456
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,519
This is a message for contact.

457
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,799
To your original address 220.

458
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,279
This is the time.

459
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,279
2: 20 this afternoon.

460
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,279
The second brother Zhou Jian

461
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,960
shanming missed you so much.

462
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,920
The Boat.

463
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,960
And mountains?

464
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,359
Is there a place in Shanghai where the word "boat" and "mountain" are added?

465
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,839
Zhoushan Park?

466
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,960
The rendezvous point is Zhoushan Park

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,759
that's right

468
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm staying on the fifth floor of Pujiang Hotel.

469
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,920
Pujiang is a water related place.

470
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,000
Is there a pond in Zhoushan Park?

471
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,720
I've been to Zhoushan Park before.

472
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,559
The pond.

473
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,279
There's no water.

474
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
Any place with water

475
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,920
with water,

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,279
next to the fountain.

477
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
The fifth floor is the fifth bench.

478
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,039
It means at 2: 20 this afternoon,

479
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,519
at the fifth bench next to

480
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,480
at the fifth bench next to the fountain

481
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,480
It must be the CCP's

482
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,920
good luck to you

483
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,799
cheers.

484
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,799
See you later.

485
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,200
There you go.

486
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:05,839
Thanks.

487
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,440
Come again.

488
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:10,759
Alright.

489
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,400
Why did you stop the mission?

490
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,200
You missed the best chance.

491
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,480
But I have found the clues.

492
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
Give me one more day.

493
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,680
This is an order

494
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,400
alright.

495
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,640
Then tell me

496
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,000
what is that which Magpie has.

497
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,400
It doesn't matter to tell you.

498
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,640
It's the formula.

499
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,119
The formula?

500
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,920
Right.

501
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,119
The Communist Party of China

502
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,039
gradually issue the Border Currency

503
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,079
to issue the Border Currency

504
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,519
they wanted to replace the legal currency gradually

505
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,400
and establish their own financial system.

506
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,599
They also developed

507
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,119
special paper for banknote printing

508
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,640
which made it extremely difficult to counterfeit.

509
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,319
Therefore, the Juntong

510
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,000
sent two agents to lurk in Yan'an

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,880
to investigate the printing

512
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,599
and distribution of the coins.

513
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,039
That Magpie is one of them.

514
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,880
But I didn't expect this person

515
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
the person threatened us

516
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,200
he threatened that

517
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,359
he wants us to buy him off?

518
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,200
How come there's such a loser in the military.

519
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,880
Chongqing can't wait.

520
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,920
They need to get the formula as soon as possible.

521
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,519
Therefore, Boss Dai

522
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,880
has agreed to his astronomical price.

523
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,720
His people have reached Shanghai.

524
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,759
They will make the transaction as soon as possible.

525
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,599
I don't understand

526
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,000
why do we need the formula of the currency printing paper?

527
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,039
Once we forge a counterfeit

528
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,599
which can be fake as real ones,

529
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,359
and invest it in the border region.

530
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,359
Then the financial system

531
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,200
that the CPC has just established

532
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,200
will collapse in an instant.

533
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
We don't need to fire a shot

534
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,039
without firing a shot.

535
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,559
But isn't that

536
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,319
to completely violate

537
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,680
declaration of Cooperation?

538
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,319
You're so naive.

539
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Have the Kuomintang and the Communist Party ever cooperated?

540
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,119
Previously, they limited all parties to dissolve all parties,

541
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
now you're really anti-communist.

542
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,759
In the Communist Party,

543
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,480
there are many brave and fearless soldiers.

544
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,640
Who risked their lives

545
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,119
to resist Japan and save the country.

546
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,799
They were our comrades

547
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,480
we're exposing our comrades to enemy from all sides.

548
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,680
How is that different from the rebels?

549
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,160
Your thoughts are terrifying.

550
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,960
Do you want to be a traitor?

551
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,799
So who is the traitor?

552
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,519
Please confirm.

553
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,039
That's the fifth bench?

554
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,960
Let's pretend to be chatting here

555
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,839
once Chen Jiaping and his contact show up,

556
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,880
and the contact man show up.

557
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,039
I'm sure Chen Jiaping won't escape this time.

558
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,319
Look at his dress.

559
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,519
It's him

560
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,680
he sat on the fifth bench

561
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,000
he must be here to meet people

562
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,799
what should we do?

563
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,160
The person hasn't shown up yet.

564
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,759
Chen Jia Ping is leaving.

565
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,680
It can't be.

566
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,440
Just now,

567
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,319
his hands went under the bench.

568
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,119
He probably didn't come for a rendezvous.

569
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,359
He must have finished exchanging information.

570
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,640
Arrest him now.

571
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,359
Catch him red-handed!

572
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,559
Move it!

573
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,440
Hurry up!

574
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Hurry up!

575
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,759
Hurry!

576
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,279
Don't move!

577
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,119
Don't move.

578
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,640
Show me your hands.

579
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,799
Chen Jiaping,

580
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,720
do you want to deny it this time?

581
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,880
You

582
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,400
captain Zhao.

583
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,440
You are everywhere!

584
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
Why are you here?

585
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,319
What are you doing here?

586
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,759
I asked why you are here.

587
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,920
Why are you holding the gun to me?

588
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,400
Did you get the gun license in French Concession?

589
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,359
And took something under the bench?

590
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,079
Bench?

591
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,359
There's nothing here.

592
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,680
Search me.

593
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,440
Captain.

594
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,599
This is their place.

595
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,519
Are you sure you want to do this?

596
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,599
We have the ability.

597
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:29,880
Search him.

598
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,519
Go.

599
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,720
Search the bench.

600
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:39,839
Nothing.

601
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,519
There you are.

602
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,519
Sheriff Clement.

603
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,000
What about you?

604
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,519
What are you doing here?

605
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,680
Inspector.

606
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,519
There was a misunderstanding.

607
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:57,720
That's right.

608
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,319
Right?

609
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,480
Here is the thing.

610
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,200
Where's Sheriff Clement?

611
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
He'll be back in France for a period of time.

612
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,400
He asked me to look after his dog.

613
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,400
Chief Clermont walks his dog here every day.

614
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,440
So I just want to meet him here.

615
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,000
What?

616
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:07,960
Captain Zhao.

617
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:08,960
You have a problem with it?

618
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,720
You have no opinion.

619
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,119
I have no comments.

620
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,039
No. You pointed a gun at me just now.

621
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,480
What are you doing?

622
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,519
You want to shoot me?

623
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,839
You got it wrong?

624
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,160
Put all your guns away.

625
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,319
Since you got it wrong,

626
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,440
mind your own business.

627
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,359
Sheriff Clement.

628
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,000
Have a safe trip back to France.

629
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,000
Thank you.

630
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,200
See you

631
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,759
see you

632
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,839
huang Jinming, head of the 5th traffic station.

633
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,759
He mutinied after being arrested.

634
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,279
Many comrades were betrayed by him

635
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,559
were either arrested or sacrificed.

636
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,519
What a terrible loss!

637
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,759
Please find out Jinming's whereabouts

638
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,000
and report to the organization as soon as possible.

639
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,079
In case of an emergency,

640
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,279
call this number 6542.

641
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,000
Hang up after one ring.

642
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,079
Call again.

643
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,960
Parrot,

644
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,079
to Jinhuangming's level,

645
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,160
he can decipher the code.

646
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,119
But he doesn't know

647
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,599
he contacted the police before he was arrested

648
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,200
he activated the emergency plan

649
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,319
so the secret code for parrot to contact me

650
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,319
has been changed to secondary code.

651
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,160
His signature.

652
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,559
But maybe we can use this to

653
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,720
to find out whether Huang Jinming

654
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,680
If Huang Jinming is in Luo Guanqun's hands or Zhao An's.

655
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,359
The first thing...

656
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,119
Go to the new declaration...

657
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,480
Publish the contents of the paper in an announcement.

658
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,759
But it must be published tomorrow.

659
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,480
The second thing...

660
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,160
What are you doing? Look at me.

661
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,559
It should be fine.

662
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,960
Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

663
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,160
You disguised as me

664
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,240
go to Zhoushan Park

665
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:22,960
what?

666
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,599
But if someone finds out

667
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,640
If that person is you,

668
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,240
you must think of a reason

669
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,359
and tell them why you're here.

670
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,680
Waiter/Waitress

671
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:06,960
hello

672
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,840
where are the guests in Room 612?

673
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,119
The gentleman just went out.

674
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,000
Will he lie to us?

675
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,920
What secret code?

676
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,960
Is not right at all.

677
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,760
He's not that bold.

678
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Something must have gone wrong.

679
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,960
And ask him about it when he comes back.

680
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,760
She's pretty bold.

681
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,800
How dare you go out.

682
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,239
You are new here.

683
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,280
I haven't seen you before.

684
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,920
It is your first day to work.

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,039
She just came.

686
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,199
Thank you for your attention.

687
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,880
What are you bringing?

688
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,159
The guest in Room 612 needs soap.

689
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,760
It's over there.

690
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,719
Is this it?

691
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,519
The soap is damp.

692
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,880
Sir, I'll send it now.

693
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,360
I know you can't smoke here.

694
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,480
Don't talk nonsense when you leave

695
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,639
captain,

696
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,840
a man entered Room 612 just now.

697
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,000
Who?

698
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,440
Waiter/Waitress

699
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,400
waiter/Waitress

700
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,360
there's no need to make a fuss.

701
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,840
Is anyone here

702
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,599
hello, sir.

703
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,719
Pujiang Hotel.

704
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,760
Room 6, 1, 2.

705
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,360
Hello.

706
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,239
Hello?

707
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,039
Come on.

708
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,079
I saw the Chief Steward...

709
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,760
I think he went into the linen room.

710
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
Watch out.

711
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,039
Alright.

712
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,280
Captain!

713
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,159
Captain!

714
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,760
Don't move.

715
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,280
Put the gun down.

716
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,119
It's me.

717
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,760
What happened to you?

718
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,360
Where were you?

719
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,400
The food in the hotel is awful.

720
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,280
I went out for something delicious.

721
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,960
Aren't you afraid that your people are looking for you everywhere?

722
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,920
Even you can't recognize me.

723
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Why would I be afraid?

724
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
We didn't catch her today.

725
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Failed to catch her.

726
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,559
It's impossible.

727
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,719
I didn't make any mistakes in the secret code.

728
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,920
Let's go inside.

729
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,079
Brother.

730
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,599
Was she seen?

731
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,119
Thank you for that.

732
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,519
You're welcome.

733
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,320
I have cigarettes here.

734
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,440
A friend gave it to me.

735
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,679
She said it was good.

736
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,719
But I don't smoke.

737
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,079
How about this, man?

738
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,599
Hadmen's smoke is good.

739
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,840
I can't even afford one.

740
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,440
Right?

741
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,119
How about this?

742
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,119
The head waiter.

743
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,119
Hanging around here.

744
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,679
Brother, you should smoke outside.

745
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,519
Used to smoke?

746
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,760
I'll stay here for you.

747
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,920
Brother, up.

748
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,719
Thank you.

749
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,440
Or one of us

750
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,519
all right. I'll cooperate with you.

751
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,480
First they released the contact code,

752
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,239
then they canceled the contact.

753
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,880
It's useless saying these things.

754
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,039
Brother Huang,

755
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,519
kimura and I

756
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,480
kimura and I traveled around.

757
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,519
Our superior has agreed.

758
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,159
You'll be assigned to an important position

759
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,199
to the Ministry of Construction of the new government.

760
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,639
So you are

761
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,719
have reservations,

762
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,599
our effort is not worth it.

763
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm having an interview with Chief Kimura tonight.

764
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
Please tell him.

765
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,880
I'll surely give you a special gift.

766
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,920
Even if you tell me about it,

767
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,639
I want to see Kimura.

768
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,039
Alright.

769
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:04,039
I'll report to Chief Kimura now.

770
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,079
I don't have time to report to my superiors.

771
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,280
We must eliminate the traitor immediately.

772
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,679
Brother.

773
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,079
The smoke...

774
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,679
Brother.

775
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
The head waiter just came here.

776
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,320
The head waiter said not to make loud noise.

777
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,239
Lower your voice.

778
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,559
Your smoke is really good.

779
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,480
Thanks. Thanks.

780
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,440
If you have any problems,

781
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,679
alright.

782
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,119
Don't hesitate to turn to me.

783
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:30,599
Alright.

784
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,159
Please.

785
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,719
I'll send the stuff now.

786
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,119
I'll go with you.

787
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:33,920
I'm off to deliver the stuff.

788
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,679
All right. Go on.

789
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,719
Hello, Sir.

790
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,960
Change the sheets.

791
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,599
I'm in the bathroom.

792
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,800
Come in.
