1
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,719
Why don't I feel you miss me?

2
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,719
Serious business.

3
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,159
These confidential documents

4
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
need your signature before they can be stored.

5
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,079
What's up

6
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,840
are the Japanese starting to kill Chinese?

7
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,319
Have the Japanese ever stopped killing Chinese?

8
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,319
Are we all going to die then?

9
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,919
Don't be so nervous.

10
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,240
It's not our turn.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,159
But Chen Jiaping

12
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,919
working for the Japanese, right?

13
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,879
They were so cruel to him yesterday.

14
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,479
Could it be that one day

15
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,919
we will be doomed one day?

16
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,919
Chen Jiaping deserves this.

17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,800
He's with Luo Guanqun because

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
the same goes for Luo.

19
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,840
He was infatuated

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
he hoarded the japonica rice,

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,879
and make a fortune by making beautiful dreams.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,960
Who knew that those are the provisions the Japanese prepare for battle?

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
But now look at that!

24
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
The mouse is lambasted when crossing the street.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Become such a mess?

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
You actually

27
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,159
on me actually?

28
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm afraid he will implicate me.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,159
I don't want to see you anymore.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Think about it.

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,400
If the Japanese attack Luo again,

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,599
I will be implicated for sure.

33
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,240
Is that even possible?

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,840
Why would the Japanese want to kill Luo?

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
Luo Guanqun is nothing but a blank.

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,520
So you should

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,080
you should work for the Japanese.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
Don't let me be so worried.

39
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,639
That's useless to worry about me.

40
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,240
This is

41
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,759
Is the treasury of Japan's Military Police Command.

42
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,599
If the Japanese need anyone,

43
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,960
they will always need me.

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,960
I miss you

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,479
If you talk about Luo again,

46
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,000
both of them are great.

47
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,080
Brother.

48
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,759
I'm busy.

49
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,159
I'm not busy anymore.

50
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,159
No, just keep busy.

51
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm not in the mood.

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,759
Let's go for a walk again.

53
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,120
Did you hear that?

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,719
Mrs. Luo.

55
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,319
Sister-in-law.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Thank you.

57
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,079
Mr. Pierre

58
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,759
the person who rented the safe

59
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,279
Is gone

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
once we confirm that the inside

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,439
Is what we want.

62
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,560
I have promised you to do it.

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,680
You should know that in doing so,

64
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
In doing this.

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,279
Understood.

66
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,079
Good cooperation.

67
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:15,920
Come on.

68
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,959
This is a robbery.

69
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,079
This is a robbery.

70
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,600
Everybody stay down. Stay down.

71
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,360
Robbery.

72
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,920
Move there!

73
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,279
Cover your head.

74
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Squat down.

75
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,879
Put your hands on your head.

76
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,000
I announce that

77
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,639
from now on,

78
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,920
everything here

79
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,759
now belongs to me.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,079
Now, please cooperate

81
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
to return to me everything

82
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,480
that belong to me.

83
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
Brother.

84
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,920
You want to rob?

85
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,839
This is a bank.

86
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,279
You should rob banks.

87
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,839
We're all civilians.

88
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,600
Cut the crap.

89
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
The masses

90
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
people keep money here.

91
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,839
Don't think I don't know.

92
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,879
The United States and Japan might start a war.

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,879
The rich people in the concession want to run away

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
are you also here to cash the money?

95
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Where is the money?

96
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,439
Your wallet.

97
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,439
The money.

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
The money...

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,639
The bag.

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,439
The bag.

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,720
These are private letters.

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
I've given you all my worthless money.

103
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,040
Brother.

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,879
Look. It's a letter.

105
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,600
It is worthless.

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,439
It's a personal letter.

107
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,240
How could there be the mark of the bank on it?

108
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
Give me the letter.

109
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,879
Brother.

110
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,439
I told you.

111
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,879
Everything here

112
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,319
belongs to me.

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,040
And yours.

114
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,480
It's all yours.

115
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,959
Sorry.

116
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Come on.

117
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,079
Where is the knife?

118
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,079
With him?

119
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
It's there.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,879
The dragon tooth on the left and the cold moon on the right.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,639
Which one?

122
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,199
What's the difference?

123
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Don't shoot.

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,759
Don't move!

125
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,519
Don't move.

126
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,519
Don't move!

127
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
Release him.

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,759
Or I'll kill him!

129
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,800
Release him.

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,240
Or I'll kill him!

131
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,440
Let's see which is faster

132
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,360
and see if my bullets are faster.

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Brother, calm down!

134
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,919
I know you are begging for money.

135
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,320
We don't have to see the blood.

136
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,679
I just want the envelope back.

137
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,799
Our boss said that

138
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,840
everything here

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
will be yours.

140
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,720
You're mistaken

141
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,720
everything is yours.

142
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,279
I don't want any money!

143
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,840
I just want the letter back.

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
Alright?

145
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,440
You didn't cheat me. You only need to believe.

146
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
If I lied to you,

147
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,039
kill him

148
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,679
let him take it!

149
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,159
Alright.

150
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,240
Take it yourself.

151
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
Don't play tricks.

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,120
Thanks.

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,279
I want that envelope!

154
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,159
Squat down.

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,799
Lower it.

156
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,799
Police officers here

157
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
put down all your weapons!

158
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,799
Come on.

159
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,240
Go right now!

160
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,799
Run!

161
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,240
My money!

162
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,279
Charge!

163
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,360
Don't move.

164
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,639
Get out of the way!

165
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,960
Come on! Hurry up!

166
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
Sir,

167
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
we are not robbers.

168
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,559
Not the robbers?

169
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,039
That's right

170
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,039
then why are you holding a knife?

171
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,360
That's my knife!

172
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,360
Your knife?

173
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,559
So you're his accomplice.

174
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
Kill both of them!

175
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
So you're supposed to be working for the Japanese.

176
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,200
No, I won't.

177
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,600
Hello, gentlemen.

178
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,679
Hello, welcome to French Concession

179
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,919
I'm Detective Liu Cheng, from French Concession Police Station

180
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,679
you may call me Chengzi

181
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,519
chengzi?

182
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,000
We've lost something very important.

183
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,840
I know.

184
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,600
Everyone here lost something.

185
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
You guys line up outside.

186
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
What's missing?

187
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
How much is it worth?

188
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Register one by one

189
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,519
I lost an envelope.

190
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,120
There was something very important in it

191
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,879
It was stolen by the two masked robbers.

192
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,799
Catch the two robbers right now.

193
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,639
Go.

194
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,360
Don't worry. You see that

195
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,879
we don't have enough manpower

196
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,440
to follow you to catch the robbers?

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,799
Then...

198
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,960
What about these people?

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Not to mention

200
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,159
there are also Americans,

201
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,399
the French.

202
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,840
We should give priority to serving them.

203
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
That the envelope was not found

204
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
and infuriate the Japanese.

205
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
You also have a hard time.

206
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,399
Since both of you are having a hard time,

207
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,240
we can't do anything about it.

208
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,000
We can't...

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Incapable of action

210
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,200
Incapable of action

211
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,679
I have the ability.

212
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,360
We'll catch it.

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,639
Come on.

214
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,600
Stop!

215
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,240
I told you.

216
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,559
Go out and line up.

217
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,080
I don't want the money anymore.

218
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,879
It's not about the money now.

219
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,399
I suspect that

220
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,000
pretended to be a customer

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,120
and cooperate with the robbers.

222
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,879
I'm going to investigate you.

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,799
This is the last time I say this.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,799
You two,

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,759
line up.

226
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,000
Line up.

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,720
Line up!

228
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,840
Lackey!

229
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,840
So it's true that

230
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,080
you took it after you peed.

231
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,399
How's that possible? I...

232
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,960
Before I take it.

233
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,159
Brandy.

234
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,120
It's French.

235
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,919
What the

236
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,399
In the letter?

237
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,480
Can't I not ask?

238
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,360
We've known you for so many years.

239
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,159
But now I don't see through you.

240
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,159
What's your job?

241
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,320
Chengzi.

242
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,399
Don't ask.

243
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Your original intention hasn't changed.

244
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
We are all anti-Japanese.

245
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
Speaking of which,

246
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,720
we are running short of funds.

247
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,240
I asked the two robbers

248
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,559
they have superb craftsmanship and acting.

249
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,879
They all cost money.

250
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,279
Alright. I got it.

251
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,200
In two days,

252
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,919
I'll handle a batch of Japanese cotton yarn.

253
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,039
I can get you two more boxes then.

254
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,840
Hold on.

255
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,159
You said that last time, okay?

256
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,399
Really?

257
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,960
Did I tell you that?

258
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,759
You didn't?

259
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
She's driving.

260
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Don't drink.

261
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,039
We're leaving.

262
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,200
No one would believe you.

263
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,919
When we lost the letters,

264
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,159
now, I want to go to the trading firm for intelligence.

265
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,200
To seek intelligence from the firm.

266
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,519
There are no clues about the warrior under the mountain and the secret letter.

267
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
It means that

268
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,679
the mission has been a complete failure.

269
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,840
Stop!

270
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,279
Where is he?

271
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,840
No one is here.

272
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,159
Why are you running?

273
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,679
A girl found me just now.

274
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,919
She gave me the fare

275
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,240
to get a free bus.

276
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,080
But she didn't.

277
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,759
Left Shuangtao.

278
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,240
Shoot.

279
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,359
When did you join the military union?

280
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,440
Thank you, miss.

281
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
I can do it myself.

282
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,240
I'll do the grocery shopping.

283
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,200
Wait for me.

284
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,640
Please.

285
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,160
What's up

286
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,440
tonight,

287
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,440
we'll have to evacuate.

288
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,720
Before we leave,

289
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,519
you must kill this woman.

290
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,359
We would be dead if it weren't for her.

291
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,119
Special agents are searching for us nearby.

292
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,279
This woman has seen our faces.

293
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,599
How can you be so sure

294
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,759
she will betray us?

295
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,880
We must bring the information back.

296
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
We do whatever

297
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,279
we will do whatever it takes

298
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,440
what are you going to do then?

299
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,759
How is it? Is it good?

300
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,400
It's good.

301
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
It is?

302
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,400
My boyfriend hasn't eaten the food I cooked yet.

303
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,720
What about Ms. Zuo's boyfriend?

304
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,599
He ran away.

305
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,039
This time,

306
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,559
thanks to Miss Zuo.

307
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,559
These days,

308
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,680
we are just afraid that

309
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,000
once Ms. Zuo's friend comes,

310
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
we will disturb them.

311
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
No, I won't.

312
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,279
Eat well.

313
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,319
My boyfriend ran away.

314
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
School was closed.

315
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,599
And the students are scattered.

316
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,640
That's why

317
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,359
nobody would come here.

318
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,640
You know we are wanted?

319
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,279
If anyone suspects your whereabouts,

320
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,000
don't worry.

321
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,200
I never told anyone

322
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
that you stay here.

323
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,519
I bought too much food these days.

324
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,880
I even changed several markets.

325
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,559
So no one will suspect it.

326
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,240
That's good.

327
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
What do you mean?

328
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,920
I treat you as a hero against Japan.

329
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,720
Why did you repay my kindness with ingratitude?

330
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,759
You sacrificed your life for anti-Japanese.

331
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,240
Left Shuangtao.

332
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm asking you

333
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
when did you join the military?

334
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,680
What are you talking about?

335
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,519
I didn't join the military.

336
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Who are you?

337
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,839
Why would you kidnap me?

338
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,599
One more thing.

339
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
You joined the military one year ago.

340
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,079
Right?

341
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,640
You must have been scared.

342
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,599
This man is a traitor.

343
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,640
This operation exposed him

344
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
because of his betrayal,

345
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,799
you follow me this time

346
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,440
to lure more people out

347
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,039
and catch us all.

348
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,400
I hate traitors the most!

349
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
They murdered my parents.

350
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,319
I'm Liu Wuchang, Military Commission of Su Zhe Action Committee.

351
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,720
I hope you can join us

352
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
to resist Japan and eliminate traitors together.

353
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,359
I will...

354
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,279
You are smart, alert,

355
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,559
and devoted to fighting Japan.

356
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,160
He is exactly the man we need.

357
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,880
Left Shuangtao.

358
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,119
Did you come to Shanghai

359
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,240
to assassinate Martial Master under the Mountain?

360
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,119
I don't know what you're talking about.

361
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,680
I told you I came to look for my boyfriend.

362
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,480
Can't you tell that I'm not a local?

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
Let me ask you one more time.

364
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,759
Did you come to Shanghai to assassinate Martial Arts Master under the Mountain?

365
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,720
Confess!

366
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Who on earth are you?

367
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,799
If you want money,

368
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,440
you can turn to my uncle.

369
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,839
He's very rich.

370
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
You want ransom, right?

371
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,079
Irrigation.

372
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,279
Jiaping.

373
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,440
Why so late?

374
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,799
I have to work overtime.

375
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,920
At the end of the month,

376
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,000
at the end of the month.

377
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,119
When you

378
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,559
I knitted the sweater for you

379
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,799
that I knitted for you when I come back.

380
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,799
I left it in the office.

381
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,960
It needs to be changed.

382
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm really sorry about this.

383
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,759
Actually, Guoguo, it's not what you think.

384
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,039
Don't take it to heart.

385
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,039
I know I can understand.

386
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,559
I was working overtime

387
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,440
she's here to take something

388
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,200
don't be unreasonable.

389
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,480
Your Highness.

390
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,160
Since

391
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,519
your girlfriend is picking you up,

392
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,799
I won't bother you anymore.

393
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,880
I'm off.

394
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,759
Guoguo.

395
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,880
You have to keep being yourself.

396
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,559
Be angry and make trouble.

397
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,000
What's wrong?

398
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,319
If you don't trust me,

399
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,799
why did you send me to carry out a mission?

400
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,920
Your mission failed.

401
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,519
And lost contact with your organization.

402
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
In this case,

403
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,920
either sacrifice

404
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,319
or betrayal.

405
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,039
When you convinced me to join the military union,

406
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,720
you told me that everyone in our organization

407
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,799
they believed in each other.

408
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,079
Is that what you call mutual faith?

409
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,519
Why did you ask me to continue with my task?

410
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,759
How did you know that?

411
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,680
You used the phone book to call me earlier.

412
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,680
Is to avoid scars.

413
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,359
Showing scars would be suspected, right?

414
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,559
Shuangtao is still so smart.

415
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,960
Come on, Xiaowu.

416
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,960
Please leave.

417
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,359
I have something to tell Zuo Shuangtao.

418
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,079
Yes

419
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,839
you did a good job analyzing the secret letter.

420
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,319
I will report it to Director Guan Yongshan.

421
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
It's a pity that we have no chance now.

422
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
No, we still have the chance.

423
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,279
This is the surveillance video

424
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,880
located in Shanghai Communication Station

425
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,279
we just received this.

426
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,319
The identity of the sender is unclear.

427
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
But apparently

428
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
they have found out that our channel

429
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,160
and they sent us the same frequency.

430
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,920
This is the transposition cipher.

431
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,839
This kind of encryption method

432
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,880
Is not widely used now.

433
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,839
So we can tell that

434
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,759
they don't know our new password yet.

435
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,400
It can't be on our side

436
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,839
did you decipher the code?

437
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,839
We cracked it.

438
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,079
It's written in the letter that

439
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,240
that the password book hasn't been obtained yet.

440
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,039
The secret letter is still with him.

441
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,079
Could it be a trap under the mountain?

442
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,240
I don't think so.

443
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,839
If he finds the radio station down the mountain,

444
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,119
he can find our communication station

445
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,079
through the directional meter.

446
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,880
They would hit us harder.

447
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,279
There's no need to set a trap like this.

448
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,319
This man knows the mountain well

449
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
and he wants to help us.

450
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,000
Who is it?

451
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
But no matter who he is,

452
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,400
as far as I am concerned

453
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,440
this information is reliable.

454
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,079
But I can't go back to the business anymore,

455
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,640
let alone contacting the mountain.

456
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,680
I think you're worried about Chen Jia Ping.

457
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,079
Nothing.

458
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,319
You know

459
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,720
I hate traitors the most.

460
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,039
No better. That's just what you want.

461
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,240
After the mission is completed,

462
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,079
you can kill this traitor.

463
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,519
You should always remind yourself

464
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,720
chen Jia Ping worked for the Japanese.

465
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
He's our enemy,

466
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,240
you should know that

467
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,319
your accidental reunion is a heaven-sent chance.

468
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
You have to do everything you can to make use of him.

469
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
To make use of him

470
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,640
to accomplish our mission.

471
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,920
Hu was dead.

472
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,960
And Da Xuan was also dead.

473
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,640
But you still haven't

474
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,839
you haven't mentioned them at all.

475
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,839
You only say the task.

476
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,960
The mission?

477
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:28,839
The mission...

478
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,279
Left Shuangtao, stand up.

479
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,440
Do you still remember your identity?

480
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,680
Operations Officer, Soviet Union Action Committee,

481
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,920
what's our slogan?

482
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,519
Gather your will and defend your leader.

483
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,480
Speak louder.

484
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,279
Gather your will to defend the leader.

485
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:41,880
Great.

486
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,000
You have to remember that

487
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,240
we have no reason to back down.

488
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,000
Sacrificing our difficulties and fears

489
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,359
will only make us stronger and braver.

490
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,440
One's emotions

491
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,079
nor will they stand in our way.

492
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,480
Yes

493
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,720
don't be afraid of suspicion.

494
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,559
In the intelligence department,

495
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,640
In this kind of intelligence.

496
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,680
I believe you can handle this.

497
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,200
Do you remember what I said

498
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,759
when I took you out of Nanjing?

499
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,559
What's that?

500
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,000
You can help me realize my dream of resisting Japan and saving the nation.

501
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,759
Right.

502
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,440
Everything you're doing right now

503
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,480
Is to realize your dream.

504
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,920
Jia Ping,

505
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,160
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have argued with you.

506
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,519
I shouldn't have broken up with you.

507
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,759
I didn't care enough for you.

508
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,079
I even stopped him.

509
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm too selfish.

510
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,319
Guoguo.

511
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,920
What act are you putting on?

512
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,599
And didn't I tell you

513
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,039
don't come to the business to see me.

514
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,759
I'm here to apologize to you.

515
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,759
Why did you come to apologize to me?

516
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,680
We should continue

517
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,279
cold war anymore?

518
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,160
Or I'll never end this.

519
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,559
And why is your hair?

520
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,119
I want to stay with you.

521
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,359
Like what we used to be.

522
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,440
OK?

523
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,079
Please.

524
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,079
When you return home,

525
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,480
you need to mend fences with Chen Family Ping

526
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,759
and return to your state of passionate love.

527
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,240
So that you can visit the firm more frequently.

528
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,240
And look for more information about the mountain

529
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,119
chief Chen

530
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
I forgot the newspaper

531
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,240
thanks.

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,839
Let's watch today's news.

533
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,480
What's new?

534
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:19,960
Let me have a look.

535
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,400
It says here that

536
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
there is another shortage

537
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
In the city again.

538
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,160
You know?

539
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,359
That's because the large quantities of medicines

540
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,200
were bought by Captain Zhao at a low price.

541
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,799
Really?

542
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,920
Then Captain Zhao will make a big deal again.

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,960
But most of the money

544
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,240
won't reach him.

545
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
He rooks everyone he can get his claws into

546
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,160
many more.

547
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,119
I think

548
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,200
the Military Police Command

549
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,720
Is up to something again?

550
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,119
How did you know that?

551
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,799
Based on my experience,

552
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,640
which are stored in large quantities

553
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,240
and sell them back at a high price

554
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,160
he must have some big action plan

555
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,279
which needs a lot of funds.

556
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,960
Qian Xiucai?

557
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,160
Is quite interesting.

558
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,799
Look, you are just a concierge.

559
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,839
How can you be so knowledgeable about these?

560
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,200
You can't say those nonsense.

561
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,000
All those things

562
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,559
Is a big business between Captain Zhao and the Japanese.

563
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,920
As for us,

564
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,160
lazy birds never build nests.

565
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,240
He can just muddle along

566
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,279
chief Chen, I think you're too talented

567
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,079
which slacking on

568
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,880
you're right.

569
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,400
I didn't want to muddle along.

570
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,519
But I have no choice.

571
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,519
I have to do it even if I don't want to follow the wrong person.

572
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,440
This is fate.

573
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,319
Jia Ping.

574
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,759
Stop eating this.

575
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,519
I made a lot of these for you.

576
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,759
I made them all by myself.

577
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,640
Look at these.

578
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,119
There are shrimps.

579
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:00,240
I learned from my aunt for so long.

580
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,960
Taste it.

581
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,920
Is it good?

582
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,000
I mean Guoguo.

583
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,839
This...

584
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,400
It's not your style.

585
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,960
I told you

586
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
love

587
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,640
can change a person.

588
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,359
Eat some too.

589
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,240
There are plenty of them

590
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,799
chief Chen

591
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,000
you have such a good wife

592
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
can be a good wife.

593
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,279
Watch your mouth.

594
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,799
Neither of us

595
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,000
get married yet.

596
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,519
It's yummy.

597
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:30,799
It's yummy.

598
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,359
Eat more

599
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,160
chief Chen

600
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,559
you've already met such a good girlfriend

601
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,319
you must marry her right away.

602
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,480
Aren't you afraid that people will think about her?

603
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,359
Who would think so?

604
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,559
We have plenty of singles.

605
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,720
For example,

606
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,119
high Fang.

607
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,559
I'm talking about Qian Xiucai. Don't talk nonsense.

608
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,680
Gao Fang!

609
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,119
Come on. Eat together.

610
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,319
Right. Come here.

611
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,279
And try them together.

612
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,000
Eat more.

613
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,759
Have some shrimps.

614
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,519
What about

615
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,679
It's good.

616
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,679
I hope I can have them often in the future.

617
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,159
You can have the dishes cooked by Ms. Zuo.

618
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,239
Right. Right. This.

619
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,000
I hope Ms. Zuo can come more often.

620
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,679
So that

621
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,079
to often have such delicious food.

622
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,760
I will. Definitely.

623
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,360
OK?

624
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:42,719
Brother.

625
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,840
If these two people were really acting,

626
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,440
their acting is better than that Miss Han Lu.

627
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,920
It's so easy to just act for a while.

628
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,519
But no matter how good an actor is,

629
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,159
If he can keep acting,

630
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,039
he will get caught one day.

631
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,599
Hey, Guoguo.

632
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,039
You shouldn't come here often.

633
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,159
Why not?

634
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
Don't you know where I am?

635
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,199
That's why I always come here.

636
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,079
I just want everyone to see

637
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,559
especially Lu Fangfang

638
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,320
to see how sweet we are

639
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,159
to make them quit.

640
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,679
Enough.

641
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,400
Go back to your work.

642
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,280
I'll leave now.

643
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,519
Guo Guo.

644
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,159
Guo.

645
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,360
I have your letter.

646
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,440
1 PM.

647
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,400
Commander Kai's Cafe.

648
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,079
I'll wait for you.

649
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,159
I've checked the name list

650
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,639
you asked me to check the list.

651
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,159
Where is the name list?

652
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,159
That's all.

653
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,679
That's all.

654
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,800
What have you got, then?

655
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,440
I found something that makes you happy.

656
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,880
Hey.

657
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,880
This Zhao An...

658
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,199
Did go to the bank of Lumiere before.

659
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,079
He was so fast.

660
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,599
But when he was about to get the list,

661
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,679
I ran into a robber.

662
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,599
Robbed?

663
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,239
I heard that she was interrogated as a robber

664
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,639
and was beaten.

665
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,079
To see your sister?

666
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,119
That's good news.

667
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,199
It's such a coincidence.

668
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,119
How come they get robbed?

669
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,719
Old Luo.

670
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,360
Do you think

671
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:32,239
no, wouldn't it be the CCP?

672
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:32,920
Enough.

673
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,679
Zhao An hasn't

674
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,159
that it's not in Zhao An's hands.

675
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,320
It's good news.

676
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,800
We both don't know it.

677
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,199
Luo, you're so afraid of Zhao An that

678
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,760
I'm following you every day.

679
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
I would feel insecure.

680
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,320
What did you say

681
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,480
feel insecure.

682
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,320
Last line.

683
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,760
Scared of Zhao An?

684
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,960
You really don't know

685
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,679
you really don't know me.

686
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,119
I'm going to kill Zhao An.

687
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,000
Have a seat.

688
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,079
You stuffed the note in my pocket,

689
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,400
this is a date.

690
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,559
What do you mean?

691
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,800
I return a letter to you.

692
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,159
Just have one date with me.

693
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,360
I'll give you a letter in the future.

694
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,000
You are going on a date with me again.

695
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,800
I never thought

696
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,559
that you stole my letter.

697
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,000
It was Dashao who stole your letter.

698
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,199
However,

699
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,639
you should feel blessed that

700
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,880
the letters ended up in my hands

701
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,400
I wrote the letter to Jiaping

702
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,360
we had a fight,

703
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,360
so I asked for the letter.

704
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,159
You can read it if you want.

705
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,119
I just didn't expect that people in your firm

706
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,800
like to pry into people's privacy so much.

707
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,360
When I first took the letters,

708
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,679
I just wanted to know

709
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,119
about your past with Chen Jiaping

710
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,880
and

711
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,880
If you really love him.

712
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
So...

713
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,599
You knew all about it?

714
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,360
I only know that

715
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,599
you shouldn't love him.

716
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,440
And he is totally unworthy of your love.

717
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,639
It's none of your business

718
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,480
of course it's none of my business.

719
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,840
Unless,

720
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,000
that I don't like you,

721
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,280
so you spent so much time

722
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,480
are you trying to poach me?

723
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,400
Chen Jiaping was working for the Japanese

724
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,119
you being with him,

725
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,400
It'll get you in trouble sooner or later.

726
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,440
Don't you work for Japanese too?

727
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,440
I have my bottom line and principles.

728
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
I don't do unconscionable things.

729
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,719
I won't fall in love with you for that alone.

730
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,559
As for the letters,

731
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,960
If you're feeling jealous,

732
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,320
watch them for yourself.

733
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:29,840
Oh, right.

734
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,119
I should be older than you.

735
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,920
If you like someone,

736
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,840
tell her bravely.

737
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,559
Peeping on privacy

738
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,599
will offend women.

739
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,320
The letters could prove you were lying,

740
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,400
I bet you didn't notice it

741
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,519
there is a number

742
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,920
on the end of the paper

743
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,320
I went to the stationery store to verify it.

744
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,760
The numbers

745
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,320
Is the factory date of this batch of stationery.

746
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,239
28

747
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,719
One 0.

748
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,280
Two, one.

749
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,880
Which is in the 28th year of the Republic.

750
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,000
October 21st the same year

751
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,880
but you dated the tail of the letter

752
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,719
september 13th, 28th year of the Republic of China

753
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,400
before we made any paper,

754
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,679
how was the letter written?

755
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,599
That is to say,

756
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,000
this letter

757
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,679
Is to make Luo Guanqun and Zhao An

758
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,440
to believe in your relationship.

759
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,639
When I believe that you and Cheng Xi

760
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,480
you and Chen Jiaping are not a couple at all,

761
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,159
you are just using your relationship

762
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,519
to achieve something.

763
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,119
But that's all right.

764
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,679
As I said just now,

765
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,320
with this letter in my hand,

766
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,480
you should feel blessed.

767
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,239
How can I be happy?

768
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,199
After all, I like you.

769
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,079
I will definitely

770
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:06,920
I also don't want your

771
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,119
your friendship was real.

772
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:08,599
Your friendship was real

773
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,079
thank you for liking me.

774
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,719
You're not bad looking

775
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,239
and smart.

776
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,400
But do you think I would like you?

777
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,639
Maybe I won't now,

778
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,039
but it will be in the future.

779
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,840
In the future.

780
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,360
Because every woman

781
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,440
falls in love with a man who can protect her.

782
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,519
What if I don't need your protection?

783
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,599
I would be a little disappointed.

784
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,599
To give the letter to Luo Guanqun,

785
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,440
or Zhao An.

786
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,400
or Zhao An.
