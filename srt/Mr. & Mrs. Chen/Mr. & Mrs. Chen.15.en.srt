1
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,799
Guoguo.

2
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,799
What's wrong?

3
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,599
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,519
What's wrong with Guoguo?

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
What's wrong?

6
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,439
Where were you?

7
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,760
It's windy. I closed the window.

8
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,239
Why didn't you tell me to close the windows?

9
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,239
I saw you fell asleep.

10
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
What happened to you?

11
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,599
That sound was so scary.

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,879
I'm afraid that

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm afraid you might fall down when you close the window.

14
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,439
I'm not made of pieces of paper.

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
How could it be?

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,159
Guoguo.

17
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:29,960
Promise me one thing

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
to close the windows

19
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,520
don't fall into it.

20
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:40,800
Alright.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,240
I promise you that

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,800
when you close the windows,

23
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,800
to ensure it won't fall.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,080
Put out the fire! Hurry!

25
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,759
Water is here. Water's here.

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,000
Hurry up.

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,120
Hurry!

28
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,080
Who?

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,000
Who took her away?

30
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,159
This afternoon,

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,240
master Ma said there were some guests.

32
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,120
They looked like those who hang around here.

33
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,039
We didn't pay much attention to it at the time.

34
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,479
Now it seems that

35
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
those people must have set their sights on it earlier.

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
They rushed into

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,919
the room where they are held.

38
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,759
To fire.

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
Luckily the brothers held them back.

40
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,240
When we were about to defeat them,

41
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,560
unexpectedly, another group of people came

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,719
I thought they were reinforcements.

43
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,840
I thought I was doomed.

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,800
But I didn't expect that

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
they didn't know each other

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800
and they shot each other.

47
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,919
We didn't stop shooting.

48
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,520
The result was a chaotic fight.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Why didn't you

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,719
take him away in the chaos?

51
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,639
Brother. Brother. Brother.

52
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,960
We've fled to the door.

53
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,080
But I didn't expect there's another gang lurking around here.

54
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:58,919
I...

55
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,479
We were caught off-guard this time.

56
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,680
We ran out of bullets.

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
We killed a few.

58
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,080
In the end,

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,319
he was taken away too.

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
Are the people at the door

61
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,240
are they with the first team or the second team?

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,039
This...

63
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,680
We don't...

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,759
Not very sure.

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,159
You said the first group must be

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,759
those who work at the pier.

67
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,199
Right.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,839
I remember that Dashao

69
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,680
he was with that punk in Wusong.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,240
They are with Luo Guanqun.

71
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,839
Who are the other two?

72
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,240
They were either CCP or military commanders.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
But how did they know

74
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
we hide her here?

75
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,600
Four of clubs.

76
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,480
The intelligence reported by 4 of clubs

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,519
I am now even more certain

78
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,600
four of clubs in clubs.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,279
Works for Luo Guanqun.

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,000
If four of clubs knew she was hiding here first,

81
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,800
and wanted to save her,

82
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,439
he wouldn't get Luo Guanqun involved.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
So, you know

84
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,879
luo Guanqun was the one who knew he was hiding here,

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
he's coming to steal her?

86
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,399
He wanted to sabotage my business

87
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,319
to take away my credit.

88
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,639
But he never expected

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
four of clubs would get him an amateur.

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,360
They're screwed.

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
It's all over.

92
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,639
Here it comes.

93
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,040
Four for every clubs.

94
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,279
Chen Jiaping.

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,959
Chen Family Ping.

96
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,600
You've taken good care of

97
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,800
taking good care of my horse.

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,199
Officer Kimura.

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
As imported horse feed.

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
After a while,

101
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,759
I will hire a horse trainer for you.

102
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,160
I should thank you in that sense.

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,639
I should thank you.

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,839
My duty is

105
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,199
officer Kimura,

106
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,480
recently,

107
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,480
that my work has disappointed you.

108
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,120
I...

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,560
The weather today is very good.

110
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,079
Right.

111
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,399
That's right.

112
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Read the newspaper on such a day.

113
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Have some tea.

114
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
Find a place and sit for a while.

115
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,639
Isn't it beautiful?

116
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,759
Gorgeous, isn't it?

117
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,720
Look at these.

118
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,319
I have brought you the newspaper.

119
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,560
Faith Xuan.

120
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,120
No, I won't.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
They got it.

122
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,480
Alright.

123
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,160
Naughty.

124
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Why don't you watch it?

125
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,199
Watch it now.

126
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,399
Jiang Zhaoguo.

127
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,639
Jiang Zhaoguo?

128
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,439
China-Japan peace talks

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
It is sheer fiction

130
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,519
It is sheer fiction

131
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,439
Idiot.

132
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,959
How could an official admit

133
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,319
that they have

134
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,839
a preliminary agreement.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
The next step is to

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,600
to have more contacts with our executives.

137
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,439
You

138
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,399
and disgraced the War Department.

139
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,639
Chief Kimura.

140
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,040
I have an inescapable responsibility

141
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
In this matter.

142
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,319
I can explain.

143
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,079
Officer Kimura.

144
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,279
Why do you have to explain?

145
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,759
Why you let Jiang Zhaoguo go?

146
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,079
Four of clubs.

147
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,079
It's the four of clubs.

148
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,240
What fourth of clubs?

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
It always says four of clubs.

150
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,879
Officer Kimura.

151
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,720
I can explain.

152
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,120
Slow down!

153
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,959
Chief Kimura.

154
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,600
I found out who the four of clubs are.

155
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,399
I found out who the four of clubs is.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Chief Kimura.

157
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,160
Manager Luo,

158
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,279
you're all here.

159
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,279
Officer Kimura.

160
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,759
I was wondering what

161
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,959
what's the matter?

162
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,879
I want to hear you tell a story.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
What story?

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
Of four of clubs.

165
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,720
The four of clubs

166
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519
the four of clubs

167
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,759
the legendary Communist Party of China undercover?

168
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,399
That's right.

169
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,919
Got it.

170
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,720
Didn't you think I'm the four of clubs before?

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,759
But I've clarified my misunderstanding.

172
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,120
Don't play dumb.

173
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
It doesn't matter.

174
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,240
The Story of Four of Clubs

175
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,279
I'll tell her for you.

176
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
The four of clubs

177
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,320
she has been lurking in Taihe Firm for long.

178
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,399
He is moving mysteriously.

179
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,240
He stole information at will

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
and ruined his family and state.

181
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,639
And unpardonable.

182
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,799
We've investigated several times,

183
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
but found nothing.

184
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,879
Everyone in our business

185
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,000
jittery

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
of mutual suspicion.

187
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,720
The teeth of hatred.

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,639
This time,

189
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,399
four of clubs knows

190
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,679
of the secret peace talks between China and Japan.

191
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
He got ahead of us.

192
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,159
First, he sneaked into the villa,

193
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,279
opened the safe

194
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,080
take out the mini camera

195
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,960
and remake it.

196
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
While his friends

197
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,960
his friends kept watch around him

198
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
they found out about us and arrived.

199
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Make an explosion to alert him.

200
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,480
But it also alerts the negotiators

201
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,759
and alert them.

202
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,039
So, our

203
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,399
the capture operation failed.

204
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,480
Officer Kimura,

205
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,159
this is the camera we found

206
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,799
we found on the lawn outside the villa.

207
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,840
There must be four fingerprints of clubs on it.

208
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,639
We have collected the fingerprint.

209
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,919
For fairness,

210
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,960
everyone present

211
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,120
on everyone present.

212
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,320
Captain Zhao,

213
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,120
there's a limit to how people can stand.

214
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,919
Right.

215
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,360
If you still can't find the four of clubs,

216
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,279
you will be the four of clubs.

217
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Wait here.

218
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm not calling you.

219
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,279
You can't go anywhere.

220
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,639
Otherwise you won't get any money.

221
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,080
Got it.

222
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,159
Frog!

223
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,480
Do me a favor.

224
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,360
Keep an eye on this guy.

225
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,320
Watch this.

226
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,399
Don't worry.

227
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,600
Officer Kimura.

228
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,559
I asked you to suspend you and reflect on yourself.

229
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,360
Get out.

230
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,840
I have something to report to Officer Kimura.

231
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,720
When do you need to report anything?

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,360
Get out.

233
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,559
And ask him to report.

234
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,519
I listened for ages outside just now.

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,159
I think Captain Zhao's investigation

236
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,759
Is really strange.

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,759
What did you say

238
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,240
captain Zhao was only looking into Chen Jia Ping

239
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,399
and forgot about someone important.

240
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
Go on.

241
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,360
The nun who broke into the villa

242
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,080
and saved Jiang Zhao Guo.

243
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,279
You think I haven't investigated it?

244
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,000
Officer Kimura.

245
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,039
You know

246
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,919
the tenant and the church

247
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,799
the concession and the church are involved.

248
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,159
Please trust me.

249
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,639
But Captain Zhao,

250
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,960
did it ever occur to you that

251
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,399
that person might not be a real nun?

252
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,480
She was wearing a nun's clothes.

253
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,080
How did you know that?

254
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,759
Chief Kimura.

255
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,519
I request you to arrest an employee of the firm.

256
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,799
I have the evidence

257
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,519
that she is a special agent from Juntong.

258
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,559
And she disguised herself as a nun

259
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,960
and saved Jiang Zhaoguo.

260
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,559
How can you hurt your hand enough?

261
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
Stay away from my wife.

262
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,240
Actually, on that day,

263
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
I also went to No. 72 Yaerpei Road

264
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,600
and there,

265
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,120
and saw a familiar face.

266
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,919
I believe it even more

267
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm even more convinced that

268
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,120
this person is Mrs. Chen.

269
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,759
Left Shuangtao.

270
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,759
I happened to go to my uncle-in-law's house that day.

271
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,879
I happened to pass the department store

272
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
Isn't it normal?

273
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,279
It's normal to pass by a department store on the way to my uncle-in-law's house.

274
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
To pass by my maternal uncle's house.

275
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,879
But you shouldn't have pretended to be a nun

276
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,440
to pretend to be a nun.

277
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,000
You have the same illness as Captain Zhao?

278
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,159
What evidence do you have

279
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,759
that Zuo Shuangtao pretended to be a nun?

280
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,399
I saw a nun passing by.

281
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,519
Mrs. Chen chatted with her

282
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,039
she told me an explosion nearby

283
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,200
and asked me to be careful.

284
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,840
What's up

285
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,399
that's your evidence?

286
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,039
Officer Kimura.

287
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,240
I want to tell you

288
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,799
what happened that day.

289
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
This operation

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Is foolproof,

291
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,879
but in fact,

292
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,879
has caught the secret

293
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,000
has information.

294
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
This special agent

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,519
he first took advantage of Yonglong Department Store

296
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,879
to observe the situation around the negotiation place.

297
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,039
When she saw Captain Zhao and others approaching the villa,

298
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,440
when she saw Captain Zhao and others approaching the villa.

299
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,519
To warn Jiang Zhaoguo and others.

300
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
However, Jiang Zhaoguo and the others

301
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,000
couldn't evacuate in time.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,399
They're still surrounded.

303
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,440
But this military special agent

304
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,480
borrowed the clothes of the nuns who passed by

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
after completing the disguise,

306
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,480
he drove a car and forced his way into the villa,

307
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,759
and saved Jiang Zhaoguo.

308
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,840
Therefore,

309
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
you suspect that

310
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,519
the special agent is

311
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,519
mrs. Chen.

312
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,039
Exactly.

313
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,200
Chief Kimura.

314
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,879
Zuo Shuangtao is my wife.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,399
We stayed together every night.

316
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,279
If she was a special agent from Juntong,

317
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,919
I must have noticed it

318
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
chief Chen

319
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,720
It means

320
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,639
you either are stupid

321
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,799
or you are pretending to be stupid.

322
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,039
In my opinion,

323
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,960
the latter possibility is more likely.

324
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:59,320
Alright.

325
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,960
Whether I'm really stupid or not,

326
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,399
these are all your speculation.

327
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
Where's your evidence?

328
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,360
Right.

329
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,759
What's your evidence?

330
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,519
What Chief Chen said is right

331
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,240
do you have proof?

332
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,799
Are you pretending to be a nun

333
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,360
I don't have direct evidence.

334
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,960
But I have another evidence

335
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,000
that can prove

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
zuo Shuangtao is a Juntong agent.

337
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,200
Alright.

338
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,080
Go ahead and I'll listen.

339
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,679
General Shanxia was assassinated at the railway station.

340
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,519
You all remember that, right?

341
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,879
Zuo Shuangtao once said

342
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
she would board the train at Wuhan.

343
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,600
But she lied.

344
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,399
She boarded the train

345
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,679
with Colonel Yamashita in Nanjing.

346
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,279
As a military special agent,

347
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,600
her mission is to kill Colonel Yamashita.

348
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,839
Mrs. Chen.

349
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Is this yours?

350
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,960
It is mine.

351
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,960
Why do you have it?

352
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,079
When you first came to Shanghai,

353
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,720
when Captain Zhao interrogated you,

354
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,559
you said you bought it at the train station.

355
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,079
Right?

356
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
Captain Zhao.

357
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,480
You should remember it, right?

358
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,359
That's right.

359
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,079
I remember that.

360
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,960
You bought them at the railway station.

361
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,359
According to Mrs. Chen,

362
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,119
this perfume satchel was

363
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:42,400
was probably bought at Wuhan Railway Station.

364
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,559
But this kind of perfume satchel

365
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,079
can't be bought at Wuhan Railway Station.

366
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,759
But it's available in Pukou Station, Nanjing.

367
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,279
Mrs. Chen.

368
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't you admit that you lied?

369
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,400
After that,

370
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,519
he was assassinated again at the wedding.

371
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,880
Captain Zhao mentioned many times

372
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,519
mrs. Chen's behavior was very suspicious.

373
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,559
Captain Zhao, what on earth happened?

374
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,480
Was assassinated?

375
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,440
Then ask for help!

376
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,920
I'll stop the bleeding.

377
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,960
Hurry up!

378
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,319
Now, that

379
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,400
Is all clear now.

380
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,519
Mrs. Chen and the assassin Kun

381
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,839
the assassin, Kun.

382
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,359
They were assassinated at the railway station.

383
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,119
You didn't hesitate to set a trap with your own wedding.

384
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,440
To set up your own wedding.

385
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
Mrs. Chen is loyal

386
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,359
to the military commander.

387
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,799
Feng Qi! That's right!

388
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
You're really eager to prove yourself

389
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,559
but these are still your speculation.

390
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,640
Do you have any direct evidence

391
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,920
zuo Shuangtao got on the train from Nanjing?

392
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,799
The one who sells perfume sachets at Pukou Station in Nanjing.

393
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
I have found him.

394
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,279
And I brought him to Shanghai.

395
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,519
He could identify Mrs. Chen in person.

396
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,000
Why don't you pee?

397
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:28,839
Then...

398
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,079
Come on.

399
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,519
Watching me like this

400
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,519
I can't do that.

401
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,599
How could you be so demanding?

402
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,640
Turn around a little bit.

403
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,519
Turn around a little more.

404
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't play tricks.

405
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,240
The vendor you mentioned

406
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,359
of the vendor?

407
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,759
He's outside.

408
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:24,599
What's going on?

409
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,039
Back off!

410
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,880
Back off.

411
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,559
Get out of the way.

412
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,119
Out of the way.

413
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,119
Where is the man he was with just now?

414
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,119
They went that way.

415
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
The frog is dead.

416
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,319
Li Youtian was the vendor.

417
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,559
He ran away?

418
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,400
What?

419
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,079
It ran away.

420
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,759
The frog is useless.

421
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,000
Officer Kimura,

422
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,480
I find this strange.

423
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,680
How could a peddler

424
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,640
snatched Frog's gun

425
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
and beat him to death.

426
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,720
Even if we can,

427
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,480
what is his intention?

428
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,720
What do you mean?

429
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Officer Kimura.

430
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,160
Actually, I really agree

431
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,839
of Captain Zhao and Feng Qi.

432
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,519
Some of these lurkers

433
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,480
some lurkers have leaked the information.

434
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,720
Otherwise, how would the negotiator be saved?

435
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,240
But who is this lurker?

436
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,559
Captain Zhao said it's me.

437
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,119
That's not possible.

438
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,640
I have explained the misunderstanding long ago

439
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,119
but Feng Qi suspected that it was my wife

440
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,240
that's nonsense!

441
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,559
However,

442
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,519
chief Kimura.

443
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,720
I have an important clue.

444
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,920
I want to report to you.

445
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,720
Go on.

446
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,799
To present the clue to you,

447
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,759
but I wasn't able to.

448
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,519
Look at this.

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,960
This is the picture Jiang Zhaoguo took

450
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,039
after he left Shanghai.

451
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,079
I noticed a detail.

452
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,960
On Jiang Zhaoguo's right arm

453
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,079
was injured.

454
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,839
On the day of capture,

455
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
his right arm was injured.

456
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,119
It doesn't prove anything.

457
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,119
Captain Zhao.

458
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,519
Injury is not the key.

459
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,400
The key lies in the way he bandaged it.

460
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Most people choose

461
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,079
to use the turning bandage.

462
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,799
The bandaging method on this paper

463
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,640
takes the shape of an 8-character spiral.

464
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,240
I think I've heard about

465
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,599
eight character spiral bandaging method.

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,559
But we met each other today.

467
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,599
Right?

468
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,119
Captain Zhao.

469
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,279
I know the 8-character spiral bandage.

470
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,839
My ex-girlfriend, Xiao Fang,

471
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,519
when she studied in Japan,

472
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,640
she studied nursing.

473
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,079
She taught me before.

474
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
I remember now.

475
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,759
Feng Qi,

476
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,599
you said your girlfriend

477
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,680
taught you the Character Eight Spiral Bandage before?

478
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,119
I have

479
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,279
I did tell you that.

480
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,519
That's right.

481
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,559
Chief Kimura.

482
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,480
There are very few people in China

483
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,519
the eight character spiral bandage in China.

484
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:25,640
Right?

485
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,000
It's Feng Qi.

486
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,880
What do you mean?

487
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,079
I bandaged Jiang Zhaoguo.

488
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,400
That was impossible.

489
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Then tell me.

490
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,839
You were already suspended on the day of the crime.

491
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,640
Why were you at the crime scene?

492
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,039
I just think that

493
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,559
for this investigation,

494
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,720
for this investigation.

495
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,319
Captain Zhao and others went to arrest him

496
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,119
but leave me alone.

497
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,519
I feel wronged.

498
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,319
I just want to see the scene.

499
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,440
You want to mess up the operation, right?

500
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,359
How could I sabotage it?

501
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,279
You didn't mess up the operation.

502
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,440
Officer Kimura,

503
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,160
feng Qi was working for the Military Commissioner...

504
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,680
Feng Qi served the military.

505
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,319
Blow up the cars,

506
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,599
you're the one who warned the negotiators, aren't you?

507
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,079
And that nun,

508
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
Is one of your fellows, right?

509
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
It was you

510
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,839
It's you

511
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,839
that you bandaged his right arm?

512
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,039
Chen Jiaping,

513
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,240
that's not true!

514
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,119
Officer Mu,

515
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,240
how loyal I am to the Empire of Japan.

516
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,359
To the Japanese Empire.

517
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,279
I wouldn't be there to save Jiang Zhaoguo.

518
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,839
How could I be the military commander?

519
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,279
Feng Qi...

520
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
You haven't answered my question yet.

521
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,400
A vendor grabbed Frog's gun

522
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,519
and killed him?

523
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Even if he could,

524
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,480
what is his motive?

525
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,680
That Li Youtian

526
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,400
he is just a peddler!

527
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,599
How would I know

528
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,279
how could he be so capable?

529
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,160
You won't admit it, right?

530
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,200
Then I will answer it for you.

531
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,160
Officer Kimura.

532
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,720
Li Youtian is his partner.

533
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,839
He's here

534
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,400
to frame my wife

535
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,680
however, while waiting outside the door,

536
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
his secret was exposed

537
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,799
and was found by Frog.

538
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,079
So he took Frog's gun

539
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,160
and killed Frog.

540
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,039
As a special agent of the military command,

541
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,759
It's nothing.

542
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,400
Captain Zhao,

543
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,839
you know me best.

544
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,720
Please speak up for me

545
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,079
chief Chen

546
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,880
based on your analysis,

547
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,519
makes sense.

548
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,599
Officer Kimura.

549
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,519
You have to believe me.

550
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,160
How could I be the military commander?

551
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:34,759
My...

552
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,240
My loyalty to the empire

553
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,559
can be expressed

554
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,160
In every task.

555
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:45,960
Report!

556
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,680
Chief Kimura.

557
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,359
I have important things to report.

558
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,359
What is it?

559
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,359
Yes

560
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,039
last night

561
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,079
captain Zhao,

562
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,359
have kidnapped the two negotiators

563
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,279
are kidnapped.

564
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,240
Mr. Luo ordered me to secretly investigate this case.

565
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,920
All my efforts paid off.

566
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,200
According to our investigation,

567
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,079
they acted after receiving information.

568
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,480
However,

569
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,319
their negligence.

570
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,519
Because they left the intel at the scene,

571
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:41,839
officer Mu,

572
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,480
we found the note

573
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,079
was found in the hotel.

574
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,119
Captain Zhao,

575
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,079
look at this handwriting.

576
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,240
Do you know him?

577
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,880
Feng Qi,

578
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,440
Isn't this your handwriting?

579
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,160
Yes, this is right.

580
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,559
I think it's Feng Qi's handwriting.

581
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,119
I signed many of his reports.

582
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,680
Hey,

583
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,920
so you're the one with four of clubs.

584
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,519
Hey.

585
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,880
Someone framed me.

586
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
The ironclad details pile up mountain high

587
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,119
don't make excuses.

588
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,559
I didn't write that.

589
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,839
If it's not you,

590
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,039
this is your handwriting.

591
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,279
You said you didn't write it.

592
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,119
What?

593
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,559
This...

594
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,680
I wrote this.

595
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,759
But Li Youtian asked me

596
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,720
he asked me to.

597
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,599
He asked you to write it?

598
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,480
Is he your superior?

599
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,440
Not that.

600
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,079
I have no superior.

601
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,559
It's Li Youtian.

602
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,680
Captain, listen to me!

603
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,640
That Li Youtian

604
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,000
he lied to me to write it.

605
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,440
What did he lie about?

606
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,599
He wanted to eat out.

607
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,200
Red bean paste cake from Hongxiang Ji.

608
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,880
The Three-yellow Chicken of Fuyun Zhai

609
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:49,599
right.

610
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,359
That's not right.

611
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,680
The red bean paste cake from Fu Yun Zhai

612
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,440
the Three-yellow Chicken of the Hongxiang Story.

613
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,359
You are greedy.

614
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,599
I bought them.

615
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,720
For your grave.

616
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
It's not my taste

617
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,440
not really.

618
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,519
Brother,

619
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,680
I can explain.

620
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,359
I was really framed!

621
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,759
I'm not your big brother.

622
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,359
The words on this note are mine.

623
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,119
But someone has copied my writing.

624
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,839
Four of clubs in clubs.

625
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,920
You really screwed us.

626
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,759
I'm not the fourth of clubs.

627
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,519
Brother

628
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,440
look at the word

629
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,359
the hotel's name

630
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
the word "Guan" is wrong.

631
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,720
You wrote it wrong.

632
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,880
It's not normal.

633
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,519
It's lucky that you can write.

634
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:35,920
Brother.

635
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,559
Don't move!

636
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,079
Get out of the way!

637
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,559
Feng Qi!

638
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,359
Don't move!

639
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:39,960
Get out of the way.

640
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:40,880
Stand up!

641
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,400
Calm down, Feng Qi!

642
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,599
Back up!

643
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Stand back!

644
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,720
Don't move!

645
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,000
Throw the gun away.

646
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,880
Zhao An, I knew you wouldn't let me go.

647
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,359
You can't find out the four of clubs

648
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,440
now you're fine.

649
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
And blame it on me, right?

650
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,839
Feng Qi!

651
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,039
If you kidnap Officer Mu Cun,

652
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,640
won't solve anything.

653
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,440
Think about it.

654
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,440
If you are not guilty before,

655
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,559
If you did that,

656
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,279
you made yourself guilty.

657
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,160
If you are guilty,

658
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,519
you'll make it worse

659
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,200
you'll be doubly guilty

660
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:25,920
feng Qi,

661
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,559
calm down.

662
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,559
You can talk to me.

663
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,039
Zhao An doesn't believe you.

664
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,079
I believe you're innocent.

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,599
No one will call you

666
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,000
you'll be dead.

667
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,160
Calm down.

668
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,960
We can talk about anything.

669
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,200
Alright.

670
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:44,799
I'll release Chief Kimura.

671
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,079
But I need a hostage to exchange.

672
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,359
Who's that?

673
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,960
Left Double-peach.

674
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,559
I'm your hostage.

675
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,680
You are next.

676
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,200
In this case,

677
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
I can't bring two persons with me at the same time.

678
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
To frame me.

679
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,599
You both had a share, right?

680
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,440
Don't worry.

681
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,279
As long as I have my hands,

682
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,039
I have a hundred ways

683
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,359
to make her tell the truth.

684
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,039
You all remember that.

685
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,279
I have a small notebook

686
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,680
where I recorded all kinds of

687
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,559
methods of torture and cruel torture that I invented

688
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,039
as long as I have my hands,

689
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,160
I will find a way to get her to confess.

690
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,279
Then,

691
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,920
and exchange her.

692
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,039
Feng Qi!

693
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,000
As long as Left Shuangtao is your hostage,

694
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,039
you'll release Chief Kimura, right?

695
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,680
I promise.

696
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,240
I have no problem with that.

697
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,119
What about you?

698
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,240
Officer Kimura.

699
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,880
To protect you,

700
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,759
we will do whatever it takes

701
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,759
double Peach.

702
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,559
I'm so sorry.

703
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,079
Why are you holding my wife hostage?

704
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,440
Don't you want to save Officer Mu Cun?

705
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,920
Jiaping, for the sake of overall interests.

706
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,680
And peace for the family.

707
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,759
As long as we can save Officer Mu Cun,

708
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,880
If we can save Kimura.

709
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,000
Don't be scared.

710
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,400
Alright.

711
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,759
Left Shuangtao, come here.

712
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,240
After I release Officer Kimura.

713
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
Be gentle!

714
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,839
Wait and see.

715
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
I'll find out the truth

716
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,279
and clear my name.

717
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,599
Wait!

718
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,000
What are you doing?

719
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't try to create trouble for me.

720
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,000
Lipstick. Lipstick.

721
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,920
Lipstick?

722
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,960
I bought this lipstick for my wife.

723
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,599
Guoguo.

724
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,200
I thought Captain Zhao took it.

725
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
I bought you another lipstick.

726
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,160
This is really lipstick.

727
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,920
Nothing.

728
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,519
I don't have any gun with me.

729
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,720
It's safe.

730
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,319
I just want to give it to my wife.

731
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,079
OK?

732
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,400
Don't go any further.

733
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,960
Great.

734
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,160
Guoguo.

735
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,400
Catch it!

736
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,359
Are you alright?

737
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,200
Take him out.

738
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't look!

739
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,160
Officer Kimura,

740
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
thank you for the gun!

741
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,799
You

742
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,839
Is very brave.

743
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,039
Thanks to my wife being a hostage,

744
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,759
I have a chance to kill that four of clubs.

745
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,200
Do you think

746
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,559
Is Feng Qi with four of clubs?

747
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,000
He is the four of clubs.

748
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,599
Of course you want him to be

749
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,679
officer Kimura.

750
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,880
It was my fault.

751
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,679
I regret that

752
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,519
I should have shot him back then

753
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,679
If it's 4 of clubs,

754
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,960
why did he repeatedly

755
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,519
over and over again?

756
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,320
Four of clubs in clubs.

757
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,400
Could it be Juntong

758
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,199
that he's a double agent of the CCP?

759
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,519
It's possible

760
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,000
but there's another possibility

761
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,880
feng Qi works for the Military Commander.

762
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,320
Four of clubs in clubs.

763
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,159
Killed my wife.

764
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,840
Chief Kimura.

765
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,840
Give me more time.

766
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,400
I'll find out who four of clubs are.

767
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,880
All right.

768
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,159
Officer Kimura.

769
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,559
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

770
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,159
I won't let you down.

771
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
You will breed my horse

772
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,119
to raise my horse well.

773
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,480
And train it well.

774
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,039
I love Takeda very much.

775
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,559
Is what I should do

776
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,119
Is my duty.

777
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,800
You have to feed my horse well every day.

778
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,679
And wash them well.

779
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,599
Scooping poop and protecting feet!

780
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,320
Can you do that?

781
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,000
Officer Kimura.

782
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,360
I'm asking you, can you do that?

783
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,639
Please give me one more chance.

784
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,360
Last chance, Officer Kimura.

785
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,280
Captain Zhao.

786
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,719
Feng Qi works for you.

787
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:34,840
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Got it.

788
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,239
The gun was against my head.

789
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,280
That was your gun!

790
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,599
I can spare your life to feed my horse here.

791
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,719
Is your last chance.

792
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,440
Mr. Lu,

793
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
the Zizhu Langhao brush

794
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,239
very well.

795
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,239
But you see,

796
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,840
the pen is a little cracked.

797
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,760
Can you fix it for me?

798
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,199
Isn't it serious?

799
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,800
We can wind and fix it with wax thread.

800
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,679
There is miniature film in the pen,

801
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,960
documents about the peace talks.

802
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
How did you get this?

803
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,440
You asked me to...

804
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:50,960
What's the matter

805
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,039
zhao An is screwed.

806
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,480
He is screwed.

807
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,480
I've already helped you.

808
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,079
Come on.

809
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,840
I want to see you smile.

810
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Show me your smile.

811
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,119
Smile when you can.

812
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
Laugh louder.

813
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,199
Smile.

814
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Laugh louder.

815
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,199
The film in my hand...

816
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,239
But I have nowhere to run.

817
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,480
Zhao An's men showed up again.

818
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,599
If I hide the film in my body,

819
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,280
they will definitely find it out.

820
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,079
So I can only hide it somewhere else.

821
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,599
You're hiding in the room.

822
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,599
Nothing

823
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,119
that villa will be closed down

824
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,599
and Zhao An will send his men to keep surveillance there.

825
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,440
How would I get in?

826
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,679
Then where are you hiding?

827
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,239
You know to keep me guessing?

828
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,360
I thought

829
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
han Lu and Jiang Zhao would leave Shanghai together.

830
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,079
If I want to get the film

831
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,480
the film in the ring box

832
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
to get the film in the ring.

833
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,199
But unexpectedly,

834
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,000
the Cold Dew didn't leave me.

835
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,840
Which saved me a lot of trouble.

836
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,079
Doesn't Zuo Shuangtao suspect you?

837
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:11,599
He's not.

838
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,679
They have a lot of tasks recently.

839
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,840
Originally,

840
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm a little worried.

841
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,000
But from what I know,

842
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,199
I over-think.

843
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,320
Your organization hasn't

844
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,400
hasn't been approved by the organization.

845
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,840
If the organization doesn't agree, you continue to lurk.

846
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,679
Old path.

847
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,719
I want to add one additional item to my application.

848
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,159
To fight for my Left Twin Peaches?

849
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,719
To assist me with my work.

850
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,760
This will not only guarantee my identity,

851
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,639
you can help me.

852
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,039
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

853
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,239
The organization has very strict rules and disciplines.

854
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,840
It's not easy to hire

855
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,199
to hire more external staff.

856
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,639
I know.

857
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,559
But the Left Shuangtao

858
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,000
In this mission

859
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,039
he was able to rescue

860
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,679
with no injuries.

861
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,519
He also managed to

862
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,320
onto Feng Qi.

863
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,079
Her bravery and wisdom

864
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,480
are beyond my imagination.

865
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,199
She's the best special agent.

866
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,079
She may have good ability,

867
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,480
but what about her ideology?

868
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,239
What about her belief?

869
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,599
Was she willing to leave the military organization?

870
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,079
Could she deny the current beliefs

871
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,519
the current belief in her heart?

872
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,119
Does she know about communism?

873
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,440
But the transformation of ideology

874
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,800
and the establishment of faith,

875
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,119
the establishment of her faith.

876
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,280
Your identity is confidential.

877
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,519
How will you help her?

878
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,239
I will think of a way.

879
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,320
Recently, Juntong's anti-communist actions

880
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,440
are more and more blatant.

881
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,159
And the situation is getting more and more complicated.

882
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,320
Even if she's

883
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,760
from the perspective of mind,

884
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,679
no one can guarantee that

885
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,400
she's trying

886
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,920
to infiltrate our party?

887
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,760
The screening and vetting process

888
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,519
Is long and harsh.

889
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,559
The old roads

890
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,599
and every operation we take

891
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,760
we always encounter obstacles.

892
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,360
And now he's talking about a lot of difficulties

893
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,960
and then be scared by the difficulties.

894
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,400
This isn't like you, Old Lu.

895
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm sorry, Lao Lu.

896
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,079
I know you're doing it for me.

897
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,199
You don't want me

898
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,199
suffer like you, right?

899
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,480
You're already walking on thin ice.

900
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,840
If you want to promote her,

901
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,960
and Juntong realizes your motive,

902
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,679
they will attack you immediately.

903
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,559
And her as well.

904
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:08,800
Of course,

905
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,679
this is just my personal attitude.

906
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,599
I will inform

907
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,079
I'll report it to my superior.

908
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,800
Thank you.

909
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,440
Old road.

910
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,920
While waiting for the approval,

911
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
while you're waiting for the approval.

912
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:26,920
What is it?

913
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,039
This person is called Zhu Yuhua,

914
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,280
who was an expert in plate-making.

915
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,159
The border coins issued in Yan'an

916
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,679
he participated in the design and plate-making.

917
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,679
He now lives in French Concession

918
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,360
he contacted Vox Lux

919
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,039
he said he has important information

920
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,440
that he wanted to give us.

921
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,440
Yes

922
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,199
this idea that...

923
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,599
A thought crossed my mind.

924
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,400
With the gun in my hand,

925
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,280
If I fail to hit it,

926
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,400
I will be a sinner forever.

927
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,960
Then the gun in my hand

928
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,719
became heavier and heavier.

929
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,079
But they become stable.

930
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,079
I raised the gun

931
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,800
to Feng Qi's heart.

932
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm thinking that

933
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,199
I must hit this shot.

934
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,599
Or

935
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,800
how can I save my beloved Guo Guo

936
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,039
and my beloved one?

937
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,239
Alright.

938
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:22,880
Got it.

939
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,599
Your shot was brave.

940
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,800
And you looked great when you fired it.

941
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,440
Right?

942
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,559
You're my real husband.

943
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,719
No other husband in the world.

944
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm a little worried about

945
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,039
If you won't

946
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,920
talk about this for a month?

947
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,360
That's too much.

948
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,159
One month?

949
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,559
Can you finish it in one month?

950
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,519
I conceived the story

951
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,079
60 times in my mind.

952
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:54,480
Why did you interrupt me

953
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,280
yet you interrupted me.

954
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,320
That's too much.

955
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:57,840
That's outrageous.

956
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,599
Do you think

957
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,039
feng Qi really bandaged Jiang Zhaoguo?

958
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,519
Then I don't know.

959
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:13,000
Would anyone know how Feng Qi was bandaged?

960
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,559
And colluded with Jiang Zhaoguo

961
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,280
to frame him.

962
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:15,880
to frame him.
