1
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
What about Zuo Shuangtao?

2
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,359
Who's her?

3
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,359
Do you know her better?

4
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,280
She's always been progressive.

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,719
How can you guarantee her ideas won't change

6
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,519
over a year?

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,799
The organization must re-investigate Zuo Shuangtao.

8
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,640
Without any reply,

9
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
you can't get married without permission.

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,959
It's a matter of discipline.

11
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,079
Yes

12
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,319
I resolutely obey the organization.

13
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,359
Old road.

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,719
Can I

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,159
ask you a personal question?

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,120
What is it?

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,319
Have you got married?

18
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,560
Did you have a wife and kids?

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,199
Before I

20
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,199
before I joined the revolutionary work,

21
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,159
you joined the revolutionary work.

22
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,520
My wife works for

23
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,080
she's from the next village

24
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
with big eyes and long braids

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
she doesn't like many girls who come to my house.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I was the one she liked.

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,319
Then I brought her to the city,

28
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,840
I joined the workers' movement

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
and I got into touch with communism.

30
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,120
Then I joined the Party.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,000
She arranged me to work underground.

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,319
But I have to hide my identity from her.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
That's it.

34
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,599
Two years passed.

35
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,639
Until one day...

36
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,960
Due to the betrayal of a traitor,

37
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,400
about our group of underground workers.

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,159
Of our group of underground workers

39
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,280
are exposed.

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
We need to evacuate urgently.

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,080
I rushed home,

42
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,319
but they were still one step late.

43
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,159
The Kuomintang's secret agents

44
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,919
captured her.

45
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,199
That's because

46
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,719
caught us.

47
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,919
To take revenge and vent anger,

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,000
he executed all the relatives

49
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,719
the relatives they caught.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,319
We are here

51
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,639
eliminate the Japanese aggressors and traitors.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,279
Intelligence.

53
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,160
Blow up bridges.

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,199
There's nothing you can't do

55
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,879
but often

56
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,439
your family.

57
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,759
Chengzi.

58
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,319
Are you busy?

59
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:00,800
No, I'm not.

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,519
What's up

61
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,759
let me ask you something.

62
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,519
Are there many flower shops in the French Concession?

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
That's right.

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,240
Foreigners

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
love flowers.

66
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,680
I have another mission.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,639
It's not a mission.

68
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,879
Do me a favor this time.

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Help me?

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,800
One thousand roses

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,680
and send them to the company where I work.

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,519
Got it.

73
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,759
It's love.

74
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,920
Love.

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,600
Stop messing around.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
Other than roses,

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
please buy me some candles.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,360
The more, the better.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,959
The sooner the better

80
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,519
I won't take advantage of you this time.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Your pay is all yours.

82
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,959
Fooled me for a long time, right?

83
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,399
But it must be enough.

84
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,319
After investigation,

85
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,759
zuo Shuangtao had an accident

86
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,759
he participated in

87
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,639
anti-Japanese activities organized by non-governmental organizations.

88
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,800
It's a patriotic youth.

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
No other political background is found so far.

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
She agrees to the marriage?

91
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,360
We're almost there.

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,079
Slow down.

93
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,839
Chase me.

94
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,600
Kids in this Alley,

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,519
always so energetic.

96
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,800
You'll know it later.

97
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
I can't even sleep.

98
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,800
This way

99
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,040
jiaping.

100
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,839
Get off work.

101
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,600
Miss Li,

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,279
have you had dinner

103
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,240
not yet.

104
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,079
I've never seen this pretty girl before.

105
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,399
Miss Li.

106
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,040
This is my fiancée, Guoguo.

107
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,120
My fiancée?

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,279
Miss.

109
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,399
You know what?

110
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,839
If you marry Jia Ping,

111
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,800
you are so happy.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,759
That's Ping.

113
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,920
He's a very nice man.

114
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,199
He often gives us

115
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,959
to our neighbors.

116
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,839
No, I can't.

117
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,439
I have to

118
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,800
treat you with dinner today.

119
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,639
Old Wu.

120
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,959
Wu, come out and give me a hand.

121
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,800
Sis Li.

122
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,959
Don't bother.

123
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,279
This is your first day here.

124
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,319
I'll show her.

125
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,000
Another time?

126
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,959
Alright.

127
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,399
Miss, come to my house for dinner sometime?

128
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,160
Come on, Ms. Li.

129
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,079
See you

130
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,360
we're here.

131
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Right here.

132
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,240
Balcony

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,199
come on.

134
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,560
Come in, please.

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,759
I found you very popular.

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,439
A neighbor is better than your distant relatives.

137
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,959
What about

138
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,720
Is my home all right?

139
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
I'll show you my cooking later.

140
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,839
It seems that you, traitor,

141
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,319
are not very good.

142
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,720
Right.

143
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,959
Traitors?

144
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,879
Is an inferior one?

145
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,399
Unfortunately, Ms. Zuo

146
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,600
I happen to be the one who muddles the worst.

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,279
Will you believe it?

148
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,079
I'm hungry.

149
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,759
Alright.

150
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,959
I'll do it now.

151
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,600
Spring noodles

152
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
with fried potherb mustard.

153
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,560
Alright?

154
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,800
Make yourself at home.

155
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,079
Make yourself at home.

156
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,800
Have a seat.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,799
What are you doing?

158
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,360
Does it taste spicy?

159
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,720
You don't know

160
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
don't you know?

161
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,720
Your house is so old.

162
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,840
Even the walls smell.

163
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,919
It's time to put the wallpaper on.

164
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,399
Alright.

165
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,600
You can choose

166
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,519
please do me a favor.

167
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,360
What's up

168
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,200
I ran out of lard.

169
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,759
Without lard, this spring noodle is soulless.

170
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,159
Help me get the bowl.

171
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,879
Go downstairs and ask Sis Li for some food.

172
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,240
How could I be embarrassed?

173
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,639
We are not close.

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,639
Easy for me once,

175
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,399
but I am familiar again after the first time.

176
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,000
Furthermore,

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,159
miss Li used the lard

178
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,639
was given to her by me last time

179
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,519
sample.

180
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,720
Is really great.

181
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,879
I've finally finished my work.

182
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,440
I've finished?

183
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,639
I still have a long way to go.

184
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,559
Picking the wedding dress, booking the hotel and picking the date,

185
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,919
we still have a lot of things to do.

186
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,919
You must be regretful now.

187
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,240
I didn't say anything.

188
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,519
You didn't say that?

189
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,879
You must feel that in your heart.

190
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,519
How about you listen to it?

191
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,559
What am I thinking in my heart right now?

192
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,559
I'm too lazy to move.

193
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
Listen to what you're saying.

194
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,279
You can't be a traitor.

195
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,039
We should just leave

196
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,639
In Shanghai anymore.

197
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,320
There are so many Japanese people everywhere.

198
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,639
Where?

199
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,559
Only when all the Japanese leave

200
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,879
will we be free.

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,919
We can buy a bed tomorrow.

202
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,000
I can't sleep on the floor all the time.

203
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,399
You choose the curtains tomorrow.

204
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,679
I will choose the bed.

205
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,519
Alright.

206
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,440
Should the mattress be soft or hard?

207
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
It's your choice.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,759
You're the boss.

209
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,720
Alright.

210
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,799
Listen to me for the curtains.

211
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:16,960
Alright.

212
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
I think the mattress

213
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,600
better than that.

214
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,120
What a coincidence.

215
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,240
What a coincidence!

216
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,679
Come on.

217
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,080
Eat something together.

218
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,720
We've tasted everything.

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
What a surprise!

220
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,240
What?

221
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,200
I didn't expect you'd step into the tomb of love

222
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,159
without hesitation.

223
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,919
Who cares if it's a tomb?

224
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,840
In the end,

225
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,559
buried in the end.

226
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,480
It'll be worth it.

227
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,440
Second.

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
Get me a cup.

229
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:18,960
Alright.

230
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Such a touching love confession?

231
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,600
Enjoy yourself.

232
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,200
Thanks.

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,159
It's a pity

234
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,799
It's not my turn

235
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,919
lu Fangfang,

236
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,240
I think

237
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
some misunderstanding about me before.

238
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,759
No, I didn't.

239
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,639
I just like you.

240
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,279
That you don't like me?

241
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,320
That's all.

242
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,799
Right?

243
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
Did I really misunderstand that

244
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,240
you also loved me?

245
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,960
Hey,

246
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,480
It's Lu Fangfang.

247
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,639
That's enough

248
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,399
even if there is,

249
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,960
you don't dare to say anything?

250
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,360
That little wife of yours

251
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,200
Is really strong.

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Chen Jiaping,

253
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,480
don't say I haven't warned you.

254
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,799
Zhao An and Luo Guanqun

255
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,960
they tried so hard

256
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,639
to get you married.

257
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,879
Don't you see anything fishy?

258
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,960
He wants to get the relation

259
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,559
and benevolence.

260
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,200
It's not that simple, right?

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,440
Then I'll ask you another question.

262
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,559
What if

263
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
zuo Shuangtao is a killer.

264
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,399
Do you still dare to love her and marry her?

265
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,120
If your lover is a killer,

266
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
would you dare to love him and marry him?

267
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,879
That's a good question.

268
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,840
I have to think about it.

269
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,320
I will.

270
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,679
Why not?

271
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,720
You don't choose anyone

272
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
who is not a killer.

273
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,359
Or undercover,

274
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,240
at all.

275
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,319
If you dare marry me,

276
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,680
If she dares to marry me.

277
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,079
I just think that

278
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,119
your previous high standards were too high.

279
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,920
It's not that I have such high standards.

280
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,200
You don't understand me.

281
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
I indeed don't understand you.

282
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,200
However,

283
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,279
by my intuition.

284
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,920
I think that

285
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,519
you are different from the others in the business.

286
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,079
Then trust your intuition.

287
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,359
Alas, this is men's doing.

288
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,480
Never, ever tell a woman

289
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,839
about everything.

290
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,920
Even their closest women,

291
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,759
there are some secrets,

292
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,400
can only be kept to yourself.

293
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,720
Got it.

294
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:06,680
Thank you.

295
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,960
Alright.

296
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't want any alcohol either.

297
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,920
Zhao An asked me to review

298
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,359
zhao An asked me to review a temporary budget.

299
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,559
Provisional budget

300
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,400
what does Captain Zhao

301
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,440
Is Captain Zhao up to?

302
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,839
It sounds like a meeting.

303
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,920
I don't know the details.

304
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
So I don't have the right to ask.

305
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,400
Come on.

306
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,240
You

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,279
to the new plan.

308
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,279
By the way,

309
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,240
how are you preparing for the special meeting?

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
There are some procedures to follow.

311
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,319
Almost.

312
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,839
The sealed document in Zhao An's safe

313
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,640
Is marked "Shan project."

314
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
Must be related to Shan Project.

315
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,880
But I think the Japanese wouldn't

316
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,640
give such an important document directly to Zhao An.

317
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,640
So, Zhao An's file

318
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,839
or a sub-plan of Shan Project,

319
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,160
If we follow your plan,

320
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,000
when we raise enough funds,

321
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,720
how long would it take

322
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,960
kimura mentioned that she's dissatisfied

323
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,519
about the amount of funds raised by Zhao An,

324
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,160
so this sub-plan

325
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,440
might be a plan to prepare funds for Shan Project.

326
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm going to Nanjing tomorrow

327
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,279
come back in a week.

328
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,079
Bring your new plan

329
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,160
and attend the special meeting with me.

330
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,720
After Kimura returned to Shanghai,

331
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,559
to attend

332
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,319
might be related to Shan Plan.

333
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,759
Zhao An's plan might be

334
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,960
could be a clue to the investigation of Shan's plan.

335
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,319
But Zhao An comes and goes these days.

336
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,920
There's no chance to get close to him

337
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,960
but the temporary budget Lu Fang mentioned

338
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,559
there might be clues related to the special meeting.

339
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,759
We must find a way

340
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,559
the temporary budget tomorrow.

341
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,680
Hello?

342
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,960
Hello, Jiaping.

343
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:24,839
After getting off work,

344
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,400
let's go to the bridal shop next to Yong'an Department Store

345
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,559
to look at the wedding dresses.

346
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,839
After work,

347
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:33,759
hey.

348
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,400
Hello?

349
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm here.

350
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,359
Alright.

351
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,920
See you at the bridal shop after work.

352
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,000
Alright.

353
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,279
See you later

354
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,440
fang Fang!

355
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,240
Fang Fang, Lu Fang!

356
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,440
Where are you going?

357
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,960
I'll go to the finance bureau.

358
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,680
That...

359
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,640
Is he in a hurry?

360
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,079
There's still time?

361
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,119
What is it?

362
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,279
I'm going to marry Zuo Shuangtao.

363
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,799
I have to choose a wedding dress.

364
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,559
Can you check it for me?

365
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,400
Shouldn't you ask Miss Zuo for this?

366
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,160
Why are you looking for me?

367
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,480
I don't have good taste.

368
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,319
I wanted to ask for some advice.

369
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,359
I'll treat you to dinner later.

370
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,680
Two meals.

371
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,839
Deal is done.

372
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,279
Hurry up.

373
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,160
Then let's go.

374
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,119
Mister.

375
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,400
The bride is so pretty.

376
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm sure she'll look good in anything.

377
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,559
You're really sweet.

378
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,680
Look at how good she is.

379
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,720
Miss,

380
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,480
please don't misunderstand.

381
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
This lady is not the bride.

382
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,599
You can't blame the girl.

383
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,200
How can I do that?

384
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,480
To accompany you

385
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,119
to choose wedding dresses for others.

386
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,599
What do you think of this?

387
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,240
This is the latest fashion of our store.

388
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,960
If you like them, please try them on.

389
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,440
I won't try it.

390
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,000
I have to try it on.

391
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,359
But try that one.

392
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,720
That style suits you better.

393
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,000
Why should I try it on?

394
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,359
I don't know when I'll get married.

395
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
That's not right.

396
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,640
Women don't wear wedding dresses for men.

397
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,359
He's trying to preserve his beauty.

398
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,519
Right?

399
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:56,960
Furthermore,

400
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,880
since you're here,

401
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,480
have a try.

402
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,319
Miss,

403
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,279
find a suitable model

404
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,200
that style.

405
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,759
Alright.

406
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:04,720
Come. Give me your pack.

407
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,559
Go have a try.

408
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,599
Let me try it on.

409
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,240
Give it a try.

410
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,759
Come on, Miss.

411
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,359
This way, please.

412
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:40,880
Jiaping.

413
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,279
What are you doing?

414
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,839
Why did you come so early?

415
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,680
Didn't we meet after work?

416
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm not working.

417
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,119
So I want to come earlier to see you.

418
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,319
On the contrary,

419
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,119
Inform me about coming earlier?

420
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,359
Home Ping.

421
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,079
Family Ping.

422
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,039
Jia Ping.

423
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,680
Shouldn't you explain

424
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,960
shouldn't you explain to me

425
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,599
you should indeed.

426
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,079
There's nothing to explain.

427
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
Jiaping accompany me to choose the wedding dress

428
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,359
that's it?

429
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,880
It's not Lu Fangfang,

430
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,119
we can't make such a scene!

431
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,880
Actually,

432
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,759
didn't we come to the bridal shop

433
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,039
to choose a dress after work?

434
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,960
I just want to ask Lu Fang Fang's help

435
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,200
to give me some advice.

436
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,519
Please don't get the wrong idea.

437
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,720
I don't need anyone to choose my wedding dress.

438
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,759
Please don't.

439
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,599
I'm sorry, all right? All right!

440
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,599
Your Majesty!

441
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,759
You were wrong

442
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,519
Is indeed your fault.

443
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,839
Even if Shuangtao is angry,

444
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
I'm also pretty angry.

445
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,160
You asked me to accompany you

446
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,519
to choose the wedding dress for your bride.

447
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,119
What's your opinion?

448
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,079
Yes, of course.

449
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,279
It's all my fault.

450
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,880
I wasn't considerate enough.

451
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,160
Sorry to both of you.

452
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,000
You should have told me

453
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,839
to come here earlier.

454
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,039
That's right.

455
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,960
Guoguo, everything you say is right.

456
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,799
Actually...

457
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,319
Actually, I don't mean anything.

458
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,759
I just want to be able to

459
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,039
to show off

460
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,920
In front of you.

461
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,960
Like this.

462
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,279
Double-peach.

463
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,119
Don't be angry.

464
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,839
Can I have family peace?

465
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,039
He's just kind.

466
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,400
He's doing everything for your good.

467
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,759
He chatted with me on his way here.

468
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,200
To choose the most beautiful wedding dress for you.

469
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,920
Today is a happy day.

470
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,839
Don't think too much.

471
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,160
Come and see.

472
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,559
What do you think of my wedding dress?

473
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,720
It's pretty.

474
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,799
It fits you well.

475
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,440
Don't be.

476
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,359
This house

477
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,119
It fits your temperament.

478
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,119
Right?

479
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,000
Guoguo, look at that one.

480
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,599
The one in front.

481
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,039
That one looks nice.

482
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,359
Try that one.

483
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,440
Miss,

484
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,920
I need to find a size that fits my girlfriend.

485
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,400
Alright.

486
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,000
Thanks.

487
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,359
By the way,

488
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,039
here, Miss.

489
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:10,799
This way please

490
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:14,960
fang Fang,

491
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,079
thank you

492
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,400
three meals.

493
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,279
For three meals?

494
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,240
Three meals?

495
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,599
I saw your emergency contact signal

496
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,960
near the bridal shop,

497
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,559
and rushed here immediately.

498
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,960
Your wedding with Chen Jiaping

499
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,000
must be held within three days.

500
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,440
Why not?

501
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,000
We just got the information.

502
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,599
The martial man under the mountain will be transferred

503
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,960
to Suzhou Military Police Headquarters next week.

504
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,480
Is leaving next Monday.

505
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
If your wedding is held after that,

506
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,039
he has no time to attend it,

507
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,880
our plan will be ruined.

508
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,039
Isn't it too hasty?

509
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,119
Hasty?

510
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,559
You really take the wedding seriously.

511
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,799
The main thing is for the warrior from the mountain to attend.

512
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,440
Right?

513
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:09,799
Yes

514
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,759
so hurry to set

515
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,079
the time and place of the wedding

516
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,319
and your action plan.

517
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
So that I can make a post-operation evacuation plan.

518
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,319
Do you still have other concerns?

519
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,279
Nothing.

520
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,079
Miss Zuo.

521
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,559
Mr. Chen said that if you don't see him,

522
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,640
If you don't see him.

523
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,599
Got it.

524
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,319
Please, Guoguo.

525
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,680
I was wrong.

526
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
Please forgive me.

527
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,240
Look at this.

528
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,079
I bought the wedding dress you like.

529
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,920
I will let you wear it then.

530
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,680
I'll lead you to dance like this.

531
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
You bought this for Lu Fang Fang, right?

532
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,920
You know what?

533
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,200
No one can beat you in this wedding dress.

534
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,240
This is the best on you.

535
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,960
You look good in anything.

536
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,119
It's ugly.

537
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,200
It's really good.

538
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,359
It's so ugly.

539
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,599
It's nice.

540
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,759
It looks best on you.

541
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,319
What's that?

542
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:46,680
This one?

543
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,880
My pickle jar.

544
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,200
I bought a wedding dress, booked a hotel and bought furniture,

545
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,039
my savings are all used up.

546
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,119
Marry me.

547
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,839
We can only live on pickles.

548
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,000
If you want me to forgive you,

549
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,400
promise me one thing.

550
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,720
I'll promise you all the terms.

551
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,440
Go ahead,

552
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,880
the wedding will be held in three days.

553
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,039
Three days?

554
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,079
That's not it.

555
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,799
I have no time to prepare.

556
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,680
That means you won't agree?

557
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Don't.

558
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,200
I promise. I will.

559
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,160
Alright.

560
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll look for the hotel tomorrow morning, okay?

561
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,319
Don't be angry.

562
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:32,440
No need.

563
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,559
I've found one.

564
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,559
When I passed by Sason Manor today,

565
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,359
I think it's luxurious and grand enough,

566
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
I like it so much

567
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,039
so I'm settled on it.

568
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,039
I like it,too

569
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,200
but Guoguo, you know how expensive

570
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,160
how expensive Sassoon Manor is?

571
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,559
Their feast

572
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,759
has cost me a month's pay.

573
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,319
Sure enough,

574
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,039
am I important

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,960
not enough.

576
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,519
Don't.

577
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,079
Heavy enough.

578
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,759
It's very heavy.

579
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,839
Alright.

580
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,240
I'll pay the deposit tomorrow morning.

581
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,640
Alright.

582
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,160
Put the wedding dress down.

583
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,839
You can go back now.

584
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,519
Don't you want to see me?

585
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Didn't you know that?

586
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,680
The bride and groom are not allowed to see each other

587
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,880
the bride and groom are not allowed to meet.

588
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,319
Alright.

589
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,680
We have to see each other every day after you marry me.

590
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,200
It won't take another day.

591
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,839
I'll leave then.

592
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,519
I'm really leaving.

593
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,519
OK.

594
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
Let's eat pickles together later.

595
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,759
Guoguo.

596
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,599
You look really beautiful

597
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,559
In the wedding dress.

598
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,400
Very pretty.

599
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,799
According to the budget,

600
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,519
the special meeting will be held in three days at two p.m.

601
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,880
In the Huihong Building, Wanning Bridge, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.

602
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,720
It will be the same day as my wedding.

603
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,759
Maybe on Zhao An's way to the meeting

604
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,759
there might be a chance

605
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,039
to capture the plan he has secretly

606
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,279
come here.

607
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,680
This way.

608
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,079
Boss, where to put it?

609
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,160
Put it here.

610
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,880
Right here.

611
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,400
Untie this.

612
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,799
OK.

613
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,480
Thank you, Boss.

614
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,000
Thank you.

615
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,279
What about

616
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,519
authentic French cherry wood.

617
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,519
Corduroy fabric sofa.

618
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,119
Perfect.

619
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,880
I knew I was asking you for a favor.

620
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,039
That's right.

621
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,839
By the way,

622
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,279
why is the sofa so green?

623
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,319
Is this green?

624
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,079
How advanced is the green one?

625
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,640
However,

626
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,960
It doesn't matter.

627
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,839
This...

628
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,200
Money.

629
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,119
We're all brothers.

630
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,200
Money or not,

631
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:21,960
that's right.

632
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,559
How come it feels so good

633
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,759
when you say it?

634
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,440
I'll get married tomorrow.

635
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,599
I didn't ask you to give me a red packet.

636
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,519
Did you invite me?

637
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,599
I really want to.

638
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,079
But tomorrow, all the people will be traitors.

639
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,680
You're comfortable with the wine.

640
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,000
That's right.

641
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,359
I guess you didn't just ask me

642
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
not only to ask you for a swindle, right?

643
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Doesn't that mean I let you off easily?

644
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,880
I knew it.

645
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,400
Here's the thing.

646
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,119
Zhao An's car will pass

647
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,839
zhao An's car will pass through the French Concession.

648
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,200
You must find a way

649
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,519
to stop the car.

650
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,119
Then?

651
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,400
And bring him to the police station

652
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,359
and impound his things

653
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,839
waiting for an opportunity to take out the documents from his bag

654
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,000
and hand them to me.

655
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,839
What document?

656
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,359
Is an important project.

657
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,159
I'll remake the plan quickly.

658
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,159
Then you put the documents back in his bag

659
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,159
and got the important information

660
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,960
without knowing it.

661
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:15,840
That's right.

662
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,480
Then I have a question.

663
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,760
How can you be sure

664
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,039
zhao An's car will enter French Concession?

665
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,360
By which point will he enter?

666
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,400
And when you entered?

667
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
Which path he took,

668
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,880
on what ground should I detain him?

669
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,320
That's why I said I wouldn't let you off easily.

670
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,199
I invited you here to discuss

671
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,920
how to solve the problem.

672
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,320
Where did you catch this?

673
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,039
The casino.

674
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,559
How did you find any clue?

675
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,960
Where are you?

676
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,000
I went to play a few games

677
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,480
I didn't expect him to be there too.

678
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,840
I saw him right after I went in.

679
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,400
But when he found me,

680
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,800
when he found me.

681
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,480
I gave them chase.

682
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,719
I chased him for two blocks.

683
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,079
Is the assassin under the mountain?

684
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,039
That's right.

685
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:57,960
And confessed.

686
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,840
Alright.

687
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,639
Spill the beans.

688
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,159
I told you.

689
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,760
I am the assassin in the Mountain Below.

690
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,480
What else can I say?

691
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,679
Who is your superior?

692
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,559
I never met him.

693
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,760
Do you have any accomplices?

694
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,320
There's a man named Da Xuan.

695
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
But he was killed by you.

696
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,119
There are more.

697
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,760
That's all?

698
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,920
You're lying.

699
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,039
What's that?

700
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,639
What's that?

701
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Give it back to me.

702
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,360
What are the meanings of the numbers here?

703
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,960
I want you to return it to me.

704
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,400
That means so much to you.

705
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,000
On it.

706
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,559
Then the number

707
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,280
means a lot to me.

708
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,760
Commander Shanxia is asking you.

709
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,960
What do you want from him?

710
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,840
On the assassin.

711
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,519
Has been captured by Zhao An.

712
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,199
So I came to report to the Commander.

713
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,079
What do you mean?

714
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,000
Commander from the lower mountain.

715
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,280
I asked Zuo Shuangtao to fill in the profile

716
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,400
I asked her to fill out personal information.

717
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,400
I remember that

718
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,960
the date of birth she wrote down

719
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,360
Is September 17th

720
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,440
you mean it's Zuo Shuangtao's birthday?

721
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,159
Exactly.

722
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,400
Could it be that Kun you caught

723
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,440
knew Zuo Shuangtao?

724
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,280
He might not just

725
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,559
he probably likes Left Shuangtao.

726
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,840
Otherwise, he wouldn't have engraved

727
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,800
on his necklace.

728
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,199
Go on.

729
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,159
Colonel Yamashita.

730
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,159
When you were attacked at the train station,

731
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,960
zuo Shuangtao's suspicions

732
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,360
haven't been cleared?

733
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,480
But because of the evidence,

734
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,239
that's why I haven't found concrete evidence.

735
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,920
In order to let them get married,

736
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,800
Isn't that a trap

737
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
to lure them out?

738
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,079
I've caught Kun this time

739
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,719
I think we can kill him with one shot.

740
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,840
Didn't you say Kun wouldn't confess?

741
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,679
If a man really

742
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,440
with the woman he loves,

743
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,760
he won't

744
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,840
he won't confide anything.

745
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,920
Do you have any plans?

746
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,199
Isn't Zuo Shuangtao getting married soon?

747
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,679
What if Kun

748
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,960
to witness the woman he loves

749
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,760
to marry another man.

750
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,440
What do you think

751
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,800
would feel?

752
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,440
The car key.

753
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:27,960
What's up?

754
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,559
Pick up the bride?

755
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,920
This is your wedding day.

756
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,440
My car can't.

757
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,239
It's too shabby.

758
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,320
She is at least my niece.

759
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,400
He needs to be a bit disagreeable.

760
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,199
The layout?

761
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,119
Mr. Yu has made all the arrangements.

762
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,400
That's great.

763
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,760
Jiaping,

764
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,519
It means Mr. Yu values you.

765
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,400
In the future, all boats will rise.

766
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,239
High.

767
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,199
Come on.

768
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,719
Let's live happily.

769
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,159
Happy?

770
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,280
Brother.

771
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,920
The meeting is over.

772
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,239
Are you still attending

773
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,119
chen Family Ping's wedding tonight?

774
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,280
Certainly.

775
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,440
There is going to be a good show tonight.

776
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,880
Really

777
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:23,119
are you going to listen to the bed at night?

778
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,519
You think I'm you?

779
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,320
Brother.

780
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,519
When will I be able to attend your wedding?

781
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,280
When will you see the doctor?

782
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,800
I'm not sick.

783
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,920
You performed with others.

784
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,559
Do you think you are normal?

785
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
The question you ask and the way you think

786
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,000
do you think you are normal?

787
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,199
Normal.

788
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,639
What's up

789
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,199
I'll check it out.

790
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,119
Hurry.

791
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,679
What happened

792
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,599
right away, brother.

793
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,800
It's too late.

794
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Let's go Meg Road.

795
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,400
That's the French Concession,

796
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,880
brother, don't you remember

797
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,920
what we suffered last time?

798
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,159
We don't have the pass.

799
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,079
Meg Road is in the west.

800
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,079
Concession police rarely patrol there.

801
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,280
But it's a detour

802
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,119
set off.

803
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,440
Stop the car!

804
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:20,960
Brother.

805
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,039
Didn't you say there are no police patrolling this road?

806
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,000
It's not normal

807
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,559
detective.

808
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:29,400
Captain Zhao.

809
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,679
It's such a fate!

810
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,280
It's such a fate!

811
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,320
Sorry.

812
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Regular course of official duties

813
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,599
I need to check your Concession Pass.

814
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,280
Got it.

815
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,920
Excuse me, please.

816
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,239
Make an exception

817
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,440
thank you, Detective

818
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,519
come on

819
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,599
hold on.

820
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,480
Without a pass,

821
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,960
and attempted to bribe the public servants

822
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,000
I suspect you are scheming

823
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,199
engage in illegal activities

824
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:14,639
come!

825
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,920
Bring them down.

826
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,599
Search them.
