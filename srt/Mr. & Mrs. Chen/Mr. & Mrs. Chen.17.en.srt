1
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,879
What is this lighter...

2
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
Lanson diesel lighter.

3
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,640
It's made by the USA.

4
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,040
Nice to meet you.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,359
Hello

6
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,920
don't look that way.

7
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,000
They've contacted each other.

8
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,239
Captain.

9
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,280
I can't hear them here.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,319
Do you want to get closer?

11
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,040
Don't listen to them.

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
We won't act rashly.

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
After they split up,

14
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,040
we'll split up.

15
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,479
You and Chuan

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,000
or Tian,

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,479
laizi and I

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,599
before the crash.

19
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,599
Understood.

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,960
You can go now.

21
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,599
Yes

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,199
the Border Region government

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
stopped the circulation of the legal currency

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,759
and coin instead,

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,439
the Border Region's financial work has turned the tide

26
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,360
the Border Area's social stability

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,919
and the life of the people

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,759
has also been greatly improved.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,639
But no one could expect that

30
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,919
there were two Juntong spies

31
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,960
In the design and printing of the border.

32
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
The two hidden agents

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,479
by the name of Dayan?

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,360
That's right.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,719
There's another one.

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,439
Code name is Magpie.

37
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,520
Magpie.

38
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,879
The special unit and I

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
after investigating for a long time, we found them.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,560
I didn't expect it would leak out before the arrest.

41
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,400
They fled overnight.

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,159
They even took away the copper plates of two Chinese coins

43
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,759
and the formula for the banknote printing paper.

44
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,400
We tracked them down

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,960
and found them in Jinan.

46
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,560
But it was just a fake shot.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,520
They ran away separately.

48
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,840
I tracked Magpie

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,319
and so I came to Shanghai.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
This is a magpie.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,879
And his information.

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,159
Did they catch him?

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,319
That's it.

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,439
Managed to escape.

55
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,759
I got hurt too.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,719
I have no one to blame but myself. I'm useless.

57
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,120
It's not easy for you to find

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,000
to track down the undercover agents.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
This is urgent.

60
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,400
I don't know much about Shanghai.

61
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,159
So I can only use

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,159
the emergency contact program

63
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,639
the emergency contact procedure.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,639
I hope to get your help.

65
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,439
I'll gather the officers

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,639
the heads of several intelligence stations

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
to discuss it together.

68
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,479
Magpie was shot in the left arm and abdomen.

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,520
I think he's resting somewhere to recover.

70
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,840
Do you have any plan for him?

71
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,639
After I recover,

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll join you in the operation.

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
Take it easy. Take your time to recover.

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,279
Follow him.

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,560
Mom, I want candied haws.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,240
Alright.

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,839
How much is this candied haws?

78
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,439
I don't want to sell it.

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,279
I want to eat it!

80
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,759
Back off!

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,600
What are you doing?

82
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,560
Don't sell it if you don't.

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,240
I've told you I won't sell it.

84
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Why did you hit him?

85
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,480
The kid is so young.

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,639
How can you hit him?

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
How could you hit a child?

88
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,600
What are you doing?

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Catch up with him.

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,199
And pay as much as is necessary.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,920
What's wrong with you?

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,839
This is not good.

93
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
My old path is exposed.

94
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,160
Don't move.

95
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,680
This Dragon Tail Inkstone Stand is made of fine mud.

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,959
It can be said that the mud is more firm than stone, which can produce fluid all over the body.

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
This crack is caused

98
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,120
to cause this crack.

99
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,560
No, I mean Boss Lu,

100
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,040
It's used for grinding ink to write,

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,519
not as a knife to cut board.

102
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
How can it be improperly used?

103
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,439
Furthermore,

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,240
the repair cost

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,120
Is too expensive.

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
To repair the crack,

107
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,920
I made cement with stone powder,

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
and lubricate it,

109
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,000
then use yellow wax and ink

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,879
yellow wax and ink.

111
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,639
Look at this.

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,319
I'm intact, right?

113
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,959
Can you still see that crack?

114
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,000
No, we can't.

115
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,199
But Mr. Lu,

116
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,600
back then, you gave me such a big reputation.

117
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,480
What's the sound of knocking?

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,360
But no holes can be broken.

119
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,959
But it cracked after a few minutes.

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,839
I said you wouldn't sell me this is a fake, right?

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,560
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,120
Mr. Lu,

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,879
I've taken care of your business for so many times.

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,120
If you sell my counterfeits again,

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
to sell my fakes again.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,079
Could you please come and see

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
do you still want me to do business?

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,360
Old road.

129
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,439
Did you receive any reply

130
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,040
did the organization reply?

131
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,000
Saying my inkstone is a fake.

132
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,879
Don't be mad.

133
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,920
Please tell me.

134
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,360
The organization

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,879
has been approved.

136
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
You may continue lurking.

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Gently.

138
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't damage it.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,439
I spent a lot of money to repair it.

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,519
We'll ask for the Left Twin Peaches then.

141
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,560
What about the organization?

142
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,079
What's that about?

143
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,560
Hurry and tell me.

144
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,839
The organization

145
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
you must take it seriously.

146
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,199
You can do some tests calmly.

147
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,480
And observe her reaction.

148
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,319
Don't be impatient.

149
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,920
Do not let her detect your intentions.

150
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,240
Understood.

151
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
And the most important point is...

152
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,439
Organization.

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,759
To control your distance and discretion

154
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,000
In your marital relationship.

155
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,879
We shouldn't be too distant

156
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
nor to be too close.

157
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,639
Distance will cause doubt.

158
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,600
Proximity brings danger.

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,519
You must keep these eight words in mind.

160
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,839
I remember that.

161
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
The two of us

162
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
are having a fight recently.

163
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,360
I can use it to stir up trouble

164
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,120
she's so stubborn.

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,160
I know the answer.

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, right.

167
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,879
Let me show you something.

168
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,199
What is this?

169
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,759
The files you took

170
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,480
recorded a lot of Chongqing government's traitorous actions.

171
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,519
For example, they were prepared to accept

172
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,319
japan's proposal to sign a anti-communist military agreement.

173
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,279
Accepting the stationing of Japanese troops in Chinese soil,

174
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,439
they even acknowledged the puppet Manchukuo and reorganized the Chinese government.

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,799
When the news was published,

176
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,759
the national and international public opinions were in an uproar.

177
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,759
Condemned Jiang Jieshi's traitorous policy.

178
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,200
Old ways.

179
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,320
Can you give me this newspaper?

180
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,559
It's useful to me.

181
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
Keep it then.

182
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,279
By the way,

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
there's something else.

184
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,279
I think I have to tell you.

185
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,799
I met a comrade from Yan'an today

186
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,159
when I met him, he told me

187
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,200
two Juntong spies lurking in Yan'an

188
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
stole the copper plate of the border

189
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,519
the formula for the printing paper.

190
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,320
Zhu Yuhua also told me

191
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,399
that Plan Shan also intends to forge the border.

192
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,639
Do you think these two agents

193
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,600
be connected to Plan Shan?

194
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,120
It's not sure.

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
Tomorrow morning,

196
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,159
I'll have a meeting with the officers of the intelligence station

197
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,679
with the officers of the intelligence station.

198
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,159
You must keep a close eye on

199
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,600
the business and the Military Police Headquarters.

200
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Take care of the external security.

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes

202
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
one more thing.

203
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Quit smoking.

204
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,360
Then stop.

205
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,759
Your eyes are really sharp.

206
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,279
These

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,000
by the comrades from Yan'an today.

208
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,080
Brother Tian.

209
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,440
Brother Tian.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,919
What's your mission in Shanghai?

211
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,080
Other than the one on the Bund,

212
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,240
outside the Bund,

213
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,600
other contacts?

214
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,480
It's my...

215
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,679
The task.

216
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
What is it?

217
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,759
To resist Japan and save the nation.

218
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,759
My

219
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,559
who is

220
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Is a Chinese?

221
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,840
I know you can't say anything.

222
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,200
Never mind

223
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,240
we've followed

224
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
your previous contact.

225
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,279
Many melons can come out

226
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,399
you'll find a lot of melons.

227
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,840
It doesn't matter

228
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,440
It doesn't matter.

229
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,360
You

230
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,759
will not succeed.

231
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,919
Then have a look.

232
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,600
That's not right.

233
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,039
You won't be able to see either.

234
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,480
It's time for death.

235
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,639
And stubborn.

236
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,480
Just leave him here today.

237
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,559
We'll send Second Blade to collect his corpse tomorrow.

238
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,200
Yes

239
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,759
I have a request.

240
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,000
Go on.

241
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,519
I want to smoke.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,679
No need.

243
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,519
It's in my pocket.

244
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,440
The cigarette from your hometown.

245
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,080
It's good.

246
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,200
I really don't understand these CCP members.

247
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,440
You're dying yet you still don't have a good cigarette.

248
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,200
I can

249
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,360
go home.

250
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,919
Mr. Yamashita,

251
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
miss Cold Dew.

252
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,639
How's your health?

253
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm much better.

254
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,559
Thanks.

255
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,480
I know what you've been through.

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
And didn't bother you.

257
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480
After knowing you were discharged,

258
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,039
so I came to congratulate you.

259
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,759
That's right. Miss Cold Dew.

260
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,720
Mr. Yamashita

261
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,559
he prepared champagne for you.

262
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you for your kindness.

263
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,759
But recently,

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,759
I just want to be alone.

265
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,720
Miss Cold Dew.

266
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,480
I have experienced death.

267
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,559
Death opens a new life for me.

268
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I hope

269
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,639
miss Han Lu can be reborn as well.

270
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,879
Have you found out everything?

271
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,399
The CCP who contacted Tian

272
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,679
Is called Lu You Sheng.

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,039
Those who know him call him Lao Lu.

274
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
He is the owner of a shop

275
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
of Yumo Calligraphy and Painting.

276
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,919
Yumo Calligraphy and Painting Shop.

277
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,679
We have something more important.

278
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,960
When we camped outside the bookstore

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,159
around the store,

280
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,799
chief Chen came just in

281
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,080
chen Jiaping,

282
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,320
what did he do there?

283
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,480
I think he built an inkstone on it.

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,399
Inkstone?

285
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,840
We asked the people around the store

286
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,919
chief Chen was a regular customer of the store

287
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,279
he comes here often

288
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,480
no wonder when we were at the Bund,

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,759
I think he looks familiar.

290
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,679
He must have been in the vicinity of our firm.

291
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,840
Captain.

292
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,279
It seems that your suspicions are right.

293
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,120
Chen Jiaping

294
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,200
Is the hidden CCP.

295
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,600
This time, it's clinching.

296
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,799
If Chen Jiaping says

297
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,480
he went to the store

298
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,519
to buy some ink and paper.

299
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,840
Without knowing the real identity of Mr. Lu,

300
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,919
what to do?

301
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
Arrest him directly

302
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,320
force him to identify Chen Jia Ping

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,919
to deal with the Communists,

304
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,559
your idea won't work.

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,679
You need to be patient.

306
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,759
The shrimp is to catch small fish.

307
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
The small fish are fishing for the big fish.

308
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,919
I reflect on the mistakes I made before.

309
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,360
I was too impatient.

310
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,799
Shall we continue the surveillance?

311
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
Continue the surveillance?

312
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,600
We must be very careful

313
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,240
and be patient.

314
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,960
But your heart is firm.

315
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,240
Grind an iron pestle into a needle.

316
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,679
You're finally awake.

317
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,360
Why did you do this to me?

318
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,600
Ms. Han Lu.

319
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,240
Don't be angry.

320
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
You beast.

321
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,840
Why are you doing this to me?

322
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm serious.

323
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,519
I'm not false at all.

324
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,159
I can swear that

325
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
do you think that

326
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,640
just because you did this?

327
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,400
Ms. Han Lu.

328
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,759
I hope that today

329
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,799
will be the beginning

330
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,319
for our two lives.

331
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,920
Fresh start?

332
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,160
You insulted me.

333
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,799
But you told me that you were a freshman.

334
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,519
Miss Han Lu?

335
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,039
Look at this.

336
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,000
This is the gift I specially prepared for you.

337
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,960
A cinema built especially for you.

338
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,279
The premiere will be held

339
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,240
will have its premiere here

340
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,920
and the screening

341
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,839
will only run a loop

342
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,880
all the movies you starred in

343
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
because I know

344
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,079
you love movies.

345
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,759
Movies are your life.

346
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,079
They are all you have.

347
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,759
I don't expect

348
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,519
I don't expect to have your everything.

349
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,960
I only hope that

350
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,720
there is someone

351
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,079
help you achieve your dreams silently.

352
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,319
This

353
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,279
this is my love for you.

354
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,559
Guoguo.

355
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,359
Guoguo.

356
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,640
This one looks nice, too.

357
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,960
I like this color.

358
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,480
Get out of here.

359
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,000
Get out of here.

360
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
What's wrong?

361
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,880
Ms. Hong Ling.

362
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,359
It's been three days.

363
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,440
You have to pay

364
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,480
when will you pay the debts?

365
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,640
Give me two more days.

366
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,359
My pay will be paid soon.

367
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,359
Your salary?

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
How many hours can you dance for a day?

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,480
With all your salary,

370
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,319
after deducting the balance sheets,

371
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,680
how much do you have left?

372
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,319
I have a few clients

373
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,839
owe me several tips.

374
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,200
You're the one who has tips.

375
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,759
You won't even be able to serve us.

376
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,359
Please trust me.

377
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
I will definitely pay you back.

378
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,480
Give me a few more days.

379
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,079
I... I will definitely...

380
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,680
This...

381
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,119
I'll give you three more days.

382
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,640
If you don't pay me back,

383
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,079
I'll sell you to the firework room.

384
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,759
Is that clear?

385
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,160
Come on.

386
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Just three days.

387
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,200
Miss.

388
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,599
Are you a newcomer?

389
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,240
Can I

390
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,759
with you for a dance?

391
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,599
I only know the simplest.

392
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,599
Slow three.

393
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,000
It doesn't matter.

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,799
Let me teach you.

395
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,839
Isn't that Mr. Yao?

396
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,000
Long time no see.

397
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,079
You want to dance?

398
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,599
Let me dance with you, okay?

399
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,400
Come on.

400
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,039
Alright.

401
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
It's been a while.

402
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,119
Miss,

403
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,160
dancing here to make money.

404
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,359
What's up

405
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,240
you must be from the countryside.

406
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,839
You think this is a market, don't you?

407
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,960
You can set up a stall and do business.

408
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm from the countryside. So what?

409
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,240
You are bullying me.

410
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm going to set up a stall here.

411
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,839
Where are you from?

412
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,079
Don't you know the rules?

413
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,039
Get out!

414
00:23:59,039 --> 00:23:59,559
I won't leave.

415
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,400
Why should I get out?

416
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,680
Why do you still dare to answer?

417
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,960
Want to die?

418
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Are you alright?

419
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,839
Is she hurt?

420
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,039
He's dying.

421
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,039
What are you waiting for?

422
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,319
Drag this darn girl out of here.

423
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:08,920
Get out of here!

424
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,359
Don't touch me. I'll leave on my own.

425
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,000
What a shabby place! Bullying!

426
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,440
Sorry.

427
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,119
You got dirty.

428
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,519
You are the

429
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,880
how much?

430
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,960
I'll pay for it.

431
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,079
Make it up to me?

432
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,480
Can you compensate me?

433
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,119
I'm rich!

434
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,920
This cheongsam was made by Hong Fu's Memory

435
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,839
It's made of real silk

436
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,960
Is more than 50 yuan.

437
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,160
I can't even do it.

438
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,039
After you did this,

439
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,079
look at that.

440
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,920
Really rich.

441
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,160
60%.

442
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,839
Miss.

443
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,759
Why did you bring so much money with you?

444
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,200
In such a short time.

445
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920
There are more than

446
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,400
upstairs and downstairs,

447
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,920
there are people selling biscuit.

448
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,519
Or servants,

449
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,960
shaved heads, fortune tellers,

450
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,480
we can see all kinds of people.

451
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,000
I think there were also two pickpockets.

452
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
Then leave the money at home.

453
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,559
How dare you?

454
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,799
So I carried it with me.

455
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,279
Why do you want to be a dancing girl?

456
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,759
You know nothing about it.

457
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,119
I see that you don't look like

458
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,640
you don't look like you're from the countryside either.

459
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Where's your hometown?

460
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,720
My hometown is Yixing.

461
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,519
Why did you come to Shanghai?

462
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,319
My father passed away

463
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,400
my father passed away.

464
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,039
My mother passed away when I was 3.

465
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,839
I was left alone.

466
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,839
Ever since

467
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,920
when this Japanese came,

468
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,799
my family would lose its sauce business.

469
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
I had to sell my stuff

470
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,880
and said I wanted to stay with a distant cousin in Shanghai.

471
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
But she moved out already.

472
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,480
I've been looking for her for two months but didn't find her.

473
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,519
The rent.

474
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,279
Food and drink.

475
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,920
Doesn't come without money.

476
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,119
Yes

477
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,559
I have the money,

478
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,599
but I can't keep living this way.

479
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,640
In the movie,

480
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,759
It's said that being a dancer can make money.

481
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,880
So I came here to try, but I didn't expect

482
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,599
It's a rule here.

483
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,960
And "particular."

484
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,920
What do I know? I was

485
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,720
was pushed in the head.

486
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,279
Since I was a child,

487
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,359
since I was a child.

488
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,440
You can't be a dancing girl just you want.

489
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,319
How old is she?

490
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,240
She's 20.

491
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,599
Not a bad cop.

492
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,759
And a pretty face.

493
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,640
What dance can you do?

494
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,519
Slow Three.

495
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
What about more?

496
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,400
Nothing.

497
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm only three behind.

498
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Waltz.

499
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,920
Bruce.

500
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,920
Foxtrot.

501
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,960
And Tango.

502
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,000
Exactly, exactly.

503
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,680
They can't do both.

504
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
There's nothing going on then.

505
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,599
Don't, Sis.

506
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,160
You are a good person.

507
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,440
You wanna teach me?

508
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,079
Teach you?

509
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,279
I need to charge for tuition.

510
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,279
No problem. Rich people.

511
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,559
How much tuition will you charge?

512
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,359
Do you really want to learn it?

513
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,960
Just like going to work.

514
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,240
Two yuan for an hour.

515
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,640
Two yuan?

516
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,759
Alright.

517
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,599
It's not expensive.

518
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,119
Where do you want to learn it?

519
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,160
Go to my home.

520
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
But the place is a little small.

521
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,279
It's less than five square meters.

522
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,039
There's a bed and a table.

523
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,480
How do you dance then?

524
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,039
We don't have enough space to play Mah-jong.

525
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,839
What can we do

526
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,880
how about this?

527
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,039
Come to my house.

528
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,359
However,

529
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
according to the street bell.

530
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,519
It costs five yuan for a bell.

531
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,960
Doubled the price.

532
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,440
To be clear,

533
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,039
I used to be

534
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,599
I was at Paramount.

535
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,920
Waiting in line

536
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,279
waiting on the other side of the road.

537
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,759
To cheer for us.

538
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,119
Think about it.

539
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,680
The money you spend now

540
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,200
when you master it, you can play the first part too.

541
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
We'll get royalties from dancing tickets.

542
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
We'll get a cut for every hour.

543
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,759
The tip of the guest

544
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,400
tips from customers.

545
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,640
To stuff it in your bag.

546
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,519
That's great!

547
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,559
Sister,

548
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,319
I want to learn today.

549
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Xiaotao.

550
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,000
You know what?

551
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,640
I used to live in a tenant's apartment.

552
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Back then,

553
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,240
I could earn more than 200 yuan every month.

554
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,839
Hongling,

555
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,400
do you live alone?

556
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,559
I made such a fuss this morning.

557
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,960
I forgot to turn off the lights.

558
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,559
Let's learn here later

559
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,359
only when there's music.

560
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,279
The gramaphone

561
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,839
a lot, right?

562
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,039
Not at all.

563
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,440
What dance do you want to learn first?

564
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,839
San has got it.

565
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,720
Let's do it quickly.

566
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,079
Alright.

567
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,519
There're three steps.

568
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,319
As the name suggests, each bar has three beats.

569
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,319
The beats are weak and weak.

570
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,720
But three in Fast Three

571
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,039
three behind you.

572
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,279
This is the classic Viennese Waltz

573
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,119
the classic triple dance.

574
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,200
I'll do the male step later.

575
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,359
Follow me.

576
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,440
Come on.

577
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,880
Dance three faster.

578
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,119
Will be much closer to each other.

579
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,319
Action.

580
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,799
One, two, three.

581
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,400
Two, two, three.

582
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,119
One, two, three.

583
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,799
Two, two, three.

584
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,480
What about fast three?

585
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,079
She's spinning fast for most of the time.

586
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,240
One, two, three.

587
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,599
Are you all right?

588
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,920
Miss,

589
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,400
maybe I was too stupid.

590
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,319
Too fast. I mess up.

591
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,480
Keep the rhythm. Don't mess up.

592
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,480
Go on.

593
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,160
Come on.

594
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,599
One, two, three.

595
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,079
Two, two, three.

596
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,440
This dance...

597
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,920
Is to let your partner control your rotation.

598
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,279
So fast three

599
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,759
and the best dance for a man.

600
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,599
I was in a coma.

601
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,039
I'm really in a coma.

602
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,799
I might have to take some time.

603
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:03,920
Take a rest then.

604
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,039
We can practice later.

605
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,359
Today's tuition...

606
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,000
Going ahead is more tiring than going slow.

607
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,359
Tomorrow or at this time,

608
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,599
I am relatively stupid.

609
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,799
Miss Hong Ling, put more effort into it.

610
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,799
Don't worry. I can't teach you.

611
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,279
And you have a good condition.

612
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Within three months,

613
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,880
I'll be the hottest dancer on the beach.

614
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,200
By that time,

615
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,599
I won't forget you.

616
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,920
Got to go.

617
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,799
See you off?

618
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,359
Slow down.

619
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,359
Who's that woman?

620
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,400
You heard it.

621
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,960
To learn dancing from me.

622
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,400
I told you not to

623
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,720
not to bring anyone home?

624
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,279
I buy medicines and food for you every day.

625
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,440
That's free.

626
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,400
Besides, I have to pay the rent next month.

627
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,359
I don't even know where to get the money.

628
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,759
If you want to be a dancing girl,

629
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,119
Instead of gambling on Pai Gow.

630
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
How could this happen?

631
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,319
Don't blame me for that.

632
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,839
Don't look down on that girl.

633
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,279
There are so many money.

634
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
After I close this deal,

635
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,759
we won't have to worry about food and drink.

636
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,279
You still care about the money.

637
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,480
You talked for so long

638
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,240
you didn't talk about the business.

639
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,400
Of whom they would talk to.

640
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,359
How can I expect you?

641
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,400
I told you to throw the things in the trash can.

642
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Did you throw it away?

643
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,640
Today is exhausting.

644
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,200
We can throw it tomorrow.

645
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,359
What if that woman sees us?

646
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,880
So what if she sees us?

647
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,319
Idiot.

648
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,079
You wouldn't listen to me.

649
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,839
What if she isn't here to learn dancing?

650
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,319
Do you know that the Communist Party of China

651
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,680
are after me?

652
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,000
How could she be

653
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,079
let me ask you this.

654
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Will she come tomorrow?

655
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,920
You promised.

656
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,759
He will come.

657
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,240
Tomorrow night

658
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,359
take her out.

659
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,640
Are you out of your mind?

660
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,240
I can't kill someone.

661
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,079
Do you still want to go with me?

662
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,480
But I can't kill anyone.

663
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,279
Take this.

664
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,119
Tomorrow night

665
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,119
just tell her

666
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,960
you want to have some midnight snacks

667
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,000
then find a quiet way

668
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,440
while she's not paying attention,

669
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,759
I'll shoot her in the back.

670
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,440
The gunshot will be heard

671
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,359
the gunshot would be heard as well.

672
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,000
Then

673
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,400
to take the road from the old factory area

674
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,599
no one's there.

675
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,119
We'll attack on the way here.

676
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Don't you know

677
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,119
how valuable

678
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,039
Is in the market.

679
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,880
So we have to be

680
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,800
we must be very careful.

681
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,960
Without the slightest mistake.

682
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,199
Where did you go while you dressed like this?

683
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,519
Where were you?

684
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,880
You came back so late with your dress on.

685
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,119
With such a good smell.

686
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:18,960
What?

687
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,280
You were allowed to stay out all night?

688
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,599
You haven't answered my question?

689
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:26,880
Alright.

690
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,039
I will answer truthfully.

691
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Firstly,

692
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,079
dance in the ballroom.

693
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,199
To have fun.

694
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,320
I forgot about time. That's why I came back late.

695
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,400
Two...

696
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,840
Wearing this

697
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,159
she must want someone

698
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,679
she wants me to dance with him.

699
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,039
What's number three again?

700
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,800
Why does it smell so good?

701
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,079
Does it smell good?

702
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,199
From France.

703
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,519
It smells good.

704
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,719
But in the ballroom,

705
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,000
you

706
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,480
to go there for you?

707
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,840
How can I not go?

708
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,239
Do you think my face is not good enough?

709
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,599
Or my figure?

710
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,400
But not your identity.

711
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,960
You're my wife.

712
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,199
A married woman.

713
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,719
Young woman.

714
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
If you want to go next time, tell me.

715
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,840
I'll go with you.

716
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,559
I suddenly thought of something.

717
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,199
Some people here

718
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,280
they still

719
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,559
you haven't been trimmed yet.

720
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,320
Isn't that you?

721
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,079
You even accompanied me to the ballroom

722
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,760
I heard that you stayed up all night

723
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,280
for the night.

724
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,440
Don't be mad.

725
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,280
Right?

726
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,559
I'm just concerned as a friend.

727
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,559
Then tell me.

728
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Who did you go with?

729
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,280
Was it a guy or a girl?

730
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,559
Have a guess.

731
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,519
Look at this.

732
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,320
Look. You are clearly angry.

733
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,679
You must be taking revenge on me

734
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,639
cold Dew, right?

735
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,320
I don't care about it at all.

736
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,440
I just think that

737
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,079
even if they are a couple,

738
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
they shall enjoy absolute freedom

739
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,559
even if they get married.

740
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,440
In the same way.

741
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,599
Right?

742
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,679
Yes

743
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
hold on.

744
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,760
I didn't ask you yet.

745
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,880
The door was also changed.

746
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,599
From now on,

747
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,920
I sleep on the bed, you on the sofa.

748
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,679
Why?

749
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
I will sleep on the sofa.

750
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,480
Please don't.

751
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,360
Stop.

752
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,440
You... Sleep on the bed.

753
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,519
I will sleep on the sofa.

754
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,719
I'll sleep on the sofa.

755
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,880
Which key is this?

756
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:50,880
This one?

757
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,519
Shanghai has so much nightlife.

758
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,360
I used to live in vain.

759
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,480
Which dress

760
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,199
which cheongsam I'm going to wear tomorrow?

761
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,760
Are you still going there tomorrow?

762
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,719
Guoguo, you're taking revenge on me.

763
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
You're trying to make me angry on purpose, right?

764
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,599
Then don't blame me, to be honest,

765
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,199
look at your cheongsam!

766
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,519
In Shanghai, it's already out

767
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,639
If you dress like this to the ballroom,

768
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,480
people will think

769
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,239
you're just a countryside girl who sells flowers.

770
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,559
There's more.

771
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,039
Let me tell you how to apply perfume.

772
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,760
Just a drop.

773
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,599
That's the lady.

774
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,679
Two drops is sexy.

775
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,400
If you just pour one on you,

776
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,639
people will think that you sell toilet water.

777
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,199
And most importantly,

778
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,960
In Shanghai's ballroom

779
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,159
eleven is the golden field

780
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,960
where are the beautiful women?

781
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,840
After the gold field,

782
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,639
after the gold field.

783
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,760
To come back at this time

784
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,119
he must have been invited by no one.

785
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,039
Such a poor thing!

786
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,400
Chen Jiaping.

787
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,440
I'm telling you, I was angry.

788
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,719
Angry? What's wrong...

789
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
For staying with Han Lu for a night.

790
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
Naughty!

791
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,159
Shameless!

792
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,159
All right, this mess

793
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,559
he can keep his distance

794
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,719
keep their distance.

795
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,320
I hope she's not really mad at me.

796
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,880
Also,

797
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,159
don't go through my things.

798
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
What's that

799
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,119
under the bed.

800
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,079
Those are the dangerous thoughts

801
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,079
the peace government should guard against.

802
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,119
You mustn't look at them.

803
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,519
I don't want to read it.

804
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm sleeping now.

805
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,920
To eavesdrop?

806
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,760
You think I can't see it?

807
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,400
Goodnight.

808
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,360
Alright.

809
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,960
After this incident,

810
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,719
that I'll be fine when I go for a mission

811
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,039
and everything will be fine.

812
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:36,719
Is it peace talk or betrayal?

813
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,320
Hey.

814
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,519
Yumo Calligraphy and Painting Shop.

815
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,400
Alright.

816
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,760
Those old friends

817
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,519
to come?

818
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,480
Second best

819
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,840
chief Chen

820
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,440
what are you pulling?

821
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,760
Hay.

822
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,960
Why is there a person lying in the hay?

823
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,199
Yesterday,

824
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,239
captain Zhao and his men caught a CCP member.

825
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:50,719
He's dead.

826
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,400
And asked me to throw it away.

827
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,280
My goodness.

828
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:05,039
Two swords.
