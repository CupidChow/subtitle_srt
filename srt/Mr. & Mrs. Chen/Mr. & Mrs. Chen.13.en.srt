1
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,520
What are you doing?

2
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm thinking.

3
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Think.

4
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,159
And why fried dough sticks with soy milk.

5
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
You can add an egg.

6
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,039
I'll wash my face.

7
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,520
What's up

8
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,719
nothing.

9
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,240
The egg dropped.

10
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,720
Brother.

11
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,800
We've investigated everything we could.

12
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,399
But we didn't find anything in the end.

13
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,399
Only means that we're out of luck.

14
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,839
Don't be too critical.

15
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,120
The self who worked so hard

16
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
scram!

17
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,759
Captain.

18
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,839
Let me check it out again

19
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,839
that's nothing.

20
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,079
A warning from Eunuch Tanaka.

21
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,720
Take one step closer to the Cold Dew

22
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,759
to break our legs.

23
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,439
I can't figure it out.

24
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
That day,

25
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
It was Fuxu Road.

26
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,959
Could it be that Cold Dew found you

27
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,279
and wrote a false address to confuse us.

28
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
He found me

29
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,399
I remembered that

30
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,519
that day, I hid under my bed

31
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,399
I dropped the notepad on the floor.

32
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,959
Do you have it?

33
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,319
They should be.

34
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,360
What do you mean "should"?

35
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,800
Stay out of this.

37
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Stay out of it.

38
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,800
Chief Eunuch Tanaka told me

39
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
you'll be suspended.

40
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
From this moment,

41
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,839
you don't have to work anymore.

42
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,000
Suspended?

43
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,560
Why have you suspended me?

44
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,959
Captain.

45
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,920
I just followed your orders.

46
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,519
You can't suspend me.

47
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,360
Why?

48
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,839
Are you really outstanding?

49
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,439
I...

50
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Bring me the notebook.

51
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,319
Brother Qi.

52
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,720
I'll take the blame.

53
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,279
You'll get used to it.

54
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,839
Brother. Brother.

55
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,879
Mister.

56
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,879
This outfit suits you so well.

57
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,120
I'll take it.

58
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,399
All right, sir.

59
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Sir, this is our new lipstick.

60
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
You can have a look.

61
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,120
Are these all lipsticks?

62
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,399
Which one is the most expensive?

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,639
This is the most expensive one.

64
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,000
Please have a look.

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,560
Alright.

66
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,279
Before the peace talks between China and Japan,

67
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,960
as the representative of Chongqing,

68
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,039
please communicate with Imamura Nobuto

69
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,799
with these two gentlemen first.

70
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,120
To express our sincerity

71
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,679
and

72
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,159
to declare our principles and stance.

73
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,159
No. 72 Yaerpei Road.

74
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Brother, you're awesome!

75
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,480
According to our intelligence,

76
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,840
japan, Germany and Italy are secretly negotiating.

77
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,879
They might sign relevant treaties.

78
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,759
The core of the treaty

79
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,080
was based on the new division

80
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,840
the three kingdoms of Japan, Germany and Italy.

81
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
The worldwide power of the empires.

82
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,159
Given the circumstances,

83
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,960
I believe Japan would also like to

84
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
from its war in China.

85
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,879
According to our intelligence,

86
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,639
japan, Germany and Italy are secretly negotiating,

87
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,200
they might sign a treaty.

88
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,120
The core of the treaty

89
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,919
under the leadership of Japan, Germany and Italy,

90
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,240
the three kingdoms of Japan, Germany and Italy.

91
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,440
The worldwide powers of the empires.

92
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,120
The Japanese side will hold a meeting recently

93
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,399
the main topic will be

94
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,080
can claim to respect China's territorial sovereignty,

95
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
but they must ask China

96
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,240
to sign a military agreement to defend the Communists

97
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
and stationed troops on Chinese soil.

98
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
The Japanese side will hold a meeting soon.

99
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
The main topic of the meeting is

100
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
respecting China's territorial sovereignty.

101
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,159
But we must ask China

102
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,200
to sign a military agreement to defend Communist Party of China

103
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,399
and station troops on Chinese soil.

104
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,159
To sign a military agreement to defend the Communists and station troops in Chinese soil.

105
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,159
Chairman Jiang has given the order.

106
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,639
To conditionally agree to the request

107
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,000
to sign a military agreement to defend the Communists and station the troops.

108
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
Chairman Jiang has given the order.

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
To conditionally agree to it.

110
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,919
And most importantly,

111
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,000
chinese government

112
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
must promise Manchukuo independence.

113
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,159
The most important thing is

114
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,159
the Chinese government must recognize the independence of Manchukuo.

115
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,320
Zhang Jr.

116
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,000
Change the tea for our guest.

117
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,600
I told you to change tea.

118
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,559
Don't just stand there.

119
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Also,

120
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,759
the Chongqing government must agree

121
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,600
to cooperate with the Nanjing Peace Government

122
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,679
to reorganize the Chinese government.

123
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Also,

124
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,559
the Chongqing government must agree

125
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,480
to cooperate with the Nanjing Peace Government

126
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,639
to restructure the Chinese government.

127
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,000
Where are the tea leaves?

128
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,639
I will answer the question

129
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,279
chairman,

130
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,000
have other ideas

131
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,720
you wanted me to convey to you.

132
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,600
I don't think

133
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,240
the chairman has a different opinion

134
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,600
he wants me to convey to you.

135
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,039
As for the armistice,

136
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,360
can it upset

137
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,000
upset the British and American sides?

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
You think

139
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,519
no need to worry.

140
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,320
As for the armistice,

141
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
can it upset

142
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,559
upset Britain and the US?

143
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,159
If you think

144
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,480
no need to worry.

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,679
To show their sincerity in fighting for peace,

146
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,799
the Chinese government has made a major concession.

147
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,799
Other than forming a coalition

148
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,799
forming the government with Wang Jingwei's government,

149
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,039
other matters

150
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,759
are within our considerations.

151
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,279
Please inform Prime Minister

152
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,120
to report to the Prime Minister

153
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,000
to show his sincerity in fighting for peace,

154
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,480
the Chinese government has already made major concessions.

155
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,679
Other than forming

156
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,679
form a government with Wang Jingwei's government,

157
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,480
other aspects

158
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,799
are within our scope of consideration.

159
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,399
Please inform His Excellency

160
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,240
to the Prime Minister.

161
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,600
I will.

162
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,879
Zhao An.

163
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,919
Not good.

164
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,879
Chen Che.

165
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,960
Take several people to surround the villa.

166
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,679
No one shall leave the villa.

167
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,000
Understood.

168
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,559
Go there.

169
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,720
You, follow me that way.

170
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,480
You two go that way.

171
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,240
Come on.

172
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,840
Second best.

173
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,840
Go in.

174
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,559
Alright.

175
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,519
Come on.

176
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Come on.

177
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,159
Come on.

178
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,879
Alright.

179
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,279
The vehicles of the action team

180
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,960
beat him!

181
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,319
It's broken. Something happened!

182
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,400
Withdraw!

183
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,920
Director Jiang, our identity is exposed.

184
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,359
Duan, Du Chun.

185
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,759
You escort the two delegates to retreat first.

186
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,279
Got it.

187
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,640
You two stand guard over there.

188
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Got it.

189
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,559
Drive the car.

190
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,519
Why are they still here?

191
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,440
We have to wait for Director Jiang.

192
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,640
Director Jiang?

193
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,799
What's up

194
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,440
go upstairs.

195
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,680
Come on.

196
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:46,880
What should we do now?

197
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,640
I think their people are already inside.

198
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,640
We can't hide here for long.

199
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,079
They will be found soon.

200
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,599
I'd rather risk my life

201
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,720
than to wait for it.

202
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,119
Let's save Director Jiang.

203
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,759
Alright.

204
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,240
Come on.

205
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,440
Wait!

206
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,400
What should we do?

207
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,039
These useless people!

208
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,640
Second best.

209
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,279
Are you all right?

210
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:10,839
Brother.

211
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:11,400
Brother.

212
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,680
Come on.

213
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:12,799
Come on.

214
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,200
Come on.

215
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,799
Come on.

216
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,200
It's dangerous here.

217
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Please leave here as soon as possible.

218
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:35,640
Stop!

219
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,240
Don't move!

220
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,119
You all

221
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:41,880
go in and support.

222
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,319
Come on.

223
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,039
Hurry!

224
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,880
Director Jiang,

225
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,400
that's great.

226
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,279
Negotiation with grenades.

227
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,119
You didn't expect that, right?

228
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,559
The boy who didn't kill you just now

229
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,680
you're lucky that

230
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
don't forget that

231
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm negotiating with the Japanese.

232
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,160
Aren't you afraid that

233
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,359
disobeyed your master by doing that?

234
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,079
Don't think I can't figure out

235
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,160
your so-called smooth negotiators,

236
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,160
where are the two Japanese negotiators?

237
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,960
I know you won't tell.

238
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
It doesn't matter.

239
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,000
We'll find them.

240
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
Second best.

241
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,359
Bring the car here.

242
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,880
Bring Director Jiang back first.

243
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:35,880
Alright.

244
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,160
Captain.

245
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,240
I saw one of our cars

246
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,720
got blown up.

247
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,759
Isn't there another one?

248
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,680
Brother.

249
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,039
Are there any nuns in our business?

250
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,480
What's in her hand?

251
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,160
Bro, what is she throwing?

252
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
Get in the car.

253
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,759
Why do you have so many bombs?

254
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,240
We'll bring them next time.

255
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,200
Brother.

256
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,440
It is all boiled ducks.

257
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,759
It just flies away.

258
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,680
The two Japanese negotiators

259
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,359
should be there.

260
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,480
Was it an illusion?

261
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,400
What I saw.

262
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,039
It seemed to be the two Japanese negotiators.

263
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,559
They...

264
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
They seem to have escaped.

265
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,799
Then we...

266
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,599
She's dying.

267
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,680
The villa.

268
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,119
Search every room,

269
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,839
search every corner carefully

270
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,119
and see if there is any evidence left behind.

271
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,359
Don't be discouraged.

272
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,319
The grenade fell beside my foot just now,

273
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,720
I was shocked.

274
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,960
Luckily you pushed me,

275
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,559
I'd be killed if I hadn't.

276
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,039
"A friend in adversity is a friend indeed"

277
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,160
A friend in need is a friend indeed

278
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,319
only you are my brother.

279
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,799
I won't be in trouble.

280
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,559
You are blocking my escape.

281
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,920
Who else would I push?

282
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,319
Cut the crap.

283
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,319
Who are you?

284
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,240
I'm the one who's here to save you.

285
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,799
You're one of us.

286
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,599
Yes

287
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,960
then can you do me another favor?

288
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
Don't move.

289
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,400
Come out!

290
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,279
Captain, they caught one alive.

291
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,640
Don't, don't fire.

292
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,839
Let me out.

293
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,039
Don't shoot.

294
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,960
Stand up!

295
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,000
Stand up.

296
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,480
Don't shoot.

297
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,440
Put your hands up.

298
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,720
Don't shoot.

299
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,839
Chen Jiaping.

300
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Captain Zhao.

301
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,640
You scared me.

302
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,960
I thought he was a Chinese communist.

303
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,640
Did they catch him?

304
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
What are you doing here?

305
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,880
So, why are you here?

306
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,559
We are on a mission.

307
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,119
I'm on a mission too.

308
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,759
What mission are you on?

309
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,920
What mission are you on?

310
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,799
Our mission is confidential.

311
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,680
My mission is confidential too.

312
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,359
Did you catch the suspect?

313
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,400
Of course,

314
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,920
I will...

315
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
And ran away?

316
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,279
No offense, Captain Zhao.

317
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,240
There are so many in the team,

318
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,359
but a few of them got away.

319
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,519
They have escaped.

320
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
You can't get away.

321
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,319
Why are you here?

322
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,359
That you're here to tip us off?

323
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,400
It was your friends

324
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,799
It's your accomplice.

325
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,440
Who are you?

326
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,559
Be investigated with me after you return.

327
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,599
Hey, Captain Zhao,

328
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,319
If you put it that way,

329
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,279
you wronged me.

330
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,759
Besides, why did you investigate me?

331
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,279
Search him.

332
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,519
How dare you?

333
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,839
How can you search me?

334
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,240
That's the reason?

335
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,799
We got nothing in the operation,

336
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,119
three of my brothers are dead.

337
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,079
A car was blown up,

338
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,799
one car was robbed.

339
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,440
All the accounts

340
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,839
on you.

341
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,839
No, Captain Zhao.

342
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,079
You're blaming me for all that.

343
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,559
You're scared?

344
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,079
She failed to catch him.

345
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,000
And caused a lot of trouble

346
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,480
I'll send a call to the Military Police Headquarters

347
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,599
to the Military Police Headquarters

348
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,039
he'll protest fiercely.

349
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,640
If Chief Kimura protects you,

350
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,240
aren't you the scapegoat?

351
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
Repeat that.

352
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,200
What are you doing?

353
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Are you bullying me?

354
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,079
Say it one more time.

355
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,680
I won't say anything nice.

356
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,559
I'm telling the truth!

357
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,119
Chen Jiaping,

358
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,839
you said that Mr. Luo is here

359
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,160
will you be questioned?

360
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,160
You're here

361
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,759
tell us then

362
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
why did you show up

363
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,599
at 72 Yaerpei Road?

364
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,440
Mr. Luo asked me to investigate the whereabouts of the representatives of the two parties.

365
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,160
I followed the clue to the lead.

366
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
Manager Luo,

367
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,920
this is the mission that Kimura gave me.

368
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,680
Why did you get involved?

369
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,119
Chief Eunuch Tanaka asked me to participate in the investigation.

370
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,680
Is that a problem?

371
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,200
Also,

372
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,599
If you can do a good job,

373
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
do you need my intervention?

374
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,240
Even if Chen Jia Ping was carrying out a mission,

375
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,319
they still have doubts.

376
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,359
Before we took any action,

377
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,920
someone blew up the car we're parked on the road.

378
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
Send news secretly

379
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,240
why should I believe

380
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,039
this has nothing to do with you?

381
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,640
No, Captain Zhao.

382
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,359
When did your car explode?

383
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,319
When they surrounded the villa.

384
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,119
You've surrounded the villa

385
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,200
you're incapable

386
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,759
or am I too awesome?

387
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,640
The villa is surrounded.

388
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,599
So I can blow up the car

389
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,799
and then went back to the villa.

390
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,359
When did you go in?

391
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,079
I went in long ago.

392
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,519
How did you get in?

393
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,759
The roof.

394
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Then why did you lie under the bed?

395
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,599
I went upstairs to find the important documents.

396
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,359
I opened the safe,

397
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,240
and found nothing.

398
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,079
But at that moment,

399
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,039
there were explosions and gunshots outside.

400
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:40,920
I'm scared.

401
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,160
I won't hide.

402
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,599
I didn't know you were the one who brought the people here.

403
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,559
Or I wouldn't have gone under the bed.

404
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,319
Where did you get that shirt?

405
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,119
I bought it.

406
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,960
Yonglong Department Store?

407
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
Have you seen the invoice?

408
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,559
You dress exactly like the Chongqing rep.

409
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,519
Right?

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,799
Right.

411
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,480
What a coincidence.

412
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,440
More importantly,

413
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,200
how did you know the negotiation location?

414
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
At 72 Yaerpei Road.

415
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,559
I investigated that.

416
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,640
What did you check?

417
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,279
Why should I tell you?

418
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,200
If you don't tell me,

419
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,680
It proves you're guilty.

420
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Maybe you already knew the location.

421
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,400
Your superior told you about it.

422
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,359
Jia Ping.

423
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,240
At such a time,

424
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,559
Is there anything you can't say?

425
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:22,519
Old Luo.

426
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,119
Everyone has

427
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,400
have their own ways and methods.

428
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,160
When I tell them

429
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
they'll learn

430
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,480
alright.

431
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,440
I will teach you rice cooker

432
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
how you investigate the case.

433
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,599
Manager Luo asked me

434
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
asked me to investigate two Japanese.

435
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,680
This is a big Shanghai

436
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,440
and there're so many Japanese.

437
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,799
Where can I find that?

438
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,279
But by coincidence,

439
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,519
when I read the paper,

440
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,440
I found that two days ago,

441
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,799
the Japanese

442
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,960
a festival of them.

443
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
A festival to eat Lu Ao's apple.

444
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,880
I thought it would be

445
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,279
I'll have my men monitor a few Japanese fruit shops.

446
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,039
Will be fine.

447
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,359
It sounds

448
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,640
they did go there once.

449
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,480
That's it.

450
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,480
What shop?

451
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Yusong Fruit Shop.

452
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,519
Yusong fruit shop?

453
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,400
In the villa hall,

454
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,640
we found

455
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,359
a paper bag from Yusong Fruit Store.

456
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,319
Look at this.

457
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,960
Is it packaged?

458
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,400
Was it that easy?

459
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,440
That was so easy?

460
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,400
You know what? Captain Zhao,

461
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,160
If it weren't for you,

462
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,039
your three little jerks

463
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,160
two representatives can't run away.

464
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,160
You don't have to

465
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,200
to them.

466
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,160
Even if you didn't blow up the car,

467
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,599
you could have done something without permission

468
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,400
your private actions

469
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,559
that's why our operation failed.

470
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,039
I've explained everything.

471
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,759
Old Luo.

472
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,000
It won't stop!

473
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,680
Did you act on your own?

474
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,440
You didn't inform me.

475
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,759
Old Luo.

476
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,440
All right.

477
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,880
We both did it for work.

478
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,160
This is a misunderstanding.

479
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,200
Right?

480
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,680
It's okay that the operation didn't succeed.

481
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,039
We should all review ourselves.

482
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,759
Instead of pointing fingers.

483
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,640
Alright.

484
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,480
Reflect upon yourself.

485
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,119
You are right.

486
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,079
You misunderstood me.

487
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,759
Should we let Chen Jia Ping go?

488
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,039
Manager Luo is the final say.

489
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,039
I'm not going to waste time here.

490
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,839
You're the best!

491
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,160
I asked you to investigate the secret settlement secretly,

492
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,440
you told me everything.

493
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,279
You just sold me to others.

494
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,960
If I sell you,

495
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,240
you're not good enough.

496
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,599
No, I'm not.

497
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,559
I was caught.

498
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,119
You didn't even ask me.

499
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,920
Am I not here?

500
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,200
You would come if I didn't bother you.

501
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,720
I find you very interesting.

502
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,160
It's such an important operation.

503
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,680
You went there yourself without telling me.

504
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,920
You invite all these people to be suspicious of you.

505
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,119
You deserve it, right?

506
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,359
Yeah, I deserve it.

507
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,480
I had an important clue to tell you.

508
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,920
Not a chance.

509
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,680
What information?

510
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,359
I don't want to say it.

511
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,359
That doesn't work either.

512
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,920
Where did you find this?

513
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,440
On the lawn outside the villa.

514
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,799
This man

515
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,519
he has captured something important.

516
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Like documents.

517
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,400
He then found himself surrounded.

518
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,759
He had nowhere to run.

519
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,480
It's hard to hide the camera.

520
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,400
It's hard to hide the film.

521
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,200
Hence, he

522
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,480
the film

523
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,000
and threw the camera.

524
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,359
Then the only one who was

525
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,640
In that room back then

526
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,920
could the camera be Chen Jiaping?

527
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,160
Who else could it be

528
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,839
who else can it be?

529
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,720
Then I don't understand

530
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,839
If Chen Jiaping was just a tip,

531
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,759
then he might be from the military.

532
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,079
But why would he

533
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,799
photocopy their own documents?

534
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,680
So he is not from Juntong.

535
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,799
He's the one we've been looking for.

536
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,119
Four of clubs.

537
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:09,599
Brother!

538
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
You're awesome.

539
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,679
If Chen Jiaping gets four of clubs,

540
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
then Luo Guanqun...

541
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,840
With their relationship,

542
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,960
he pulled his ears and moved his cheeks.

543
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:20,800
This time, Luo Guanqun

544
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,400
the disaster!

545
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,119
If Luo Guanqun's disaster occurs,

546
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,079
mrs. Luo will become

547
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,519
mrs. Luo will become our sister-in-law

548
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,159
can you keep a low profile?

549
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,360
By the way,

550
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,960
where are the items found on Chen Jiaping?

551
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,199
Yes, I will get them now.

552
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,719
Brother.

553
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,840
It's not that serious.

554
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,719
I said it's not okay.

555
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,679
I want to know...

556
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,599
What information?

557
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,199
Did Zhao An tell you that

558
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,159
the Japanese representative and Jiang Zhao ran away?

559
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,119
We missed one.

560
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,760
Zhao An was lying.

561
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,840
The Japanese representative and Jiang Zhaoguo ran away.

562
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,719
Jiang Zhaoguo's man was arrested?

563
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,199
How did you know that?

564
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,079
I saw them.

565
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,559
Zhao An's men took the two men away.

566
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,679
When we caught him,

567
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,880
he wouldn't bring me back.

568
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,239
Don't be angry, calm down.

569
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,159
Zhao An is really smart.

570
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,360
Is a secret mission.

571
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,519
If he returns the truth to Mumun,

572
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,760
he won't be rewarded.

573
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:35,960
His name

574
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,800
even Kimura wouldn't report his name.

575
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,280
Therefore, he must hide her

576
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,199
as something to gain his merit,

577
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,360
your analysis is right.

578
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,519
But what good is the information?

579
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:51,559
No, Luo.

580
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,039
Have you been confusing

581
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,760
there are so many pictures.

582
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,159
It will be our power to find her

583
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,280
the weight will be ours, right?

584
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,599
Right?

585
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,119
Do you know where Zhao An hid her?

586
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,440
How would I know?

587
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,360
You have to figure out a way

588
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,079
think about it.

589
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,280
Is there anyone here

590
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,360
close to Zhao An?

591
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,480
To know where he hid people.

592
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,639
Right?

593
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,039
This is for you.

594
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,280
I need to pick up my wife.

595
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,679
I can have a good weekend.

596
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,360
It ended up like this.

597
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,559
Think about it.

598
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,440
We found these on him.

599
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,079
That's all. We have searched every place

600
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,440
where do you think the film would be hidden?

601
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,400
Only the size of

602
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,280
Is about the size of your little finger nail.

603
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,760
Could it be hidden in the lipstick?

604
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,400
Brother,

605
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,320
If he wants to put the lipstick

606
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,480
to the lipstick,

607
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,280
to expose the film?

608
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,599
We won't have any evidence again.

609
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
Draw the curtain!

610
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,599
Hurry!

611
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,079
Where's the film?

612
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,239
Make way, please.

613
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,039
What's going on?

614
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,840
There's a shooting.

615
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,119
A shooting?

616
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,119
Where are the people inside?

617
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,280
No one is there.

618
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,360
Just a few bodies.

619
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:22,960
Let me in.

620
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:23,920
Please let me in.

621
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,760
You are not allowed to enter this place.

622
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,199
You're not allowed to enter this place.

623
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,599
Leave her to me.

624
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,679
I know her.

625
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,199
Keep her safe then.

626
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,920
A man surnamed Jiang asked me to tell you

627
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,840
he's meeting you at the Hollywood bar.

628
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:39,559
Alright.

629
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,000
Thank you.

630
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,119
Mr. Jiang, right?

631
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,079
A friend of mine wants to see you.

632
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,079
Sorry.

633
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:10,840
In this video.

634
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
I think you'll be interested.

635
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,639
Mr. Jiang.

636
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,320
I've heard a lot about you.

637
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:33,719
Have a seat.

638
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,760
Who are you?

639
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,199
I'm willing to

640
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,559
the warrior under the mountain

641
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:53,719
that's right.

642
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,440
I'm Japanese.

643
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,559
You

644
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,840
how do you know that I am here?

645
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,599
Not only did I know that you would come here,

646
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,079
I also know

647
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,840
ms. Han Lu will be here soon.

648
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,159
What do you mean?

649
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,800
Our people

650
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,000
Is following Ms. Han Lu.

651
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,920
What do you want?

652
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,719
Rest assured, Mr. Jiang.

653
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,360
We are just trying to

654
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:25,199
to delay Ms. Han Lu's coming here.

655
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,920
I won't hurt her.

656
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,239
You can see her later.

657
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,920
Have a seat.

658
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,360
We can take this chance

659
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,760
let's

660
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:50,840
and talk about it.

661
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,239
What do you want to talk about?

662
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,639
Thank you.

663
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,320
Cold Dew.

664
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,880
All right.

665
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,000
Stop crying.

666
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,480
Look. Am I not all right?

667
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,679
You are injured.

668
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,880
You're bleeding so much.

669
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,320
And he said he was fine.

670
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,159
Just a slight wound. It's okay.

671
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,920
Come on.

672
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:46,519
Have a seat.

673
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,199
I went to Yaerpei Road.

674
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,440
There were burned cars

675
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,000
many police were crossing the road

676
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,000
one of the policemen told me

677
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,079
there were bodies there

678
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,920
nothing.

679
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,079
There was a little mistake.

680
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,719
My people saved me.

681
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,039
When I called you,

682
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,639
why didn't you pick up?

683
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:19,079
The other day when you called me

684
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,239
there was a spy hiding in my house.

685
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,719
I was kidnapped.

686
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,559
What?

687
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,360
Did he...

688
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,000
Did they do anything to you?

689
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:29,480
They wanted to get the address you gave me.

690
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,320
But I didn't say anything.

691
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,320
Then why did they

692
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,079
how come they let you go?

693
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,760
I met a Japanese army officer

694
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,039
I knew a Japanese officer.

695
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,320
His name is Yamashita Martial Arts.
