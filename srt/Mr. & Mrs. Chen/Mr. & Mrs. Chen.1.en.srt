1
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
You dare to ask for money for the imperial army's meal?

2
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,519
No, I won't.

3
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,040
It's a good lesson.

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,959
Stop fighting!

5
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,360
This is our goal today.

6
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,039
Don't.

7
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,360
Our target is Martial Arts Master Yamashita.

8
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,800
The Special Agent from the Military Division of Japan's Army Division.

9
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,360
He stayed in China for many years

10
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,719
as a businessman.

11
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,680
He could speak fluent Chinese.

12
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,599
But he has always acted mysteriously.

13
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,639
We don't even know what he looks like.

14
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,199
This person is...

15
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,039
His guards

16
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,000
according to reliable information,

17
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
he'll protect Shangshan Hu

18
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,439
and board the train from Nanjing to Shanghai.

19
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
I heard that you weren't

20
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,120
you don't want to participate in the operation.

21
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,319
In the past one to two years,

22
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,159
In the past one to two years.

23
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,639
And make profits by monopolizing trade in the enemy-occupied areas.

24
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,840
And there are many drug smugglers,

25
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,039
but this time is different.

26
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,159
We intercepted

27
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
that we were going to send to Shanghai.

28
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
If the secret service

29
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,199
crack the secret letter,

30
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,240
shanghai Organization will be destroyed.

31
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,280
So we must get rid of Yamashita

32
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,840
and get the secret letter back.

33
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,599
But there are so many people at the railway station.

34
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,120
It's hard to do it.

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,840
That's right.

36
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,439
He has a characteristic.

37
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,159
His left eye.

38
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,360
I think

39
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,439
the person either has a squint

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,079
or he is blind.

41
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,240
When you were little.

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
The train will arrive at the station at around eight o'clock.

43
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,319
I've inspected it in advance.

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
There are two entrances

45
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
kun and I will watch the first entrance.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You two will be on the other side.

47
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
Find him.

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,959
We have to

49
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
to take care of Martial Man

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
before he leaves for the train.

51
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
The train station is crowded with people and exits are crowded.

52
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,680
You have a chance to escape from the chaos.

53
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,920
Alright.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,920
Also,

55
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,000
In case of an emergency,

56
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,519
I'll take off my hat

57
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,560
as the signal to evacuate immediately.

58
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Sis,

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
buy a perfume satchel.

60
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,199
How much is it?

61
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,879
Eighty cents, Miss.

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,199
This is stitched with yun brocade.

63
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
That only exists in Nanjing.

64
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,160
Get one.

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,639
Keep the change.

66
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you, miss.

67
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,120
♪ Check your tickets and come to the station ♪

68
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,639
Hold your tickets in your hand

69
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,800
one by one.

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,639
Don't crowd, don't rush.

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,920
Look at the one with sunglasses.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,319
Does he look like the warrior next to him?

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
Go and knock his sunglasses off.

74
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,120
What are you doing?

75
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,040
Can't you see?

76
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,279
Sorry, I fell down.

77
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,480
Sorry

78
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
melon seeds, baby.

79
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,959
Forget it, let's go.

80
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Sorry.

81
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,759
That one-eyed man

82
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,879
Is the man in the picture.

83
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,240
He lost his artificial eye

84
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,199
and put on the black eye.

85
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
The warrior sat in the second class.

86
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,800
Maybe he's afraid that the first class seat is too conspicuous.

87
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,000
You're cunning.

88
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
Did you confirm which one is the warrior under the mountain?

89
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,600
No one.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,439
But there must be more than one guard.

91
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,959
What should we do now?

92
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Not only the guards,

93
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,439
but also a military police.

94
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,720
The train station is bound to fail

95
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,879
carry out plan B.

96
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,759
Get on the train. Lock the mountain first.

97
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,600
Don't move.

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,360
Why did you have my photos?

99
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,920
I found it.

100
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,639
I can see it in your eyes.

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,040
This photo was your missing one.

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,480
Confess!

103
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,240
Who on earth

104
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
I can't go there

105
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,679
chief Chen

106
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,159
good morning

107
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,279
good morning.

108
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,039
Tell me your spirit of the states of Eastern Zhou Dynasty.

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,679
You have nothing to do to kill time.

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Oh, right.

111
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
Ms. Luo was looking for you just now.

112
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,960
Mrs. Luo,

113
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,000
what kind of perfume did you wear?

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,639
It smells so good.

115
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,840
How could I afford perfume?

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,919
Toilet water.

117
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,159
Mrs. Wan.

118
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,240
When I apply it to you,

119
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,200
It's as good as French perfume.

120
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,960
What a surprise.

121
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,639
You are really sweet with words.

122
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,840
But now Luo has become like this,

123
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,279
In the future,

124
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,840
we can only use toilet water as perfume,

125
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
and turn the pancake and deep-fried dough sticks into croissant cheese.

126
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,279
Xiaoqin,

127
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,240
fried dough sticks.

128
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,039
I'd rather starve to death than eat these.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,480
Captain.

130
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,360
The Train No. 514 that you asked to check

131
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,159
will arrive at 3 p.m.

132
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,600
Should we pick it up?

133
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,279
No need.

134
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,360
I heard that the warrior from the mountain was mysterious and low-key.

135
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,519
He doesn't like to be picked up at the station.

136
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Then wait in the trading house.

137
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,320
Captain, it's from the warrior under the mountain.

138
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Who exactly is this Communist Party traitor?

139
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
A wide net.

140
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,679
Captain Zhao,

141
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,080
the Chinese Communist Party's big fish and small fish

142
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,799
of the Chinese Communists.

143
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,320
Officer Kimura let you take over Fan Xian,

144
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,120
to make you prove yourself

145
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,639
and make you upright.

146
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,519
Do I need to be promoted?

147
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,720
Let Luo Guanqun continue to be the manager.

148
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,080
He only uses chopsticks when drinking tea.

149
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,320
Just for decoration.

150
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,120
That's right.

151
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,639
Just for decoration.

152
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,080
How about we go to the dining car at 11: 30?

153
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,919
We might have nothing to eat if we're late.

154
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,120
Have you found the warrior under the mountain?

155
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
Coach three.

156
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,840
Seat 23.

157
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,919
Wearing a grey overcoat,

158
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,600
how can you be sure?

159
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,879
I first found the Crew Head

160
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,919
who was with Cyclops before.

161
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,000
He was sitting with three other guys

162
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,360
they read the same newspaper

163
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,039
and exchanged cigarettes.

164
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,519
So I'm sure they're in the same trade

165
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,600
besides the dust coat,

166
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,080
the seats for the other three.

167
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,720
Their vision can cover the whole carriage.

168
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,759
And they keep looking around.

169
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,759
I was very vigilant,

170
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,519
monitoring the situation inside the carriage.

171
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,440
Must be a trained special agent.

172
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,320
Furthermore,

173
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,759
a grey coat,

174
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,519
Is the only one with a bag.

175
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,799
I guess that

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,159
the secret letter is inside the bag.

177
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,039
The grey coat is the warrior under the mountain.

178
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,759
It's just that

179
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
they've tightened their guard

180
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,679
of the warrior in the mountain.

181
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,600
Could it be because

182
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,360
because that one-eyed man was killed?

183
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,960
What makes them suspicious?

184
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,200
They wouldn't have.

185
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,799
Hu sacrificed himself

186
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
he wanted the mountain

187
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,759
that Cyclops was robbed.

188
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,360
For Hu.

189
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,960
To Xiao Hu.

190
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,639
What is our backup plan?

191
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,600
Poison them.

192
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,759
According to my observation,

193
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,919
yamashita should be left-handed.

194
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,519
He smokes.

195
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,519
Look at the menu.

196
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,399
To take the bag.

197
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,639
With every left hand.

198
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,679
So he used his left hand

199
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
to drink tea.

200
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,120
Cups on the train have handles.

201
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,159
Is the one who holds the cup?

202
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,519
It should be like this.

203
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,799
His lip touches the cup,

204
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,320
opposite to the one holding the cup in our right hand.

205
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,559
So we only have to

206
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,799
to paint this side.

207
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,399
We need to keep an eye on the cups in the dining car

208
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,120
In case any innocent people are hurt.

209
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,360
You're back.

210
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
Aren't you afraid that your brothers

211
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,279
return so suddenly?

212
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,960
I've already

213
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,879
sent them out to drink.

214
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,559
We were the only two on the third floor

215
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,759
on the third floor.

216
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,360
Without water,

217
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,039
what should I do?

218
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,200
Don't panic.

219
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,039
Be careful.

220
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,600
Come.

221
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,600
Let's sit down and drink.

222
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Soda water, peanuts, melon seeds.

223
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,639
Do you need anything?

224
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:39,759
Mother.

225
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,440
I want to drink soda.

226
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,039
No way

227
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,200
every time you drink that soda,

228
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,360
no, thanks.

229
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,919
Soda water, peanuts and sunflower seeds.

230
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,919
Stay here.

231
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,480
Soda water, peanuts, sunflower seeds.

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,480
Do you want some soda?

233
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,759
My mom doesn't allow me to drink anything from a stranger.

234
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,559
But I'm not a stranger.

235
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,519
I'm your mom's friend.

236
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,960
Don't believe me.

237
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,960
I even know your little secret.

238
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,920
What little secret?

239
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,319
It's...

240
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,480
The reason your mother doesn't allow you to drink soda is

241
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,880
because the minute you drink soda,

242
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,559
It would...

243
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:51,799
Hurry.

244
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Have a sip.

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,599
Are you alright?

246
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,279
What's wrong with him?

247
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,200
You know?

248
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,039
The soda pop in your mouth

249
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,680
It can make a beautiful sound.

250
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,160
But it's only heard when you close your eyes.

251
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,119
Do you want to try it?

252
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,839
Come on.

253
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,200
I'll cover your ears.

254
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Listen carefully.

255
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,759
It seems he has heart attack.

256
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,279
What should I do?

257
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,440
I swear that

258
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,640
as long as I hold power one day,

259
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,319
I'll definitely marry you.

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,440
I also want Luo Guanqun

261
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,200
to attend our wedding.

262
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,960
I must ask him to bless us.

263
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,319
I just want him to know that

264
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,000
he doesn't deserve to be a manager

265
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,880
even less your man.

266
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,720
Does it smell nice?

267
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,880
Smells good.

268
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,680
You smell so fragrant every day.

269
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,720
Won't Luo arouse suspicion?

270
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,759
That's why

271
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,200
you're a cowardly old hat.

272
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
I lied to him that it was toilet water,

273
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,640
and he'll buy it.

274
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,920
Toilet water

275
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:10,680
and he bought it.

276
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,119
That's right.

277
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,759
An old bumpkin.

278
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,359
Who's that?

279
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,240
It's me.

280
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Kenzo Kimura.

281
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,400
You're here, Officer Kimura.

282
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,759
Curtain. Curtain.

283
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,359
Hurry up.

284
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,960
Here they are, Officer Kimura.

285
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,480
She's here.

286
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,599
Officer Kimura,

287
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,119
I've checked it.

288
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,720
It seems the mountain is still alive.

289
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,799
It seems that the poison on the cup

290
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,799
was not enough.

291
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,079
It doesn't matter.

292
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,839
Is still alive,

293
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,119
when I'm in Shanghai,

294
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,880
he must send her to the station infirmary first

295
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,839
for emergency treatment.

296
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,480
Let's take advantage of this.

297
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,400
To grab the secret letter,

298
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,160
I was not far from welcoming you.

299
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,160
Captain Zhao.

300
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,200
What are you doing?

301
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,839
Nothing.

302
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,359
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

303
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,440
I went out for a while

304
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,799
but I missed it.

305
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,359
Sorry, Officer Kimura.

306
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Why would you draw the curtain during daytime?

307
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,720
Why would you

308
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,519
officer Kimura,

309
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
I see

310
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,799
no wonder you answered my call.

311
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,119
The Chinese often say that

312
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,160
the rabbit

313
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,359
doesn't eat grass near its nest.

314
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,359
No, I haven't.

315
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,839
Get out.

316
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,079
You have grass,

317
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,000
why did you run all over the mountain?

318
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,319
I dare not.

319
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
I dare not run.

320
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,359
We received an emergency telegram.

321
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,519
There was an accident.

322
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,839
Once the train arrives at the station,

323
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,960
we need to take him to our infirmary

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
for emergency treatment.

325
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:19,720
Yes

326
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,960
bring some people to set surveillance around the infirmary.

327
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,160
If there's another problem,

328
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,000
watch your head.

329
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,839
Understood.

330
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,799
Do you know there's a mole in your business?

331
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,920
A mole?

332
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,039
When you find out

333
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,640
you've turned into a ghost.

334
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,559
Catch anyone suspicious.

335
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,599
Yes

336
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,839
everyone, don't get out of the car.

337
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,200
What's going on?

338
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:04,799
Don't allow me to get out of the car.

339
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,119
Step forward.

340
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,599
Get out of the way!

341
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,599
Get out of the way!

342
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,279
Get out of the way.

343
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,519
Get out of the way.

344
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,279
Get out of the way!

345
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,640
Watch this.

346
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,480
Get out of the way.

347
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,519
You'll lose the chance if you don't do it now.

348
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,039
We can't do it now. Find a chance to talk again.

349
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,079
It's too late.

350
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
The second-class coach can get off now.

351
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,559
Don't crowd!

352
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,359
Isn't that Cold Dew?

353
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,799
Who is Cold Dew?

354
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,799
A super star.

355
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,720
Is really beautiful.

356
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,640
It's a pity

357
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,400
worked for a Japanese film studio.

358
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,519
He is a traitor.

359
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,279
Get out of the way!

360
00:23:59,279 --> 00:23:59,799
Get out of the way!

361
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,319
Get out of the way.

362
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,119
Stand up.

363
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Miss Han Lu.

364
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,640
I'm your fan. Please sign your name.

365
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,599
Stand up!

366
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,400
I'll beat you to death!

367
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,200
You traitor!

368
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,319
Let go of me.

369
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,880
Go right now.

370
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,880
-Let's go. -It's dangerous here.

371
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,839
Hold on.

372
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,000
Thank you for saving me.

373
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,319
I'm no traitor.

374
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,440
Alright.

375
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,960
Ms. Han Lu, let's go.

376
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,599
Let's go now!

377
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,440
Mingxuan!

378
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,160
Stop!

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,880
Chase them!

380
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,920
Chase them! Hurry up!

381
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,079
They went that way. Chase them!

382
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:34,599
Hurry!

383
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:42,640
Stop!

384
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,400
Second-best.

385
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,240
That woman with a hat and trench coat

386
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,839
I guess it's with the assassinators.

387
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:49,880
After them.

388
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,759
Hurry!

389
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Chen Jiaping.

390
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,279
Captain Zhao.

391
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,000
We're all here.

392
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:50,839
Are on a mission.

393
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,519
Captain Zhao.

394
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,920
What are you doing here?

395
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,160
He came to pick up his girlfriend.

396
00:26:59,319 --> 00:26:59,799
Hey.

397
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,000
Guoguo, you are also the same.

398
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:02,960
I told you.

399
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll wait for you at the exit.

400
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Why didn't you come out for so long?

401
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,319
I don't know the way.

402
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,079
You don't know?

403
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,400
I looked for him for ages,

404
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,680
I even saw someone shooting.

405
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,920
And I was really scared.

406
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Where are you waiting for me?

407
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,119
I waited for you at the exit

408
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,359
I heard gunshots inside

409
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,440
and I ran in

410
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
I was worried about you.

411
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,359
Then,

412
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,160
then we can meet each other.

413
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
Don't be mad.

414
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,920
Captain Zhao.

415
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,000
Sorry about that.

416
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,920
Please keep your things to yourself.

417
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,799
I'll leave with my girlfriend.

418
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,799
CAUTION

419
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,119
come on.

420
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,160
Come on.

421
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,720
What happened?

422
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,759
They know each other?

423
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,039
Brother.

424
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,200
Should we arrest them?

425
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,079
Sit down.

426
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,480
Thank you.

427
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,880
When we get to the car tomorrow,

428
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,839
we must first confirm who is connecting you

429
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,240
he will be in the same carriage with you

430
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,279
wearing a grey hat.

431
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,119
And get the newspaper

432
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,720
after receiving the newspaper

433
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
and then return to Nanjing

434
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,160
got it.

435
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,000
Tomorrow will be your first mission.

436
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,319
Are you confident?

437
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,519
We are.

438
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,640
I heard

439
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,400
you and Zuo Shuangtao are getting married tomorrow.

440
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,359
That's right.

441
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,559
But I want to tell Guoguo that

442
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,359
we can get the marriage license another day.

443
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
That's not good.

444
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,400
If you change the time at the last minute,

445
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,680
left Shuangtao will suspect you.

446
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
If you can complete the task tomorrow

447
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
and return to Nanjing on time,

448
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
to register for the marriage.

449
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes

450
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,559
please rest assured.

451
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,640
The mission is the priority.

452
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,359
Left Twin Peaches?

453
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,039
Did she suspect you?

454
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,680
No, she's not.

455
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,319
That's Jiaping.

456
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,480
Our organization has approved your marriage application,

457
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,559
but Zuo Shuangtao is not a member of the Party.

458
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,119
She is just an ordinary person.

459
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,960
That we can't

460
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,759
the secret of your identity

461
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,079
your identity to her.

462
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
The killer might have known it in advance.

463
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,440
He has information in his hat.

464
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,519
He must have taken the newspaper

465
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
but who was the murderer?

466
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,200
The only clue

467
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,559
was the newspaper in the killer's hands.

468
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,119
Zhenjiang Station will be arrived soon

469
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,039
It's likely that the killer gets off here

470
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,759
we must find the killer before that

471
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,680
but we won't have a clue

472
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,240
I don't have any clue at all.

473
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,240
With a news report in his pocket

474
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,200
which would mark the information

475
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,359
to mark the information.

476
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,559
And writing potion

477
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,759
write down the secret potion

478
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,279
In the newspaper

479
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,720
It takes time.

480
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
It can't be done this morning.

481
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,319
It can't be done yesterday

482
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,119
or even earlier.

483
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,599
So,

484
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,519
a newspaper in a gray hat.

485
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,799
It's not today's

486
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,000
who holds the news from yesterday

487
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,720
the news from yesterday or earlier

488
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,799
that person

489
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,720
Is the killer

490
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,599
the killer must have hidden the newspaper away

491
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,440
what to do now?

492
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,319
Are you going to fail your first mission?

493
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,960
No, absolutely not.

494
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,440
Judging from the way that the gray top hat fell to the ground,

495
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,920
he probably was facing a mirror when he was murdered.

496
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,599
The murderer stabbed him in the neck with an needle.

497
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,039
We must kill him when we're close to him.

498
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,759
He must have seen

499
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,480
the murderer who was close to him.

500
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,599
But as an intelligence worker,

501
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,359
to a certain extent.

502
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,119
But there were no signs of struggle or resistance at the scene.

503
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,920
Why would she be so careless?

504
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,240
To let the killer get close to him easily?

505
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,079
Unless the killer's identity

506
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,000
can relax his vigilance.

507
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,759
The killer must be

508
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,119
the train has arrived.

509
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,240
Please get off the train in an orderly way

510
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,839
take your belongings with you.

511
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,359
And don't leave anything behind.

512
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,640
Those with children, hold hands with children.

513
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,640
Don't crowd.

514
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,000
What's up

515
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,559
I sprained my ankle.

516
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,240
Are you alright?

517
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,359
It's alright.

518
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,400
It's changed a lot.

519
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,680
Mature now?

520
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,079
Come on.

521
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,880
Slowly. Slowly.

522
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,320
Where are you from?

523
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,239
Wuhan.

524
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,639
After that, you went to Wuhan.

525
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,679
You wouldn't have come to Shanghai without me.

526
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,199
I can't go to Wuhan.

527
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,280
Don't move.

528
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,800
Thank you for your help.

529
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,360
Let's walk another part of the way

530
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,519
If no one is with us,

531
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,599
we'll just

532
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,239
let's go our separate ways.

533
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,800
Who are they?

534
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,760
What did you come to Shanghai for?

535
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,159
It's none of your business

536
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,280
are you still mad at me?

537
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,719
You thought too much.

538
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,559
You're way too important to me.

539
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,280
I know.

540
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,400
I stood you up on the day of the registration.

541
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,320
I've done something that hurts you.

542
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,280
You won't forgive me.

543
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,960
I'm sorry.

544
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,159
Is there a mirror?

545
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,519
What?

546
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,039
Freshen up your makeup.

547
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,480
There's no one here.

548
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,639
We'll break up when we reach the intersection.

549
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,039
I have something important to do.

550
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,960
What a coincidence.

551
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,920
I also have something important to do.

552
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:46,480
Alright.

553
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,119
Calm down please

554
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,639
chief Chen

555
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,280
don't be mad

556
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,159
Is very sweet.

557
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,920
Captain Zhao, we meet again.

558
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,199
Where are you going?

559
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,519
For shopping?

560
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,679
I just saw one turning to the left,

561
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,559
while another was right.

562
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
They parted ways.

563
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:02,760
How could they?

564
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,159
You're embarrassing me on your first day.

565
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,599
This is the thing.

566
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,280
I told her the train station.

567
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,639
I'll take her for a walk

568
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,559
for a walk.

569
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,480
She doesn't

570
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,599
Insisted on going shopping.

571
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,480
We don't see the scenery.

572
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,000
So there's a disagreement

573
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,719
there was a conflict.

574
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
You can't bear to spend money.

575
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,679
No one wants to see the Huangpu River.

576
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,639
There must be shopping in Shanghai.

577
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,800
It's all my fault.

578
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,320
Which mall do you want to go to?

579
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,239
Yong'an Mall?

580
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,199
I'll send you there.

581
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:29,760
No need.

582
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's walk around.

583
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,840
Get in the car.

584
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm afraid you won't make it to the mall.

585
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,559
Why not?

586
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,039
I suspect that you are involved in the assassination.

587
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,199
Come with us and cooperate with the investigation.

588
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,400
Be rather baffling

589
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,000
why did you investigate me?

590
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,880
No, Captain Zhao.

591
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,320
It must be a misunderstanding.

592
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,400
My girlfriend came to Shanghai to visit me.

593
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,800
Be related to the murder?

594
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,559
Feng Qi,

595
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,639
bring Chen Jiaping back too

596
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,199
yes

597
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,320
no, wait a second.

598
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,760
It's...

599
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,360
Why do you take me back?

600
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,320
You had no mission

601
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,039
but you showed up at the train station.

602
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
That's suspicious.

603
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:03,920
Hey, Captain Zhao,

604
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,679
you are wrong.

605
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,840
We're colleagues.

606
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,320
You want to take me back?

607
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,880
You must have the evidence, right?

608
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,519
Proof?

609
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,119
Then we'll have the evidence

610
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,559
you'll have the evidence.

611
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,000
Second best.

612
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,000
Feng Qi!

613
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,280
Escort her separately.

614
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,440
To prevent collusion.

615
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:20,519
Yes

616
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,239
chen Jiaping,

617
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,719
Isn't this your business?

618
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,159
How can you arrest people without permission?

619
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,400
Nothing.

620
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,639
Let's go home and chat.

621
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:29,920
Come on

622
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,320
this way, Chief Chen

623
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,440
this way

624
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,400
chief Chen, this way

625
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,199
miss Zuo

626
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,039
where are your coat and hat?

627
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,199
What do you mean?

628
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,920
I wore this outfit

629
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,159
when I got on the bus from Wuhan.

630
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
Wuhan is in the twenties.

631
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,239
Who doesn't need a trench coat and a hat.

632
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,880
Why were you at the assassination scene?

633
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,079
I'm here for Chen Jiaping.

634
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,000
How could I have known that

635
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,760
people would kill me at the train station?

636
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,000
You are really scared.

637
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,960
Why do you want to see Chen Jia Ping

638
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,920
for what?

639
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,039
I'm his girlfriend.

640
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,519
Why do you think I'm here?

641
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Hey, what do you guys want?

642
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,280
We're colleagues after all.

643
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,400
Say something

644
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,360
please quiet down

645
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,079
what are you doing?

646
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,960
Who's Jiaping?

647
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,079
We're friends.

648
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,199
Look at this mess you made.

649
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,679
Come on.

650
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,280
What the hell is wrong with you?

651
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,320
I have something to do.

652
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,159
An explanation will help.

653
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,599
Zhao An didn't do anything to you, did he?

654
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,360
Nothing.

655
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,639
He still needs to

656
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,679
pay me the price.

657
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,639
Come on.

658
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:00,760
No rush.

659
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,800
Come. Sit down.

660
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,159
Sit down.

661
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,400
Big spoon!

662
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,840
Why are you so close to me?

663
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,159
Please don't.

664
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,159
I...

665
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,079
I just saw someone trying to kill you.

666
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,239
I want to remind you that

667
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,079
but he shot me

668
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:35,880
he fired.

669
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,800
To hit me.

670
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,239
Don't point at me, I'm scared.

671
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,159
Thank you.

672
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,400
I saved you.

673
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,559
And you won't care about me anymore?

674
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,639
What's your name

675
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,519
what's your name?

676
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,559
What's your name

677
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,880
chen Jiaping.

678
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,599
My family name is Luo.

679
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,000
It's called Luo Guanqun.

680
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,639
Jiaping.

681
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,920
What are you thinking about?

682
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,719
How we knew each other?

683
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,440
I got shot for you.

684
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,840
Otherwise, how could you

685
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,679
to interrogate me here now?

686
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,480
You're really something

687
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,840
you took it seriously.

688
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,239
It's said that

689
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,280
there are CCP spies in our firm.

690
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,280
By our undercover agent.

691
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,239
Zhao An was at the train station today.

692
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,239
I have no choice.

693
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,239
Just a formality.

694
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,440
To deal with the Japanese.

695
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,400
Furthermore,

696
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,119
wherever you go,

697
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,519
why you're going to the train station?

698
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,360
Stop asking.

699
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,239
What?

700
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,519
To pick up my girlfriend.

701
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,519
When did you have a girlfriend?

702
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,039
You never told me?

703
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,320
Lower your voice.

704
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,920
Affect my market.

705
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:10,559
You know...

706
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,480
I have

707
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,639
my girlfriend and I

708
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:16,679
living in different places.

709
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,960
And I haven't had a chance to introduce you.

710
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,519
What's more,

711
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,000
since I've been working under you,

712
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,920
after what I did for you,

713
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,039
men are just

714
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,119
we shouldn't make life

715
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,880
without possibilities.

716
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,840
Alright.

717
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,159
Understood.

718
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,559
Which train does your girlfriend take?

719
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,719
When did she arrive?
