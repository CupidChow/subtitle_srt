1
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,519
Because you're my big brother.

2
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,879
That little bean dropped you.

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,359
When you dropped you.

4
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,319
But you made it uncomfortable again.

5
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,640
You should apologize to it.

6
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,719
Then I caused this.

7
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,879
And I raised Little Bean.

8
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,719
So I must apologize to both of you.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,159
You're abnormal?

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,599
If you still act abnormal,

11
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,239
I'll kick you out of the business.

12
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,239
I won't bring you with me.

13
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,280
Can you believe it?

14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Brother.

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,359
Sister-in-law.

16
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,519
The earring.

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
Why is it here?

18
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,599
Understood.

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Brother.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
You and Mrs. Luo got together again?

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Has scored twice.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,879
Keep a low profile.

23
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,879
This time, I can't let Guan Qun find out.

24
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,840
That's for sure.

25
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
It's really a great drought.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
Or how could you lose your earrings?

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,560
Get out of here!

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,520
Go back to your work.

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,719
Brother. Brother.

30
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,120
Give her back the earrings!

31
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,919
In case Luo Guanqun finds it out.

32
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,759
First of all, I want to know

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,000
your specific action plan.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,759
We'll work with the hurricane team.

35
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,479
We'll rescue the kidnapped experts

36
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,439
and other staff members.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,439
Then they arranged the bomb

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,000
to completely destroy the counterfeit factory.

39
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,400
What's up

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,599
something is wrong with our plan.

41
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,159
I have inquired.

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,400
This factory has 24-hour production.

43
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,840
At the same time,

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
standing guard day and night.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,159
It's very difficult

46
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,680
to get in through the front door.

47
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,360
Are you underestimating the fighting power of the Hurricanes?

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
It's more than enough to beat

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,840
more than sufficient

50
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,199
but don't forget that

51
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,120
the Huxi Division of the Military Police Headquarters

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Is within 15 minutes' drive

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,120
less than 15 minutes' drive

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
once a battle starts,

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,159
they will support you quickly.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
Do you have any suggestions?

57
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,120
The only way.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,719
Tell me about it.

59
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,719
The daily shift

60
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,960
the day shift

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,919
during the day shift

62
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,479
to change shift.

63
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,520
Other than the workers,

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,159
the Japanese team

65
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,240
will leave two soldiers to guard.

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,280
The rest of the guards will be relieved as well.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,639
It means that within this period,

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,919
there were only two supervisors

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,479
and there are two Japanese soldiers.

70
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,240
At their weakest point.

71
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,319
That's right.

72
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,680
But it won't be long.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,279
20 minutes at most.

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,639
20 minutes?

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
We won't have time to make the plan

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,920
and carry out the operation.

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,839
But if you can achieve something

78
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,480
do something at once,

79
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,000
I think there is still a possibility for us to succeed.

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,279
What do you mean by targeted?

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
Before the operation starts,

82
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,040
let's sneak into the factory

83
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,439
and find out the location of the banknote factory

84
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,000
so that the hurricane team can get to the bottom of it.

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,959
We'll finish the task

86
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,519
before the support arrives.

87
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,519
The factory

88
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,319
with 24 hours a day.

89
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,480
And we have a team from the Japanese.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,920
How are we going to get in?

91
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,279
That's why

92
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,160
you're lucky that you know me,

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,839
that you were lucky.

94
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,680
I have inquired.

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,079
Lunch and dinner in the factory

96
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,160
are provided by a restaurant in the city

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,319
called Kai Yun Restaurant in the city.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,439
When the dining car gets to the factory,

99
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,560
the foreman will check everyone's labor cards.

100
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,800
Then the hotel staff

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
bring the food into the factory

102
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,680
and distribute them one by one.

103
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,800
You mean that

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,279
we can pretend to be employees in the hotel?

105
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:24,920
That's right.

106
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,199
The hotel is of huge scale

107
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,160
with a lot of employees.

108
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,560
And high turnover.

109
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,240
The foreman won't know everyone's face.

110
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,160
As long as we can become one as the witness,

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,399
the foreman will not suspect us.

112
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,600
But even if we enter the factory,

113
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,480
how are we going to find the counterfeit factory?

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
That is what I have been thinking.

115
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,360
We don't have any clue right now.

116
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,240
Guoguo.

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
Think about it.

118
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,600
The Japanese imprisoned their workers and experts.

119
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,680
But to ensure their basic survival every day,

120
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,199
right?

121
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,680
Alright.

122
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,920
There are 30 to 40 people working in the counterfeit factory.

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,439
Plus the Japanese team,

124
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,839
how will they be provided with meals?

125
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,920
Guo Yun once told me that

126
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,959
they can have steamed buns at noon every day.

127
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,160
My wife has such a good memory.

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
That's right.

129
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,199
Two steamed buns for lunch.

130
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,560
The porridge and rolls in the evening.

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,079
That goes to

132
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,839
at night, we can have some steamed buns

133
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,000
this is the menu of Kai Yun Restaurant.

134
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
Got it.

135
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,279
Part of the meals

136
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,600
are actually sent

137
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,199
was sent to the underground counterfeit factory

138
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,839
that's right.

139
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,199
So someone must have

140
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,560
to the counterfeit factory.

141
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,480
As long as we follow this man,

142
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,879
to locate the counterfeit factory.

143
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
This is a good idea.

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,759
Get out of the car.

145
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Give me the ring.

146
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:17,839
Got it.

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,199
Don't speak.

148
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,399
After this operation,

149
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,240
military Police Command

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,199
will launch an investigation into us,

151
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,839
Including everyone in the factory.

152
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,839
One by one.

153
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,480
The fake delivery guys

154
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,160
will definitely draw the portrait,

155
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,759
especially us.

156
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,800
Meet the Japanese a lot.

157
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,360
So, you should put a good cover on.

158
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,439
I think they're having meat buns today.

159
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,000
These two big buckets are supposed to be for the workers.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
The two small ones on the bottom

161
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
should be sent to the counterfeit factory

162
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,079
your analysis is right.

163
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
In this basket

164
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,199
Is supposed to be for the Japanese soldiers and supervisors.

165
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
How are we supposed to divide the work?

166
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,759
You gave out steamed buns to the workers.

167
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,839
I've been there to serve the Japanese and the foreman.

168
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll come with you.

169
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,319
Don't trust me.

170
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,040
Alright.

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,800
OK.

172
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,439
Guoguo, please check this for me.

173
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,720
Why are you so late today?

174
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,759
Why are you so late?

175
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,240
That's far.

176
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,480
Why are we all strangers today?

177
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,200
Another one?

178
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Go and ask the boss.

179
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,000
You are really bad-tempered.

180
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,960
Really?

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
To your place within 50 minutes.

182
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,159
It's just over 10 minutes to send the downtown area.

183
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,399
From this period.

184
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,960
It's your turn, you don't have a temper.

185
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,879
Have you got your ID?

186
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,480
Yes, I have.

187
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,879
Come on.

188
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,600
Give me a hand.

189
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,480
Hurry up.

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,720
Let's go to bed when you're done.

191
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,639
Finish it early.

192
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,919
Show your face.

193
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,639
Have you finished reading?

194
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,919
Wait a second.

195
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,799
If you don't want to come,

196
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,840
why are you here?

197
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
Isn't it me?

198
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Last time we got into a fight with a customer,

199
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,080
and Mr. Zhou got angry.

200
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,440
And because of me,

201
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
because of me.

202
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,759
How's Mr. Zhou recently?

203
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,399
He's asking you a question.

204
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,639
Are you dumb?

205
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,399
Didn't you hear that

206
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,320
mr. Zhou recently married a second wife.

207
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,559
The money he earned from marrying a second wife

208
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,919
by taking advantage of our wealth.

209
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,919
Do you think that Second House...

210
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,759
His second house?

211
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,440
Brat!

212
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,120
Ready?

213
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Come with me.

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,600
Come on.

215
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Leave here.

216
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,200
Come on.

217
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,759
Come on in.

218
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,120
Come on! Hurry up!

219
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,879
Hurry!

220
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,000
Hello, sir.

221
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
It's time for meal.

222
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,840
Come and line up.

223
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,320
Come on.

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,840
Come on, hurry up.

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
That way! Over there!

226
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,799
Hurry up!

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,399
Come on.

228
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,080
You carry them down.

229
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,919
Hurry up!

230
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,279
What about us?

231
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,000
Follow me.

232
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Come on.

233
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,600
Captain Matsumoto.

234
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,039
Dinner is served.

235
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,720
Come on.

236
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
What is the dish today?

237
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm talking to him.

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,039
Captain Matsumoto.

239
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,200
Is he a mute?

240
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,879
Officer, don't be mad.

241
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,240
How about this?

242
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Let me introduce them to you.

243
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,559
Today's dish is boiled chicken,

244
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,720
and braised eggplant.

245
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,919
Stir-fried shrimps. = Braised Pork Slices =

246
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,039
Braised white,

247
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,519
shanghai Pork Ribs

248
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,240
and the pickled mustard green shredded meat soup.

249
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,039
The food is good.

250
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,840
Hurry up!

251
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,120
Officers, take your time.

252
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,159
I'll deliver the food first.

253
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,759
Don't worry.

254
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,440
We'll cook for you

255
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,320
to save the best dishes for you.

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,039
Sir, please

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
take good care of the officers.

258
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,559
I'll go with him to deliver food.

259
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,840
No, I'll go alone.

260
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,559
Idiot.

261
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,440
What are you doing?

262
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,320
You're blind.

263
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,480
Be careful!

264
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Taijun, are you alright?

265
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,440
Look at this.

266
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,480
Come on.

267
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,440
Let me tell you something.

268
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,240
Watch out.

269
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,200
Got it?

270
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,159
Sir,

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll get back to work then.

272
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
What are you doing?

273
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,919
Hold on.

274
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Shrimps.

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,799
It's good.

276
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,360
The shrimp.

277
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,960
It's on the floor.

278
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,279
You

279
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,279
eat it.

280
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,480
Thank you, sir.

281
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
Eat, eat.

282
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
The shrimp is good.

283
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,120
No one can eat prawns.

284
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:11,840
The shrimps.

285
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,279
It's yummy.

286
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,600
Thank you, officer.

287
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,159
Stop!

288
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,840
This way.

289
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,120
Get out of here!

290
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,480
Do you hear me?

291
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm afraid I can't catch up with him.

292
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,600
He tampered with the trailer

293
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,519
who did it?

294
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,159
Leave now. We'll be exposed.

295
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:46,759
♫ Somebody help me ♫

296
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,159
Please help me.

297
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,960
Please.

298
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,080
Leave or we'll be exposed.

299
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,279
He has already seen us.

300
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,440
He was exposed because I didn't save him.

301
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,799
Master Sun has gone far.

302
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,279
Thank you for saving me.

303
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,080
If I had been caught just now,

304
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm dead then.

305
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
You're still dead to me, okay?

306
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,639
Hold on.

307
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,559
He is from the military garment factory.

308
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,559
If we don't kill him,

309
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,879
he will expose us.

310
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,879
I won't reveal you.

311
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,679
I just want to steal something to feed myself.

312
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,039
I don't even know who you are!

313
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,240
You little jerk,

314
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,440
ruined our plan.

315
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,759
No, it's not.

316
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,320
Hold on!

317
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,120
You climbed over the wall

318
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,960
so that you can secretly eat to fill your stomach?

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Right.

320
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,440
We only have a bowl of porridge and a steamed bun for dinner.

321
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,039
That's not enough.

322
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,240
Where to steal it?

323
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,759
Chief Sun.

324
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,759
There are iron barrels on his trolley

325
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,480
there are steamed buns in it.

326
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,759
How did you know

327
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,440
there are steamed buns in the tin bucket of Foreman Sun.

328
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,039
I stole them before.

329
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,679
Where?

330
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,679
I once

331
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,919
I was doing this at the waste land of the workshop.

332
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,640
I saw Master Sun pushing a cart

333
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,799
passing by there.

334
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,039
I was thinking that

335
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,279
the iron barrels up there

336
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,200
Inside the tin bucket?

337
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,039
And I followed him.

338
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,960
To a warehouse gate.

339
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,240
Foreman Sun opened the warehouse and entered it

340
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,799
then the trolley parked there

341
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,960
I took the opportunity to approach them

342
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,279
and opened that iron bucket.

343
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,960
And there was a bucket full of meat buns inside.

344
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,480
I took two and ran away.

345
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,920
It smells so good.

346
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,119
Do you remember which warehouse it is?

347
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,079
Yes, that's right.

348
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,440
It's warehouse No. 23.

349
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Do you know the way to Warehouse No. 23?

350
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,160
Yes, I know.

351
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,039
Take us there.

352
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,640
Or I'll kill you!

353
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,240
Alright.

354
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,839
Come on.

355
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,119
How are we supposed to go?

356
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,240
That way.

357
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,920
Alright.

358
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:49,799
Back off.

359
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
Why is he back?

360
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,559
Look at this bucket.

361
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,279
Take the buckets here?

362
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,319
It means that he has finished the meal.

363
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,319
He's got the bucket from yesterday.

364
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,519
Come on.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,279
Come on.

366
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
This is it.

367
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
This is warehouse No.23.

368
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,160
When I was here last time,

369
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,200
there are Japanese soldiers guarding this place.

370
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,599
I only got the steamed buns

371
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,640
when they were peeing.

372
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,759
Are you sure about this?

373
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,519
Really?

374
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,839
Alright.

375
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,440
Go back.

376
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,559
It's time for the meals.

377
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,079
I guess that

378
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,000
you must be anti-Japanese, right?

379
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,599
Cut the crap!

380
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,160
Also,

381
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,000
remember that

382
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,599
don't tell anyone

383
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,000
you saw us?

384
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
Do you plan to resist the enemy

385
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
I am already anti-Japanese.

386
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,920
You can ask him.

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,599
Aren't you afraid that he would betray us?

388
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,759
One day, if I'm really betrayed,

389
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,400
It can't be him.

390
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,400
The counterfeit factory must be here.

391
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,400
But don't you think it's strange?

392
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,960
In such an important place,

393
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,200
there isn't even a military police.

394
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,000
It's also too quiet.

395
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,119
I'll go and have a look.

396
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,000
It's meal time.

397
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,720
The gendarmes must be delivering steamed buns.

398
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,680
Since bao was delivered here,

399
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,160
there must be no problem.

400
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
It's about time.

401
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,839
Leave now.

402
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,920
Good day, sir.

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,839
Thank you, sir.

404
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,359
I won't...

405
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,599
You are a driver.

406
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,160
Right.

407
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
I am the driver.

408
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,680
How long have you been at Kai Yun Hotel?

409
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,720
Not long. About one month.

410
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
How's Mr. Zhou's leg?

411
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,519
What?

412
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,519
I heard that your boss

413
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,039
your boss Zhou had a car accident.

414
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,119
Breaking one of his legs.

415
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,519
How is your recovery now?

416
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm much better now.

417
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,920
The food is good these days.

418
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
Please give my regards to him.

419
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,119
Yes, sir.

420
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,880
Yes, Your Highness.

421
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,599
Where have you two been?

422
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,039
The prawns on the ground are not clean.

423
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,200
And you have diarrhea.

424
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,559
Pack your things.

425
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,440
Get out of here.

426
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,160
Get out of here.

427
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,440
Get out of here!

428
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,640
What about

429
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,359
the counterfeit factory is in Warehouse 23.

430
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
Have you found anything?

431
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
There was a red button on the left side

432
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
at the door of the workshop.

433
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,359
It should be an alarm.

434
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,000
Factories that produce Japanese armaments

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,759
would be fitted with such an alarm.

436
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:08,839
We have to find a way

437
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,200
to avoid the alarm being triggered.

438
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,160
There's still one hour

439
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,359
before their shift change.

440
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,559
We'll meet up with the hurricane team first.

441
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,640
Make a plan of action

442
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,519
to make a concrete action plan.

443
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:24,559
Alright.

444
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,480
Director Jiang,

445
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm Tao Dachun, the leader of the Hurricanes.

446
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,960
Hello

447
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,640
hello

448
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,839
all members of the Hurricane Team

449
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,279
wait for Director Jiang's instructions.

450
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,960
Director Jiang, you're really something.

451
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,240
You sneaked into the Japanese factory.

452
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,359
This is thanks to

453
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,559
to someone who got us the labor card.

454
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,079
Who is that capable?

455
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I can't tell you her name.

456
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,599
I can only tell you her name.

457
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,000
She is the one we infiltrated into

458
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,519
the key departments of the enemy.

459
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,200
Code name is Five of Hearts.

460
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,319
Understood.

461
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,640
This is the Five of Hearts.

462
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,480
Hello, Captain Tao.

463
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,880
You are a girl.

464
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,440
Great!

465
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,319
This is

466
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,319
team 6 of the Action Committee of Su Zhe.

467
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,200
Of Team Six.

468
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,400
Hello

469
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,519
this is

470
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,359
this is...

471
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,200
Let me introduce myself.

472
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,720
Chen Jiaping,

473
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,279
one traitor.

474
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,720
Traitor?

475
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,960
It's a long story.

476
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,319
But he's on our side now.

477
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,720
Hello

478
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,519
director Jiang,

479
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
I want to know the distribution of the buildings

480
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,599
as soon as possible

481
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,519
to make a concrete action plan.

482
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,119
Alright.

483
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,160
Please.

484
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Please.

485
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,680
Did you hear that?

486
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,799
Got it?

487
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,759
In this operation,

488
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,799
nothing must go wrong.

489
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,960
We must succeed

490
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,319
can only succeed

491
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,880
but not to fail.

492
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,480
Yes

493
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,359
got it.

494
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,799
It's about time.

495
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,480
Get ready to go.

496
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,599
Yes

497
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,680
please stay here.

498
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,119
Why not?

499
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Don't worry.

500
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
I won't kill him.

501
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,480
After this operation is over,

502
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,559
after that.

503
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
I don't want to join your operation.

504
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,680
Director Jiang, right?

505
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,720
Can I have my wife stay

506
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,759
and chat with me?

507
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,319
What are you thinking?

508
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,680
She must join the operation.

509
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,480
Alright.

510
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,720
Honey.

511
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,720
Come on.

512
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,880
I won't be able to protect you later.

513
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,720
Please be careful

514
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,240
when taking action.

515
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,599
Look at these.

516
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,440
They treated me like this.

517
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,720
It's not worth it

518
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,559
It's not worth it.

519
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,599
It's Xiaowu.

520
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,319
Here it is.

521
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,640
Have you remembered your task?

522
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Got it.

523
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,039
Be careful when you

524
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,119
when you move next.

525
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,359
Stay away from me.

526
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,079
Don't go ahead.

527
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
Drive to the junction behind the Military Clothing Factory

528
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,240
to the junction behind the military service factory before 8: 15.

529
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,039
Remember to turn off the lights

530
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,240
and make a detour from the west.

531
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,400
To avoid the route of the military police squadron

532
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,640
the route of the military police squadron.

533
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,319
Understood.

534
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,079
Action.

535
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,519
See you later.

536
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,920
Why not let Chen Jiaping join the operation?

537
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
The Japanese

538
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,720
has got the copper coin of the Chinese Communist Party.

539
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,160
And it should be under the counterfeit factory.

540
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,480
Our mission this time

541
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,119
Is not only to destroy the counterfeit factory,

542
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,119
but also the copper plate.

543
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,279
Chen Jia Ping helped us a lot,

544
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,119
but after all, he is not on our side

545
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,960
If he finds out about the copper plate,

546
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
and even the Communists were involved.

547
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,359
It will affect our plan.

548
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,039
I'm off work.

549
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,079
There are two Japanese soldiers at the door.

550
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:31,960
And Captain Sun.

551
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,119
In addition to the guards at the gate,

552
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,680
there are ten Japanese soldiers in total.

553
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,519
Nine left.

554
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,680
One more should be in the office.

555
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,559
Taijun, have a smoke.

556
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:48,920
Come on.

557
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,680
Have you seen the red alarm

558
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,880
In the room?

559
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,880
Got it.

560
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,400
Let's kill her first.

561
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,839
Withdraw.

562
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,200
Unlock it.

563
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,480
Chief.

564
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,160
This is the paper for counterfeit money.

565
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,279
But where are they?

566
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,279
Where's the equipment?

567
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,319
This is a secret tunnel.

568
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,519
Stay where you are.

569
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,160
I'll check the situation.

570
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,400
Captain.

571
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,160
What about

572
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,759
the counterfeit factory must have moved

573
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,480
the hole underneath is blocked.

574
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,640
It's blocked.

575
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,279
Is it possible to blow it up?

576
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,000
The counterfeit factory must be underground.

577
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,000
Otherwise, we wouldn't find counterfeit paper.

578
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,240
It's just that

579
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,559
why?

580
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,319
They suddenly moved.

581
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,799
Director,

582
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,440
what are you going to do now?

583
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,960
Retreat first.

584
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:44,880
Withdraw.

585
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,920
Come on.

586
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:31,880
Are you all right?

587
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
How did you escape?

588
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,559
I'll tell you later.

589
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,559
The military police squadron will arrive soon.

590
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,240
We won't be able to get out of the main entrance.

591
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,599
What can we do

592
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,720
blow the wall up!

593
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,480
To hide

594
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
and escape.

595
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,759
Blow up the wall and hide.

596
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,559
Take cover.

597
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,359
Follow me to retreat.

598
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:00,640
Hurry.

599
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,960
Leave here now!

600
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,679
Go right now!

601
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,719
Go!

602
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,159
Cover Director Jiang.

603
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,920
Split up. See you at the warehouse.

604
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,880
See you in the warehouse.

605
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,119
Come on.

606
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,079
Go right now!

607
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:11,599
We're leaving.

608
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,519
What do you mean?

609
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Sorry.

610
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,159
Although you saved us,

611
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,639
and I'm grateful to you,

612
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,400
but you know too much.

613
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,960
If I were to betray you,

614
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,280
I would wait till now

615
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,599
you really think

616
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,480
that I would believe

617
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,119
you are just an ordinary traitor?

618
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,320
You can lie to Zuo Shuangtao,

619
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,000
but you can't fool me.

620
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,599
I should not have saved you.

621
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,320
There're so many things you shouldn't do.

622
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,760
You shouldn't join our operation.

623
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,320
You shouldn't have married Zuo Shuangtao.

624
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,639
But I won't regret it.

625
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,880
For the woman I love,

626
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
Is worth doing.

627
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,039
Director Jiang, why are you

628
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,400
what you can do

629
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,480
for your beloved woman?

630
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,559
Stop!

631
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,079
Don't move!

632
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,239
Do you think we will believe you?

633
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,840
How did Xiaowu die?

634
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,920
How could the Japanese see through our plan?

635
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,719
If Chen Jia Ping really wants to betray us,

636
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,920
why did he save us out?

637
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,719
He was trying to save you.

638
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,480
Of course I only want to save my wife.

639
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,000
Who wants to save you jerks?

640
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,960
What is it?

641
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,880
Where is Director Jiang?

642
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,239
Ask him then.

643
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,840
Why would you ask me?

644
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,719
Are you going to tell me or not?

645
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,440
If you don't tell me,

646
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,400
I'll give you a shot.

647
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,360
Put the gun down

648
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,480
put down the guns, everyone!

649
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,840
Let him go.

650
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,199
Why not?

651
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:05,960
I believed him.

652
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,880
You believe Chen Jiaping?

653
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,000
He is a traitor.

654
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,320
I believe in Zuo Shuangtao.

655
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,039
So I believe what she believes.

656
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,079
And leave with Chen Jiaping.

657
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,639
Take care of him.

658
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,920
Don't get involved in our business anymore.

659
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,960
Don't worry.

660
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,840
That won't happen again.

661
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,920
Do you know why Jiang Zhaoguo

662
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,159
why Jiang Zhaoguo wouldn't allow you to participate in the final operation?

663
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
Why?

664
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,480
That's because the copper coin

665
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,559
would end up with the Japanese.

666
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,719
He thought he could find the copper plate

667
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,519
he could find this copper plate in the counterfeit factory.

668
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,239
But he didn't want you to know it.

669
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,400
Where do you think

670
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,400
the counterfeit factory?

671
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,719
I have no clue now.

672
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,320
What's up

673
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,119
who exactly are you?

674
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,960
What? Who am I?

675
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,719
That's because he had

676
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,119
he had the same suspicion as me

677
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,639
that's why I wanted to kill you.

678
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,079
Can it be...

679
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,840
You're from the other side?

680
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,320
You are not my type.

681
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,760
It's me.

682
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,039
Your husband.

683
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,119
Just remember that.

684
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,119
I guess you won't say any more.

685
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,559
Just one day I'm scared

686
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,679
you aren't even my husband.

687
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,719
What about other things?

688
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,039
I can't guarantee that.

689
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,800
But this is the only thing

690
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,760
I absolutely guarantee that

691
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,280
mr. Jiang,

692
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,159
I prepared ice cubes and whiskey for you.

693
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,119
Thank you.

694
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Mr. Jiang is really resourceful.

695
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,119
He was able to find the location of our underground factory.

696
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,400
I think it's you

697
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,679
probably you two.

698
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,119
Da Hua Hotel. I've been exposed.

699
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,280
Today,

700
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,239
I made such a detailed plan,

701
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,000
but it failed to succeed in the end.

702
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,960
I like to have an open and frank

703
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,760
with Mr. Jiang.

704
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,039
Mr. Jiang can stay here for a while.

705
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,480
We will prepare for your

706
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,760
as you need.

707
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:55,800
Oh, right.

708
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,360
There is a suit in the room.

709
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
No need for the suit.

710
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,679
This suit

711
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,599
It's good.

712
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,119
Alcohol/Liquor

713
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,280
I will drink,

714
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,800
but that doesn't mean I'll negotiate with you

715
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,639
without my cooperation.

716
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,000
We can talk about

717
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,320
about the future.

718
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,559
However,

719
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,039
I have something to ask you.

720
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,400
Please tell me.

721
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,960
Where did this labor card come from?

722
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,840
It was forged.

723
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,119
We have checked it.

724
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,880
That the labor card is real.

725
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,639
Every labor card has a different number.

726
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,119
We traced the number

727
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,719
we found

728
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,119
that this labor card

729
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,320
came from Taihe Trading Firm.

730
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,360
We have people in Chongqing.

731
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,639
We got information

732
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:48,840
a military commander named Five of Hearts

733
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,960
he lurked in Taihe's trading house.

734
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,639
The Five of Hearts

735
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,960
Is given to you by the Five of Hearts, right?

736
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,679
I don't know what Taihe Trading Firm

737
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,400
mr. Jiang,

738
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,039
at least we gave you a decent head.

739
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,360
I hope you'll show me a decent thing, too.

740
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,639
We can hold off

741
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,639
discuss it for a while.

742
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,360
But you must give me an explanation

743
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,360
on this matter.

744
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,199
Otherwise,

745
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,760
everyone would be disgraced.

746
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,039
The counterfeit factory has been moved

747
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,559
the operation got nothing.

748
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,159
The military has suffered a great loss.

749
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,119
I might be implicated too.

750
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:44,719
In addition,

751
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,000
zuo Shuangtao already suspected me.

752
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,280
Wang Dapu is the one

753
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,000
bronze sculptor and financial expert,

754
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,159
he participated in the printing and issuing of the coins.

755
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,320
His real identity

756
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,280
whose identity was Dayan

757
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,400
after stealing the copper coin,

758
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,960
and fled to Shanghai.

759
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,679
Sources said he was captured by the Japanese.

760
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,440
Contact the organization if you have any new information.

761
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:29,760
Class.

762
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,440
Today we have invited a special expert
