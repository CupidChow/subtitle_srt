1
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,480
I've stayed here longer

2
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,480
for longer than you.

3
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,599
I've only seen one enter.

4
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,799
And have never seen them leave.

5
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,840
Don't be delusional.

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,519
Escape with me.

7
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,200
There's a chance for you to survive.

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,359
I'll think about it.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,879
There's nothing to think about.

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
You can only wait for your death if you stay here.

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
You are right.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,439
What good will it do

13
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,159
If I ran out with you?

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
What benefit do you want?

15
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,199
Give me the money.

16
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,800
I saved your life.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,840
And I need to pay you!

18
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,759
Of course you need to pay me.

19
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,719
First of all, I don't need to do that.

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,039
Now I know your secret,

21
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,919
I have to run with you.

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,159
Second,

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,919
you forgot the most important thing.

24
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,159
Your keys

25
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,879
It's not enough.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,039
Where's the last key?

27
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,520
Without that key,

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
no matter how many doors you open,

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,000
you can't get out of here.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,439
That key.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,199
He doesn't hang it around his waist.

32
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,039
Is always next to his private key.

33
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,879
In his left trouser pocket.

34
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,360
Are you sure you have the ability to get the key?

35
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,039
I'm really not sure.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,039
Tell me how much you can give me first.

37
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,800
How many do you want?

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,360
One thousand.

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
I don't have that much money.

40
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,599
Aren't you wasting your time here?

41
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,319
Why don't you go out

42
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,120
where are you going?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,199
It's better to stay here

44
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,400
and make a living.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
800 then.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,639
All my possessions.

47
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,960
What about

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
do you know that key?

49
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,599
His nose.

50
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,280
Sir, I didn't cut it.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,400
I am not that cruel.

52
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,879
He said he didn't.

53
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,199
He does have

54
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,120
Indeed there is

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
he has knives.

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,039
Really?

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,759
Sir.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,199
This man is insane.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,879
Is this a knife?

60
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,240
This is the one I usually trim my nails with.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
This one is fine.

62
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,560
Yes, sir.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,599
You can't trust him.

64
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,280
Sir,

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,520
please help me find justice, sir.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,639
Please help me.

67
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,199
Is this a knife?

68
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,560
Look at this.

69
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,280
But your nose is still on your face.

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Are you fooling me?

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,159
Are you courting death?

72
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,400
Don't.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,159
Let me help you.

74
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,000
Officer.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Dream on.

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,000
That...

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
You said he

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
to pick people's eyes

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,319
bite your ears?

80
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,920
I had a dream just now.

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,759
It's so real!

82
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,920
Behave yourself.

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,839
I'll kill you if you make any more trouble.

84
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,199
Sir.

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,639
Sir.

86
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,639
Treat him well.

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,920
Officer.

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,519
Sorry to disturb your rest.

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,160
Sorry.

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,279
And get along well.

91
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,759
No, I won't.

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,920
The key is divided into three parts.

93
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,839
The length of the key

94
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,839
Is equal to the length of your index finger.

95
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,360
The length of Keyi

96
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,279
the length of the first joint

97
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,720
of the first joint of the index finger

98
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,120
and the third part,

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,360
the serrated parts are square.

100
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
With grooves on all three sides.

101
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Of your first knuckle

102
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,000
Is one-third of the length of your first knuckle

103
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,920
don't worry. I have it all noted.

104
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
Don't be happy too early.

105
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,000
What's up

106
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,560
the materials to make keys

107
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,759
to make the key.

108
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey.

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,639
There are so many hinges on this bed.

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,879
On the bed?

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,839
Do you really think the materials I made earlier

112
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,519
every time it was a success?

113
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,000
What we can use now

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,920
It's not that they're not thick enough.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
Otherwise it would turn rusty.

116
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
He used wood.

117
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,480
The wood is too brittle.

118
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,040
It can't bear the force.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,720
This should do.

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,879
It's made of peach core wood.

121
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,000
Is definitely hard enough.

122
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,160
If you carve it following the wood pattern,

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,759
that won't be a big problem.

124
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,439
Mr. Yamashita,

125
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,879
I'll go home then.

126
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,439
Now that we're getting married,

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,839
don't call me Mr. Yamashita.

128
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Alright.

129
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,759
Press conference tonight

130
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,720
with your interview.

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
You must be tired too.

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
Go home and have a rest.

133
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,160
Alright.

134
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,279
The copper coin is in Wang Dapu's hands.

135
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,800
He was eager to get out,

136
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
he must have given the copper engraving to his superior.

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,839
As long as we follow him,

138
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,240
we'd find the copper plate.

139
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
It's really surprising that

140
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,480
jiang Zhao would do such a thing.

141
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,639
I think

142
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,360
you don't know him.

143
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,959
Don't worry.

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,040
I will convince him.

145
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,720
By the way,

146
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
did Yamashita tell you about Plan Shan?

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,320
Not really.

148
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,000
But Fujita, the driver back there, told me

149
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,159
he's doing something great

150
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,200
for the Japanese empire.

151
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,679
What about you?

152
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,279
What are your plans for the future?

153
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,120
If she really wants to marry Yamashita,

154
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,080
I've already made up my mind.

155
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,279
Have you brought the thing?

156
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,759
Don't worry. It is colorless and odourless.

157
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,960
Is the poison enough?

158
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,639
We can even poison a horse.

159
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,679
Eunuch Tanaka promised me

160
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,399
with Mr. Jiang alone to

161
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,639
you still have the dress?

162
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,200
How could you frame Chen Jia Ping?

163
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,360
You came to me for this?

164
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,200
Why?

165
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,399
This is politics.

166
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,559
You don't understand.

167
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,159
I don't know politics.

168
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,919
But I do know a person.

169
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,960
He should have minimum integrity and conscience.

170
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,360
In any case

171
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
you should never frame

172
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,159
the one who once helped you.

173
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,360
Zuo Shuangtao asked you to come, right?

174
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Chen Jiaping saved my life

175
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,879
after you returned to Chongqing,

176
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,639
I was too narrow-minded

177
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,120
I would have died

178
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,559
If it wasn't for Chen Jiaping.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
You should have told me earlier

180
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,879
chen Jia Ping was held in the detention center by the Japanese.

181
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
Only if you change your confession,

182
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,120
can you save him out.

183
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:37,960
Alright.

184
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,120
I promise you that

185
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,000
you need to tell Ueda

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,120
that Zhao An gave you the labor license.

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Zhao An is the real five of hearts.

188
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,799
If you want to frame Zhao An,

189
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm afraid my confession alone

190
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,840
by my confession alone.

191
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,679
They have another plan.

192
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,080
You just have to say that.

193
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,200
Just do it as the last favor.

194
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,080
Last thing?

195
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,919
What do you mean?

196
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,200
When are you going to look for Neitian?

197
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,519
At noon then.

198
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,639
Every day at noon,

199
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,519
ueda will return to the Military Police Headquarters.

200
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,919
I'll see you this afternoon.

201
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,679
Come see me in the afternoon.

202
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,080
I see the mung bean cake of Xing Hua Lou is available again.

203
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
I want to buy some to share with you.

204
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,639
Uchida,

205
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,480
allow you to come to me again and again?

206
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,639
This is Military Police Headquarters anyway.

207
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,200
You won't be able to escape, right?

208
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,440
Right?

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
Right.

210
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,120
This is Military Police Headquarters.

211
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,159
There's no escape.

212
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,200
Do you still remember

213
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,159
we took a picture together?

214
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,600
You were wearing the same dress that day.

215
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,840
The weather that day

216
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
was also good.

217
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,279
Miss Cold Dew.

218
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,120
What a coincidence.

219
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,919
You are also here.

220
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,919
Oh, right.

221
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,039
Congratulations.

222
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,759
For what?

223
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,399
What do you mean?

224
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,039
You already saw it.

225
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,919
Did you promise him?

226
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,039
Tell me. Have you promised him?

227
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,759
Yesterday they said you would be executed.

228
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,679
If I don't agree,

229
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,360
who exactly is he?

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
All I know is that Ueda is helping him.

231
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,519
He is very powerful.

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
Why didn't I think of it?

233
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
The warrior under the mountain

234
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,159
he's the one behind Shan Plan.

235
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,080
He's...

236
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,919
What are you doing?

237
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,919
You've already bought the mung bean cakes.

238
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,879
What's this?

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,159
Give it to me.

240
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,279
What is it?

241
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,840
Let me have a look.

242
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,480
Give me that.

243
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,679
What's this?

244
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,120
Give it to me.

245
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,200
It's poison, right?

246
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,159
Are you trying to poison me?

247
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,559
You want to sprinkle it on the mung bean cake

248
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,080
and let me eat it to poison me, right?

249
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,759
Yes

250
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,600
I wanted to poison you.

251
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,200
But not only that,

252
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,759
I'll eat mung bean cake with you,

253
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,120
I'll die with you!

254
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,000
Are you out of your mind?

255
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm not crazy.

256
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,960
I know what Martial Master Yamashita is capable of.

257
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,519
He won't let you off

258
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,200
he won't let me off either.

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,879
He will use you as a hostage.

260
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,840
We will never

261
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,879
the two of us will never

262
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,240
can never get rid of him.

263
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
You must be crazy.

264
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
I can't die, you know?

265
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,159
I have a mission.

266
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,480
I need to live well.

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
I can't die with you.

268
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,559
Do you still live like that?

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,759
Please get me out of here.

270
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,360
I have to get out of here.

271
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,080
Martial Master Yamashita is in control of Shan Project.

272
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,759
He loves you so much.

273
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,279
There must be a way

274
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,120
to release me.

275
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,799
You mean that

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to really marry Yamashita?

277
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,440
In exchange for your freedom.

278
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,759
If we are still going to be together,

279
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,120
would you

280
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,679
so make a little sacrifice, okay?

281
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,080
Do you mean that

282
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
to let those dirty hands

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,519
touch me again.

284
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,279
And defile me?

285
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,399
Cold Dew, listen to me.

286
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,159
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Every word you said

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,360
Is an insult to me

289
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,720
and our love.

290
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,600
Please.

291
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,559
Please.

292
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,960
For the last time.

293
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,120
One last time, okay?

294
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,679
This time.

295
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,600
Then what am I?

296
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,559
After I leave,

297
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,200
I...

298
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,480
After I ruined Shan Plan,

299
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,480
you and I are the same.

300
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,399
You're both heroes.

301
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Hero?

302
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,679
Why do you think I want to be a hero?

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,319
Since you are not helping me,

304
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
I must insist

305
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,960
chen Jiaping is the Five of Hearts.

306
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,119
You are so mean.

307
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,240
Don't you want to help Chen Jia Ping?

308
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't you want to save him?

309
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Alright.

310
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,480
Alright.

311
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,279
Get me out of here first.

312
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,200
I'll get the release order

313
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,960
personally issued by the warrior under the mountain,

314
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,240
I'll change my words right away.

315
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,000
You know what?

316
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,079
The warrior under the mountain

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,240
he treated me gently.

318
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,160
But he's actually a pervert.

319
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,000
We are both adults.

320
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,720
I don't care about that.

321
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,039
You're shameless!

322
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,119
How long before we arrive?

323
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,119
Almost. We'll be there in five minutes.

324
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,079
Stop the car!

325
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,880
Stop the car.

326
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
What's wrong with Captain Zhao?

327
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:04,799
Nothing.

328
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,640
I'll take some water.

329
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Wait for me.

330
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,480
Tang.

331
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,319
I'll talk to the tree trunk.

332
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,599
You go first. Drive quickly.

333
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,880
Captain, we are running out of time.

334
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,519
It is almost time.

335
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,240
It is too late.

336
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,519
I need to talk to the second car.

337
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,519
Follow her.

338
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:41,920
We're going to be late.

339
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,680
Follow her.

340
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,519
Hurry up!

341
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,279
Captain, what's wrong?

342
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,960
Follow me!

343
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Uchida Officer.

344
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,400
Cotton yarn

345
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,759
please convey my thanks to Mr. Underhill.

346
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,319
According to Mr. Yamashita,

347
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,480
this is his first time

348
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,640
and the last time.

349
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,359
Release your enemy.

350
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,799
Since you're giving me such honor,

351
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,640
I'm going to give you a gift as well.

352
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,799
What gift?

353
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,240
Demand a truth,

354
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,799
please tell me.

355
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,200
In fact, Chen Jiaping

356
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,759
Instead of a five of hearts

357
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,359
I intentionally framed him.

358
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,400
Why did you do this?

359
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,240
Because I've heard

360
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,720
I heard that their relationship has been ambiguous.

361
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,119
But to my surprise,

362
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,880
It's not her

363
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
who betrayed me,

364
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,839
but the warrior under the mountain.

365
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,720
So I don't have to frame Chen Family Ping

366
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,319
you were so sure before

367
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,240
but you suddenly changed your words.

368
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,759
Do you think I would believe that?

369
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,519
Does that matter

370
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,440
does that matter to me?

371
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,200
Cold Dew asked me for a favor.

372
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,240
So I told you the truth.

373
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,960
Whether you'll execute Chen Jia Ping in the future

374
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,559
that's your business

375
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,200
If Chen Jiaping isn't the fifth of hearts,

376
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,319
who's the real five of hearts?

377
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,559
Then you

378
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,359
you can only let your men

379
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,519
keep pushing their guns to my head.

380
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,799
I might tell you.

381
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,000
I know.

382
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Mr. Jiang is only pretending to be afraid of death.

383
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,200
The information you told us

384
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
seems to be important,

385
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,599
but you have long been convinced

386
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,839
we couldn't find the formula and the copper plate,

387
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,880
so it doesn't matter to tell us, right?

388
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,559
Who the five of hearts are.

389
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,039
This important information

390
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,519
that you won't tell us.

391
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,920
But don't worry.

392
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,680
I'll find out the truth.

393
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Mr. Jiang,

394
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,839
I'm sorry that we haven't reached a consensus

395
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,559
we can't agree on this.

396
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,240
But if there's regret, there's expectation.

397
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,240
We have ample time ahead of us.

398
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm also looking forward

399
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,519
with Mr. Uchida again.

400
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,599
But I won't give you another chance

401
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,799
put your gun to my head again.

402
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,039
I don't think so.

403
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,359
Where is Zhao An?

404
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,079
I don't know.

405
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,799
Where exactly is Zhao An?

406
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,400
Uchida, I really don't know.

407
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,480
Captain Zhao was in Tang's car the whole time.

408
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,960
I really don't know what Officer Uchida

409
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,039
after he went to the toilet, Captain Zhao asked me to leave.

410
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Then, he wanted to discuss something with Chen Dunhu.

411
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,200
Nothing.

412
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,759
Captain Zhao didn't get in my car.

413
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,599
He asked us to leave quickly.

414
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,359
He got into the car behind him.

415
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,440
I really have no idea

416
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:43,799
uchida Officer.

417
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,799
If we caught someone,

418
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,839
and explain his situation to us.

419
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,519
Look at this.

420
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,519
Bring her here.

421
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,880
Hou Si,

422
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,160
repeat what you told me just now.

423
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,880
Who is the buyer of this batch of cotton yarn?

424
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,079
Mr. Zhou.

425
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,200
Mr. Zhou?

426
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,720
The Tong Body Company

427
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,480
of Du Yuesheng in Chongqing.

428
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,240
Who manages Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai.

429
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,480
It is said that

430
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,920
he allocated a lot of money

431
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,079
to get urgently needed goods

432
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,480
so the buyer is the Chongqing government?

433
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,519
I was just an errand boy.

434
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,519
How did you know about the cotton yarn?

435
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,559
Mr. Zhou told me.

436
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,519
He said that someone in Shanghai

437
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,839
who can buy fine cotton yarn

438
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,359
who is that person?

439
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,039
He didn't say it directly.

440
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,920
But once,

441
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,680
I heard him calling that person.

442
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,759
I heard that he was from Juntong.

443
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,559
What's the code name?

444
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,359
Five of Hearts.

445
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,119
Uchida, Officer.

446
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,799
The one called Chen Gangmu

447
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,000
Is Zhao An's confidant.

448
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,599
Since he's Zhao An's confidant,

449
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,839
don't you know

450
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:15,400
your Captain Zhao is a five-of hearts in the military.

451
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:16,839
That's impossible.

452
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,839
That's impossible.

453
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:18,759
It's impossible that Officer Uchida

454
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,960
he must have known!

455
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,400
I really don't know anything.

456
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,440
Uchida, I really have no idea.

457
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,480
Please trust me.

458
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,039
Tell me then.

459
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,359
Why Mr. Zhou didn't come?

460
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,319
I don't know either

461
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,640
we agreed to gather here at five.

462
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,400
Maybe he found an ambush here in advance

463
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,599
and run away?

464
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
Understood.

465
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,599
I see, Ueda Officer.

466
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,400
Zhao An has tricked us all.

467
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,039
He asked us to continue here on purpose

468
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,400
to distract you

469
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,799
so that he had time to run away.

470
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,000
Officer Uchida, this has nothing to do with me.

471
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,319
I really have no idea.

472
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,240
What you said seems right.

473
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,599
Officer Uchida.

474
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,680
Please spare my life.

475
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
Spare my life.

476
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,240
I'll be your servant in the future.

477
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,440
As long as you don't kill me.

478
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,240
Why won't I think

479
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,160
you and Zhao An are partners.

480
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,400
You'll distract us

481
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,759
to cover him to escape.

482
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,440
He's not here.

483
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,519
I didn't have one.

484
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,039
I don't have any.

485
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,799
Shuyun!

486
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,440
What took you so long?

487
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Something happened.

488
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,119
What's up

489
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,000
why...

490
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,599
Why are you carrying such a big suitcase?

491
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,759
This is everything I own.

492
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,920
What do you mean?

493
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,759
My days with the Japanese

494
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,440
Is completely over.

495
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,480
Thanks to my brilliant mind,

496
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,000
managed to escape.

497
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,759
Otherwise, you won't be able to see me.

498
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,359
Chen Gangmu and the others

499
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,839
they died.

500
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,359
What should we do now?

501
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,359
I'm going to Pudong with you.

502
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,039
We can hide for a while.

503
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,079
And find a way to leave Shanghai.

504
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,839
What about from now on?

505
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,359
Are we going to run away like this all the time?

506
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,880
I can only depend on you now.

507
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,599
You can't let me live like this.

508
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,359
Shuyun.

509
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,759
Trust me.

510
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
The money in the box is enough for us to spend a lifetime.

511
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,279
I'll take you to Hong Kong.

512
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,519
We can buy a big house there.

513
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,079
I'll invest and do business there.

514
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,119
We won't be living a bad life.

515
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,720
And then

516
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,480
I will throw a spectacular wedding for you.

517
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,519
Then you can give me a chubby boy.

518
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,240
The three of us will have

519
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,559
we'll have enough to eat and wear.

520
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,839
To live a good life.

521
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,119
Go to Hong Kong.

522
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,799
Hong Kong!

523
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,119
Screw it!

524
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,200
The Imperial Army, the Japanese...

525
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,960
Piss off.

526
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,839
I've been a Japanese grandson for so many years.

527
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,519
Why should I

528
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,119
I just want to make a lot of money.

529
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,640
And live a normal life.

530
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,400
You can lead a good life with me.

531
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:43,920
Right?

532
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,799
Right.

533
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,160
Shuyun.

534
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,960
You've been suffering with me.

535
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,319
I will make it up to you later.

536
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,720
We'll go to the ferry right now.

537
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,200
Hold on.

538
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,039
What's up

539
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,960
I have something to take.

540
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,200
What are those?

541
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,359
Some of my soft gold and silver

542
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,759
and the cheongsam I just made.

543
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,160
Where are they?

544
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,559
I'm hiding in the ruined temple opposite.

545
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,359
Shu Yun!

546
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,359
Shu Yun.

547
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,039
Come in, Shuyun.

548
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,319
Shuyun.

549
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,839
Come in and save me.

550
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,200
Shu Yun.

551
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,680
Zhao An.

552
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,799
Why are you looking for my wife?

553
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm right here.

554
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,599
Luo Guanqun.

555
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,759
What are you doing here?

556
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,640
My wife is here.

557
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,680
Why can't I be here?

558
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,079
Where's Shuyun?

559
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,359
She's by my side.

560
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,319
Shu Yun.

561
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,440
Shu Yun!

562
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,960
Say something to Captain Zhao.

563
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,599
Don't be scared.

564
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,759
Let the past things stay in the past.

565
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
You did very well today.

566
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,359
Luo Guanqun, you jerk!

567
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,599
You forced Zhang Shuyun.

568
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,720
Shuyun.

569
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,599
Zhao An.

570
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,079
Don't talk nonsense here.

571
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,400
You forced me from the beginning to the end!

572
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,119
Shuyun,

573
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,559
I am sincere to you.

574
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,559
Did you forget how Luo Guanqun hit you?

575
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,000
Zhao An,

576
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,359
you trust no one,

577
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,799
but you trust women.

578
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,519
But being a woman,

579
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,000
lied to you.

580
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,519
You must die.

581
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
He's furious.

582
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,160
Bury him.

583
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,720
Bury him

584
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,079
shu Yun.

585
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
Don't listen to this.

586
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,839
Don't listen to Luo Guanqun's lies.

587
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,920
No matter what you do,

588
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,119
even if he buries me.

589
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,960
Did you hear that, Shu Yun?

590
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,400
Shu Yun!

591
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,319
Luo Guanqun, stop it!

592
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,880
I didn't do that.

593
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,359
Shu Yun did that.

594
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,559
Shu Yun.

595
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,920
He's lying to you, Shu Yun.

596
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,480
Come on.

597
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,759
Luo Guanqun,

598
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,279
release me.

599
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm rich.

600
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,480
I'll give all the money to you.

601
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,799
I'm rich.

602
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,480
Look, there's money inside that box.

603
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,759
Here is the key.

604
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:43,319
Here you are.

605
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,960
Let me throw it up.

606
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,240
Look inside the box, there's money.

607
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Here you go.

608
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,680
Zhao An.

609
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,599
I'd like to see

610
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,359
how much you've made over the years.

611
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,559
Zhao An.

612
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,680
You really never let me down.

613
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,039
Luo Guanqun is here to give you

614
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,519
please

615
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,640
please!

616
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,200
Stop making troubles, Shu Yun!

617
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,759
Please save me, Shu Yun!

618
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,160
Shu Yun, look at the box!

619
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,279
There's my gift for you, Shu Yun.

620
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,039
We saw it together last time.

621
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,920
I want to surprise you!

622
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,559
Look at Shuyun.

623
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,799
This is the gift Captain Zhao bought for you.

624
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,839
How would you like to deal with this?

625
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,720
Brother Qun.

626
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm sorry, Qun.

627
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,920
Please spare my life, Qun.

628
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,599
My Zhao An is done for.

629
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,880
I can't stay in Shanghai anymore.

630
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,319
Leave now.

631
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,519
Brother Qun.

632
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,239
Please spare my life, Qun.

633
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,239
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,480
I shouldn't have sought your position.

635
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,280
I shouldn't have robbed you.

636
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,719
I shouldn't have had feelings for Mrs. Luo.

637
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,920
Please

638
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,320
please spare my life.

639
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,920
Please, Qun.

640
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,039
Zhao An.

641
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,639
You also have today.

642
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,760
You also have today.

643
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,679
You won't end up there too!

644
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,039
Shu Yun!

645
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,280
I truly love you, Shu Yun.

646
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,480
I truly want to take you away.

647
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,360
Break his incantation, break the trap,

648
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,840
lift the barrier of untimely death

649
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,000
and save all grievances.

650
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,599
To purify and light. It's more auspicious.

651
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,559
Break his incantation, break the trap,

652
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,760
and lift the barrier of peaceful death.

653
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,000
Save them.

654
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,559
Zhao An!

655
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,760
On your way to death,

656
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,199
let me see you off.

657
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,920
I'm sincere to Shuyun.

658
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,119
I want to live a good life with you.

659
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,639
I want to take you away.

660
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,000
A big house,

661
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,719
and have babies.

662
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,320
I want to give you a good life.

663
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,679
Get ready!

664
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,079
Manager Luo,

665
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
his subordinates

666
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,840
here are all the men

667
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,559
all the rest are here.

668
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,679
Zhao An colluded with General Jun

669
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,519
do you know the evidence?

670
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,079
Zhao An colluded with General Jun

671
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,840
for a long time.

672
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,280
You must know something about it.

673
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,760
If you have any evidence,

674
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,559
report to me.

675
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,039
If you cover up for this,

676
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,679
the consequences will be the same as his.

677
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,039
A big spoon.

678
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

679
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,920
If they don't tell me,

680
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,639
beat your teeth!

681
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,400
If you don't tell me,

682
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,599
cut out his heart for me!

683
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:49,800
Yes

684
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,119
what about

685
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,960
got it?

686
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,840
If anyone wants to report Zhao An,

687
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,840
I'll give you a chance

688
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,519
I know.

689
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,719
I said that

690
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,079
I also know that

691
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:03,920
I told you.

692
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,840
Me too.

693
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,760
Don't be anxious.

694
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,880
One by one.

695
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:07,960
You go first.

696
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,039
Manager Luo,

697
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,800
where do you think Captain Zhao might have gone?

698
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,199
I don't know.

699
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,400
I think he is dead.

700
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,079
What do you think?

701
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,679
I happened to hear

702
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,000
that Captain Zhao was in his office

703
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,960
planning his escape.

704
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,400
Mr. Luo, don't worry.

705
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,320
I know.

706
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,639
See a lot with your eyes,

707
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,119
put it in your stomach,

708
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,599
but never let it out.

709
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,679
I know that

710
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,360
I know that you helped her.

711
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,519
I remember that.

712
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
By the way, Manager Luo,

713
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,519
have you read the Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou States?

714
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,599
As for Wei,

715
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,039
named Hou Ying

716
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,559
he had big plans

717
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,920
but he didn't show any remorse.

718
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,039
Until I met Lord Xinling,

719
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,320
before I met him.

720
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,239
And finally offered Lord Xinling

721
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,000
to steal the talisman and save Zhao.

722
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,440
And protected Wei.

723
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,840
What do you mean?

724
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:23,559
Nothing.

725
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,920
Nothing.

726
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,800
If you're interested to read the Chronicles of

727
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,039
the Chronicles of the States of Eastern Zhou,

728
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,960
I can lend it to you anytime.

729
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,519
Qian Xiucai?

730
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,039
What

731
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,400
what's your real name?

732
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,599
Qian Chengyi

733
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,039
the sun rises and a pawn goes by.

734
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,320
Who finally achieved one thing.

735
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,360
Manager Luo,

736
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,880
what a surprise!

737
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,679
Zhao An is the real five of hearts.

738
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,039
He's right.

739
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,840
I didn't expect the five of hearts would be so well hidden.

740
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,360
Zhao An fled to escape.

741
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,960
It proves Ping's innocence

742
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,280
jiang Zhao Guo changed his confession.

743
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,840
Five of Hearts isn't Chen Jia Ping

744
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,599
do you think it's strange?

745
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,639
How is it odd?

746
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
Hasn't he always hated

747
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,440
that Jia Ping and Han Lu were close?

748
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,800
That's why she framed Han Lu.

749
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,719
Since Han Lu also came to your rescue,

750
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,039
he could only tell the truth.

751
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,599
Right?

752
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,000
Five of hearts.

753
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,280
And four of clubs.

754
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,000
Do you think Officer Uchida will be able

755
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,880
from Uchida this time?

756
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
The evidence is complete.

757
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,679
However,

758
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,199
It's hard to tell the Japanese.

759
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,199
It's hard to say

760
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,159
It's hard to say.

761
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,159
There hasn't been any news

762
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,719
there's no news from Jia Ping

763
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,400
were locked up in that horrible place?

764
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,840
I don't know what could have happened.

765
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,519
What books are you reading?

766
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,599
The Japanese even caught

767
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,480
such a loyal traitor.

768
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,039
You're blind.

769
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,199
At first,

770
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,079
I wanted to climb over the wall.

771
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,320
But later I found

772
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,119
It was impossible.

773
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,679
Did you see the whole building clearly?

774
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,480
The first floor is the range of Japanese activities.

775
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,320
There's a dining room on the far right.

776
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,519
There's a back door leading to the outside.

777
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,719
We have to pass through the second floor to get to the first floor

778
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,239
we'll have to pass three iron gates first

779
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,159
we need to pass four more

780
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,079
to escape.

781
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,960
This is the escape route.

782
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,559
Remember that.

783
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,960
The show starts at 8 p.m.

784
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,760
There are eight shows in total.

785
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,360
If you want to leave,

786
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,519
you have to escape before the end of the show.

787
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,360
you have to escape before the end of the show.
