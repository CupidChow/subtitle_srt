1
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,040
You are so confident.

2
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,560
Because every woman

3
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
falls in love with a man who can protect her.

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,719
What if I don't need your protection?

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,799
I would be a little disappointed.

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,799
To give the letter to Luo Guanqun,

7
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,640
or Zhao An.

8
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,400
This is not protection.

9
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,719
You are threatening me.

10
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,359
The threat is only temporary.

11
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,799
When you fall in love with me,

12
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,000
you will find that

13
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,360
you need me to threaten you.

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,879
It's fine.

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
I know that

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
you need time to accept all these.

17
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,319
However,

18
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,879
we have plenty of time.

19
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,479
How to curse

20
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,479
how to curse.

21
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,319
Useless trash.

22
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,439
Idiot.

23
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,240
Such an important list

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,479
was robbed of that.

25
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,240
What's the use of writing

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,280
what's the use?

27
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,680
Sorry for my incompetence.

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,479
I hope that

29
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,560
could give me another chance to redeem myself.

30
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,080
Another chance?

31
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,280
You can redeem yourself

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,879
here are the Xuan paper you asked for.

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,280
I'm wearing perfume today.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,039
Repellent.

35
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm really old now.

36
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,520
And I can't tell

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
and perfume, right?

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,080
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
We're leaving.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,840
Manager Luo.

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,919
Mrs. Luo, you are also here?

42
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:55,879
Captain Zhao,

43
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,639
what a rare visitor.

44
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,319
You know fashion.

45
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,719
Smell it.

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,719
The fragrance in my room belongs to toilet water

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,360
or perfume?

48
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,759
How can I understand?

49
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,040
You have to ask Mrs. Luo

50
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,480
I don't know what you're talking about

51
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,600
I'll leave now.

52
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Captain Zhao.

53
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
What can I do for you?

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,519
Chief Chen

55
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,959
a double-edged sword

56
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,160
what's the matter?

57
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,199
Captain Zhao wants to invite you to Huayou Restaurant.

58
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,240
Captain Zhao.

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,240
Thank you for your kindness,

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,319
but I'm busy.

61
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,560
I can't.

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Manager Luo is also here?

63
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,639
He asked me to bring you a message.

64
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
That you must go there.

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Why do you have to eat?

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll know when you get there.

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,399
Miss Zuo, someone is looking for you.

68
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,680
Who's looking for me?

69
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,480
Mr. Chen's colleague.

70
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,800
Big scoop?

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Big scoop?

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,639
Miss Zuo,

73
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,480
chen Jiaping asked me to take you to Huayou Restaurant for dinner.

74
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,959
What's the matter? Having lunch?

75
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,480
I'm not sure about that.

76
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,879
We should go.

77
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,079
Guoguo.

78
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,000
Why are you here?

79
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,439
You asked me to come.

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,800
I didn't ask you to come.

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,560
Enough.

82
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,720
You are already here.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,839
Don't talk so much.

84
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,800
Sit down.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,439
Drink and eat.

86
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:09,920
This way.

87
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,439
Please.

88
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,199
This way.

89
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,600
Come, this way.

90
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,240
He is coming.

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,600
He's coming.

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,399
This way.

93
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,360
This is the business gathering.

94
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
Captain Zhao.

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,279
We're waiting for you.

96
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,519
For you two.

97
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,040
Come on.

98
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,759
Sorry, everyone.

99
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,920
Sorry, I'm late.

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,639
Come on.

101
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,519
Miss Zuo, sit here.

102
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,680
Sit there.

103
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,639
Sorry,

104
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,639
sorry, guys.

105
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,319
Then

106
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,680
let's eat and drink then.

107
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,319
I want to sit here...

108
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,879
Well, Captain Zhao.

109
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Would you like to say something?

110
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,560
Everyone,

111
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,480
today I have prepared a humble meal

112
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,639
It's mainly because I've been neglected

113
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,040
In the work recently

114
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,920
sorry to Ms. Zuo and Chief Chen

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,879
I am here to

116
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,040
I am really sorry.

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,079
Don't.

118
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,000
Captain Zhao.

119
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,519
It's all for work.

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,199
Don't take it to heart.

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,279
I must take it seriously.

122
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,519
Miss Zuo.

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,439
I'll punish you with one cup of wine.

124
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,079
Alright.

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
So generous, Captain Zhao?

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,120
That...

127
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,839
Anyway, the misunderstanding is cleared.

128
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,639
We're a family.

129
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,560
Don't take it to heart.

130
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,439
Eat this, OK?

131
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,000
This is only the first drink.

132
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,079
Everyone's waiting for the second one.

133
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,079
Sit down.

134
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,399
That's the punishment for the second drink.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
For the second drink.

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,879
We will

137
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,759
the two of you

138
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,839
are affectionate every day,

139
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,639
love each other dearly

140
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,680
everyone is envious and jealous.

141
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you want to punish?

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,480
Punish them.

143
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,839
Alright. Punish me.

144
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,480
How about this?

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,639
I'm not that drunk either.

146
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,120
She's worse than me when it comes to drinking.

147
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,920
I replaced her.

148
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,439
Alright.

149
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,399
To protect him like this?

150
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,240
Right.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,399
Great!

152
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,639
This third glass of wine is what you're looking forward to the most.

153
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,439
It's your wedding celebration.

154
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Captain Zhao.

155
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,040
Sincerity.

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,360
I appreciate your kindness.

158
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
However

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,360
here's the thing.

160
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
Guoguo and I...

161
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
We've discussed this issue

162
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
before.

163
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,559
And I don't plan to get married recently.

164
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,559
We'll talk in two years.

165
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,919
Marriage will deepen our friendship.

166
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
You two love each other deeply.

167
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,720
As time goes by, speed comes.

168
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,279
Right?

169
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,039
Please pour the wine.

170
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,360
Don't.

171
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,000
This...

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,360
This will be a serious joke.

173
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,120
Captain Zhao

174
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,320
section Chief Chen

175
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,519
are you still angry with me?

176
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,639
To be honest, Miss Zuo,

177
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,879
at the very beginning,

178
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,600
I doubted your relationship.

179
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,679
And pretended to be a couple.

180
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,840
But now

181
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,840
you guys told me to pretend to be

182
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,799
I don't believe it.

183
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,840
Would you believe me?

184
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
No, I don't.

185
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Captain Zhao,

186
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,919
you haven't even asked me about it.

187
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,080
I also think it's a little hasty

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,559
for us to get married.

189
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,440
That's right.

190
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,159
Guoguo is not ready to marry me.

191
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,320
Shuangtao is a girl.

192
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,799
It's normal for girls to be reserved.

193
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,960
If she's not willing to marry you,

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,480
why did she come all the way to Shanghai?

195
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,240
Right?

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,000
Double peach.

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,799
I know you.

198
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,960
You want a proposal, right?

199
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,799
You really don't know me.

200
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
Look at this flat.

201
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,399
They don't have money,

202
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,799
that's not your career.

203
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
This is so far from my requirements.

204
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,639
I won't marry him now.

205
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,480
The thing I regret the most

206
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
moving to Shanghai with you.

207
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,080
Look at that

208
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,720
the Shanghai Beach

209
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,759
Is full of young talents, right?

210
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm under a lot of pressure.

211
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,159
Family is peaceful.

212
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,159
Only by having a family can you have a successful career.

213
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,320
Also,

214
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,120
who Ms. Zuo's uncle is.

215
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,320
If you can marry Miss Zuo,

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,240
the entire Taihe Trading Firm

217
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,799
can increase.

218
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,720
In the future,

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,240
will prosper.

220
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,840
So you have to

221
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,679
get married.

222
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,440
Come on.

223
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,159
Come and propose.

224
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,679
Come here.

225
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,919
Propose to him?

226
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,480
Congratulations.

227
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,639
Congratulations.

228
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,200
Congratulations.

229
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,919
Congratulations.

230
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,879
If you agree to marry Chen Jiaping,

231
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,679
I'll reveal your secret.

232
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,840
Congratulations. Congratulations.

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,159
What are they doing?

234
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,759
What are they talking about?

235
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,360
Captain Zhao.

236
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,399
Getting married or not

237
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,320
It seems to be between them.

238
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,360
It is a blessing

239
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,080
that would be a good thing.

240
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,240
But now it seems that

241
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
zuo Shuangtao doesn't want to.

242
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,279
Aren't you imposing

243
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,919
forcing him.

244
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,480
That's right.

245
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,159
Men wouldn't just play for a few years

246
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,559
like that today,

247
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,799
like this tomorrow.

248
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
Why ask her to get married so early?

249
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,159
She is depriving her of the right to make another choice.

250
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,720
The main thing is

251
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,360
the decision of parents

252
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,960
right?

253
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,240
The words of a match-maker

254
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,240
although we pursue a peaceful new life,

255
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,039
but as for marriage,

256
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,840
to get married.

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
Right, Luo?

258
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,919
Jiaping.

259
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,000
Usually,

260
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,399
you call me brother.

261
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,320
As the saying goes,

262
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,399
the elder brother is the father.

263
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,480
I can help you with that.

264
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
You're not just my brother.

265
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,240
You want to be my father?

266
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,320
But I don't agree.

267
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,879
Don't try to take advantage of me.

268
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,679
I can handle this.

269
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,600
But your parents are not good enough.

270
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
You won't look down

271
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
of Luo Guanqun's position?

272
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,720
Is my status enough?

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,320
Officer Kimura.

274
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,080
Uncle.

275
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,120
Your aunt called me

276
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,200
and told me that you came to Shanghai.

277
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,559
But I was in Suzhou

278
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,679
business in Suzhou these days.

279
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,679
And I won't have time to take care of you.

280
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,919
Thank you, Manager Luo.

281
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,799
Thank you for coming.

282
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,840
Thank you for your presence.

283
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,679
Have a seat.

284
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,480
Please, Officer Kimura.

285
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
Have a seat.

286
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,720
Have a seat.

287
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,279
You're Chen Jiaping?

288
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,240
Boss Yu,

289
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,960
no, Uncle.

290
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,639
You should've

291
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
If you're coming.

292
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,759
I'll pick you up in advance.

293
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,679
Don't stand on ceremony.

294
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,759
I went to see Chief Kimura today

295
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,240
that I discussed your marriage

296
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,080
that's great news.

297
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,360
So we came here uninvited.

298
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,919
A good thing?

299
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,320
It's a good thing indeed.

300
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
Jiaping,

301
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,159
look, Officer Mu Cun is on your side.

302
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,399
Miss Zuo is joined by Boss Yu.

303
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,519
It's able to withstand the orders of parents

304
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,519
yes

305
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,000
china-Japan friendship

306
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,240
and East Asia prosper together.

307
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,720
In the future.

308
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,840
Chen Jiaping is an outstanding talent under the new government

309
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,480
left Shuangtao.

310
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,240
Is the niece of our business tycoon Yu.

311
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,039
The marriage of the two of you

312
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,759
Is the model of a peaceful new life.

313
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,840
That's right.

314
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,559
Is of great significance to us.

315
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,600
Left Double-peach.

316
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,679
Chen Jiaping,

317
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,360
If you two don't agree,

318
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,039
It will become an anti-peace movement.

319
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,080
That's right.

320
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,919
On your wedding day,

321
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,039
I'll invite the commander in chief

322
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,120
the Commander of the Mountain

323
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,759
to make this wedding

324
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,799
Into a ceremony of China-Japan goodwill.

325
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Great!

326
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Come on, let's drink together.

327
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,080
Cheers.

328
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,879
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

329
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,120
How about this?

330
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,600
Officer Kimura.

331
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,679
Thank you for your promotion and support.

332
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,840
A toast to you alone.

333
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:21,960
Alright.

334
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
And on behalf of Guoguo,

335
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,879
she's not a good drinker.

336
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll propose another toast to you on her behalf.

337
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,519
Uncle.

338
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:31,919
This is our first meeting.

339
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,240
A toast to you.

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,639
And also,

341
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
luo, Captain Zhao,

342
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,799
and everyone here,

343
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,559
to everyone here.

344
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,320
How about this?

345
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,039
I will finish this. Okay?

346
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,120
No need for that.

347
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,519
Don't drink too much.

348
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,639
Don't delay our work.

349
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,600
Jia Ping.

350
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,240
Jiaping.

351
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,960
Get married?

352
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,840
But I think

353
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,240
they forced me to get married.

354
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,159
It's not that simple.

355
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,039
Marriage?

356
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,480
What's Chen Jiaping's attitude?

357
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,519
He is drunk.

358
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,759
I don't know if it's real.

359
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
If what you said is true,

360
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,320
Including Kenzo Kimura, Crown Group Luo,

361
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,039
and even Sunin are pressuring you.

362
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,840
This isn't Zhao An's only idea.

363
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:45,639
That's right.

364
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
But under those circumstances,

365
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
I could neither accept

366
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,639
or refuse.

367
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,799
I can only keep drinking

368
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,799
and drink more.

369
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,679
To buy more time.

370
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,240
So, what are you going to do next?

371
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,000
This is a great opportunity for us.

372
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,720
What do you mean?

373
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,240
If the warrior from the mountain attends your wedding,

374
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
we can carry out the assassination

375
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,120
and retrieve the secret letter.

376
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,120
I could directly go to Tao Dachun

377
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,279
on the day of the assassination.

378
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,240
This will ensure

379
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,399
can escape safely.

380
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,200
What about Chen Jiaping?

381
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,720
He'll be identified as his accomplice in the assassination.

382
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,799
The Japanese won't spare him.

383
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,159
He is a traitor.

384
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,200
Don't you hate traitors the most?

385
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,919
Why are you worried about him?

386
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm not.

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,039
I think it's strange

388
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,879
that they suddenly forced us to get married.

389
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,840
It feels like they have other purposes.

390
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,440
Then we should play along.

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,000
What if Chen Jia Ping doesn't agree to the marriage?

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,440
Then force it.

393
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,440
Since Zhao An and Luo Guanqun

394
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,200
and Yu Shanren,

395
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,639
so many people want to facilitate your wedding.

396
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,360
What are you afraid of?

397
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,399
You use both carrot and stick,

398
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
until he agrees.

399
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,039
Captain Liu,

400
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,319
what's your motive

401
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,559
to assassinate Prince An?

402
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,160
I told you that

403
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,960
he has the secret letter we need.

404
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,680
But I heard

405
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,000
the martial man under the mountain secretly colluded with

406
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,599
they colluded with each other

407
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,799
to smuggle drugs to the areas under the Kuomintang control.

408
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,920
Later due to the uneven distribution of the spoils,

409
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,240
he planned to publish the official's name

410
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,640
to the press.

411
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,720
But getting back the secret letter is not a big deal.

412
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,599
But keeping this official is more important.

413
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,160
You're all grown up now.

414
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,920
Who asked you to find out?

415
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,000
I feel sorry for Hu and Da Xuan.

416
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,920
Our mission is to complete it.

417
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,119
You don't need to ask for other things.

418
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,680
I will.

419
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,119
Just regard me as avenging Hu and Da Xuan.

420
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,319
Alright.

421
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,759
And that Gao Fang who threatened you

422
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,160
kill him as soon as possible,

423
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,799
otherwise, he'll ruin our plan.

424
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,839
If we really get married,

425
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,559
If I assassinate Yamashita in the wedding,

426
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,000
even if I escape,

427
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,880
chen Jiaping will also be dead

428
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,680
who's that?

429
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,160
I am Zuo Shuangtao.

430
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Miss Zuo.

431
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,079
How do you know I live here?

432
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,079
You left the cafe.

433
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,119
I followed you.

434
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,359
What?

435
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,519
You don't want me there?

436
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,000
It's not like that.

437
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,000
Please come in.

438
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,839
You're here at this late hour.

439
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,359
What's the matter?

440
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,039
A person you like came to you.

441
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,160
Isn't it stupid

442
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,599
to ask this?

443
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,319
No, it's not.

444
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,480
My place is a bit messy.

445
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,839
You usually drink coffee.

446
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,200
Right.

447
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,079
Can you make me a cup?

448
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,000
Of course not.

449
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,839
Do you want to live alone?

450
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,440
Right.

451
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,079
I want to live alone.

452
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,200
When did you start to like me?

453
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,519
I started to fall in love with you

454
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,160
did you tell others that they like me?

455
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,720
Nothing.

456
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,440
I don't have any friends.

457
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,039
The water temperature of 93 degrees Celsius

458
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,119
Is the best temperature to make coffee.

459
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,039
The kettle was boiled half an hour ago.

460
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,079
It's one hundred degrees.

461
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,039
The temperature is around 20 degrees.

462
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,440
The speed of hot water cooling

463
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,480
Is in direct proportion to the temperature of the hot water in the air.

464
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,759
So the temperature of the water is just right.

465
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,680
This is the latest communication signal

466
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,559
that we received at our Shanghai communication station.

467
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
The identity of the sender is unclear.

468
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,359
Please.

469
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,039
Sit over there.

470
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
If I marry Chen Jiaping,

471
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,039
will you expose me?

472
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,480
I know what your purpose is.

473
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,920
I won't give you the letter.

474
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,319
I saw a telegraph transmitter

475
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,559
there's a telegraph transmitter in your cabinet.

476
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,000
It is a scrap.

477
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:00,839
It's useless.

478
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,400
But you can already fix it.

479
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,880
Why are you asking these?

480
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,359
You not only fixed it,

481
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,759
you also used it to send telegrams.

482
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,799
I have no idea what you're talking about.

483
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,000
You sent an encrypted telegram to Juntong communication station.

484
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,799
Isn't that right?

485
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,920
I don't have one.

486
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
Your phone is no. 45A3-8

487
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,039
Was captured from Juntong.

488
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,599
Because of the special habit of transmitter,

489
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,160
caused abnormal wear of the telegraph key.

490
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,480
So the reporter could identify the message

491
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,519
the message

492
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,000
was sent from the 45A3-8.

493
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,240
Who on earth are you?

494
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
How do you know all these?

495
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,079
Answer my question first.

496
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,599
What if I don't?

497
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,559
I don't think you'll like the result of not answering.

498
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,480
All right.

499
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,799
I admit that

500
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,720
I sent the telegram.

501
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,839
But how come you had a telegram?

502
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,079
Could it be

503
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,240
you're from Juntong?

504
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,920
Don't you know

505
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,960
what they do?

506
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,119
Their men are with Juntong.

507
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,400
That's why I was able to get this secret telegram.

508
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Answer me!

509
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,000
Why did you send Juntong secret messages?

510
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,240
I also

511
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,880
I also accidentally

512
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,519
their channel by accident.

513
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
And I wanted to see

514
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,559
If they can decipher my password.

515
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,720
I just want to play around

516
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,480
I believe that.

517
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,359
But do you think Zhao An and the Japanese will believe it?

518
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,079
What do you want?

519
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
Make a deal.

520
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,319
Return the letter to me.

521
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,200
I'll return

522
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,240
I'll give you the secret letter.

523
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,359
Who on earth are you?

524
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,160
Why did you forge the previous letters?

525
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,319
We have each other's secrets.

526
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,200
Isn't that good?

527
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,640
Zhao An and Luo Guanqun are suspecting you.

528
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
You'd better leave now.

529
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
Do you really worry about me?

530
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
No matter who you are,

531
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,000
I hope you can be safe.

532
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,759
I will leave.

533
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,119
But not now.

534
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,759
By the way,

535
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,839
Is the information in your secret telegram

536
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,279
Is it real?

537
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,160
It's true.

538
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,279
I happened to hear it from Zhao An.

539
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,519
So you wish Jun Tong could kill Underhill successfully?

540
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,480
His hands are covered with Chinese blood.

541
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,640
He deserves death.

542
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,039
I should go.

543
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,359
Thanks for your coffee.

544
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,720
At least

545
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,400
I don't hate you as much now.

546
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,839
Really?

547
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,839
Uncle. Aunt.

548
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,440
Good morning!

549
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,599
Good morning.

550
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,440
Shuangtao.

551
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,799
Your uncle-in-law

552
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,119
everything.

553
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,519
What a good thing!

554
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

555
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,640
When will you do it?

556
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,720
He hasn't proposed to me yet.

557
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,920
Not to mention

558
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,079
I'd like to see if this man is sincere.

559
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,400
If he's sincere.

560
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,240
Right.

561
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,880
Just don't easily agree to it.

562
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't let Chen Jia Ping take advantage of her.

563
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,240
After all, you are the daughter of the Yu Family

564
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,240
right?

565
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes, of course.

566
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:17,839
Miss Zuo.

567
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,599
Your phone is ringing.

568
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,160
Alright.

569
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,400
Hello?

570
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,640
Miss Zuo.

571
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,799
Hello

572
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,279
this is Xiucai Qian

573
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,599
section Chief Chen was drunk yesterday

574
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,039
she tripped over when she went to the toilet

575
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,440
she's in the hospital now.

576
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,839
Is his injury serious?

577
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,079
He has a slight concussion.

578
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,440
But the doctor said he will be fine after a few days

579
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,119
chief Chen asked me to tell you

580
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,119
got it, thank you

581
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,599
and her head was injured?

582
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
She's fine.

583
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,079
He'll be fine after a few days' rest.

584
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,000
But the patient's face was badly hit.

585
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,559
He said he doesn't want you to see him.

586
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,400
When I see him.

587
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,559
And he's unwilling to see you.

588
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,319
Please give this to him for me.

589
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:22,519
Alright.

590
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,359
That Zuo Shuangtao

591
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,279
she has been going to the hospital

592
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,559
bringing meals to Chen Jia Ping.

593
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,359
But Chen Jiaping

594
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,559
he never showed up

595
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,240
what is Chen Jia Ping doing then?

596
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,039
Premarital phobia?

597
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,000
In this situation,

598
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,240
he can either run

599
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,359
or hide.

600
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,759
He won't run or hide.

601
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,240
What do you think he's waiting for?

602
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,240
Waiting?

603
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,240
No matter what,

604
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,759
he'll be discharged today anyway.

605
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,839
In my opinion,

606
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,200
he had nowhere to hide anymore

607
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,319
when did he leave?

608
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,160
He left early this morning.

609
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,640
Thank you.

610
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Miss Zuo

611
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,200
chief Chen specially told me that

612
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,279
that you can't go up there

613
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:42,880
he... he...

614
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Miss Zuo.

615
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,559
Chen Jiaping.

616
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,400
Open the door!

617
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,039
Why are you avoiding me?

618
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,680
You must clear your face.

619
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,400
Open the door.

620
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,559
Miss Zuo

621
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,519
chief Chen seems to be on the fourth floor

622
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,799
where is Chen Jiaping?

623
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,279
How should I know?

624
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,400
We're going to have the wedding, aren't we?

625
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
How come we can't find him?

626
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,759
Chen Jiaping,

627
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,000
show yourself.

628
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,680
Chen Jiaping.

629
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,839
I know you're inside!

630
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,440
Why are you avoiding meeting me?

631
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,319
Chen Jia Ping.

632
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,480
Chen Jia Ping, come out now!

633
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,880
Do you remember that one year ago,

634
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,599
one year ago?

635
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,079
We promised

636
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,279
to travel

637
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,039
would travel together.

638
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
But what about you?

639
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,039
Why didn't you come that day?

640
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,240
If so many people hadn't brought us together,

641
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,920
I didn't have the courage to tell you this.

642
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,079
Chen Jiaping,

643
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,920
I can't wait any longer.

644
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,119
I just want to ask you.

645
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,759
What are you thinking?

646
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,400
Is it because of

647
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:24,720
chief Chen

648
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,880
are leaving the hospital

649
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:26,839
discharged.

650
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,920
Are you all right now?

651
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,119
We are all worried about you.

652
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,839
Don't worry.

653
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,880
It's just a minor injury.

654
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,039
Oh yeah

655
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,680
chief Chen

656
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,440
this morning,

657
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,200
a worker sent a box,

658
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
he said all your things were in it.

659
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,720
That's right.

660
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:38,440
Where is it?

661
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,920
I... I'll bring it to you.

662
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,920
Officer Kimura.

663
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,759
The implementation schedule is ahead of schedule.

664
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,839
Chief Chen

665
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,880
what's inside

666
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,119
what's inside?

667
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,000
You'll find out later.

668
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,640
Enough.

669
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,079
Thank you.

670
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,119
You're welcome.

671
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,960
According to your plan,

672
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,440
when we raise enough funds,

673
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,039
It's been a long time.

674
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,039
Officer Kimura.

675
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,039
Business here isn't easy either.

676
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,119
Since the imperial army's offensive slowed down,

677
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,039
the farming and industry in the Chongqing government-occupied areas

678
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,319
In the areas occupied by the Chongqing government.

679
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,000
The shortage of goods is worse than before.

680
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,920
It's about the same in Communist Area.

681
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,680
We sell rice, oil, cotton yarn and other conventional materials

682
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,759
to sell them there.

683
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,799
The price is not as good as before.

684
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,240
The medicines?

685
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,079
The medicines may be slightly better.

686
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,480
But our stocks are limited.

687
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,480
So such a large amount of funds

688
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,599
after preparing for this,

689
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,519
It's a little...

690
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,159
There are always more solutions than difficulties.

691
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,920
Right.

692
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,559
What do you think?

693
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,400
This is what I think.

694
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,360
What about

695
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,360
you've finally made an improvement.

696
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,519
Thank you for your compliment, sir.

697
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Thus

698
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,000
It can solve the problem for me in a short time.

699
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
More importantly,

700
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,000
you can make more profit.

701
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,760
I can't.

702
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,119
I can't and I dare not.

703
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,280
And I won't.

704
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,480
You

705
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,719
to the new plan.

706
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,639
By the way,

707
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,559
how are you preparing for the special meeting?

708
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,840
There are some procedures to follow.

709
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,599
That's it.

710
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm going to Nanjing tomorrow.

711
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,800
Come back in a week.

712
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,800
Bring your new plan

713
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,960
and attend the special meeting with me.

714
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,199
Yes

715
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,840
also,

716
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,480
that you must keep it a secret.

717
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,519
Especially before we find the four of clubs,

718
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,440
don't worry, Chief Kimura.

719
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,239
Before the special session,

720
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,079
before the special session.

721
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,119
Goodbye.

722
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,320
Do you remember that one year ago,

723
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,599
one year ago?

724
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,119
What are you doing?

725
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,159
We had a deal.

726
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,519
Is it a play?

727
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,440
Travel with you.

728
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,599
How about you?

729
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,119
Chen Jiaping is in there?

730
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,280
That must be it.

731
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,039
Why didn't he open the door?

732
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,039
Men always

733
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,920
after eating, just want to run away.

734
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,679
Who has the key to the warehouse?

735
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,639
Only Chen Jiaping has.

736
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,480
Beat him away.

737
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,800
Brother, is that necessary?

738
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Kick him off.

739
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,199
Sorry, Guoguo.

740
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,079
I...

741
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,880
And avoided you for a week.

742
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,280
Because I didn't want to

743
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,159
treat my swollen face

744
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,800
to propose to you.

745
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,880
But these days,

746
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,000
I miss you all the time.

747
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,039
I hated myself

748
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,280
no matter what proposal

749
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,119
and no matter how I propose,

750
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
can't express my love.

751
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,440
Because in my heart, you're unique

752
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,800
In the world.

753
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,840
That's why it's a unique proposal

754
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,000
to be a good match for you.

755
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,239
However,

756
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,000
but I'm sorry.

757
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,599
I really can't think of

758
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,280
I won't

759
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,159
I don't know how to express emotions.

760
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,920
But I only want to accompany you to grow old.

761
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,639
In fact, in these years,

762
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,000
there is a saying,

763
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,719
In my heart,

764
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,639
In my dream,

765
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,960
In my dream,

766
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,360
but today,

767
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,199
I finally got the chance to say it out loud.

768
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,800
Guoguo.

769
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,760
Marry me.

770
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,280
Didn't you say you don't want to see me?

771
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,400
You have wronged me.

772
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,159
I have no conscience.

773
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,000
I was thinking about how to apologize to you these days.

774
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,039
I planned to invite you here

775
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,199
to lead you here one more day.

776
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,559
And bring you to the proposal site.

777
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,920
But I didn't expect that

778
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,800
you would find it yourself.

779
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,519
Don't think

780
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,679
making these rose candles

781
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,960
then just suck it up.

782
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,239
Wedding dress?

783
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,960
The ring.

784
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,719
Everything.

785
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,280
Of course, the most important thing

786
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,719
the most important thing is that

787
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,199
otherwise, I won't agree

788
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,719
I solemnly promise

789
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,719
nothing will be missed.

790
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,679
Old road.

791
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,119
I applied to the organization

792
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,239
to allow me to marry Zuo Shuangtao.

793
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,480
You've thought it over.

794
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:57,800
That's right.

795
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,400
Firstly,

796
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,280
If I refused to get married,

797
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,960
they will surely suspect me.

798
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,320
The potential work I'm going to do

799
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,880
to continue the work.

800
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,679
I think

801
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,719
I left without a word before,

802
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,000
I failed to live up to Zuo Shuangtao's expectations.

803
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,360
I want to give her a home.

804
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,800
I want to give her happiness, deep down.

805
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,800
I agree with you about first thing.

806
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
As for the second,

807
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,880
zuo Shuangtao is not on our side.

808
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,039
To marry her

809
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,960
will go through a strict examination procedure.

810
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,719
I know my place.

811
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,679
But a year ago, Left Shuangtao

812
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,199
to marry me a year ago

813
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,760
has been approved.

814
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,480
It was one year ago, after all.

815
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,079
The situation is different now.

816
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,440
You have an insidious task.

817
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,800
Once you are married,

818
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
you will be with each other day and night.

819
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,719
How can you guarantee your safety

820
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:56,000
how can you guarantee your identity?

821
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,559
Old Lu, I promise you

822
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,679
I will protect my identity.

823
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,599
If I have no other ways,

824
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,400
I won't tell you such opinions.

825
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
What about Zuo Shuangtao?

826
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,239
Who's her?

827
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,239
Do you know her better?

828
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,159
She's always been progressive.

829
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,599
How can you guarantee her ideas won't change

830
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,400
her mind hasn't changed?

831
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:13,599
her mind hasn't changed?
