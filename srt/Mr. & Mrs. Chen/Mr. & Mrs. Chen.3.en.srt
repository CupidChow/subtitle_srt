1
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,400
Slowly.

2
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,640
Hold your horses.

3
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,879
Why did you save me?

4
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,359
Why did you follow me in the past three days?

5
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,799
Red flowers blossoming in the south.

6
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
Miss Chao Nan brought tea.

7
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,319
No tea, no wine.

8
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,360
And sing the folk songs there.

9
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,599
You know who I am now?

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't know who you are.

11
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,719
But I know that

12
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,639
the organization hasn't forgotten me.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm finally waking up.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Is it because

15
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,960
I've been lurking in Shanghai for over a year!

16
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,319
Before they awaken me,

17
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,319
they must observe me secretly

18
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,039
to check on me

19
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
to see if I colluded with the enemy

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
and if my ability

21
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,520
and my ability.

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,599
Right?

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,319
By the way, I have a question.

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
That's the coffee suit just now.

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,560
It's closest

26
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,400
and the most dangerous.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,319
Why did you shoot the plaid pants?

28
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,800
Newspaper. Newspaper.

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,919
Selling news.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
The coffee suit

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,800
with the Browning Pistol.

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,599
With seven shots,

33
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,280
the gunshot was slightly stuffy

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
but I heard seven gunshots

35
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,319
so the pistol

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,360
without bullets

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
checked pants

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,360
his hand was a revolver M1917.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,439
It has six rounds,

40
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,639
but he fired three rounds.

41
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,759
So his pistol

42
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,560
with 3 rounds left.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,919
Black top hat.

44
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,400
With the Soviet Union's TT33 pistol

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,919
It has eight rounds loaded.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Loud sound.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,479
I heard seven gunshots

48
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,960
that means he had one round left

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,800
I can only save this bullet

50
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,240
to checked pants

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,759
but if I don't have

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,240
what if I don't have a magazine?

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,879
I bet you do have a magazine.

54
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,120
You're gambling on your life.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,319
At least I won.

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,520
Alright. Four of clubs.

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
Follow the Shanghai traffic line

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
as instructed by Comrade Sparrow.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,759
You are officially woke up.

60
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,159
From now on, I'll be your contact.

61
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,520
You can call me Lao Lu.

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,279
Old Lu.

63
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,360
Stay here and recover.

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,959
The clinic

65
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,000
Is run by my friend from French Concession.

66
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,959
I woke you up urgently

67
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,959
because our organization received information

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
we have a traitor.

69
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,199
To be taken to Shanghai.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,759
Traitor.

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,839
Who is this traitor?

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,399
No one knows

73
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,079
It's not clear who is escorting him.

74
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,600
According to the specific message,

75
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,680
they will take Train 514 tomorrow

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,160
from Nanjing to Shanghai.

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
They'll arrive at the station at about three p.m. tomorrow.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,040
Zhao An of Taihe Trading Firm

79
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,639
from Taihe Trading Firm.

80
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,879
Zhao An has a secret letter

81
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,079
from a traitor.

82
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,079
The traitor will do great harm.

83
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,560
Many of our comrades who spy in the police station

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
might be found by him

85
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,560
so your mission is

86
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,439
find the traitor

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,879
and eliminate traitors in the organization.

88
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,079
Yes

89
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,959
the difficulties will be great

90
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,240
find a way to overcome it.

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,199
And look for clues as much as possible.

92
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,120
You can deal with it in an emergency.

93
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,759
At the same time, you should be ready to evacuate.

94
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,720
If your identity is exposed,

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,000
you should leave the firm and Shanghai immediately.

96
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:35,879
My usual

97
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,759
I promise to complete the task.

98
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,959
The Yumo Calligraphy and Painting Shop on Dongpushi Road.

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,040
This is where we should be contacting later.

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,720
This is where we'll be contacting in the future.

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,519
Come on, Jiaping.

102
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,240
Come on

103
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,439
look at this painting.

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,639
Please write a note for me.

105
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,519
Eat while it's hot.

106
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,839
My paintings and your writing

107
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,680
so a perfect match in Shanghai

108
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,639
no one can find another in Shanghai

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,439
old Luo,

110
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,000
why are you still in the mood for painting?

111
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,319
Do you know that Zhao An

112
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,600
zhao An has a meeting today?

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't blame me for this

114
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,839
do you think I'm straightforward?

115
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,399
Now everyone in the business

116
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,519
are saying that you are just a fake brand.

117
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
Zhao An is the real boss of the business.

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
That's enough.

119
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,680
But look at this.

120
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,600
The Japanese only call you Zhao An at meetings.

121
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,120
This is so not fair.

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,480
Jiaping,

123
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,120
take a look at the painting for me.

124
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
Please comment.

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Alright.

126
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,319
And light energy,

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
contains the power.

128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,240
From within.

129
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,839
Brother,

130
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,759
It's time to accumulate wealth.

131
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,720
You know me.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,959
Certainly.

133
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,839
You're my eldest brother, right?

134
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,879
I'm not like those pushers who

135
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,199
they all went to Zhao An.

136
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm determined to follow you.

137
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,800
Do you think that

138
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,519
do you think

139
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,160
I will deal with Zhao An sooner or later?

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,879
Not necessarily.

141
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,600
I just think

142
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
If I'm with Zhao An,

143
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,680
wouldn't I be able to use

144
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,879
my good handwriting.

145
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,639
You

146
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,319
the power of this painting

147
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,040
a bird is out of the wood.

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
Write cursive characters in a vigorous and nimble style

149
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,120
also,

150
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,319
If you open the curtains,

151
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
It's bright

152
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,639
chief Chen

153
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,039
what are you up to?

154
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm sweating.

155
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,080
It's too hot to clean up the office.

156
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,360
Let it out.

157
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,919
He's busy.

158
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,519
I'll get something back.

159
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,879
Got to go.

160
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,720
Based on all information,

161
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
we can now confirm that

162
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,840
the traitor Fang Hong Nan was escorted by

163
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,399
from Nanjing to Shanghai.

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,279
As long as we find the Martial Master and his men

165
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,960
and find out the traitor's southpaw

166
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,399
we can target him and find an opportunity to eliminate traitors.

167
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,799
But there was an accident.

168
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,120
Zhao An will take men to guard the train station.

169
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,639
It would cause unpredictable difficulties and dangers

170
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,720
to the operation.

171
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,159
What should I do?

172
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,639
To go or not?

173
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
It's too late to report to the organization now.

174
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,679
We must make a decision immediately.

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Watch your step.

176
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,799
Get out of the way.

177
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,080
Please make way.

178
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,840
I made some business.

179
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,519
I agreed to meet him at the railway station.

180
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,879
But Zhao An found out.

181
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,919
The Japanese

182
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,039
has been very strict recently.

183
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,200
And Zhao An is the underling of the Japanese.

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,320
So he used you as his cover.

185
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
That's it?

186
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,279
What about you?

187
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,360
What about me?

188
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
When I asked for your help,

189
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,840
you reacted so quickly.

190
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,080
That there is something

191
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,480
to hide something on purpose.

192
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,080
Did you also use me to give you a cover?

193
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,840
I thought they wanted to catch me.

194
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Why?

195
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,480
I participated in an activity

196
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,120
I participated in an activity against Wang puppet government.

197
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,879
That's not like you.

198
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,759
When I was a traitor.

199
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,639
By the way,

200
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,320
how come I didn't notice

201
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,000
your memory is so good.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,759
When Zhao An caught up with us,

203
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,240
I told you once.

204
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,080
Remember all the information

205
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,039
about the firm,

206
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,240
you're not bad, right?

207
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,879
Exactly the same.

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,759
I'm the chief of the General Services Section.

209
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,120
But I'm good at that

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm in the accounting office,

211
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
and I'm good at remembering these things.

212
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,080
I'm not good at remembering

213
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,799
not only these trivial matters.

214
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,279
I know.

215
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,919
You have a lot of things to ask me.

216
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,639
Go ahead then.

217
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,519
Why you didn't come that day.

218
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
We already investigated.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,639
Luo Guanqun is really something.

220
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
The so-called Taihe Trading Firm

221
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,000
the so-called Taihe Firm.

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,919
The Imperial Bodyguard

223
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,720
Is an intelligence station

224
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,879
under the control of Japan's Military Police Headquarters.

225
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,919
We can infiltrate our enemies

226
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,960
we can infiltrate our enemies, right?

227
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:15,840
That's right.

228
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,679
However,

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,039
have you thought it over?

230
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,679
Yes, I have.

231
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,279
I'm a Party member.

232
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,559
I want to do my best

233
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,799
to resist Japan and save the country

234
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,080
and national liberation.

235
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,679
Once you execute a lurking mission,

236
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,320
your identity should be more concealed.

237
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Please rest assured.

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,919
I will definitely be able to do it.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,320
I remember that

240
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,559
to marry Zuo Shuangtao before.

241
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,440
But you weren't there on the day of the registration.

242
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,240
She must be very sad.

243
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,720
How do you plan to

244
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,480
with Zuo Shuangtao?

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,720
I...

246
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
I owe her so much.

247
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,559
Pay it back next life.

248
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:03,720
Answer me. ♪ I fell in love with her. ♪

249
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Why didn't you come that day?

250
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,519
I don't know.

251
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,320
I thought

252
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,519
I can't give you

253
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
happy life.

254
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,639
So you ran away?

255
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,639
Come to Shanghai

256
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,480
to be a traitor.

257
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I only knew Luo Guanqun by chance.

258
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,200
I didn't know he was working for the Japanese.

259
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,200
It was too late when I found out.

260
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,159
In addition,

261
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,159
just make a living.

262
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,559
You were not like this.

263
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,480
Yes

264
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,919
It was...

265
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,080
In the past.

266
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,120
I was stupid in the past.

267
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,840
Too childish

268
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,759
and unrealistic.

269
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,879
Including being with me.

270
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,720
Did you come to Nanjing to find me later?

271
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,320
Bill, please.

272
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,080
Have you finished?

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
What about the girl who always comes with you?

274
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,320
Recently,

275
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,360
that girl always came alone

276
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,279
and today you're again alone?

277
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Boss.

278
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,000
Can you do me a favor?

279
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,320
What help?

280
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,440
That girl of yours

281
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,799
If I come again next time,

282
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,879
can the soup be less salty?

283
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,039
Use less Kaiyang.

284
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,519
In fact, she doesn't want to trouble you.

285
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,919
She's too shy to say it.

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,159
Alright.

287
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,440
Please don't tell her.

288
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
That I told you this?

289
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,120
Answer me!

290
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,840
Did you come to Nanjing to find me later?

291
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,960
Not really.

292
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,679
Can I leave now?

293
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,759
Not yet.

294
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,120
(Sorry.)

295
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,720
This drama won't end

296
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,639
the play won't end.

297
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
I accompany you

298
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll go to the Yu Residence with you.

299
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,759
We need to make them believe

300
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,240
that we're couple.

301
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,039
Why should I listen to you?

302
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,039
Go back first

303
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,359
pick me up tomorrow morning.

304
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
Let me leave just after taking a shower?

305
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,519
Where should I go?

306
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
To your home.

307
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,160
Wherever you are,

308
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,079
where will be my home?

309
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,200
I won't go back.

310
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,720
Stop it.

311
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,920
To let your colleagues know about this.

312
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,000
Then give me a kiss.

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,759
Before I leave.

314
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,400
How annoying.

315
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,359
You don't want to kiss me?

316
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,680
Let me kiss you.

317
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:40,960
I'm leaving now.

318
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,839
Sir, are you looking for me?

319
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,839
Tonight,

320
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,279
bring your people

321
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,039
to Ci'an Hospital to set up an ambush.

322
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,960
Yes

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,519
sir, I've heard

324
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,799
commander Shanxia is already dead.

325
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,480
Then what's the purpose of the guard at the hospital?

326
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,559
I see.

327
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,839
If the Chinese Communist has surrendered to us,

328
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,119
Is in the hospital now.

329
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,920
Have you ever heard of four of clubs?

330
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,200
Four of clubs

331
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,240
Is the mole in your firm.

332
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,599
There's a Communist Party of China named Four of Clubs lurking in the background.

333
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,279
Communist Party of China?

334
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,319
Who do you think

335
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,000
of Four Clubs?

336
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:27,519
It's me.

337
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,519
I see

338
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,279
slowly.

339
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,720
Did you hear anything?

340
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,880
What sound?

341
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,920
Don't scare us.

342
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,880
The morgue is full of dead bodies.

343
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,680
With a dead body in the morgue?

344
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,039
I really heard that.

345
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,880
You must have misheard it.

346
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,680
Come on. Let's go.

347
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,599
Little Liu.

348
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,000
The patient at bed 307 passed away.

349
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,680
Bring her to the morgue.

350
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,319
Alright.

351
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,279
What the hell!

352
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,920
Can't we even sleep now?

353
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,920
Come on.

354
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,680
Don't move.

355
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,880
What's up

356
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,319
she is the number 11.

357
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,039
You remember that I put it in.

358
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,559
Didn't you remember it?

359
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,839
Maybe I forgot.

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,279
It must have slipped my mind.

361
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:20,920
Come on.

362
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,359
Come on.

363
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,039
You know what?

364
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,160
I'm the most

365
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,279
most meticulous person.

366
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,839
To plug in all the plugs in.

367
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,519
Then tell me

368
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,240
why was the latch on the morgue cabinet

369
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,079
Is open?

370
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,920
It's scary.

371
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,880
Yes, it is.

372
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,039
Bring me to the morgue.

373
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,200
Who are you?

374
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,920
Come on.

375
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,039
This way, please.

376
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,480
The traitor Fang Hong Nan has arrived in Shanghai.

377
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,799
Why is he suddenly so quiet?

378
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,599
Such an important person

379
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,119
could've caused huge waves.

380
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,839
But they don't show any sign to take any action.

381
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
Could she be

382
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,279
when Shanxia was assassinated at the railway station,

383
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,799
fang Hongnan was also injured.

384
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,720
I heard that the guards under the mountain were injured.

385
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,079
To hide his identity,

386
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
and framed Fang Hongnan as a guard?

387
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Among the injured victims who checked in today,

388
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,559
Is still no left-handed.

389
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,640
Would it be that Fang Hongnan was seriously injured and died?

390
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:29,480
Try to think again.

391
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,039
Try to think about it.

392
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,799
Anything abnormal tonight?

393
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,319
Hearing your words,

394
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,599
I remember that.

395
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,079
I saw the back of a male doctor.

396
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,880
But the doctors on duty tonight

397
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,039
on duty tonight

398
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,160
but there are no male doctors.

399
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,839
That man

400
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,160
Is pretending to be the male doctor.

401
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:38,920
Stand up.

402
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
That's the way I saw his back.

403
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,680
He must want to run away.

404
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,799
But he fell to his death.

405
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,319
Let's see who she is.

406
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,240
Aren't these the bodies in Counter No.2?

407
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,599
Let's see who it is

408
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,519
section Chief Chen, Miss Zuo

409
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,680
get in the car

410
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,599
old Luo asked you to come?

411
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,119
It's not like you don't know

412
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,960
you know that.

413
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,519
When I heard that Ms. Zuo is the niece of the Yu family,

414
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,799
when you hear that Miss Zuo is the niece.

415
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,799
Forget about it.

416
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,319
We still have to do some shopping in the mall.

417
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,359
No need.

418
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,559
They've got all the gifts.

419
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,640
Come on.

420
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,640
It's very considerate of me.

421
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,200
Come on.

422
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:25,599
Come on.

423
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,839
Shuangtao, it's really you.

424
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
Look at this.

425
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,119
You've changed so much.

426
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,440
Come on, aunt.

427
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,880
We haven't seen each other for years.

428
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,599
You look younger every day.

429
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,519
Not really.

430
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,359
I'm already old.

431
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,119
Mrs. Yu doesn't know she's not aged.

432
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,680
She should be in her early thirties at most.

433
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,640
He's a man of striking appearance.

434
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,759
Such a sweet young man like him.

435
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,519
Yes

436
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,680
jiaping,

437
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,839
you mentioned it in the letter.

438
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,559
Hi, Mrs. Yu.

439
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,039
So you're Jia Ping?

440
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,920
You finally see your natural face today.

441
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,920
Go there.

442
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,039
Every letter of Shuangtao mentions you.

443
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,599
But in recent years,

444
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,240
he didn't mention it much this year.

445
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,119
I thought...

446
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,559
Sorry.

447
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,839
Look at my mouth.

448
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,319
Oh, right.

449
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,440
Why did you come to Shanghai

450
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,279
without telling me?

451
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:26,960
I wrote you a letter.

452
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,160
You didn't receive it?

453
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,240
No, I didn't.

454
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,680
A month ago.

455
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,519
It's alright.

456
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,599
We're all here now.

457
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,839
This is the most important thing.

458
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,599
It doesn't matter if I receive this letter.

459
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,759
In this age,

460
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:39,839
everything is in chaos.

461
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,039
It became a mess.

462
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,559
And got lost.

463
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,559
They are normal.

464
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,440
Normal.

465
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,039
Standing here and talking for so long,

466
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,519
go in and talk.

467
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,039
Go in.

468
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,519
Mrs. Yu, I won't go in there.

469
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,720
I've completed my task

470
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,920
that's it.

471
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,359
Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,119
Goodbye, Mrs. Yu.

473
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,079
-Bye. -See you.

474
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,279
This way, please.

475
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,480
You have become

476
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
have become more beautiful.

477
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,440
What?

478
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,759
Drive slowly.

479
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:13,960
Is this Jiaping?

480
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,079
You don't know.

481
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,559
Our Zheng family was once

482
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,839
we were all from wealthy families.

483
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,880
Within tens of miles,

484
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,440
within a radius.

485
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,960
Guoguo once mentioned this before.

486
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,599
My mother told me that

487
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,960
she was thin and weak as a child

488
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,079
and was bullied a lot.

489
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,880
And you protected her.

490
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
So many brothers and sisters.

491
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,200
Your mom and I are the closest.

492
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,359
Don't mention it.

493
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,240
Whenever I mention your mother,

494
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,359
whenever I mention your mom.

495
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,240
Guoguo, now that you're in Shanghai

496
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
you're here,

497
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,799
my aunt's house is your home.

498
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,160
You can live here.

499
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,680
You can tell her whatever she needs

500
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,240
you always told her

501
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,720
to take it easy.

502
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,519
Do you know

503
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,839
by the way, there's work.

504
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,079
Don't worry.

505
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,119
And don't worry.

506
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,920
I'll tell your uncle

507
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,240
and ask him to

508
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,599
and take care of it.

509
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,480
Search carefully.

510
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,400
Must be happy

511
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,799
with your husband.

512
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,759
It's getting late.

513
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,200
I have to prepare lunch.

514
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,839
I'll cook a few dishes

515
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,359
to welcome you.

516
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,519
Mrs. Yu is beautiful and kind.

517
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,400
You can cook too.

518
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,039
It's great honor

519
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,279
to marry you.

520
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,160
Guoguo.

521
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,079
A handsome man like Jiaping

522
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,559
young people like him

523
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,559
should have been brought to your aunt long ago.

524
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,519
You guys chat.

525
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,200
You guys have a chat.

526
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,519
Xiaoli, come with me.

527
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,200
Alright.

528
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,880
Mrs. Yu mentioned the letter just now.

529
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,920
Big Scoop is suspecting.

530
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,000
What can we do

531
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:47,839
how about this?

532
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,759
You can write more letters

533
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,480
within one year.

534
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,400
And different periods.

535
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,720
Using papers from different periods

536
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,519
and pens.

537
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,559
I can leave the postmark

538
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
I will find a way.

539
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,359
I'm going to work in the business.

540
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
You're so meticulous.

541
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,599
To be a traitor.

542
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
What a pity

543
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:36,880
chief Chen

544
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
what took you so long?

545
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,320
For you to come.

546
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,800
Waiting for me?

547
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,559
What is it?

548
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,079
By order of Chief Kimura,

549
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,400
all employees of the firm

550
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,320
to the grove behind the building.

551
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,000
I don't know

552
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,960
I don't know either

553
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,920
It's very likely that

554
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,000
nothing good.

555
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,480
Come on.

556
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,360
This is the horse Zhao An gave to Mucun.

557
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,679
It was said to be transported from Manchuria.

558
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,480
From Central Asia.

559
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,920
Look at that.

560
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,440
What does it mean?

561
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,599
You asked us here to watch others hang?

562
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,360
I'm afraid we're not watching others being hanged,

563
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,480
rather, one of us will be hanged!

564
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,440
Have you heard who is going to be hanged?

565
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,679
No one.

566
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,320
Is everyone here?

567
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,679
Everyone is here.

568
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,360
Everyone,

569
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
although Taihe Trading Firm

570
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,239
Is a trading company,

571
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,039
you know who we work for

572
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,119
what we do

573
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,960
we all know that

574
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,079
that some anti-Japanese elements

575
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,480
tried to sneak in

576
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,440
to steal intelligence

577
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,079
and sabotage the China-Japan friendship,

578
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,360
to bring common prosperity to East Asia.

579
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,559
Today

580
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,320
we gathered here

581
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,519
because we have definite information.

582
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,679
There's a spy

583
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,519
In the firm

584
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,440
under the cover of four of clubs.

585
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,320
Today

586
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,559
we're going to show a ghost

587
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,440
kill the four of clubs.

588
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,719
I'm afraid you don't know

589
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,039
under threat from

590
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,239
by the Great Japanese Empire and the peaceful government,

591
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,519
a CPC defector came here

592
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,760
he identified four of clubs.

593
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,519
Officer Mu Cun,

594
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
now show us the traitor.

595
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,039
Come on out!

596
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:51,960
Fang Hongnan,

597
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,400
all the people in the commercial are here.

598
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
Everyone in the business is here.

599
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,519
You have to make sure

600
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,199
look at them.

601
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,079
Check out

602
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,000
see if there are any Chinese Communists.

603
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,000
Chief Kimura.

604
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,400
I need to confirm one by one.

605
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,880
How about this?

606
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,800
If he's not someone,

607
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,920
I'll pat his shoulder.

608
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,360
The sleeve and button of his left hand

609
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,760
Is much worse than that of his right hand

610
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,199
It shows that he wrote with his left hand.

611
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,400
It's the same as my previous judgment.

612
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,239
Is that Fang Hongnan?

613
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,519
This person?

614
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,039
I am an unmarried accountant.

615
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,159
I'm sure you've never seen me before.

616
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,440
I'm Luo Guanqun's.

617
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,320
I'm the manager's wife.

618
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,920
How could it be me?

619
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,159
Alright.

620
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,159
Kimura must be looking for

621
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,960
the secret letter under the mountain.

622
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,320
If he gets the secret letter first,

623
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,239
It would be over.

624
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,320
But there was no letter on the body in the hospital.

625
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:40,079
Instead of just sitting here,

626
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
you'd better go to the commercial firm and investigate

627
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,119
mr. Fang,

628
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,559
I am just a guard.

629
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,159
Sir, there's no one in the business.

630
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,400
I'm going to the door.

631
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,239
Mr. Fang,

632
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:18,960
look carefully.

633
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,320
Don't get the wrong person.

634
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,320
You would be four of clubs.

635
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,559
I once saw you

636
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,360
a Communist Party meeting.

637
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,840
Fang Hongnan.

638
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,079
Are you sure that

639
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,360
chen Jiaping is four of clubs.

640
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,639
No, no, Captain Zhao.

641
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,400
Mr. Fang must have got the wrong person.

642
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,400
Manager Luo.

643
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,360
Manager Luo.

644
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,199
Officer Kimura,

645
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,639
I've been working in the business for a long time.

646
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,239
I can't be a Communist Party spy.

647
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,559
Mr. Luo can testify for me.

648
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,960
Officer Kimura.

649
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,719
Even if I was a Communist Party spy,

650
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,199
I wouldn't choose a four of clubs

651
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,320
to be my code name.

652
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,960
With my personality,

653
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,880
why should I choose Q or K?

654
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,039
Chen Jiaping,

655
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,039
no need to deny it.

656
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,880
I want to invite you

657
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,119
to test my horse.

658
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,599
To

659
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,639
to think.

660
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,119
Hello

661
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,559
I want to see Chen Jiaping.

662
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,480
I... I know you are

663
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,960
you're the girlfriend of Chief Chen

664
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,400
she's called

665
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
left Pair Tao.

666
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,000
That's right

667
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,440
miss Zuo, are you here to see Section Chief Chen?

668
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,880
You came at a bad time

669
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:50,840
what's up

670
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,599
today,

671
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,039
with the firm today.

672
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,559
Or is it something

673
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,119
chief Chen is in trouble

674
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,360
what happened to Jiaping?

675
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,719
I just want to

676
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,760
I couldn't bear to watch it anymore.

677
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,000
So I ran back.

678
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,000
I advise you

679
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,159
go back now.

680
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,440
What happened?

681
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,159
Can you take me to see him?

682
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
If you

683
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,280
the place,

684
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,559
let me show you.

685
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,920
Hurry.

686
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,400
Guoguo.

687
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,159
Jia Ping.

688
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,400
Jiaping.

689
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,559
Miss Zuo, you are here.

690
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,159
You two...

691
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,639
What are you doing?

692
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,079
Miss Zuo.

693
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,880
You were also kept in the dark like us?

694
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,000
Your boyfriend, Chen Jia Ping

695
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,960
Is a Communist.

696
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,639
That's impossible.

697
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,840
That's bullshit!

698
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:47,719
That's bullshit!
