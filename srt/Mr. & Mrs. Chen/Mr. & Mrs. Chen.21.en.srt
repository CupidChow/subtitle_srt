1
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,239
Captain Zhao.

2
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,840
I have an emergency.

3
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
Just now, there was a video

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,560
who are you?

5
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,759
Please bless me, Father.

6
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm willing to repent

7
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,400
willing to repent.

8
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
(Please tell me your sins.)

9
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,479
(In the long wait,)

10
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
(I once felt tired of it.)

11
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,919
And lonely.

12
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,280
I lost my patience.

13
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,439
I almost

14
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,360
I almost lost my guard.

15
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,919
Actually, waiting is also our mission.

16
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,599
But from now on,

17
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,240
you don't have to wait any longer.

18
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,639
Comrade Parrot.

19
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
You have been officially awakened.

20
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,639
You're Uncle Hai.

21
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,719
Right.

22
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,159
I thought the organization forgot me.

23
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,000
The organization never forgets anything.

24
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,479
You've done a great job.

25
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,080
Your cover was well covered.

26
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,680
The hardest part is

27
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,879
as a young woman,

28
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,759
I'm not married or in a relationship.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,919
I was worried that I might look abnormal to others.

30
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,840
So I had to play a nympho.

31
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,919
Chasing after her all the time.

32
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
I thought about

33
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,360
your position in Taihe Trading Firm,

34
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,520
with your position in Taihe Trading Firm,

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,240
that's why you were never awakened by the organization.

36
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,840
Uncle Hai.

37
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,680
What is my task?

38
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
There's another one of our comrades lurking

39
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,920
within the firm,

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,519
the code name is four of clubs

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
from today on,

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
you'll be the superior of Four of Clubs.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
Your joint mission

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,879
to investigate Plan Shan of Japan's Army Ministry.

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
Plan Shan?

46
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,680
Right.

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,160
Was controlled by the Japanese Army Ministry.

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,000
To interfere and sabotage the financial and economic affairs

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,560
to sabotage the economy of the Kuomintang-controlled area and the border area.

50
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,720
Now you have a chance

51
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,800
to enter the Archives Department of Gendarmes Command

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,480
military Police Command

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,399
Is an important executive branch

54
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,759
of Shan Plan.

55
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
What about four of clubs?

56
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Four of clubs?

57
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,399
To investigate Shan Project for some time.

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,079
And there's been some progress.

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,319
Therefore, your intelligence sharing

60
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,439
and close cooperation

61
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,839
will be the key to the success of the mission.

62
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,839
How can I get in touch with Four of Clubs?

63
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,959
Considering your current identity

64
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,000
you are not allowed to meet with four clubs directly.

65
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,199
Contact with Four of Clubs must be conducted in secret.

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,199
Yes

67
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,600
this is

68
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,560
Is all the intelligence information

69
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,480
plan Shan that we have now.

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,399
You need to familiarize yourself with them.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,680
I promise to the organization that

72
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,920
that I will complete the task.

73
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,160
No. 5 Station Head Huang Jinming

74
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,639
he mutinied after being arrested.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,839
Many comrades were betrayed by him

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,319
were either arrested or sacrificed.

77
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,160
What a terrible loss!

78
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,800
Please find out Jinming's whereabouts

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
and report to the organization as soon as possible.

80
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,600
In case of an emergency,

81
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,160
call this number 6542.

82
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Hang up after one ring.

83
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,160
Call again.

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,639
Parrot.

85
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,120
Who saved me?

86
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
And who killed Huang Jinming?

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
Is he part of our organization?

88
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,839
Is it the parrot?

89
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
Or Guoguo.

90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,160
What a coincidence.

91
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,439
Why are you here?

92
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,040
I just went to the church after mass.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,439
What are you doing?

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
We just went swimming.

95
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,639
And passed by here,

96
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,959
and saw you here.

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,759
When did you start believing?

98
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,680
But no one loves me.

99
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,199
For their own spiritual sustenance.

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,079
It's straight.

101
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:24,800
Don't move.

102
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,399
What's up

103
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,000
this is my secret.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Then I won't move.

105
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,199
I...

106
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,800
I was confused at first.

107
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought I could find the answer

108
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,519
maybe we can find the answer.

109
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,879
What's there to lose?

110
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,480
Nothing.

111
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,000
By the way,

112
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,199
how are you and your wife?

113
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,000
Very well.

114
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,439
Are separated.

115
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,879
She sleeps on the bed

116
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,079
and I sleep on the sofa.

117
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,240
It's normal for lovers to quarrel.

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,879
Yes

119
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,959
I want to see when

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
to treat you and your wife.

121
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Don't.

122
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,560
Stop making a fuss, Lu Fangfang!

123
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
Don't you think I've caused enough trouble?

124
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,000
What do you mean by that?

125
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,160
Do you think I want to confess my love to you?

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,839
I used to say I liked you.

127
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,240
As I watched your drama.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,759
I think Shuangtao

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,959
cares about her.

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
I want to explain and clarify to her.

131
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,360
I have

132
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,360
you've made it clear to me.

133
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,360
I want to have

134
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,120
who's a little older

135
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
and mature.

136
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,039
Young people like you

137
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,759
not reliable at all.

138
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,279
But I have to tell you that

139
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,799
you have finally grown up.

140
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,480
Right?

141
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,000
Miss Han Lu.

142
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,639
She looks rather haggard.

143
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,159
Really?

144
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,159
Because you didn't sleep well last night.

145
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,440
Recently, I've been shooting every day.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,679
Maybe the pressure from work is too great.

147
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,759
This is all my fault.

148
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,399
In order to get the movie released as soon as possible,

149
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,320
I have reduced the shooting period.

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,039
Thank you for your hard work.

151
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,679
No, I won't.

152
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,799
I also wanted to

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,720
to adapt myself quickly.

154
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,600
Ms. Han Lu, come here.

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Miss Cold Dew?

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
I went to the studio.

157
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,759
Director Ding didn't come at noon.

158
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,840
He called his home.

159
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,919
But no one answered.

160
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,039
So I want to ask you

161
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,480
If you have seen him.

162
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,679
Actually...

163
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,639
You didn't come to me,

164
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,120
I was about to tell you that, too.

165
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Is that so?

166
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,759
What's wrong with Director Ding?

167
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,200
He...

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,159
He was dead.

169
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,600
He's dead?

170
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,159
He sent me home last night.

171
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,360
It's probably

172
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,200
after he sent you home.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,320
He was stabbed by someone

174
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,279
and died because of bleeding

175
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,519
his car and the money are gone.

176
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,559
It's possible that he encountered the robbers

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,480
his body was dumped in the suburbs.

178
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,320
And found his corpse.

179
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,440
Has the criminal been arrested?

180
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,039
Not really.

181
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,679
The world is in chaos now.

182
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,879
It's such a waste.

183
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,600
Ding Qiuyang is still young.

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,360
He was supposed to have a bright future.

185
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,559
That's right.

186
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
Director Ding is very talented.

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,759
And he's...

188
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,279
I mean, where's his corpse?

189
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
That you wanted to see

190
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,720
to see his body.

191
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,759
After all,

192
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,000
I've worked with Director Ding

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,639
for a long time.

194
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,720
I feel very sad

195
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,759
I feel very sorry.

196
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,240
See him off in the future.

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,799
Ms. Han Lu, you're so kind.

198
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,799
I was going to the hospital.

199
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,879
Ding Qiuyang is helpless.

200
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,279
The hospital asked me to come over

201
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,960
to confirm the identity of the corpse.

202
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,279
Just come with me

203
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,879
then go with me.

204
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,440
Alright.

205
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,279
Yes

206
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,120
he is our friend Ding Qiuyang.

207
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,799
Mr. Underhill.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,679
I want to be alone.

209
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
Someone who was alive yesterday

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
someone who was alive yesterday

211
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,919
but he is gone today.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,600
Alright.

213
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
Let's leave this place now.

214
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
Miss Han Lu.

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,879
Although Ding Qiuyang is in an accident,

216
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,000
but the movie will still go on.

217
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,039
I will assign a new director.

218
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Take a break

219
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,639
take a good rest.

220
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,879
I'll ask Fujita to send you home.

221
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,559
No need.

222
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,679
I'm still a little confused.

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,639
I want to find a quiet place

224
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,360
and stay alone for a while.

225
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,840
How about this?

226
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,799
I won't bother you.

227
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,120
Take care of yourself.

228
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,840
Hey.

229
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,480
Ding Qiuyang is dead.

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,679
Are you sure about this?

231
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,519
Really?

232
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,080
I saw the corpse.

233
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,799
The cause of death is excessive bleeding

234
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,039
the body was found in the suburbs

235
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,440
It's not far from the place

236
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,799
from where he ran away last night.

237
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,759
Just like what you said,

238
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,320
he didn't last long.

239
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,039
And never saw the mountain.

240
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,919
That's good.

241
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
So you don't have to worry.

242
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,399
It is your mission

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,080
proceed as planned.

244
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,679
Yes

245
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,840
also,

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,440
when will you leave this time?

247
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,879
This evening

248
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
when everything is over,

249
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,519
after everything is over.

250
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,960
Can I see you again?

251
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,039
Although

252
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,639
I'm safe now,

253
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,279
but please

254
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,720
consider it as the last time.

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,799
All right?

256
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,399
You can have your own life

257
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,279
you will have your own life.

258
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,240
And I

259
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,360
I will have my own life.

260
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,000
We might never

261
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,879
we will never see each other again.

262
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,120
Just take it as a farewell, OK?

263
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,279
Is Jiang Zhaoguo's

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,159
when I found him,

265
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,200
he tried to kill me to keep my mouth shut.

266
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,840
Are you sure he was Jiang Zhaoguo?

267
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,240
As sure as a gun

268
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,679
miss Han Lu also helped him.

269
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,799
That Miss Han Lu

270
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,799
who stabbed me.

271
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,960
They thought I was dead.

272
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,120
And put me in the trunk

273
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,240
to bury the corpse in the wilderness

274
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,440
I escaped

275
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,559
they were quarreling.

276
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,879
Okay. On the way,

277
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,159
on my way here.

278
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,080
So I ran to the city

279
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,000
I didn't even have time to go to the hospital.

280
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,440
Then I came to see you.

281
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Mr. Yamashita.

282
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,559
Don't trust Miss Han Lu.

283
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,039
She is still with Jiang Zhaoguo.

284
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,919
You're severely injured.

285
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,519
Have a drink to calm yourself.

286
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,320
I will send you to the hospital.

287
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,559
Thanks.

288
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,680
Let me show you a place.

289
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,680
And put the corpse there.

290
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,799
Also,

291
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,319
find someone to find the body tomorrow morning.

292
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
I hope

293
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,480
to be able to see the body

294
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,279
In the morgue tomorrow morning.

295
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:22,839
Yes

296
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,680
mr. Yamashita

297
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
you're really an actress!

298
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
If I didn't know the truth,

299
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
I couldn't tell she was acting.

300
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,359
What do you think

301
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,480
who has the better acting skill

302
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
who has the better acting skill?

303
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,319
You, Mr. Yamashita, of course.

304
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,160
To make her think she was using me.

305
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,759
But in fact,

306
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,480
I used her.

307
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,440
Miss Han Lu is so beautiful.

308
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,200
You really don't like her?

309
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
In my opinion,

310
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,640
there are only two kinds of Chinese,

311
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,440
useful and useless.

312
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,279
The cold dew is something that can be used.

313
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,160
As for

314
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,079
whether you like her or not,

315
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:16,880
If

316
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,400
she didn't act in those terrible movies,

317
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,960
I will

318
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,960
I'll fall for her more.

319
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
The person who followed Cold Dew

320
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,559
for them?

321
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,240
Right.

322
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,079
Get Midorikawa Dahiko to follow me.

323
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,559
If I know Cold Dew,

324
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,640
she would definitely find a way to meet Jiang Zhaoguo.

325
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,359
Follow her.

326
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
We will know where Jiang Zhao Guo is.

327
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,640
Following Jiang Zhao Guo, we know where the magpies are.

328
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,359
We will have the formula.

329
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,839
The Chinese Communist Party's border area

330
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,599
must be covered by our Shan Plan.

331
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,640
Miss.

332
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,680
Is the man you want to meet here?

333
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,720
He's already here.

334
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,039
Why didn't you go to see him?

335
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,720
I have already met him.

336
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,880
Let's go back.

337
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,039
Alright.

338
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,119
Sit down please.

339
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,920
We're leaving.

340
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,359
Room 722.

341
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,559
Three of you take the elevator.

342
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,559
And you three guard the stairs.

343
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,680
I'll watch it here.

344
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,359
Call the front desk

345
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,359
call the front desk immediately.

346
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:29,759
Hurry.

347
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,400
Yes

348
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,839
search this place!

349
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,480
Hello?

350
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,119
Hello, boss.

351
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,799
There is no one in Room 722.

352
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,039
No one's here.

353
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,000
How could that be?

354
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,079
There is no one here.

355
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,039
What now?

356
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,519
What should we do?

357
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,200
Search everyone here.

358
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,519
What to do?

359
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,119
Yes

360
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,720
search the place!

361
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,200
Yes

362
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,480
did anyone call just now?

363
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,400
I think so.

364
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,440
Less than a minute before you came here,

365
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,680
a gentleman just made a call

366
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,880
wearing a gray hat

367
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,920
yes

368
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,960
which room is it?

369
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,119
I think it's on the ninth floor.

370
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,359
Which one?

371
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,000
Hurry.

372
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,440
I remember now.

373
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,359
Room 902.

374
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,920
Room 902.

375
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
The magpie is in 902.

376
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,880
Hurry.

377
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,519
Alright.

378
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,759
Is anyone here

379
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,000
no one here.

380
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,279
Come on.

381
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,799
Whether Magpie and the people from Chongqing

382
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,440
with or without the deal,

383
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,839
I will stop this counterfeiting plan

384
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,200
I must stop this plan of counterfeiting the currency.

385
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,839
According to Cai Hongling,

386
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,000
and the record of Dr. Qiao taking medicine.

387
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,240
Tomorrow

388
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,440
should be the day

389
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,079
the day when Magpie went to Ci'an Hospital to get the medicine.

390
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
This might be my last chance.

391
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,240
What?

392
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,160
This is important information.

393
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
Why didn't you tell us before?

394
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,680
You know

395
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,400
the actions related to this plan

396
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,759
we will try our best to keep no outside units

397
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,759
without the involvement or knowledge.

398
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,880
Is Intelligence Class an outsider?

399
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,839
That magpie you mentioned

400
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,839
you mentioned?

401
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,000
According to the description of the waiter in Da Hua Hotel,

402
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,960
according to the description given by the waiter of Da Hua Hotel.

403
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,359
I will issue an arrest warrant

404
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,880
but Shanghai is a big city.

405
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,400
It's too hard to find someone else.

406
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
We have to give it a try

407
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:12,960
chief Chen

408
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
what are you doing here?

409
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,000
Qian Xiucai?

410
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,599
The fountain is there.

411
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,759
It's cheap

412
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,400
It's cheap and clean.

413
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,000
Shower here?

414
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,160
Alright.

415
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,400
I'll go to work then.

416
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,720
Goodbye.

417
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
A man from Chongqing and a magpie

418
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,359
to make a deal in Da Hua Hotel.

419
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,759
However, Day Special Command tracked their whereabouts

420
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,559
were rounded up and ran away.

421
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,839
Their whereabouts are unknown.

422
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,920
Kimura has issued an arrest warrant.

423
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,079
Be sure to find Magpie before the Japanese do.

424
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,079
The parrot.

425
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,359
Sorry.

426
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:50,759
Nice to meet you,

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,039
we meet again.

428
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,119
And you are?

429
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,519
I don't really remember.

430
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,240
When you dropped your scarf

431
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
you dropped your scarf.

432
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:00,680
You still remember?

433
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,480
I remember now.

434
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,920
You're here for a treatment today.

435
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,440
That's right.

436
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,400
I came here for registration early in the morning.

437
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:16,720
But now,

438
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,279
what a surprise!

439
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,519
The line is so long.

440
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,880
I don't know when I can arrive.

441
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,000
What department are you hanging up?

442
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,759
Cardiology.

443
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:28,920
What's wrong?

444
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,279
Is your heart sick?

445
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,119
That's right.

446
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,240
I often feel flustered

447
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,000
and shortness of breath.

448
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,799
Don't worry.

449
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,119
What a coincidence.

450
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,359
I am a doctor of cardiology.

451
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,599
And I sat in the clinic today.

452
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,039
Really?

453
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,519
Then...

454
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,720
Could you check it out for me first?

455
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,480
Some gossips?

456
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,880
That's great.

457
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,839
Then...

458
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
How should I address you?

459
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,079
My last name is Qiao.

460
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,039
Qiao Yufeng.

461
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,079
What about you?

462
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,599
My last name is Guan.

463
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,400
Dr. Qiao.

464
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,079
Then

465
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,119
I'll come to you later.

466
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,440
Miss Guan,

467
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,519
don't take a while.

468
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Right now.

469
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,240
You can come inside with me.

470
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,200
This way.

471
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
How can you cut in line?

472
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,759
- Why am I cutting in line? - Right.

473
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,079
Dr. Qiao.

474
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,039
Is it not good?

475
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,400
Don't worry.

476
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,119
Don't care about them.

477
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,640
Please have a seat.

478
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:50,839
Miss Guan,

479
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
I will get you some water.

480
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
Come on. Have some water.

481
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,119
Tell me about you.

482
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,799
I have

483
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,680
I feel dyspnea and palpitation.

484
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,720
And sometimes I get so flustered.

485
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,720
It makes me faint.

486
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,160
Don't worry.

487
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,960
Let me do a heart stethoscope for you.

488
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,359
The heart rate is normal.

489
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,319
No murmur.

490
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,440
There's no big problem.

491
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,839
It's more caused by the psychological factors.

492
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,200
What's that?

493
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,680
You mentioned the symptoms just now.

494
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,119
They are more mental.

495
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,200
This is very common in medicine.

496
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,839
Ms. Guan, please forgive me.

497
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,279
Do you have any problems

498
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,119
bothering you recently?

499
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,079
Tell me about your worries.

500
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,960
I studied psychology.

501
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,440
That can help enlighten you.

502
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,920
Nothing.

503
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,160
I don't have any disease.

504
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,880
I'll leave now.

505
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,559
Miss Guan,

506
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,559
I know you have a lot on your mind.

507
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,559
She is too familiar with people.

508
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,839
That makes it hard to talk about them.

509
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,240
But I...

510
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,279
I'm a stranger who can both keep your secret

511
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,160
who can keep your secret and help you.

512
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:49,880
Thank you.

513
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,319
Doctor Qiao

514
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,759
when will you get off work today?

515
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,720
I usually get off work at six.

516
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,200
A patient will be here at 7: 00 p.m.

517
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,240
So he'll get off work a bit later.

518
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,000
Let me think it over.

519
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll come to you when I decide.

520
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,240
Alright.

521
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,599
I'll be in the office tonight.

522
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,920
You can come anytime.

523
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,920
Honey.

524
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,359
You're back.

525
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,000
Are you going out?

526
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,599
I won't go out.

527
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,359
I won't go out.

528
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,759
You dress so well.

529
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,640
Just so so.

530
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,240
Will it kill you to praise me?

531
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,319
It's good.

532
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,200
As long as you're not mad at me,

533
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,480
you look good even without dressing up.

534
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,160
Don't drink my soda.

535
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,839
Stop it!

536
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,240
Is this a new flavor?

537
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,119
Never tried it?

538
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,880
I bought it on my way off work.

539
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,920
It tastes quite good.

540
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,440
Didn't you put anything in it?

541
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,400
Me too.

542
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,440
That's right.

543
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm your husband.

544
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,759
What are you taking me?

545
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,599
Followed me to the hospital this morning.

546
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,839
You think I didn't know?

547
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,200
Sorry.

548
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,680
We have an important mission.

549
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,559
Have a good sleep.

550
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,639
Why are you so late?

551
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,920
Were you seen by others?

552
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,679
Don't worry.

553
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,119
I climbed over the wall from behind.

554
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,920
Get me the meds.

555
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Hang me a bottle of water.

556
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
The hospital has made a strict investigation recently.

557
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,559
If people know that I prescribed medicine

558
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,800
I prescribed the medicine to you,

559
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
I will be screwed.

560
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,760
That's not right.

561
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
The amount of money is not enough.

562
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,000
It's very unlucky today.

563
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,920
And I lost a lot of money.

564
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,519
I'll make it up to you next time.

565
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,039
I'm the one who's in trouble!

566
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,000
Doctor Qiao

567
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,199
go on.

568
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,760
Do you have anti-inflammatory drugs?

569
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,119
What's wrong?

570
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,360
My wound is a little inflamed.

571
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,239
Where is it? Let me take a look.

572
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,199
Your wound lasts a long time, right?

573
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:21,559
Right.

574
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,320
Why does it have inflammation repeatedly?

575
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,119
I don't know either

576
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,320
take this medicine

577
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,519
three times a day.

578
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,519
Take one tablet each time.

579
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,320
After every meal.

580
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,519
Thank you.

581
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,199
Let me bandage your wound.

582
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,800
Alright.

583
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,559
Doctor Qiao

584
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:01,960
doctor Qiao.

585
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,079
It's me.

586
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:05,880
Miss Guan,

587
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:06,840
you're here.

588
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,760
Have a seat.

589
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,679
Take a seat.

590
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,480
Sorry

591
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,599
for bothering you so late at night.

592
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,079
It's fine.

593
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,400
I'm not off work yet.

594
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,840
Doctor Qiao

595
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,800
I thought about it.

596
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,719
These days,

597
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,840
I have been depressed.

598
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,559
But I have no one who understands me.

599
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,320
But when I see you,

600
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,679
I felt that

601
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,280
you're practical and reliable.

602
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,800
And you know psychology.

603
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,920
I think you might be the one

604
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,280
I can trust with my heart.

605
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,639
Certainly,

606
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,000
rest assured. Leave your world to me.

607
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:05,840
What's up

608
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,719
my silk scarf disappeared.

609
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,639
Would you lose it on the way here?

610
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,199
No, I won't.

611
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,000
When I entered the gate,

612
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,320
when I entered the gate.

613
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,719
The wind in the corridor must have blown it

614
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,320
In the corridor.

615
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,519
I'll look for it.

616
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,159
Don't.

617
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:23,519
It's windy outside.

618
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,000
Don't catch a cold.

619
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:25,920
I'll look for them.

620
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,039
Wait for me here.

621
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,480
Thank you then.

622
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll look for them.

623
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,800
Wait for me.

624
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,880
Wait for me.

625
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
The wound is severely inflamed.

626
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,039
And the stitches look fresh.

627
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,559
Could the wound be re-opened?

628
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,440
And stitched it up again?

629
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,400
Miss Guan, why are you here?

630
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,679
Doctor Qiao.

631
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,239
I saw someone there

632
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,280
and I passed by.

633
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,800
How did he die?

634
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,280
He died a while ago.

635
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,719
Miss Guan, don't be afraid.

636
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,199
He's one of my patients.

637
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,800
He had a severe heart attack

638
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,280
he suddenly died of heart attack just now.

639
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,440
And I didn't get to

640
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,920
have his body taken away,

641
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,679
and you're here.

642
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,960
I didn't want to frighten you.

643
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,519
So I didn't tell you.

644
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,679
Dr. Qiao.

645
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,920
It's a scary place you have here.

646
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,239
I should leave.

647
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,199
Miss Guan,

648
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,440
If you're scared,

649
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,920
let's go to another place.

650
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,480
Then...

651
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,159
Where are we going?

652
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,639
I'll take you to a quiet place

653
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,400
where no one can disturb us.

654
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,119
What is this?

655
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:33,760
Shoot.

656
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,119
Where did you hide it?

657
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,239
I don't know.

658
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,039
What's that

659
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,360
that patient's thing.

660
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,679
Or something like that.

661
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,639
The things in his wound,

662
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,719
were they taken by you?

663
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,440
Gently. Gently.

664
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,440
Is your wound

665
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,119
he is indeed wounded.

666
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,360
But what could be hidden in the wound?

667
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,920
You're lying.

668
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,000
Do you believe that I'll kill you?

669
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,039
If you don't believe me,

670
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,400
you can search me.

671
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,440
You search me.

672
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,519
I really have no idea.

673
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,679
I only prescribed him medicine secretly.

674
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,760
And help him hang up the water.

675
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
I don't even know his name.

676
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,679
As for what you mentioned,

677
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,719
I've never heard of that.

678
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,559
Are you Officer Kimura?

679
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,320
This is Qiao Yufeng.

680
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,199
Here is some important information.

681
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,280
Qiao Yufeng.

682
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,119
Yes

683
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,559
don't you remember?

684
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm your informant.

685
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,559
I've given you a lot of clues.

686
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,360
The doctor,

687
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,880
I am a doctor from the Cardiology Department of Ci'an Hospital.

688
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I saw your poster, the wanted notice.

689
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:11,159
The name on the wanted notice, Magpie,

690
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,760
and alias Shi Yang on the wanted notice

691
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,280
I just remembered

692
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,239
he happens to be my patient.

693
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,280
Patient?

694
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,360
Where is he?

695
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,800
He's with me.

696
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,679
However,

697
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,280
he had an accident.

698
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,599
He died.

699
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,360
He's dead?

700
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,480
How?

701
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,280
He came to see me,

702
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I wanted to control him.

703
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,800
So I gave him some medicine.

704
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,280
It might be an overdose.

705
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,039
But he suddenly

706
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,480
suddenly passed away.

707
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,559
Idiot.

708
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,920
Where's the corpse?

709
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,119
I have the corpse.

710
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,239
You have to protect the scene

711
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,559
I'll be there soon.

712
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,920
I need to check it myself.
