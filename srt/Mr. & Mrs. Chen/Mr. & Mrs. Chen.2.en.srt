1
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,159
My girlfriend and I

2
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,200
living in different places.

3
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,480
And I haven't had a chance to introduce you.

4
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,040
What's more,

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,519
since I've been working under you,

6
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,439
after what I did for you,

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,560
men are just

8
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
we shouldn't make life

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,400
without possibilities.

10
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,359
Alright.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,680
Understood.

12
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,079
Which train does your girlfriend take?

13
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,239
When did she arrive?

14
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,239
Where are you from?

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,079
Wuhan.

16
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,120
From Wuhan to Shanghai via Xuzhou Tongshan

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,000
bus 429.

18
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,599
2: 40 p.m. on the phone.

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
What time did you pick her up?

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,080
It was past three.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,479
She arrived at 2: 40 a.m.

22
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,280
Why did you pick her up at 3: 00 a.m.?

23
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,319
Jiaping said she would pick me up at the exit A.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,960
But he knows that

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,439
I'm a road blind.

26
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,800
How could I find the exit armour?

27
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,199
How many times have I told her

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,879
to ask more people if you don't know the way?

29
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,520
If she didn't ask me for help,

30
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,840
then you were

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
where were you the whole time?

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,080
I've been at Exit A.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,319
You've been to the area around

34
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,520
you haven't been there?

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,240
Not really.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
Why should I go there?

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Have you ever come to Shanghai to find him?

38
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,879
No, I have not.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,199
Why did you come here now?

40
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,319
Tell me your details

41
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,719
I need to know

42
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,879
and living habits in Wuhan.

43
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,520
And you should remember what I told you.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,639
She

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
because the work in Wuhan is boring

46
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,080
and I don't have a bright future.

47
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,039
He has an aunt in Shanghai.

48
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,280
So I wanted to say

49
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,680
come to Shanghai to see

50
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,520
big cities

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,599
have a brilliant future

52
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,000
there is another reason.

53
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,520
He came to keep an eye on me.

54
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,400
What does your girlfriend do?

55
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,000
A section of the Ministry of Finance.

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
What office?

57
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,000
Accountant's Office

58
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,800
now that you're going to stay in Shanghai,

59
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,159
where's your luggage?

60
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,400
Why doesn't he have any luggage?

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,439
Too many luggage.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,800
How could I carry this?

63
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,560
Three boxes of clothes.

64
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,439
Of course I'm lucky by water.

65
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,960
We'll arrive in a few days.

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,400
Do you know what he does in Shanghai?

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
Isn't he Taihe Trading House?

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Business?

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,240
Of course it's trading.

70
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,680
He bragged to me

71
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,400
that he was some kind of section chief.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,080
Did he tell you the firm's address?

73
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,360
Yeah, I have.

74
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,639
No. 26, Jisifei Road, West Area of Shanghai.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
No. 26.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,439
How are you going to contact?

77
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,639
Make calls,

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,879
write letters,

79
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,600
what's the exchange phone number of the firm?

80
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,160
What is it?

81
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,319
I don't know.

82
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,000
Called me these days.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,439
It's normal for a man

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
be proactive.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Her phone is ringing.

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,800
I always call the Finance Ministry's switchboard

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,079
to their section every time.

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,040
Six eight three three three seven seven.

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,120
Take it down

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
my goodness!

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,160
Where did you meet Miss Zuo

92
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,439
where and when you knew Miss Zuo?

93
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,800
That's necessary.

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,759
In the autumn of 1936,

95
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,480
nanjing

96
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,480
we met in October

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,199
In the autumn of 1936.

98
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,959
Where was your first date?

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,879
The Confucius Temple at Zhonghua Sect.

100
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,079
The movie I watched.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Crossroads

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,160
who are you?

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,000
Please don't.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Please don't.

105
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,439
Don't let go of her hand.

106
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,079
You scared me, huh?

107
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,680
How dare the police

108
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,199
shooting at our patriotic students,

109
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,399
how aren't you scared?

110
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,639
No, I'm not a cop.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
I joined the patriotic parade, too.

112
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I knocked out a police

113
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,600
changed his clothes

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,639
and stole his car.

115
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,959
I wanted to take them away.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Why should I believe you?

117
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,040
Look.

118
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,319
I also have red armbands.

119
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,279
The same as you.

120
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,959
But many of my classmates died.

121
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,439
To get such armbands these days.

122
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,240
Hey.

123
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,160
Don't be nervous

124
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,639
you are holding my gun

125
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,240
to me.

126
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,959
Then I'll find this bolt.

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,519
Don't.

128
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,240
Don't misfire.

129
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,040
Where did you throw the plug?

130
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,399
Hey.

131
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,240
You are injured.

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,920
How about this?

133
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,839
I'll stop the bleeding first.

134
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,360
Alright?

135
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Don't.

136
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,839
Don't face me.

137
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,800
Sit down.

138
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,439
Slowly.

139
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,480
Let me have a look.

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,279
Which school are you from?

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,800
South Nanjing.

142
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,399
Specialized in finance.

143
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,319
Endure it.

144
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,920
What's your name?

145
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Left Shuangtao.

146
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,920
Students call me Guoguo.

147
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,199
Guoguo.

148
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,319
It's a nice name.

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,839
Hold it, hold it.

150
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,319
Alright.

151
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,399
But why...

152
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,319
Why do you have grenades?

153
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,959
Our parade was sprayed with bullets.

154
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,439
The organizer of the march was severely injured.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,279
The grenade he gave me

156
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,279
he also told me this address

157
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,160
here is some very important information.

158
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,399
It can't be taken by the reactionary police.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
However,

160
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,759
It's not a good thing

161
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,639
It doesn't matter.

162
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,360
The police will chase after us.

163
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,959
How about this?

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,879
If you believe me,

165
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,000
just let go when I say.

166
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,519
Don't be scared.

167
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,079
Just pretend we watched a movie.

168
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
Watched it at the intersection?

169
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,800
Be ready.

170
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,360
Three.

171
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,720
Two.

172
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:20,959
One.

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Loose!

174
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,720
Oh my goodness.

175
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,120
Wait a second.

176
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll take care of it first.

177
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
Come on.

178
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,559
Come on.

179
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,840
What to do with it?

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't bother.

181
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,919
I'll take care of the rest.

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080
I think it's about time.

183
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
Zhao An is such a jerk.

184
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Nothing serious.

185
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
You keep tossing about till now?

186
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,519
Oh, right.

187
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,799
I heard from Zhao An that

188
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,759
when he picked you up at the train station,

189
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,080
miss Zuo said that

190
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,279
you are going to Yong'an Mall, right?

191
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
But you are going to

192
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,840
Is the southwest.

193
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,960
Yong'an Mall is to the north.

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,039
She's lying.

195
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,080
Miss Zuo.

196
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,840
You said you were from Wuhan to Shanghai.

197
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,200
That's right.

198
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,759
Can I see your ticket?

199
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,000
She lied.

200
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,480
I sprained my ankle.

201
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,720
What is this?

202
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,559
A perfume satchel.

203
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,720
Haven't you seen one?

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,440
You haven't seen them before?

205
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,120
It smells good.

206
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,519
Where did you get it from?

207
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,159
You bought it at the train station.

208
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,120
You bought it at the railway station?

209
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,279
This perfume satchel is very nice.

210
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,919
I like it,too

211
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
It's hard to love.

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,320
My goodness.

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Why didn't you read it out?

214
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,080
Would you please save my face?

215
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Aren't you ashamed?

216
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,159
My girlfriend is finally here.

217
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,840
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

218
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Who would think about going shopping?

219
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,519
What's so passionate

220
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,960
what are you laughing at?

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,000
Brat,

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
you should have told me this earlier.

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,240
Team Leader Zhao,

224
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,320
have you finished all the questions?

225
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,480
I want to go out

226
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,120
during the dawn.

227
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,799
Don't worry, Miss Zuo.

228
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,039
I want to introduce someone to you.

229
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,159
Please come this way

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,799
fang Fang!

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,639
Captain Zhao,

232
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,080
why would I come here?

233
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,960
You're beautiful again.

234
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,279
Thanks.

235
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,480
I want to ask you something.

236
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,360
Are you in love

237
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,639
like Chen Jiaping a lot?

238
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,759
What?

239
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,559
That I can't like other people?

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,159
Mind your own business.

241
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,000
It's not that

242
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,360
care about

243
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,360
care about their employees' living conditions.

244
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,440
He

245
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,799
does Jia Ping really like you

246
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
of course he does.

247
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,360
Then Captain Zhao, do you think we are a good match?

248
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,879
Perfect match

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,960
perfect for each other!

250
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,759
What a pity!

251
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,919
I'm just a few years

252
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,399
I'm a few years older than her.

253
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,240
She's

254
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,720
It's the 21st century.

255
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,679
The trend nowadays.

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Be confident.

257
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,960
When will you treat us to the wedding feast

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,799
or the wedding candy?

259
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,639
Then we have to depend on the family.

260
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,399
Proposed to me?

261
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,919
Almost.

262
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,320
Miss Zuo,

263
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't want to ruin your relationship.

264
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,519
I'm actually trying to help you.

265
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,759
How can you help me?

266
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,919
I'll tell you the truth.

267
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,759
I don't suspect you.

268
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
You can't even

269
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,440
and look so beautiful.

270
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,879
How could it be related to the assassination?

271
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,759
Our real purpose

272
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,759
Is to investigate Chen Jia Ping.

273
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,960
Why?

274
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,279
Let me put it this way.

275
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,759
If Chen Jia Ping appeared at the railway station

276
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,759
If he didn't agree to pick you up,

277
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,159
he is very likely

278
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,000
something to do with the assassination under the mountain

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,840
or another case

280
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,559
which involved an underground organization of the CPC.

281
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,759
You heard that.

282
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,960
Chen Jia Ping is not very faithful

283
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,639
only with you in love.

284
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,279
You don't have to protect him, right?

285
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,360
Be honest with me.

286
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,639
Was it because

287
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,039
I ran into Chen Jiaping at the train station

288
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,240
and you were used by him.

289
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,679
Miss Zuo.

290
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,559
If you tell me the truth,

291
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,039
I will let you go shopping right away.

292
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,720
Alright.

293
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Let me show this to the Japanese.

294
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,320
It should be almost done.

295
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,240
And you can go back.

296
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,080
What's up

297
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,200
chen Jiaping,

298
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,919
you're such a good friend!

299
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,960
You shouldn't lie to Zhao An.

300
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,519
Stop lying to me.

301
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,320
What did I trick you again?

302
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,360
Drop the act.

303
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,799
Since Zuo Shuangtao already admitted it,

304
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,559
you two have lost contact for a long time?

305
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,919
He came to Shanghai to visit his aunt.

306
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,279
At the train station last time

307
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,240
you insisted on asking her

308
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,039
that you picked her up

309
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,159
and asked her to cooperate with you.

310
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,919
What you were doing

311
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,679
to the train station?

312
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,679
You won't tell Zhao An?

313
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,360
You can't tell me?

314
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,000
I have no idea why you're going.

315
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,919
Is that all?

316
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,559
From buying or selling secretly?

317
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,639
Are you the only one who has done that?

318
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,679
What can I do if you tell me now?

319
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,200
I'll take care of your problems.

320
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,360
What are you afraid of?

321
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,000
You may not know the situation yet.

322
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,679
Your personal matter is nothing.

323
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,720
About Zuo Shuangtao,

324
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,879
this is serious.

325
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,399
When they were murdered in the mountain,

326
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,679
left Shuangtao was within the range.

327
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,360
We can conclude

328
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,320
she's the assassin's partner.

329
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,080
Assassin's partner?

330
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,320
You know what?

331
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,039
Don't let Zuo Shuangtao take advantage of you

332
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,919
because of your old love.

333
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,320
Tell me the truth.

334
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,919
You don't know Zuo Shuangtao?

335
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,120
We met at the train station.

336
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
She asked you

337
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,799
to take her out.

338
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,639
To cooperate with her.

339
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,879
Right?

340
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,080
Fellow communist.

341
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Let me tell you the truth.

342
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,480
Tell me the truth.

343
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
I'll tell you the truth.

344
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,320
You are a jerk!

345
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
I've been treating you as my big brother for all these years.

346
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,759
And now you're lying to me.

347
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,039
You know what?

348
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,440
I went to the train station to pick up my girlfriend.

349
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,240
She came to Shanghai to find me.

350
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,119
That's what I said today.

351
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,160
She said the same.

352
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,920
Because it's the truth.

353
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,440
Team Leader Zhao,

354
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,160
I want to go shopping now.

355
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,799
Alright.

356
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,519
A car to send you there.

357
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,279
No need.

358
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,160
Jia Ping will take me there

359
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,200
If he really has something

360
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,920
Is not a problem,

361
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,240
I will not let him off.

362
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,680
But what you said is nonsense.

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,640
I am here for Chen Jia Ping

364
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
she came to pick me up from the train station

365
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm not in the mood

366
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,039
to repeat these two sentences to you anymore.

367
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,319
Believe it or not,

368
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,440
then take me with you if you don't believe it.

369
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,480
Hurry and take me away!

370
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:40,759
Don't.

371
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Hurry up.

372
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,400
Hurry up! Don't waste your time!

373
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,640
You're really...

374
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,319
Chen Jiaping, where are you?

375
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,039
Come out!

376
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,279
Chen Jiaping,

377
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,559
what's up

378
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,319
jiaping, please

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,359
please explain

380
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,000
what's going on between you and Lu Fangfang?

381
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,720
Hey...

382
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,599
I don't mind you interrogating us,

383
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,039
why do you even involve Lu Fang Fang in this?

384
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,960
It's a misunderstanding

385
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,519
It must be Zhao An.

386
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,440
He tricked me.

387
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,240
Got it?

388
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,440
It's a misunderstanding.

389
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,799
It's not what you think.

390
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,240
Brother.

391
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,039
Left Shuangtao won't interrogate me anymore.

392
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,000
We won't refuse.

393
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,079
Let's do it another way.

394
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,880
I knew Luo Guanqun's

395
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,680
that crappy game doesn't work.

396
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,319
How is the assassin?

397
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,799
He's still alive.

398
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
But she won't hold on for long.

399
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,400
What about Cold Dew?

400
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,839
She's on her way. She'll be here soon.

401
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,759
Find Gao Fang here.

402
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,680
His skills could be put to use.

403
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,519
Understood.

404
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,759
I'll report this to Officer Kimura.

405
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,160
Next,

406
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,920
It's my turn to sing.

407
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
Isn't this all just a formality?

408
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,519
Don't mind

409
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,960
shanghai Beach is fun.

410
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,279
Do it, do it.

411
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,119
If you need anything,

412
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,039
let me know.

413
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,759
Come on, you old man.

414
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
Do you still have the intention?

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,799
We still shop,

416
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,559
and eat.

417
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,559
Let's go for lunch.

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,319
Come on.

419
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,599
You're still eating?

420
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,759
Have you cleared Lu Fangfang?

421
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,920
She's fine

422
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
misunderstanding.

423
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,839
This is a misunderstanding.

424
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,359
Tonight at Huayou Restaurant...

425
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,240
My treat.

426
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,559
You two.

427
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,599
Both of you.

428
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
Zhao An, what do you want to do?

429
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,799
If there's new evidence,

430
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,039
and continue the investigation

431
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,279
do you have any new evidence?

432
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,880
It's the order of Chief Kimura.

433
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,599
It's so late.

434
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,039
What is he trying to do?

435
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,720
Zhao An?

436
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,880
What are these?

437
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,440
The German guy.

438
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,319
Hello, Miss Cold Dew.

439
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,440
What's the matter

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
what do you want to ask?

441
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,240
I heard you were in trouble at the train station today.

442
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,559
Yes

443
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,200
what's up

444
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,119
I heard that a man pushed you away

445
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,839
pushed you away just in time

446
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,599
so you wouldn't be in trouble.

447
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,359
Right.

448
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,640
That person...

449
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,119
That person?

450
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,319
No, I don't.

451
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,559
Check if that's him.

452
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,279
I don't quite understand what you mean.

453
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,039
The Commander of the Mountain Martial Master.

454
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,839
Miss Cold Dew?

455
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,559
You must know her.

456
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,680
He's my friend.

457
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,559
I heard that when we were in Manchuria,

458
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,200
the General of Martial Master under the Mountain

459
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,599
has arranged several

460
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,559
made by Manying Ying to let you act in.

461
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,400
You two have a good relationship.

462
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,279
What are you trying to ask?

463
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,799
The Commander of the Mountain Warrior

464
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,359
was stabbed at the train station today

465
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,599
he was dead.

466
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,200
Did you know that

467
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,759
and died at the foot of the mountain.

468
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,319
This man is called Chen Jiaping,

469
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,440
I suspect that he is related to the assassination.

470
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,839
You're the key witness.

471
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,599
I...

472
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,680
He insisted that

473
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,480
he waited for the exit of the train station

474
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,079
and didn't reach the area where the murder happened.

475
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,039
But the scene of your assassination

476
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,119
Is very close to the murder.

477
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
If he is the one who saved you,

478
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,480
then Chen Jia Ping was lying.

479
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,200
I don't think you would harbor

480
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,359
for a murderer who killed a warrior under the mountain, right?

481
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,200
Of course I won't.

482
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,920
Is the person

483
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,440
that saved you?

484
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,920
Yes

485
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,079
It is Chen Jiaping who saved me,

486
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,880
what about Jia Ping?

487
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,200
Don't tell me

488
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,759
why you lied to me.

489
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's hear the next one.

490
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,359
What's your name?

491
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,880
Feng Qi!

492
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,480
Pulling out one of his fingernails

493
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,920
your name.

494
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,839
Who sent you

495
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,559
who sent you to assassinate the warrior under the mountain?

496
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,440
Group.

497
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,119
What organization?

498
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,960
I only know that we are anti-Japanese.

499
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,039
I shall take orders from my superior.

500
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,720
You're not allowed to ask other questions.

501
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,440
The one who ran away.

502
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,200
Is he your accomplice?

503
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,720
Yes

504
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,640
I know him.

505
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,720
We're in this together.

506
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
What's his name?

507
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,240
His name is Kun.

508
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,720
Besides Kun,

509
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,519
besides Kun?

510
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,359
No one.

511
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
Then pull out your nails.

512
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,279
Feng Qi,

513
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,119
watch.

514
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,440
Let him see.

515
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,720
Do you know this woman named Zuo Shuangtao

516
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,759
the woman?

517
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,880
Is she with you?

518
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,440
Pull out all his nails

519
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
of his fingernails.

520
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,160
Don't.

521
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,279
I mean...

522
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,200
That...

523
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,720
I know her.

524
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,680
We're in this together.

525
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,960
Chen Jiaping,

526
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,200
you lied.

527
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,359
Miss Shuangtao.

528
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,799
You also lied.

529
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160
The confessions of Da Xuan and Han Lu

530
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,720
has explained everything.

531
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,200
Zhao An.

532
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,799
I'll leave this to you.

533
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,079
Hold on.

534
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,279
What else do you want to say?

535
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,079
Can I hear it again?

536
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,559
Alright.

537
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,480
Hear it again.

538
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
Manager Luo,

539
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,200
please listen carefully again.

540
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,319
Hold on.

541
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,720
What are you doing?

542
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,039
Captain Zhao.

543
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,519
Can I do it?

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,839
Do you know how to do it?

545
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,720
It's alright.

546
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,920
Hello, Miss Cold Dew.

547
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,039
What's the matter

548
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
what do you want to ask?

549
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,799
I heard you were in trouble at the train station today.

550
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,119
Yes

551
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,799
what's up

552
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,680
I heard that a man pushed you away

553
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,319
pushed you away just in time

554
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,160
so you wouldn't be in trouble.

555
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,240
Right.

556
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,519
That person...

557
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,119
That person?

558
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,759
Yes

559
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,799
chen Jiaping is the one who saved me,

560
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,000
you're still able, right?

561
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't break it.

562
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,279
Yes

563
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,359
It is Chen Jiaping who saved me,

564
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,880
captain Zhao,

565
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
I want to hear the recording

566
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,960
and I want to listen to it again.

567
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,279
Whatever.

568
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,519
What's your name?

569
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,119
I'm Li Da Xuan.

570
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
The one who ran away.

571
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,920
Are you with him?

572
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,319
What is his name?

573
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,279
Yes

574
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,400
I know him.

575
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,039
We're in this together.

576
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,079
His name is Kun.

577
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,960
Captain Zhao.

578
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,440
You're such a joker.

579
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,559
It was a joke.

580
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,519
Why did you have to edit

581
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,240
why did they edit it?

582
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,559
It was edited.

583
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,200
Do you have proof?

584
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,880
Are you kidding me

585
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,319
let me analyze it.

586
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,279
Old Luo.

587
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,200
Do you hear the sound of water droplets in the background?

588
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,440
The studio is leaking.

589
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,519
It's normal to use the basin.

590
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,279
Yes, very normal.

591
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,519
Listen again.

592
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,640
Listen carefully.

593
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,319
Yes

594
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,400
It's Chen Jiaping who saved me,

595
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,359
I can't tell.

596
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,640
The first half of the recording,

597
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,400
the sound of water droplets was uniform.

598
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,359
But why did they suddenly stop

599
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,240
then the sound of water droplets became fast and slow.

600
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,000
Do you know why?

601
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,279
Did Chen Jiaping save you?

602
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:42,319
Miss Han Lu.

603
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm your fan. Please sign your name.

604
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,559
Hey!

605
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,079
The one who saved me

606
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,799
who saved me,

607
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,920
also,

608
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,559
don't explain.

609
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,279
Old Luo.

610
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,559
Let's listen to Li Daxuan's conversation again.

611
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:08,880
Yes

612
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,559
I know him.

613
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
We're in this together.

614
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,720
His name is Kun.

615
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,279
Remember that.

616
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,319
I know him.

617
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,640
We're in this together.

618
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,519
And listen to the second part.

619
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,200
Do you know this woman named Zuo Shuangtao

620
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,160
the woman?

621
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,480
Is she with you?

622
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,599
Pull out all his nails

623
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,559
of his fingernails.

624
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:36,920
Don't.

625
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,799
I mean...

626
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,880
That...

627
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,440
I know him.

628
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,319
We're in this together.

629
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,079
I know him.

630
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,920
We're in this together.

631
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,680
Captain Zhao,

632
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
In one sentence,

633
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,519
li Daxuan said it twice.

634
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,400
And coughed at the same spot.

635
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,599
Do you think it's a coincidence?

636
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,720
I don't think so.

637
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,039
But I think

638
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,680
captain Zhao is saying it twice.

639
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,079
I don't know her.

640
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,319
I don't know her.

641
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,559
She's dead.

642
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,240
Gao Fang.

643
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,359
Can it be handled?

644
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,119
Don't worry. No problem.

645
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,240
Zhao An.

646
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
You're so bold.

647
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,759
Jia Ping is one of us.

648
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,200
Zuo Shuangtao is Jia Ping's girlfriend.

649
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,519
We are also friends.

650
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,160
You trick them

651
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
to trick them.

652
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,079
As for the lousy trick,

653
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,000
Is yours.

654
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,920
Don't blame it all on me.

655
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
That's bullshit!

656
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,279
I'm ordering you

657
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,839
release him immediately.

658
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,640
Immediately.

659
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,359
Can we leave now?

660
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:18,799
Can we leave now?

661
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,240
We should go.

662
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,119
Why do you leave?

663
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,039
Let's have a meal at Huayou House.

664
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,960
My treat.

665
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,720
My brother.

666
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,279
Miss Zuo.

667
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,920
I didn't take good care of you today.

668
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,319
Which scared you and Jiaping.

669
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
Come on, I'll drink as a punishment.

670
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,880
I'll drink as my punishment.

671
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,039
Zhao An can't be around for long anyway.

672
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,039
36. Mr. Lei hits Qiu.

673
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,599
I'll deal with him after the fall.

674
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,880
I won't talk about it today.

675
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,599
I'll make a toast to you with this one.

676
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,519
Frightened?

677
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,799
Jia Ping told me that

678
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,079
In a Sino-Japanese joint venture firm.

679
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,640
I thought

680
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,599
he earned money and lived a simple life.

681
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,319
I didn't expect that

682
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,799
this must be a demon cave.

683
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,160
Yes

684
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,039
there are no outsiders here.

685
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,759
I might as well be straightforward.

686
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,519
We work for the Japanese.

687
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,799
To fight.

688
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,119
The use of knife and spear

689
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,160
Is inevitable.

690
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,480
Got it?

691
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,640
It turns out to be a den of collaborators.

692
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,079
Miss Zuo is candid.

693
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,799
I like that.

694
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,079
By the way, Ms. Zuo,

695
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,279
I heard from Jia Ping that

696
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,359
that you came to Shanghai

697
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,319
to find a job.

698
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,240
Have you made up your mind?

699
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,599
I have no idea so far.

700
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,519
I'll decide after visiting my aunt.

701
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,839
Where your aunt lives?

702
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:34,880
The Residence.

703
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,200
Where?

704
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,599
That's Mr. Yu Shanren's mansion.

705
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,920
She worked there as a maid.

706
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,359
My aunt is the wife of Mr. Yu Shanren,

707
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,720
zheng Yumei.

708
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,640
Really?

709
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,160
She's not my aunt,

710
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,119
she's my mother's cousin.

711
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,000
Mr. Yu,

712
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,920
he is the chairman of Sanbei Lunbu Company.

713
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,240
He is also a well-known financial tycoon

714
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,559
and the President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce,

715
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,759
even the Japanese are thinking highly of him.

716
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,800
Chen Jiaping,

717
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,039
your girlfriend

718
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,079
she's really great.

719
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,519
Make a toast.

720
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,320
Come on.

721
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,840
Miss Zuo, here's to you.

722
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm going to the bathroom.

723
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,079
Please excuse me for a while.

724
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:19,920
Alright.

725
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,159
Come on. Let me drink for her.

726
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,480
- I will drink for her. - Me.

727
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,400
Chen Jiaping,

728
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,400
you did it on purpose, right?

729
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,039
What's up

730
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,760
your girlfriend who is backing him?

731
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,800
You didn't tell me either.

732
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
I finally know.

733
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,320
Mr. Yu stamped his foot

734
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
even the Shanghai Beach would tremble.

735
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,679
If I had known about this,

736
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,079
If I had known about her?

737
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,920
You didn't cheat me.

738
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
When has I lied to you?

739
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,440
Then I should propose a toast to you.

740
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:56,920
Come on.

741
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,599
Come on.

742
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:58,880
Brother.

743
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,880
Back to business.

744
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,519
After he was poisoned,

745
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,880
he was sent to Ci'an Hospital.

746
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,159
He was shot again.

747
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,719
One member of his guard was killed.

748
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,440
I mean,

749
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,039
you're so ruthless!

750
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,199
He poisoned the car.

751
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,440
You added your pistol when you got off the carriage.

752
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,199
Do you think Juntong was behind this

753
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,400
or the CCP?

754
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,119
I think it should be Military Commander.

755
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,280
Why not?

756
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,440
Think about it.

757
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,599
After he was poisoned,

758
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,920
he had to use it when he got to Shanghai.

759
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,320
That will take his life.

760
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,920
I also heard

761
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,800
on the warrior under the mountain,

762
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,840
they said there was a secret letter from Juntong.

763
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,519
But the strange thing is

764
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,159
and the secret letter was not found

765
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,239
but I couldn't find the secret letter.

766
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
We'll need to check it out carefully.

767
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,960
Here they are.

768
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,159
For you.

769
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,079
In order to express his apology to you,

770
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,599
zhao An will arrange for you to stay here tonight.

771
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,800
Have a good rest.

772
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
It's not too late to go to the Yu's tomorrow.

773
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,639
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

774
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,719
Warm.

775
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,000
Hot? What is it?

776
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,280
You scared me to death.

777
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
No one cares about me even when I'm dead.

778
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Just go.

779
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:50,840
Got to go.

780
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,159
Take care.

781
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
These two

782
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,199
do you think something's wrong?

783
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,199
Nothing.

784
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,400
What is wrong?

785
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,000
What a coincidence!

786
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,280
Chen Jia Ping had a girlfriend suddenly.

787
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,039
They were both at the train station,

788
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,800
they were assassinated.

789
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,760
And a traitor of the CPC.

790
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,719
These are too coincidental.

791
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,440
It's too coincidence.

792
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,480
There must be something wrong.

793
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,039
I'll go find out.

794
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:26,760
No need.

795
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,760
Zhao An will look into it.

796
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,079
We'll wait and see.

797
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Chief Chen, this way please

798
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,119
you can leave now

799
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:39,840
alright.

800
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,880
Just go.

801
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,280
I'll turn it off.

802
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,719
Alright.

803
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,800
Chen Jiaping, let me ask you something.

804
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,039
Why did you pretend to be in love with me?

805
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,480
Why did you pretend that you still love me?

806
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,559
Actually,

807
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,599
you have had a change of heart, right?

808
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,239
I wasn't acting.

809
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,480
She thinks she's affectionate.

810
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,360
She said those things without feelings.

811
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,440
Pretentious.

812
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
I think it takes two to make a quarrel?

813
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:25,760
You know what?

814
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,960
Don't argue with me.

815
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,719
I've had enough of a bad day.

816
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,039
It's annoying!

817
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,880
If I knew I wouldn't come to Shanghai,

818
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,360
I thought I could take the tram to buy imported goods.

819
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,280
But what happened?

820
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,639
I almost sat on the bench.

821
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,079
Enough.

822
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
Let's stop chatting unhappy,

823
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,920
alright?

824
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,480
Let me ask you this.

825
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,639
Do you miss me?

826
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,400
Missing you?

827
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,519
Miss you.

828
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:54,960
Very much.

829
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,239
If you miss me, go take a shower together.

830
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:58,480
Come on.

831
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,079
Let's take a shower first.

832
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,199
I can't hear anything clearly.

833
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,559
The tap is turning on.

834
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,239
A bug fears the sound of water droplets the most.

835
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,639
Aren't you skilled?

836
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,960
Do something

837
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,079
what's good about taking a shower?

838
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,320
I'm not interested.

839
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,599
It's really the clean spring

840
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,000
ruined the good things

841
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,880
what a pity.

842
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,119
You can talk now.

843
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,480
But I still have to keep it down.

844
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,639
So, let's

845
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,480
can you now tell me

846
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,960
why did you pretend

847
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,440
did you pick me up at the railway station?

848
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,840
Let's eat.

849
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,800
What are you doing?

850
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,639
Stop!

851
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,960
Get out of the way!

852
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,960
Get out of the way!

853
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,079
Get out of the way.

854
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:21,840
Go to hell!

855
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,199
Get out of the way.

856
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,519
Magazine?

857
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:12,719
Slow down.

858
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:20,960
Hold your horses.

859
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,199
Why did you save me?

860
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,679
Why did you follow me in the past three days?
