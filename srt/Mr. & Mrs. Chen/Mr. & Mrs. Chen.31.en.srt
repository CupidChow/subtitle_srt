1
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,120
Contact target appears.

2
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,519
Ready to fire.

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,799
Hold on.

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,519
That woman doesn't seem to be here for a rendezvous.

5
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,879
Why didn't you retreat when you knew it was dangerous?

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,200
You can't retreat if I retreat?

7
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,799
How many snipers you have got?

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,920
So far, only one is confirmed.

9
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,079
Understood.

10
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,280
Which side you're from?

11
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,599
Military command or Japanese puppet master?

12
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,039
It's not clear yet.

13
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,280
But when you get into the shooting range,

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,520
It's been a while

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,680
but he didn't shoot.

16
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,960
He must have known

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,120
you will meet your superior here today.

18
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,319
And want to take us all out.

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,039
But they are confused.

20
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,639
Because there are no superiors and subordinates.

21
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,120
Would be meeting like this.

22
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,319
Would make it look like we're on a date

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,639
or having an affair.

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
They can think whatever they want.

25
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,439
But they've obviously doubted

26
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,599
their suspicions.

27
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,919
I'm afraid this is only temporary.

28
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,000
Right.

29
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,919
So we must come up with a plan as soon as possible.

30
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,199
The time

31
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,280
the place is all right.

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,159
Captain Tao.

33
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,560
Are you going to shoot or not?

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,319
Our goal is to eliminate Chen Jia Ping

35
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,159
together with his superior.

36
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,080
Firing now

37
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,280
the real target would be startled.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
The real target is here.

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,879
You are a parrot.

40
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,439
I didn't expect you

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,719
you would be the leader of

42
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,280
so you knew about my identity long ago?

43
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,960
Four of clubs.

44
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,159
Tell me about the current situation.

45
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,680
Have you heard about the matter with the firm?

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,879
I don't have an identity to cover myself.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,879
And he got the formula.

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,759
I failed the organization's trust in me.

49
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,159
The original plan of the organization

50
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,639
to evacuate Shanghai.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
I once watched Mr. Lu compile

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,479
about you.

53
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,159
I thought you wouldn't agree to leave.

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,199
So, I've already asked for new instructions from the organization.

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
But now,

56
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm at my wits' end too.

57
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
There is a clue.

58
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,280
Do you know Xindi?

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,479
Xindi?

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I heard the conversation between Yamashita and Uchida.

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,039
Yamashita said that

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,159
hopefully the second phase of Project Shan

63
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,159
will be in Xindi.

64
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,560
Unfortunately, I was interrupted.

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,719
I didn't hear the rest of it.

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,599
Could new ground

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,719
could be the same?

68
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,879
I have checked.

69
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,399
There's no place called Xindi in Shanghai.

70
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,560
What's that?

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,240
You must investigate it clearly.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,959
But now the main thing

73
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,199
to get away from here.

74
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,000
Is that the copper plate in the box?

75
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,439
As long as you give me the box,

76
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,079
and it is clear that I am your superior.

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,120
They will fire.

78
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,040
We can't take over the copper plating

79
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,240
or act rashly.

80
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,560
Right.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
The copper plate is their first target.

82
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,759
Then they want to kill us all.

83
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,000
They still can't confirm my identity.

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
So they're still hesitating.

85
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,160
But if

86
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
make us want to leave,

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,040
they don't care about that much

88
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,560
they'll fire directly.

89
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,680
Your three o'clock position

90
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,879
Is Suzhou River.

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,399
As long as we can jump into the river,

92
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,839
as long as we can jump into the river,

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,480
you mean that I run to the river bank with the box?

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,959
No way.

95
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,000
If you touch any boxes,

96
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
they'll shoot you.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,879
I have an idea.

98
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,439
What?

99
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,879
Kiss me.

100
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,399
Aren't you scared?

101
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
It seems that

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,360
this woman isn't here for the rendezvous

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,920
and target Chen Jiaping.

104
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,319
Why are you mad at me?

105
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,560
They are trying to escape.

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,639
And shoot at Chen Jiaping

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,199
aim at the woman.

108
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,720
And block their escape route.

109
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't kill me.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
My child is only 2-month-old.

111
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,480
Please help us.

112
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,879
It's dangerous to run back.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,079
How are you?

114
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,079
Lu Fangfang,

115
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,160
cover for me!

116
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,439
Jia Ping?

117
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,000
Chen Jia Ping's superior was you.

118
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,959
You are the one who betrayed Chen Jia Ping.

119
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,560
Where is Chen Jia Ping?

120
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,800
What happened to him

121
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,680
what happened to him?

122
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,839
Don't you know

123
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,040
what happened to him?

124
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,560
Is he still alive?

125
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,040
I don't know.

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
I just know that he was saving me.

127
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,840
In fact, you really love him.

128
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,159
Really?

129
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I should be asking you this question.

130
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,120
Do you really love him?

131
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,360
I love him.

132
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,559
But I must kill him.

133
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,960
Inside is the copper plate.

134
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,120
You won't succeed in your conspiracy.

135
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,320
You won't be able to escape.

136
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,279
Your crimes will be known

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,159
will be known.

138
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,720
Everyone, back up!

139
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,639
Back up!

140
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Back up.

141
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,559
Back up.

142
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,399
Okay, stop looking!

143
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
Back up!

144
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,279
Back up!

145
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,200
It's time to go.

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,960
Left Pair Tao.

147
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,480
He's back.

148
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,720
He's back.

149
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,120
You must be disappointed

150
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,279
to see me die.

151
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,360
I'll be more disappointed if you die.

152
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,919
At least you didn't deny that

153
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,279
as a top secret agent in Juntong.

154
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,320
Tao Dachun must not understand

155
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,679
to set the ambush

156
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,039
to set an ambush.

157
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,799
I still couldn't get rid of you.

158
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,399
Why did you do this to me?

159
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,480
You betrayed me.

160
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,759
You betrayed your re-established faith

161
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,360
that has nothing to do with my beliefs.

162
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,039
Then what does it have to do with?

163
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,039
You killed Captain Liu.

164
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,600
I want to avenge him!

165
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
Liu Wuchang is dead!

166
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,679
What?

167
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,639
You dare not admit it?

168
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
It's not like you.

169
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,159
He saved me.

170
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,480
Why would I kill him?

171
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,799
That's why your crime is even more unforgivable.

172
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,519
I didn't kill him.

173
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,919
I didn't kill Liu Wuchang.

174
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,120
Whoever killed him

175
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,440
to sow dissension between us

176
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,840
and instigated you to betray and kill me.

177
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,919
I see

178
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,519
you killed Lu Fang Fang?

179
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
When Lu Fang Fang was dead,

180
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,679
was killed by you?

181
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,600
Captain Tao.

182
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,759
I've got the copper plate.

183
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,879
Good job!

184
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,679
Where is Chen Jiaping?

185
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,480
He's dead.

186
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Are you sure about this?

187
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,080
If he's still alive,

188
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,799
I would find him

189
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
and kill him myself.

190
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,559
Alright.

191
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,440
How is this woman now?

192
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,320
She's injured.

193
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
I will take her away.

194
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Why not?

195
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,360
I didn't want her to die so easily.

196
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
You knew about her affair

197
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,960
she was having an affair with Chen Jiaping.

198
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,080
Alright.

199
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,759
I'll leave her to you.

200
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,639
You'll get rid of your old enemy.

201
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,720
The copper plate

202
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,759
Is finally back to you.

203
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,279
What's in the box just now?

204
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,360
That's none of your business.

205
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,039
I replaced it with something else.

206
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,359
Why?

207
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,200
You first betrayed us

208
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,400
why are you helping us now?

209
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,480
I suddenly understand a truth.

210
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,119
It's personal between me and Chen Jiaping.

211
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
I can't be used by people with ulterior motives.

212
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,839
I believe in the justice of the Communist Party.

213
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,839
Only believe that the Communists can bring hope to China.

214
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,799
That's why I won't let Juntong get the copper plate.

215
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,200
And their evil plans will not succeed.

216
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,039
Get off here.

217
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,519
Bring it back to the border.

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,759
Thank you.

219
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,920
Comrade.

220
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,160
So what are you going to do next?

221
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,160
I don't know.

222
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
I had nowhere else to go.

223
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,480
And nowhere to go.

224
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,839
Why would you choose this path of destruction

225
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,160
than believe Jia Ping is framed?

226
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,240
I believe what I see

227
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,440
jiaping must still be alive

228
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,279
the truth will be known sooner or later.

229
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,559
I want him to be alive too.

230
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
He should die in my hands

231
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,440
after that, Lu Fang Fang got out of the car

232
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,200
I won't know

233
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,359
I will never know.

234
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,440
It seems that I misunderstood you.

235
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,640
I also misunderstood you.

236
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,000
We're even now.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
We're even now.

238
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,880
Honey.

239
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Remember what I told you at our wedding?

240
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,160
You're not perfect.

241
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,799
I'm not perfect either

242
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,039
but together we

243
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,200
will be perfect.

244
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,759
But now,

245
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,519
so perfect.

246
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:20,920
Do you still remember

247
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
we first met?

248
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,680
Who are you?

249
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
Don't.

250
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,440
Three, two, one.

251
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,480
Hold on.

252
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
What are you doing?

253
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,720
To think why fried dough sticks with soy milk

254
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
you can add an egg.

255
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,480
What's up

256
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,200
nothing.

257
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,680
The egg dropped.

258
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,920
You can add an egg.

259
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,359
They're killing people.

260
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,240
Leave now!

261
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,920
He got himself involved in

262
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,559
to kill me.

263
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,200
Master Yamashita

264
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,160
the four of clubs and the five of hearts are dead.

265
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,400
Are you sure about that?

266
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,440
OK?

267
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

268
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It is as expected

269
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,039
as expected, they killed each other.

270
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,240
And eventually perish with the same.

271
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,200
You helped me

272
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,880
you not only found Lu Fangfang,

273
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,519
the hidden CCP,

274
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,440
found the copper engraving of the coin.

275
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,720
And now,

276
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,960
you killed four of clubs and five of hearts for me.

277
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,839
You are talented.

278
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,319
I really admire your talent.

279
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,759
Thank you, Mr. Yamashita.

280
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,440
It seems

281
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,759
you should be the manager

282
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,960
of Taihe Comptoir.

283
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,599
It's you.

284
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,279
Qian Xiucai imprisoned you here.

285
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,359
It's you.

286
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,200
So it is you who

287
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,880
about Zuo Shuangtao's identity

288
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,559
that Zuo Shuangtao and I

289
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,519
why did you kill Captain Liu?

290
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,559
I didn't kill him.

291
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,319
Isn't it Chen Jiaping?

292
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,440
It's not Chen Jiaping.

293
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:44,799
Who was it?

294
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,279
Are you going to tell me or not?

295
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,440
It's Director Jiang.

296
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,799
Why did he do that?

297
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,119
Captain Liu is a traitor.

298
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,200
They're leaning against the Communist Party.

299
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,119
Even the Communists' side.

300
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,119
How did Jiang Zhaoguo know about this?

301
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,839
I told you?

302
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
So Jiang Zhaoguo asked you to lie

303
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,680
to frame Chen Jiaping?

304
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,519
Right?

305
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,519
If I don't do that,

306
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,240
director Jiang will kill Zhou Qingfang.

307
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
That's why Qian Xiucai killed Lu Fangfang

308
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,359
and framed Zuo Shuangtao.

309
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,000
Am I right?

310
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,920
Qian Xiucai,

311
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Is a devil.

312
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,759
And a talent as well.

313
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,599
He has done many things that he is proud of.

314
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,359
But no one told me.

315
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,799
She kept chatting with me.

316
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,160
I know everything.

317
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Promise me one thing.

318
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,359
I'll tell you everything.

319
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
What is it?

320
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,640
Unlock it.

321
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,359
What about the letter of Captain Liu?

322
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,680
Captain Liu's handwriting.

323
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,160
It's me.

324
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,920
Who forged it.

325
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
I studied graphology before

326
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,640
and I'm good at it

327
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,640
where the letter was?

328
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,640
Director Jiang burned it.

329
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,160
What's in the letter?

330
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,200
Tell me.

331
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,680
Captain Liu said that

332
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,759
I hope you can follow your faith

333
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,839
and dream.

334
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,759
At the end of the letter,

335
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,200
he also sent you a poem.

336
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,039
"Do not listen to the sound of the forest beating the leaves."

337
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,400
Walk slowly despite the noise.

338
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,960
You are badly hurt.

339
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,720
You won't live long.

340
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,839
I know that

341
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,720
you almost killed me today.

342
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,319
Which cut?

343
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,599
The knife.

344
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,039
That cut to you, didn't you?

345
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,319
If I didn't dodge it,

346
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,920
wouldn't you be a widow?

347
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,400
I firmly believe you can avoid it.

348
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,480
Oh my goodness.

349
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,519
It's so scary.

350
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,519
How did you find that?

351
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,680
When I was waiting for you at home,

352
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,240
I kept thinking

353
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,200
all the things that happened.

354
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,000
I thought

355
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,279
to open the window to get some fresh air.

356
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,759
Then I saw the reflection

357
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,920
the reflection from the telescope.

358
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,960
I suddenly realize that

359
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,640
this is not as simple as I thought.

360
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,680
I was too stupid before.

361
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,759
Sure enough,

362
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,279
I went to see Hu Jun

363
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,200
and he also confessed.

364
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,039
It's alright.

365
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,160
Not that stupid.

366
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,920
What about you?

367
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,119
Me?

368
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,799
At the scene,

369
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,079
I saw the knife stabbed in Lu Fangfang's body.

370
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,240
To be honest, for a second,

371
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,279
I did suspect you.

372
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,720
But after I thought about it carefully,

373
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,880
even if you really killed Lu Fang Fang,

374
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,480
you shouldn't have left the knife at the scene, right?

375
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,880
I saw you cutting apples

376
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
cutting apples at home.

377
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,240
I was sure that

378
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,759
that you weren't the one who killed Lu Fangfang

379
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,720
didn't you notice it?

380
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,920
Our neighborhood is so quiet.

381
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,039
It's the quietest it's ever been?

382
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,759
It means that someone has set up defences.

383
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,759
You know?

384
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,240
The truth is

385
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,279
when you said we're not perfect at this moment,

386
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,640
I know what you mean.

387
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,880
After all, there are things

388
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,000
to be honest.

389
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,839
What if there's a bug?

390
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,839
A tacit understanding?

391
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,200
One is Scholar Qian,

392
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,079
and the other is Jiang Zhaoguo.

393
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,359
Each set his own trap

394
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,880
so that he could incite us

395
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,720
to kill each other.

396
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,559
Fortunately,

397
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,440
we chose to trust each other.

398
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,440
But now it's still not perfect.

399
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,359
Under the mountain,

400
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,880
sell papers?

401
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,880
The marriage of the movie star Han Lu to a wealthy Japanese businessman

402
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,559
the grand wedding is about to be held.

403
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,799
I suddenly want to drink coffee,

404
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,240
just wait for me in the car.

405
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,960
All right.

406
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,640
If you really marry the warrior under the mountain,

407
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,559
you'll become a notorious traitor.

408
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,480
You'll be branded with shame forever.

409
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,039
Do you know that

410
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,799
I let you down again and again

411
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,279
and heartbroken.

412
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,559
That's because I've been through too much.

413
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,039
I've been through so much.

414
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,640
Now that's different.

415
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,079
Now the mission completely failed.

416
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,880
I can't bring myself to go back to Chongqing.

417
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,640
In my life,

418
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,960
you're my only one now.

419
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
Let's forget all these.

420
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,359
Let's find a place where no one knows us

421
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,279
and start a new life.

422
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:10,960
Alright?

423
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,440
Is this ticket to Hong Kong?

424
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,039
I'll be waiting for you.

425
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,359
I'll be waiting for you all the time.

426
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,480
Comrades.

427
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,199
It's time for the decisive battle.

428
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,400
Welcome the new comrades to join us.

429
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,039
This is Gao Fang.

430
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,800
He intercepted some important information through his radio.

431
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,239
Everyone.

432
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,119
We were misled before.

433
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,039
Xindi is not a place at all.

434
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,400
It's a movie that promotes militarism.

435
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,159
The name of this movie is Xindi,

436
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,519
and the movie

437
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,159
Is going to be released in Luhua Cinema.

438
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,639
And I've already located

439
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,920
the counterfeit factory is underground of Lu Hua Cinema.

440
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,559
Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

441
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,320
The warrior and Cold Dew

442
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,960
a traditional Japanese wedding ceremony

443
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,000
at the foot of the mountain in Shanghai.

444
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,440
After that, they'll have an outdoor wedding

445
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,360
for an outdoor wedding.

446
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
After the banquet,

447
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,280
commander of Shanghai Dispatch Army, Junliu Hata

448
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,239
will arrive at the scene.

449
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,119
To sign an investment agreement with Yamashita.

450
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,719
Investing in movies is just a cover.

451
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,400
The main content of the agreement

452
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,880
Is about the launch of the second phase of Plan Shan.

453
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,920
So, our goal this time

454
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,440
Is to rescue the kidnapped workers in the counterfeit factory.

455
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,760
And experts

456
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,760
and returned the printed coins

457
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,719
the paper used for the coin

458
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,760
and printing equipment

459
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,960
and destroying the entire planet.

460
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,199
But in fact there are two huge

461
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,000
(and insurmountable difficulties.)

462
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,280
The underground counterfeit factory is divided into two areas,

463
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,639
two areas: the printing shop,

464
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,400
has a built-in safe

465
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,079
has a built-in safe.

466
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,920
Through blasting,

467
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,719
to enter the workers' printing shop,

468
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,840
and the experts' workshops

469
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,360
are separated by an iron gate 5 centimeters thick.

470
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,239
Can it be exploded?

471
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,559
To blow up this iron gate,

472
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
we need at least 10 kg

473
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,480
more than 10 kg of TNT

474
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,159
moreover, even if we break the iron gate,

475
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,920
the occupants can't survive

476
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,880
no one inside would have survived.

477
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,920
The only way

478
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,840
Is to get the key to the iron gate.

479
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
But the key is in his hand.

480
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,519
Yes

481
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,760
mr. Yamashita,

482
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,800
I don't understand why Jiang Zhaoguo

483
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,320
I don't quite understand.

484
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,639
Why you want to marry Han Lu?

485
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,400
I need a

486
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
a Chinese film star

487
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,719
shooting films with the spirit of Japanese empire.

488
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,480
Which will paralyze the Chinese people.

489
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:39,880
Got it.

490
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,159
There's one thing

491
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,760
I'll only tell you.

492
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,199
What is it?

493
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,119
I like the way

494
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,119
with the scars

495
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:53,159
with scars.

496
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,039
It turns out that

497
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,679
scars can make a woman

498
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,199
can make a woman more beautiful.

499
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,320
Kimono has no pockets.

500
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,599
That you carry with you.

501
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,320
Usually put it in the Faith Pouch.

502
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,920
Little Pea.

503
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,280
At 4 p.m.,

504
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,079
we must finish it on time.

505
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,159
After we finish today's mission,

506
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,519
I will leave Shanghai.

507
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,840
I'll bring you back to my hometown.

508
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,960
Where is my hometown?

509
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
The beautiful Rehe.

510
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,239
My hometown is pretty.

511
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,000
There're prairie,

512
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,280
and lakes.

513
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,800
The grass there is richest.

514
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,119
The water there is the sweetest.

515
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,719
You can have enough to eat

516
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,039
and drank as much as you wanted.

517
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,519
Then I ran.

518
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,559
Until the moon was up.

519
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,079
The prairie will be peaceful.

520
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,400
I can take you to eat roast mutton.

521
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh, right.

522
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,960
You don't eat meat,

523
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,119
but you only love grass.

524
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,719
I've been muddle through these years.

525
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,039
But working for a Japanese

526
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,400
and almost caused a huge mistake.

527
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:10,199
So I'll sit on the grassland in my hometown

528
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,440
watching the bright moon

529
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,039
and reflect on yourself.

530
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,360
What?

531
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,199
And you're looking down on me.

532
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,199
You almost became the Japanese's horse.

533
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,840
So you should reflect on yourself too.

534
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,880
Although Chen Jiaping is mean to me,

535
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,920
he's a good man

536
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,440
I really envy him.

537
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,000
What?

538
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,239
Being a hero?

539
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,239
To be a hero.

540
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,639
Especially when he comes home after being a hero.

541
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,840
And his beautiful wife to keep him warm.

542
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,119
That's right.

543
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,360
I still have you, right?

544
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,920
Little Pea.

545
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,119
In the days to come,

546
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,559
we can live together.

547
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,599
It's broken.

548
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,599
The key is not in the Faith Pouch.

549
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,360
Little Pea.

550
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,599
We're ready to go.

551
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,199
Little Bean!

552
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,599
Action!

553
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,719
What should we do?

554
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,280
Where will the key be?

555
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,320
Little Doudou, come back!

556
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,239
Come back!

557
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,599
Don't shoot.

558
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,559
Don't shoot.

559
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,000
Be careful

560
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,039
what happened

561
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,960
what's going on?

562
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:03,960
Little Pea.

563
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,880
Come on.

564
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,800
Mr. Foot the mountain.

565
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,280
Mr. Yamashita.

566
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,519
Miss Cold Dew.

567
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,199
Come here.

568
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:24,320
What are you doing?

569
