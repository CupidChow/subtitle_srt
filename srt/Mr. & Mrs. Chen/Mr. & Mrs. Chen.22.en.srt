1
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400
Officer Kimura.

2
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
Officer Mu Cun, what are you looking for?

3
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
Someone touched the body.

4
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Why was the wound cut?

5
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,280
What?

6
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,439
I don't know.

7
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,319
Where it went?

8
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,520
What's that

9
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,039
I don't know.

10
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,000
You're lying.

11
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,080
Officer Kimura.

12
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,479
It's true.

13
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,919
Why don't you believe me?

14
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
What? You...

15
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,520
Nothing.

16
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,360
Is there anyone else?

17
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,719
I shouldn't have said that.

18
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,520
There's no one else.

19
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
You know what?

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,719
If you dare to tell a lie,

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
I'll kill you.

22
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,639
Officer Kimura.

23
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,319
It's true.

24
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,080
I really didn't.

25
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,319
Someone had

26
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,759
who's saying...

27
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,680
There's only one person.

28
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,759
One patient.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
I only left for a short while.

30
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,719
I thought she was an ordinary patient.

31
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,840
I didn't expect her to threaten me with a knife

32
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,719
she suddenly threatened me with a knife

33
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,599
and she forced me.

34
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,199
She asked me what she said.

35
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,520
She asked what was hidden in Magpie's corpse.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
That I took the stuff inside.

37
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
No, I didn't.

38
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,159
Where is she?

39
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,960
Right here.

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,719
What?

41
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,159
In the back room.

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
To the back room.

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,519
Officer Kimura.

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,879
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

45
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,120
That's what I was saying.

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,319
You know what I mean

47
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,079
would be you.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,319
Left Double-tao.

49
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,040
Officer Kimura.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Do you know this woman?

51
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
Her name is Zuo Shuangtao.

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,160
Officer Kimura,

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
she used this knife

54
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
to threaten me.

55
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
In the past.

56
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,439
It's specially made for the military commissioner.

57
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,759
You're the military commander?

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,639
Yes

59
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,000
are you here to track Magpie?

60
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,120
That's right.

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,120
That's right.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,040
You are very brave.

63
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,560
I want to know where the formula is.

64
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,000
I didn't find any.

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,160
You made the wound?

66
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,000
I made your wound.

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,120
But I didn't find the formula.

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,079
You're lying.

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Officer Kimura.

70
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,399
She's definitely not lying.

71
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,319
If she lied to me,

72
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,680
she wouldn't have threatened me with the knife.

73
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,959
What do you think?

74
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,079
Even though we haven't found the formula,

75
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,279
we've got something unexpected.

76
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,160
Kenzo Kimura.

77
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,839
Today, I know I can't survive.

78
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,040
But I won't tell you anything.

79
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,800
You'd better not bother yourself with this.

80
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,319
Just kill me.

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
You misunderstood me.

82
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,959
I have no interest in killing people.

83
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,079
Is so cheap.

84
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,240
She is too cheap.

85
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Dr. Qiao.

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
Do you know what my dream is?

87
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't tell me you're...

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,079
My dream

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Is to become a doctor.

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,959
Chief Kimura.

91
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,879
What kind of surgery do you want to be?

92
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
Surgical.

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,319
The surgeon in charge.

94
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,600
Great.

95
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
You know

96
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,759
when I

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
have this dream?

98
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,120
How am I supposed to know?

99
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,079
When I was in primary school,

100
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,160
In the biology class,

101
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
during the biology class.

102
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,519
He's a very lively

103
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,000
that is lively.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I used a nail

105
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,680
to the board

106
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,240
then use a blade to cut its belly open

107
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,000
then I'll slice it open.

108
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
The nerves inside are twitching.

109
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,279
His limbs were twitching wildly.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
Nothing can stop my curiosity

111
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,079
my curiosity and passion for bioscience.

112
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,800
Can you make my dream come true?

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,879
Well, how can I help?

114
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,920
Very simple.

115
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:39,839
Look at that.

116
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,839
We now have

117
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,279
of the autopsy.

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
Chief Kimura.

119
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,319
Are you going to

120
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:51,920
hey!

121
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,639
Get me something that is a doctor's

122
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,720
a doctor's clothes

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
and the tools.

124
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,959
Hurry up.

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,959
Alright.

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,759
I'll do it.

127
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,639
What is it?

128
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,319
What is your task?

129
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,879
What is it?

130
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,920
Where is your superior?

131
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,079
How many people are there in your organization?

132
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,439
And where they hold their events.

133
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
What is it?

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,199
Go on.

135
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,199
I'll listen to you.

136
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
I will.

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
I just want to say,

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,159
right now, in this room,

139
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,279
I am just a Chinese who is bound

140
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,000
who can no longer fight back.

141
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,080
But outside this room,

142
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
In every street,

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
In every family.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,440
In Shanghai,

145
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,000
In the eastern China,

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,159
In China,

147
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
and many of our comrades

148
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,039
they will record the heinous crimes that you committed.

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
They are filled with indignation

150
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
and hold the weapons in their hands.

151
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,000
They will fight until their last moment.

152
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,159
Thousands of Chinese

153
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,879
will die one by one under my sword.

154
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,799
Including you.

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,039
Was just one of many victims.

156
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,360
However,

157
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,879
I will let you die

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,399
with grace.

159
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,600
Died in a beautiful way.

160
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
What the hell is she doing?

161
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:07,919
It's not good.

162
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,399
Tonight,

163
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,080
she must have something important to do.

164
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,759
She must go to Ci'an Hospital for that doctor.

165
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't bother.

166
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm not going to see Officer Kimura.

167
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm afraid I'll get scolded again.

168
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,519
I can't.

169
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,440
I can't leave.

170
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,679
If I leave,

171
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,679
I won't be able to see Officer Kimura anymore.

172
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,519
I have to go no matter what.

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
I still have to go.

174
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,440
I insist. I'll go too.

175
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,600
Officer Kimura,

176
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,399
I'm a double-edged sword.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,399
I was looking for you today

178
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,200
to discuss something with you.

179
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,759
Little Pea.

180
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,240
No, I won't.

181
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
The matter with Takeda Xinxuan...

182
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,679
I heard that you wanted to

183
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,559
taking Songxuan Takeda away.

184
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,279
We're very happy.

185
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,240
It means

186
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,360
we're taking good care of Takeda.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,679
Why am I saying this?

188
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
Officer Kimura.

189
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,120
What I mean is

190
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,440
can you let me raise your horse?

191
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't worry.

192
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,519
I'll treat you as my own son.

193
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,120
Why am I so stupid?

194
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,080
I only left for a short while.

195
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,679
I thought she was an ordinary patient.

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,840
I didn't expect her to threaten me with a knife

197
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,679
she suddenly threatened me with a knife

198
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,600
and asked me

199
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,159
what?

200
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,960
What?

201
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,799
She asked what was hidden in Magpie's corpse.

202
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,200
That I took the stuff inside.

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,759
No, I didn't.

204
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
Where is she?

205
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Right here.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
What?

207
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,360
In the back room.

208
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,440
I can't.

209
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,080
You can't even say that.

210
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,559
To be so humble.

211
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,679
I'll get rejected easily.

212
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
But I've contributed a lot after all.

213
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,799
To be credited anyway.

214
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,039
No, you can't.

215
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,159
I need to think it over.

216
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,840
Please

217
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,559
get me something that is a doctor's

218
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,559
a doctor's outfit?

219
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,360
And

220
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
surgical tools.

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,639
Hurry up!

222
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,919
Alright.

223
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,080
Darn it!

224
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
The sick Japanese!

225
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,600
Even if she doesn't confess,

226
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,039
there is no need to dissect her.

227
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,080
Chen Jiaping,

228
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,080
you did that to Zuo Shuangtao.

229
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,519
Don't you know she's my wife?

230
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
Guoguo.

231
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm here.

232
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Don't be scared.

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,240
Don't be scared.

234
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,960
The door will open soon.

235
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,679
Don't be scared.

236
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,039
I'm here.

237
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,519
I'm right here.

238
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,480
I am here.

239
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,159
I'm here.

240
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,960
Don't be scared.

241
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,320
Listen to me.

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,080
This is not the time to cry.

243
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,559
Got it?

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,519
We must both leave here right now.

245
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,879
Got it?

246
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,120
Look at me.

247
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,559
We're leaving.

248
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,080
We're leaving.

249
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,759
Come on.

250
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,559
Slowly.

251
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,600
Officer Kimura.

252
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,080
From today on,

253
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,759
you are me.

254
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,879
Touch wood!

255
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,399
What are you talking about?

256
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,600
Sincerity.

257
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,639
OK.

258
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Let's just say that.

259
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,120
It will be fine this time.

260
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,480
Why did you come here, Second Blade?

261
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,519
It's a long story

262
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,879
but we can't let him find us.

263
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,759
I even feel sorry for him.

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,919
Officer Kimura.

265
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,639
Officer Kimura.

266
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
I'm entering the door.

267
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,120
He's coming in.

268
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,639
What to do?

269
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,360
Leave him alone.

270
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,960
He wouldn't know who did it anyway.

271
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,200
Are you all right?

272
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
Sorry, I'm late.

273
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,559
Where is Dr. Qiao?

274
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,600
He's behind you.

275
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,519
Don't look!

276
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,679
He's dead.

277
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,639
This is strange.

278
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
Where is my scalpel?

279
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,320
It's here.

280
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,120
One's crime deserves more than death

281
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,200
this is bad.

282
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,720
What's up

283
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,159
I dropped my scarf.

284
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,559
I wear it in the business every day.

285
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,000
The Second Blade will surely recognize you.

286
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:41,879
Where is it?

287
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,360
On the side of the table.

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,039
It's not real.

289
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,120
I must be wrong.

290
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,320
An illusion.

291
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,600
It's just an illusion.

292
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,319
I must have used my brain too much just now

293
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,759
I have hallucinated.

294
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,200
Why does he sit by the door?

295
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,279
Second Blade.

296
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,599
What are you doing?

297
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm sitting here for a while.

298
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,279
Then I can go back.

299
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,359
Everything will be back to normal again.

300
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,680
Why are you holding a knife?

301
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,000
Section Chief Chen!

302
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,319
How could you...

303
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,720
-I... -He... he...

304
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,839
What's the matter with you

305
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,279
you sound so anxious.

306
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,799
What? You his?

307
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Second best.

308
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,079
Is it a mission?

309
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
Why didn't you say that earlier?

310
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,319
If I had been there.

311
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,640
It's so scary.

312
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,640
Officer Mu Cun.

313
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,559
Kimura.

314
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,000
What...

315
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,119
What happened?

316
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,039
How did Officer Kimura die?

317
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,799
Understood.

318
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,200
You're the killer.

319
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,799
No, I didn't.

320
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,799
Look at this.

321
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,240
The wound angle is sharp.

322
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
The wound margins are neat.

323
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,759
And the wound wall is smooth.

324
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,880
And there is no skin lesion around the wound.

325
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,680
And skin abrasions.

326
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,400
The 2nd blade.

327
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,519
The wound is caused by a sharp blade.

328
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,480
The murderer is the knife in your hand.

329
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,480
There are blood stains on the knife

330
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,400
and we can easily prove whether it belongs to Chief Kimura.

331
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,079
The most important thing is...

332
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,720
There are your fingerprints on the knife.

333
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,519
Now we have witnesses and material evidence.

334
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,000
Are you still trying to deny it?

335
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,400
Section Chief Chen

336
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,920
how can you frame someone?

337
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,319
I found this knife here.

338
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,160
Second one.

339
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,920
I heard that Officer Kimura

340
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,119
wanted to take away the horse you raised.

341
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,880
You're furious with that.

342
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,720
You could say that you bore grudges against her.

343
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,240
This is your motive to kill him

344
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,200
chief Chen

345
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,160
little Bean is very important to me

346
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,119
I wouldn't kill anyone for it.

347
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,880
I don't want to suspect you.

348
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,640
We're colleagues after all.

349
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
But what can I do to

350
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,759
you're at the crime scene

351
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,799
and held the murder weapon in your hand

352
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
most of all, you have the motive to kill him.

353
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
How can I not suspect you?

354
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,759
I'm used to taking everything on my back.

355
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,599
I have

356
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,160
but this

357
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,960
but the pot is too big.

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,279
I can't carry it.

359
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,599
Double-edged sword.

360
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,559
Are you going to take the blame or not?

361
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,000
Follow me to the military police headquarters.

362
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
When you're there,

363
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,559
a reasonable explanation.

364
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,000
Come on.

365
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
Someone's coming.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,759
Someone is coming.

367
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,839
Come on

368
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,559
chief Chen

369
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,720
I can't be found

370
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,400
I will hide.

371
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,640
I can't carry it.

372
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,039
The hottest pot in the world.

373
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,480
I really can't take it back.

374
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,240
Hallucination.

375
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,720
Hallucination again.

376
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,440
I'm not scared.

377
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
God bless me!

378
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Please bless us!

379
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,000
Chief Chen

380
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,759
you're also my hallucination

381
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,079
you never appeared in front of me.

382
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,640
Do you have feelings?

383
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,480
I do. Is that an illusion?

384
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,279
Sit up.

385
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,880
And have a look.

386
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,240
You didn't forget it, right?

387
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,960
You messed up big time.

388
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,000
You know?

389
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,160
Section Chief Chen

390
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,759
I really didn't kill Officer Kimura.

391
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
Yes

392
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,440
maybe you didn't kill her.

393
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
Then you did kill her.

394
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,839
What if you were possessed by a wronged ghost?

395
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,319
I've told you that when you took

396
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,119
I told you

397
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,640
It's easy for a demon to possess you in this way.

398
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
Am I really possessed?

399
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,720
Brother.

400
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,160
We would've called

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,440
I was going to call the Military Police

402
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
and ask them to arrest him.

403
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,720
I picked up the phone

404
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,240
and it suddenly occurred to me that

405
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,319
to what I have accomplished in the business

406
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,720
although

407
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
you work for Zhao An,

408
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
but usually,

409
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,240
give me a hard time.

410
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,119
Right?

411
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,240
And the key is that

412
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,519
I think you are not

413
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,759
a good person.

414
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,640
So I put the phone down.

415
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,920
I can't bear to

416
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,839
we're colleagues after all.

417
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,640
Right?

418
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,400
I was thinking how I can help

419
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,559
put this thing

420
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:11,839
forget about it.

421
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,440
Brother.

422
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,240
Here is the thing.

423
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,759
That's all I can do to help.

424
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,039
After all, you killed a Japanese today.

425
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,519
If the Japanese find out about this,

426
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,160
I will be in danger too.

427
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I can't help you anymore.

428
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,359
I'll leave now.

429
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,279
Find your own solution

430
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,200
section Chief Chen

431
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,960
you have to help me!

432
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,119
Section Chief Chen

433
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,000
find a way to save me?

434
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,480
Chief Chen

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,599
please

436
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,079
I'll listen to whatever you say.

437
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,480
Alright?

438
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,200
Chief Chen

439
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,559
stand up!

440
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,279
You now bully me for being soft-hearted.

441
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,119
You know what?

442
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,519
Let me think about it.

443
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,799
Let me think about it.

444
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,480
Please tell me

445
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
how did you come to the hospital?

446
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,400
I wanted to go to the Military Police Headquarters

447
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,559
to ask Chief Kimura

448
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,880
and ask him not to take Little Doudou away.

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,599
Waiting outside for ages.

450
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,960
Finally, Chief Kimura came out.

451
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,480
I didn't know where to start.

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,319
When I come around,

453
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,440
his car had left.

454
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
I ran after his car,

455
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,440
to the gate of Ci'an Hospital.

456
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,319
When I saw that Chief Kimura was admitted to the Cardiology Department,

457
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
after hesitation,

458
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,039
I finally had an excuse.

459
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,079
I'll go and see Officer Kimura.

460
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,599
When I opened the door,

461
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,240
first, I saw a dead man outside.

462
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,000
I got scared.

463
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,720
You called Officer Kimura.

464
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,440
But no one replied.

465
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,400
I thought something bad might have happened.

466
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,799
I was scared.

467
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,079
I saw a scalpel in the room.

468
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,799
I wanted to pick it up for self-defense.

469
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,039
You know

470
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,559
since I raised Little Doudou,

471
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,160
I was afraid it would be hurt by my two blades.

472
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,839
I dare not carry the knives with me.

473
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,400
You would know

474
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,559
what happened later.

475
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,319
Brother,

476
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,039
you should have never

477
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,720
pick up that knife.

478
00:24:59,119 --> 00:24:59,920
You are so stupid.

479
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,319
Let me think what to do.

480
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,400
Look at them.

481
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,839
One, two, three.

482
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,559
Three bodies.

483
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,359
Officer Kimura.

484
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,799
No need for introduction.

485
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,640
Right?

486
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,960
The doctor

487
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
a heart doctor.

488
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
He also has an identity.

489
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,400
He is Officer Kimura's informant.

490
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,920
An informant?

491
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,480
How did you know that?

492
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,079
You know what?

493
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,640
Thank you for meeting me,

494
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,359
think about how you'll thank me.

495
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,160
The wanted notice...

496
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
I found this on the doctor's desk.

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,079
Look at this photo.

498
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,960
Look at this guy.

499
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,400
Isn't the code name Magpie

500
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,920
It's the corpse who is sitting there, isn't it?

501
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,480
Right.

502
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,359
Brother.

503
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,599
Kenzo Kimura died today.

504
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,759
He's Kimura.

505
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,559
If Military Police Command finds out...

506
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,119
If Beiqi gets to know it, you know?

507
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,759
That's why...

508
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,839
We need to

509
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,160
at the scene

510
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,799
let the Military Police Command

511
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,319
from Military Police Command

512
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:30,240
alright.

513
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,119
Magpie.

514
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,039
Repeat offender.

515
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,839
But he had heart disease.

516
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,880
So he came to the hospital

517
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
to the cardiology department.

518
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,720
But out of his expectation,

519
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,359
the doctor was an informant of Kimura.

520
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,160
He recognized the criminal.

521
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,680
So he found a chance to inform Kimura Executive.

522
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,319
When the doctor tried to keep Magpie calm,

523
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,799
he added something

524
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,039
I don't know what was added to his liquid.

525
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,920
It might be an overdose of the drug.

526
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,400
Which caused his death.

527
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:02,559
Brother.

528
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,920
It's easy to explain.

529
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,599
But you must listen carefully next.

530
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,359
Got it?

531
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,400
Because Kenzo Kimura is about to play.

532
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,519
When Chief Kimura arrived,

533
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,359
he saw a magpie

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,799
he's dead.

535
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,920
But we didn't find

536
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,519
we didn't find the information he wanted.

537
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,000
So he thought the doctor

538
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,200
stole his information.

539
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,599
He took out his gun and wanted to kill the doctor.

540
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,799
But what about the doctor?

541
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:22,759
Took precautions.

542
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,160
He hid a scalpel in his cuff.

543
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,960
To look for a scalpel.

544
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,599
While Chief Kimura was raising his gun to fire,

545
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,079
the doctor scratched his arm.

546
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,039
What are you doing?

547
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
This is my hand.

548
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,519
You go row Mu Cun's hand.

549
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,000
Sorry, sorry.

550
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,720
Then the doctor stabbed Officer Kimura in the neck

551
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,200
when he wasn't ready.

552
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
But Officer Kimura,

553
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,400
was a lieutenant colonel in the Army of Imperial Japan.

554
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
How could he be killed so easily?

555
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,640
Hence,

556
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,440
officer Kimura got into a fight with the doctor

557
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,200
and got into a fight with the doctor.

558
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,160
You break the bed

559
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,799
and hit this bed.

560
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,839
That's not enough.

561
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,480
Alright.

562
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Finally,

563
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,319
kimura,

564
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,680
the scalpel away from the doctor.

565
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,640
The doctor died on the spot.

566
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,799
Chief Mu Cun died of excessive blood loss

567
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,759
were also found in blood.

568
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
Both of them died.

569
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,599
Brother.

570
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:49,559
This is the only

571
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,400
that I could think of

572
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,720
chief Chen

573
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,599
thank you for your help today

574
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,400
otherwise, I would really

575
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,720
It's not right.

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,799
It suddenly occurred to me

577
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,200
why are you here too?

578
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,720
I'm here to get the medicine.

579
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,480
Hey...

580
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,559
Why are you here at this late hour?

581
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,880
My wife has a fever.

582
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,240
I came to get the fever medicine.

583
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,279
Then you get the medicine.

584
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,559
When you took the medicine?

585
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,079
Do you think that I want to come here

586
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,480
do you think I want to see something like this?

587
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,880
I saw you sneaking around outside.

588
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,599
I came to see you.

589
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,880
What the hell are you doing?

590
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
You were at the crime scene, too.

591
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,440
Why was I suspected

592
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,480
you're not!

593
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,119
Why are you against me?

594
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm doing you a favor.

595
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,200
Besides, you have the motive to kill him.

596
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,079
Your fingerprints were on it

597
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,680
chief Chen, did you forget it?

598
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,680
You faked the scene

599
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,400
I used this cloth as a cushion.

600
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,160
Yes

601
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,160
don't forget it, either.

602
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,359
You took this knife from this trolley.

603
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:03,839
The one you use

604
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,440
Is with me.

605
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,599
What are you doing?

606
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,920
Chief Chen

607
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,000
you're literally

608
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,759
what's that?

609
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,279
What am I?

610
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,200
Then you'll be my savior.

611
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,720
My... my biological parents.

612
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,480
That's good

613
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,079
chief Chen

614
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,000
do you think that

615
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,640
we'll be on the same boat.

616
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,720
Hey.

617
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,920
You need to make it clear

618
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,799
I'm on a boat.

619
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,720
You were a drowning person.

620
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,039
You were just lucky enough

621
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,240
who managed to grab my boat.

622
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,920
Asking me to save you.

623
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,640
Got it?

624
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:39,559
However,

625
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,279
I can kick you out at any time.

626
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,000
Also,

627
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,240
I'm telling you, being second best.

628
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm not helping you for nothing.

629
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,039
From now on,

630
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
you are Zhao An's subordinate on the surface,

631
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,920
but you actually work for me.

632
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
From now on, you must do whatever

633
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,319
In the future.

634
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,240
But you can't ask me

635
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,279
why I asked you to do that.

636
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,359
What I told you.

637
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,559
What I asked you to do.

638
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,559
Got it?

639
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,880
I got it.

640
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,880
If you still can't understand,

641
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
then this knife

642
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,839
appeared in the evidence room

643
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,640
at the military police headquarters

644
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,119
chief Chen

645
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,759
will you ask me to do

646
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,920
will you ask me to do many bad things?

647
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
Brother.

648
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,039
Is it good or bad?

649
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,319
You'll find it out one day.

650
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,519
Got to go.

651
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,599
I... I'm leaving with you.

652
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,960
Why come with me?

653
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,599
Have you finished your work?

654
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,400
And you are leaving?

655
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Didn't I arrange the scene well?

656
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,759
What are you decorating?

657
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,720
In case you find anything.

658
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,880
Are there any footprints here?

659
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,119
Are there anything else?

660
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,119
That's unexpected.

661
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,119
You have to do it

662
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,759
as I told you?

663
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,599
You know what?

664
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,759
The Military Police Command

665
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,079
find no evidence

666
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,039
the case was sewed up.

667
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,359
If the case is closed. Understand?

668
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,759
Got it!

669
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,480
This is...

670
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:06,920
How long

671
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,680
by myself?

672
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,799
You can work whenever you want.

673
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,720
You know what?

674
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,519
Six in the morning.

675
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,920
The cleaners will come to clean the place

676
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:18,880
chief Chen, don't worry

677
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,640
lower your voice

678
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,480
leave it to me, Second Blade.

679
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,920
Take care.

680
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,359
Do you feel any better now?

681
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,119
Tell me honestly.

682
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,279
What kind of organization?

683
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,880
Didn't I tell you before?

684
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,319
Blood Soul Group?

685
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,839
Youth Patriotic Organization.

686
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,240
Zuo Shuangtao, you lied to me.

687
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,279
I could hear you clearly

688
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,079
you said you're Juntong.

689
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,880
Are you the military commander or not?

690
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,759
You heard it.

691
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,480
Why are you asking me that?

692
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,039
Are you really a military commander?

693
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,200
I didn't expect that.

694
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,759
My...

695
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,480
My wife is a military commander.

696
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:36,880
Over the years,

697
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
I have been cautious

698
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,599
speak and act cautiously

699
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,799
I can sail for tens of thousands of years.

700
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,519
But unexpectedly,

701
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,119
I'm a ship filled with explosives.

702
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,480
So what are you going to do?

703
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,240
Report me?

704
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,519
You have no conscience.

705
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,519
I'll report you.

706
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,519
If I want to report you,

707
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,359
why would I save you?

708
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,240
I'll report you.

709
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,119
But you killed Mu Cun just now,

710
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,359
you're a master

711
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,359
even if they're in the military.

712
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,640
Tell me. Where did you learn it?

713
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,639
And combined with all your previous experiences,

714
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,559
It makes me less and less convinced

715
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:14,000
you're just a small traitor who dawdles on.

716
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,239
Are you one of those

717
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,480
lying on the other line.

718
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,320
Or

719
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,960
the Communist Party of China?

720
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,079
Now, I'm asking you

721
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,199
the other way around.

722
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,599
To ask me?

723
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,960
Be honest with me.

724
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,639
What's your purpose in the hospital?

725
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,440
What task?

726
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,559
Do you think I'll tell you my mission?

727
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Do you think I want to know

728
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,400
I want to know about the missions?

729
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,440
That's good for me.

730
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,840
But I did that to save you.

731
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,440
And to save myself. I...

732
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,599
Do you know who I killed today?

733
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,400
Kimura Kenzo,

734
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,840
head of the Intelligence Division of Military Police Headquarters.

735
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,039
Yes

736
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,239
right now,

737
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm threatening you

738
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,239
that Mu Cun was killed

739
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,840
he created the scene

740
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,400
mu Cun and the doctor here.

741
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,679
But what if I make mistakes?

742
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,800
What if I didn't think of anything?

743
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,159
Then we're both finished.

744
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
Where is that?

745
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,760
That's the Military Police Headquarters!

746
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,880
It's hard to offend Military Police Headquarters

747
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,559
so I'm telling you that Zuo Shuangtao

748
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,360
you have to tell me.

749
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
You have to tell me every scene.

750
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,599
Then I can figure out

751
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,000
how to face it next.

752
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,199
Whatever we are about to face.

753
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,360
Hurry up.

754
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,239
My mission was

755
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,960
to track down a traitor

756
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,400
who hid in Yan'an.

757
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,480
Why are you tracking Magpie?

758
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,719
He stole the formula of the Chinese Communist Party's border paper

759
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,559
the formula?

760
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,719
Have you got the formula?

761
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,880
I haven't.

762
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,559
Left Twin Peach.

763
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,880
Are you still hiding something from me?

764
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:00,800
You know what?

765
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,719
If you don't tell me the truth now,

766
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,559
we'll both be dead.

767
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,840
I'm not lying.

768
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,719
I suspected Magpie hid the formula in her wound.

769
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,760
So I opened it with a dagger.

770
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,400
But I didn't find it.

771
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,679
But I found a piece of brown paper.

772
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,840
This proves my judgment is right.

773
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
But maybe someone

774
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,679
perhaps someone took it earlier.

775
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
By someone.

776
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,440
Could it be that this magpie

777
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,159
gave the formula to someone?

778
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,840
Left Shuangtao.

779
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,559
You still don't want to tell me the truth?

780
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,599
I tell you the truth.

781
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm not interested in

782
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,239
your confidential information.

783
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,760
Maybe it's done.

784
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,480
What deal?

785
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,760
Chongqing sent someone to negotiate with Magpie.

786
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,440
They wanted to buy the formula with a heavy price.

787
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,000
Chongqing.

788
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,039
Why did Chongqing use the paper formula of the currency?

789
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,559
They wanted to forge the border currency

790
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,119
and destroy the Border Region's economy and finance.

791
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,519
But since the deal has been over,

792
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,719
why did they send you to find Magpie?

793
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,360
They wanted to kill Magpie before doing the deal

794
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,519
and get back the formula.

795
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,360
But they failed in the previous operation

796
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,679
my superior has suspended the mission.

797
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,159
All the missions have been suspended.

798
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,679
So what did you do today?

799
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,639
Left Twin Peach.

800
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,960
I've decided to disobey your order.

801
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,880
I must get back the formula first.

802
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,159
Traitor.

803
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,480
You are a traitor.

804
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:50,519
What you are doing is a traitor.

805
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,360
I knew that.

806
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,519
But do you know?

807
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,559
The counterfeiting plan

808
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,159
It would undermine the united Anti-Japanese War.

809
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,639
And desecrate the martyrs

810
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,320
who made the sacrifice to resist Japan and save the country.

811
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,199
Come on.

812
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,079
Left Twin Peach.

813
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,079
You are not only a spy from the military commander,

814
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,679
but also sympathize

815
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,800
and support the CCP?

816
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,920
You know what that is?

817
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,639
You're doubly guilty

818
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,360
what's wrong with supporting CCP?

819
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,800
I think that

820
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,159
perhaps the ideas and beliefs of the CPC

821
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,639
are the right way for China to come.

822
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,079
You dare to tell me anything now?

823
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:32,840
As long as it's the truth,

824
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,159
I dare to say that.

825
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:34,960
Fine, fine.

826
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
That's enough.

827
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,840
Don't tell me these anymore. No.

828
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,519
I have already taken down

829
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,719
the clues that you mentioned.

830
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,760
Let me think about it.

831
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,519
Think about it carefully.

832
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,480
See if there's anything missing.

833
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,159
Sleep early, sleep early.

834
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,480
Also, let me tell you something.

835
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,679
Let's both go to work tomorrow

836
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,639
and act like nothing happened.

837
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,800
As usual.

838
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,599
Hold on.

839
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,199
What are you doing?

840
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,239
What are you doing?

841
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,360
I saved you today.

842
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
You can't kill me.

843
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:05,960
It is...

844
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,719
I am a traitor.

845
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,280
But I really didn't do anything bad.

846
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
What I told you today

847
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,360
If you dare reveal one word about it,

848
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,000
I... I won't tell anyone!

849
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,840
Don't worry.

850
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,280
I will never

851
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,519
I will never tell anyone.

852
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,599
It's not a joke.

853
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,840
It's not a joke!

854
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,199
Let me tell you something.

855
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,800
I only have four handles of

856
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,199
this family has four more.

857
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,760
There is another Browning M1935

858
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,000
And a Colt pistol.

859
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,199
The Register of Foreign Ministers was assassinated

860
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
the puppet Foreign Minister.

861
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,239
And three American MK grenades,

862
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,639
and one bottle of cyanide.

863
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,920
Was used to poison the 5th Wing of the Japanese Navy in Guangzhou.

864
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,679
And killed 19 people with the poison.

865
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,119
Don't.

866
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,280
It's alright.

867
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,159
Please

868
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,119
I don't want to know these.

869
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,280
I don't want to know about it.

870
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,039
I... I saved you because I needed my wits out of desperation.

871
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:55,800
Because I love you.

872
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
What about me?

873
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
You may rest assured.

874
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,519
Alright?

875
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,239
Alright.

876
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,039
Come here.

877
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Why should I go there?

878
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,199
Sleep together.

879
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,159
Why are you sleeping together?

880
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,199
Don't married couples sleep together?

881
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,159
Recently,

882
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,199
sleep separately recently?

883
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,679
You saved me today

884
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I forgive you.

885
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,519
Don't.

886
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,840
Come on.

887
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:28,760
Sorry.

888
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:29,960
Guoguo.

889
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,159
Are you going to kill me

890
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,199
In my sleep?

891
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,800
Jia Ping,

892
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,440
If I died today,

893
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,920
would you miss me?

894
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,000
I will.

895
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,800
I'll think about it for a long time.

896
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,760
That's why

897
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,880
from now on, even for me,

898
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,639
In the future,

899
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,639
and protect yourself.

900
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,760
If it's to blame, it's the time we live in,

901
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,079
It's the Japanese.

902
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,639
Why did they start the war?

903
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,119
I remember you said

904
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,159
the beliefs and ideas of the CPC

905
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,039
are the future of China.

906
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,360
Are you serious?

907
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,000
Actually,

908
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,960
I secretly read the interrogation report of Mr. Lu.

909
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,679
I found that their faith

910
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,679
are powerful

911
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
and hopeful.

912
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,039
They would rather die than surrender.

913
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,679
Is admirable.

914
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
We must stay alive.

915
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,519
Only when we are alive,

916
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,280
can you have hope.

917
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,000
Promise me that

918
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,280
to do anything against the Chinese.

919
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,639
I remember that.

920
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,880
Are you sure that man was a magpie?

921
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,960
As sure as a gun

922
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,119
I've ordered you to stop the mission.

923
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,480
Why are you still following him?

924
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,840
I don't want to give up easily.

925
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,519
Is it because you don't want to give up easily?

926
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,360
Do you have no other motives?
