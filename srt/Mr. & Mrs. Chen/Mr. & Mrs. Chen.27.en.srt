1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,840
Today's show of sympathy is about to begin.

2
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,519
Soldiers of the Empire

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,599
for the great cause of East Asia's co-prosperity,

4
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,959
for your participation in the Holy War,

5
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,519
on behalf of all the officers and men,

6
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,920
on behalf of all the officers and soldiers.

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Applause.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,680
For the empire.

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,239
What about

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,920
I still can't make it.

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,639
When are you going to give me the key?

12
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,840
To be honest,

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,159
when you were not here,

14
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,120
I've looked through the entire house.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
I really want to know

16
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
where you hid the key now.

17
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,560
You haven't opened my book, have you?

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
You are a traitor!

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
I am not.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,639
It's from Japan.

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,000
And the one in your hand,

22
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,800
there are seven keys in total.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,479
The Wave dance begins.

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,159
Of the First Ranking.

25
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,080
What do you mean?

26
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,080
What do I mean?

27
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,919
Hurry up.

28
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,240
Hurry up.

29
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,000
A little lower.

30
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,879
Move down a bit.

31
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,360
To the right.

32
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
Hurry up!

33
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,759
Take it back!

34
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,519
What's up

35
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,439
put it back.

36
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,639
Where's the key?

37
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Shine the light on it.

38
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,879
A little forward.

39
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,680
Watch out!

40
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
To the left.

41
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,519
Give it to me.

42
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,199
Come on.

43
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,759
This is the last chance.

44
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,839
It's coming!

45
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,399
To the right.

46
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
This is the second key.

47
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,040
Commander Shanxia is anxious to see me.

48
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,319
What is it?

49
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,959
According to Jiang Zhaoguo's information,

50
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,800
we contacted

51
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,279
the spy in Communist Zone.

52
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,600
Verified that an alias Li Yupu

53
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,839
who was involved in the design and printing of the currency.

54
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,319
He absconded a while ago.

55
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,519
Look at this.

56
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,920
This photo is of

57
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,200
this is an surveillance video of

58
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,240
who lurked in Yan'an Communist Zone

59
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,360
after his identity was exposed,

60
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,639
he stole the copper engraving in the border area

61
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,279
I think I've seen this person recently.

62
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,000
He looks familiar.

63
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,519
You met him?

64
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,600
I remember that

65
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,120
we have caught this person.

66
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,840
He is currently detained

67
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,120
of Military Police Headquarters.

68
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,480
Really?

69
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,480
To make it through.

70
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,639
Now we have to fight.

71
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,679
Rush there!

72
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,879
Don't take the risk!

73
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Let me think.

74
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,399
What for? We have no time.

75
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,679
If you don't leave, I will.

76
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,080
It's almost over. Give me the key.

77
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,919
Give me the key.

78
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,519
Wang Dapu.

79
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,600
Wang Dapu?

80
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,440
How did you know about Dayan?

81
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,080
It's me.

82
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,679
I was...

83
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,720
I heard it from...

84
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,320
From Manager Luo.

85
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,840
How did you know

86
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,399
wang Dapu is Dayan's?

87
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,639
I saw him making the key

88
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,519
In the cell.

89
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,320
This is extremely exquisite.

90
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,440
I heard that

91
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,799
dayan was a bronze carver.

92
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,279
So I guessed

93
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,440
wang Dapu could be Dayan.

94
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,759
In that case,

95
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,840
why didn't you report it to us?

96
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,399
Officer Uchida.

97
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,159
If I report to you,

98
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,559
he will be arrested and interrogated for several times.

99
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,519
But he will keep his mouth shut.

100
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,559
However,

101
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,519
I was thinking...

102
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,120
If I escape with him,

103
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,000
I might be able to find the copper plate.

104
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,879
You think I'll believe you?

105
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,279
The five of hearts

106
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,080
are a team, aren't they?

107
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,000
Officer Uchida.

108
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
I'm really not the Five of Hearts.

109
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,519
If I can find the copper plate this time,

110
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,039
to prove my innocence.

111
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,399
Uchida Officer, please trust me.

112
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,240
But Wang Dapu doesn't trust you.

113
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,679
He ran away.

114
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,960
To trap you here.

115
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,840
Officer Uchida.

116
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,720
Think about it.

117
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,960
If Wang Dapu is really

118
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,320
with Wang Dapu,

119
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,360
how could he leave me behind?

120
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,159
Wang Dapu is now gone,

121
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,039
you can't get close to him anymore.

122
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,759
I can find him.

123
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,759
Is that so?

124
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,600
On Mai Yang Road,

125
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,600
an abandoned oil factory on Mai Yang Road

126
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,600
why?

127
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,320
After he was locked up,

128
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
the only time he left the detention center

129
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,279
was to work at the oil factory

130
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,159
he knows the environment

131
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,039
and he's very familiar with the environment.

132
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,879
The Gendarmes are looking for him

133
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,360
I think

134
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
he must be hiding there.

135
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,480
Uchida Officer.

136
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
I will find the copper plate.

137
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
Please trust me.

138
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,919
Please trust me.

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,320
Alright.

140
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,320
I'll give you this opportunity.

141
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,240
Thank you, Officer Ueda.

142
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,919
Chen Jiaping is dead.

143
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,720
That's impossible.

144
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,639
Officer Uchida.

145
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,360
Is that a joke?

146
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,720
Why would I?

147
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,879
How did he die?

148
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,399
Who killed him?

149
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,240
I killed him myself.

150
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,240
Why did you kill him?

151
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,559
He escaped from prison with a criminal.

152
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,480
And were caught on the spot.

153
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,240
Prison break?

154
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,799
Why is that?

155
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,720
Officer Uchida.

156
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,159
We found her.

157
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,600
Five of hearts is Zhao An.

158
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,720
Chen Jia Ping is innocent,

159
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,559
are you blaming me

160
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,039
for killing innocent people?

161
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,799
I didn't mean that.

162
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,279
That boy is to blame.

163
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
He was unlucky.

164
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,159
You are anxious to see Director Jiang?

165
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,799
What exactly is it?

166
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,879
Something important?

167
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Where's Director Jiang?

168
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,080
He is having a meeting inside.

169
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,559
Please.

170
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,600
We haven't contacted Dayan for a long time.

171
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,799
If we contact him rashly,

172
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,400
when we contact him, right?

173
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,319
Do you think that

174
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,200
to the wild goose?

175
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,759
We might run into those who come from Yan'an.

176
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,599
Or caught by the Japanese.

177
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,680
It's all possible.

178
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,839
I heard you wanted to see me.

179
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,599
Left Shuangtao, what are you doing?

180
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,960
Drop the gun!

181
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,119
Put it down!

182
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,759
Why did you do this?

183
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,839
Left Twin Peach.

184
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,960
Do you know what you're doing?

185
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,519
Put the gun down!

186
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,079
Why you want to frame Chen Jia Ping?

187
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
I framed Chen Jia Ping?

188
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,839
Didn't you know it was to protect you?

189
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:02,880
However,

190
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
chen Jia Ping died.

191
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
Chen Family Ping died?

192
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,599
He was killed by you.

193
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,599
Chen Jiaping is dead?

194
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,519
That a traitor might die,

195
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,640
or a hidden CCP is dead.

196
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,480
Do you have to be that sad?

197
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,000
Director Jiang,

198
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
don't you have anyone you love?

199
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,000
Have you ever loved anyone?

200
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,160
Don't forget that

201
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,519
you are doing a mission

202
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,519
chen Jia Ping is a tool you pretended to use.

203
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,680
When did you start separating private interests from private interests?

204
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,440
Have you ever suspected

205
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,119
about Chen Jia Ping's identity?

206
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,319
Or did you already suspect that?

207
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,640
But you kept it a secret from me.

208
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,119
You can even say that

209
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,359
your faith has started to deteriorate.

210
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,720
My belief has not changed.

211
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,279
You are changing.

212
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,599
It's you all.

213
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
Everything you're doing right now

214
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,759
Is still anti-Japanese and saving the country?

215
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,240
Are you still doing all that?

216
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Your so-called counterfeiting plan

217
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,559
that you were trying to forge the border?

218
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,400
It is our Anti-Japanese Alliance.

219
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,680
And millions of Chinese people.

220
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Why are you doing this?

221
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,680
Director Jiang,

222
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,079
I know my subordinates well.

223
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,400
Zuo Shuangtao was acting on impulse.

224
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,599
Let her go outside to calm down.

225
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,519
Let her go out to calm down.

226
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,640
Lock her up first.

227
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,720
Alright.

228
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
Come on.

229
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,960
It's fine if you always complain to me.

230
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,000
How can you really

231
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,279
look at yourself.

232
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,119
Answer me sincerely.

233
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,279
Was I really wrong?

234
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,200
We are all executors of orders.

235
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,039
Political issues are complicated.

236
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,119
They have their own reasons

237
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,680
they have their own reasons.

238
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,759
We don't need to ask too much.

239
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,319
But I don't think

240
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,519
you are not as determined as before

241
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,240
how did Chen Jia Ping die?

242
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,119
He and another wanted criminal

243
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,079
were caught...

244
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,599
When he escaped from the prison.

245
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,759
It was Neitian.

246
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,599
Uchida killed him with her own hands.

247
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,519
Did you see the corpse?

248
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,440
I think

249
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,880
he'll give you a surprise.

250
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,640
Do you think

251
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,039
chen Jiaping will still be alive?

252
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,960
You really love him.

253
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Really?

254
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not qualified to love him.

255
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,440
I shouldn't have agreed to your marriage.

256
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,960
Captain Liu.

257
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,519
Although you're strict,

258
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,400
I think you're different from Director Jiang.

259
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,599
I can feel

260
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
I can feel it.

261
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,079
The shiny thing

262
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,559
I know what's in your mind.

263
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,960
I went through that, too.

264
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,640
I also want to talk to you.

265
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,200
But today is not the right time.

266
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,559
Another time.

267
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,559
Captain Liu.

268
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,319
Do you think

269
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,480
could Chen Jiaping

270
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
give us a surprise this time?

271
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
Have you figured out how to get out?

272
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,480
How did you get out?

273
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,640
The power was cut.

274
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,799
Lead Nishimura here to grab the key.

275
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,839
Officer Uchida.

276
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,000
Please stab me.

277
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,640
You're trying to save me.

278
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,160
Although I was wounded,

279
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm still alive.

280
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,640
You can't die.

281
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,519
You are the God.

282
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm not going to kick your ass.

283
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,680
I won't die.

284
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,359
Listen to me.

285
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,599
Now if you kill me,

286
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,480
you won't be able to go out.

287
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,200
And killing me

288
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,759
It won't do you any good.

289
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,759
Then I can keep you,

290
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,720
what good does that do me?

291
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,920
I can give you money,

292
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
just like our promise.

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,799
You want to lie to me again?

294
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,920
In this case,

295
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,519
I won't lie to you.

296
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,559
Or we end up

297
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,839
and end up with each other.

298
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,599
I can swear that

299
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,680
as long as we're both out,

300
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,440
I'll pay you back.

301
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,039
Without money,

302
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,279
It's useless to go out.

303
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,319
Right?

304
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:57,920
Where is the money?

305
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm hiding somewhere

306
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,640
could not be found by others.

307
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,279
Where is it?

308
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,559
I can take you there.

309
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,359
But what if I tell you

310
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,839
what if you kill me?

311
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,680
You can't get out here either.

312
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,440
Do you have a way?

313
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,920
Pushan Villa's cars

314
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
pass by every night.

315
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,880
Pushanzhuang.

316
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,079
A charity organized by Mr. Du.

317
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,559
People died of starvation in the city.

318
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,039
Pushan Zhuang's cars will

319
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,240
pull them out of the city

320
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,440
and buried them.

321
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,160
Get down and help!

322
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Come over there.

323
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:41,440
Great Lord.

324
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,119
Pass, please.

325
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,559
Thank you, Your Majesty.

326
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:52,720
Hold on.

327
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,000
Captain!

328
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
It was Pushanzhuang's carriage.

329
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
The carriage that dragged those dead people is here again.

330
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,000
That's right.

331
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
Why would I not believe it?

332
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,440
So many dead people?

333
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,000
I've checked already.

334
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,119
There're dead bodies.

335
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,839
Let them go.

336
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,519
Yes

337
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,920
stop.

338
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,920
I can't hold it in anymore.

339
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,359
I'll go with you.

340
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,319
Come on.

341
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,160
Are you sure the box is still in the hotel?

342
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,359
Don't worry.

343
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,000
He must be there.

344
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,359
I was captured by a traitor.

345
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,000
The Japanese don't know about the box.

346
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,559
What about

347
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,400
did you find him?

348
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,839
That's not necessary.

349
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,519
Once fired,

350
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,000
and disturbs the guests in the hotel,

351
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,319
the Japanese might catch him again.

352
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,440
The loss outweighs the gain.

353
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,119
If that comes to the case,

354
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,319
stop acting.

355
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,440
What you want

356
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
Is not money at all.

357
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,000
Back in Maoshan Mountain,

358
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,519
you were in my class.

359
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,680
Are you a Communist Party member?

360
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,960
What are you talking about?

361
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,119
Did you recognize the wrong person?

362
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,519
You forgot my ability to remember everything.

363
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,440
I recognized you when I first met you in the detention center.

364
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,680
When I first saw you

365
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,359
what you want

366
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,119
Is another thing in the box.

367
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,920
You know clearly

368
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,440
you know it clearly.

369
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,119
If you say that,

370
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,319
we're no longer in the same boat.

371
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,039
I've never been in the same boat

372
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,920
with your Communist Party.

373
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,640
Captain Liu,

374
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,480
dayan got in touch.

375
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,559
Two-peach.

376
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,000
I have a good news for you

377
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,559
chen Jiaping should still be alive

378
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,440
really

379
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,880
but his real identity

380
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,599
he's a Communist Party member.

381
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,599
Communist Party?

382
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,039
Is there any evidence?

383
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,920
It's our guy who escaped with him.

384
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,039
The name is Wang Dapu.

385
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,559
When he was lurking in Yan'an,

386
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,039
he stole the copper plate of the coin

387
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,319
chen Jiaping tried to get it back,

388
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,680
but he couldn't.

389
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,079
And Wang Dapu

390
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,039
I met him in Maoshan Mountain before.

391
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,839
He is a Communist Party member.

392
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,279
That he is a Communist Party.

393
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,480
Where Chen Jiaping is now?

394
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,759
Wang Dapu wanted to get rid of him,

395
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,000
but he ran away.

396
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,160
No one knows now.

397
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,119
What about

398
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
are you feeling better now?

399
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,039
But later,

400
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,240
you have to apologize to Director Jiang with me.

401
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,960
He's in a good mood.

402
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,680
Maybe he can show you a side of the net.

403
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,240
I won't go.

404
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,759
Listen to me.

405
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,640
That's a must.

406
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
Captain Liu,

407
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,880
how should I apologize to Director Jiang?

408
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,160
You've contributed a lot this time

409
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,240
as an undercover in Yan'an for many years

410
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,599
mastermind with painstaking effort

411
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,759
to finally get this priceless

412
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,000
this priceless copper coin.

413
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,440
The interests of the party and state come first.

414
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,640
For the sake of the overall interests of the Party and state,

415
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,599
work with utter devotion

416
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,559
until my heart stops beating

417
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,559
come.

418
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,160
Have a seat.

419
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,880
Sit down.

420
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,680
Director Jiang,

421
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,920
I've just talked to Zuo Shuangtao.

422
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,160
She also regrets very much

423
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,279
what she did.

424
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,119
Why not let her write a self-review

425
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,680
to reflect on herself.

426
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,440
Director Jiang,

427
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,839
you can punish me as you like.

428
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,319
You just want me to pour a cup of wine for you.

429
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,279
Is that OK?

430
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,680
We can celebrate together.

431
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:05,960
Alright!

432
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,799
Let's celebrate together.

433
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,519
Chief, please.

434
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,480
Come on.

435
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:13,759
Come on.

436
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,160
Thank you, Director.

437
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,119
To help us

438
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,920
obtaining the copper plate of the coins.

439
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,759
For the Imperial Concubine Qiao.

440
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,880
To the

441
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,839
the first successful step of our plan.

442
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,680
Cheers!

443
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,480
Cheers.

444
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,119
The Communist Party of China

445
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,160
the Chinese Communist Party border area?

446
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,319
To be honest,

447
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,920
after two years of observation and research,

448
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,759
they are thriving.

449
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,400
Over time,

450
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,359
a great threat to the Party and the state.

451
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,680
So it is more important

452
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,640
Is more important than anti-Japanese war.

453
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,799
The chairman said

454
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,039
the Japanese are a threat to us,

455
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,240
but the Communists are the most dangerous.

456
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,799
Destroying the economy of the border region.

457
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,680
Is the most important now.

458
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,079
Director, please be discerning.

459
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,079
But it came from one of the magpies.

460
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,400
The formula for the border currency printing paper

461
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,000
Is still missing.

462
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,880
That's right.

463
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,840
I've been thinking about the same thing.

464
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,639
If the formula is really

465
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,559
where's the copper plate?

466
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's gone.

467
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,880
Are you leaving?

468
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,719
Let me see you off.

469
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,280
Where is Left Shuangtao?

470
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,719
He went that way.

471
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,280
Chase them!

472
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,960
She can't run far.

473
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,639
Let's look for her separately.

474
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,519
Yes

475
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,159
stop.

476
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,559
Turn around.

477
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,079
Give me the copper plate.

478
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
You know how important

479
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Is to me?

480
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,519
You traitor.

481
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,840
Come on.

482
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,119
How are you?

483
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:18,840
Are you all right?

484
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,920
Why are you here?

485
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,159
I almost fell into his hands.

486
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,159
After I escaped, I followed him secretly

487
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,079
I got it

488
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,239
so you know about my identity.

489
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,800
Know?

490
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,119
Then you also know that

491
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,000
what that means

492
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,639
what does that mean?

493
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,400
I know.

494
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,920
Why did you do that?

495
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,280
For the belief

496
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
that I once lost and now I've found back.

497
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,639
Jiang Zhaoguo and others are looking for me.

498
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,840
I'll distract them.

499
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,559
Stop joking around.

500
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,719
We should go together.

501
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,719
They don't know you're here.

502
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,840
Their target is me.

503
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,159
You have a chance to escape.

504
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,079
You know I'm right.

505
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,519
That the copper plate

506
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,119
get the hands of Jiang Zhaoguo.

507
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,400
Alright?

508
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,199
Take this.

509
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Let's each take one.

510
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,239
Even if either of us gets caught,

511
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,320
we will have access to the other party.

512
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,480
Got it?

513
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,599
See you at home.

514
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,440
Come on.

515
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,960
Stop!

516
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,239
There are people around us.

517
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,960
You won't be able to get away.

518
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,519
Don't worry.

519
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,840
Captain Liu told me to

520
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
that he hid you here.

521
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,199
The headquarters.

522
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,000
That's right.

523
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,320
Captain Liu ordered me to save you.

524
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,599
Luckily I found you before Director Jiang's men

525
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,519
before Director Jiang's men got there.

526
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,719
Thank you

527
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,079
jia Ping.

528
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,320
Zhou Qingfang saved me.

529
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,320
I almost got caught just now.

530
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,079
Sorry

531
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
who told you about this place?

532
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,199
Liu Wuchang.

533
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:37,800
Then

534
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,559
you guys hide here for a while.

535
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,079
I'll meet up with Captain Liu.

536
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,639
Director Jiang may even send people

537
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,079
to search for you everywhere.

538
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,880
Make sure you're safe before you leave.

539
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,280
Alright.

540
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,280
I ran into Liu Wuchang just now.

541
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,639
I thought

542
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,000
he wanted the copper plate.

543
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
But unexpectedly,

544
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,639
he told me a secret way to avoid the search

545
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,760
then I'll come.

546
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,400
Captain Liu and Jiang Zhaoguo are different people.

547
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:22,719
Right.

548
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,119
I misunderstood him before.

549
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,880
But now,

550
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,719
he chose the right way.

551
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,119
I have many questions for you.

552
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,840
Just go ahead.

553
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,800
You'll be four of clubs.

554
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,239
When did you join the Communist Party?

555
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,559
Nanjing.

556
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Before you knew me,

557
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,239
when I first met you,

558
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,320
I was confused,

559
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,039
I didn't know what the future held in China.

560
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,400
Or mine.

561
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,079
But the communist ideology

562
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,000
showed me the way.

563
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,000
We would be together.

564
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,559
Why didn't I notice at all?

565
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,400
What about the organization?

566
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,320
Let me join the Communist Party secretly.

567
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,840
But I wanted to keep my original identity.

568
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Then

569
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,119
you didn't show up on the day we agreed to register the marriage.

570
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,119
Why did you lie to me?

571
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I'm not lying to you.

572
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,280
In fact, our organization has approved

573
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,800
our marriage application.

574
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,440
But there was an assignment that day.

575
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,559
And it was my first mission.

576
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,719
And left without saying goodbye.

577
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
After that, he asked me

578
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,400
and asked me to carry out an undercover task.

579
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,360
I knew at that moment

580
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,920
I could never return to you again.

581
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,159
That's why

582
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,280
you left me in Nanjing.

583
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,440
Actually, I went back once.

584
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,199
But we have discipline.

585
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,639
That's why I couldn't meet you.

586
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,920
And then you left Nanjing.

587
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,880
That's when

588
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,760
I first met Jun Tong at that time.

589
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,159
And we have taken different paths since then.

590
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,000
But we reach the same goal by taking different paths.

591
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,840
Don't we meet again in Shanghai?

592
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:25,880
In Shanghai?

593
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,480
That day in Shanghai...

594
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,280
You were carrying out a CPC mission?

595
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,559
Zhao An almost found me anyway.

596
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,800
I have to come up with a reasonable reason

597
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,119
to prove why I was at the train station.

598
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,159
So you used me.

599
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,519
You also used me.

600
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,840
Otherwise, how can I clear your suspicion of assassinating Shangshan Hu?

601
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,119
I did use you.

602
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,000
But when I saw you,

603
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,199
to see you.

604
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,679
What about you?

605
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:57,960
Are you happy?

606
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:57,119
Are you happy?
