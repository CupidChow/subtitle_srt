1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,239
I knew a Japanese army officer

2
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,519
I knew a Japanese officer.

3
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,680
Called Martial Master Yamashita.

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,480
His man Ueda Naoki saved my life.

5
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,840
I've got all the things

6
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,319
when do we leave?

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,239
Don't be anxious.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,719
I have something

9
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,040
I want to tell you.

10
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,239
Mr. Jiang,

11
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,239
let me introduce to you.

12
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,480
This is my friend.

13
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,359
Ding Qiu Yang.

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
Hello, Miss Cold Dew.

15
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,719
Hello

16
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,400
nice to meet you.

17
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,680
I watched a lot of

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
I've watched many of them.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,560
Now that I see you in person,

20
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,000
the movies

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
In those films.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
What a pity!

23
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,759
Thank you.

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
He's also a director.

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,639
I'm looking forward to working with Miss Han Lu.

26
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,599
I have a friend there.

27
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,080
I won't bother you.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,759
Alright.

29
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,039
When are we leaving?

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,639
Don't be anxious.

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,439
Come, sit down.

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
I came to Shanghai this time

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,680
things didn't go well.

34
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,439
And then I'm back to Chongqing,

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
I'm afraid that it won't be easy for me to stay at home.

36
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,319
The nation is in difficulty now.

37
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319
Successive distresses as caused by continual wars

38
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,000
and I

39
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,719
I also have responsibilities.

40
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,159
Do you think

41
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,159
why would I let you run around

42
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,240
run around here and there

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,280
In the city?

44
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,599
That's why

45
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,240
I can't take you away this time.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,759
So it's the same as before?

47
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,800
I made all the high pledges to you

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,560
were just to make me happy for the moment.

49
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,120
You'd leave me behind.

50
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,039
I also want to spend my life with you.

51
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,919
Follow shadow

52
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,280
to live and work in peace.

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,199
But I'm still the enemy of my country and family.

54
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,439
How dare I expect

55
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,159
will you marry me?

56
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm serious this time.

57
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,080
Please give me more time.

58
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,599
I promise you that

59
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,599
I'll come back to get you,

60
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,639
to take you as my bride.

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,800
Really

62
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,000
really.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,639
By the way, you're on a mission today.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,759
I followed you to the scene.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,879
I thought

66
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,680
although my gun has been confiscated,

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,319
but I will

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
can I follow her to check it out?

69
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,040
Guess who I saw then?

70
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,839
Who?

71
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,160
Left Pair Tao.

72
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,120
I was thinking

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
why was she there?

74
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,399
She had a chat with a nun.

75
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,639
Nun?

76
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,519
What? Interested in it?

77
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,959
I know you have a habit of collecting women's clothes.

78
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,240
What's more, you need a nun's gown.

79
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,839
Just go.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,800
I have changed.

81
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,000
I just remembered that

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,279
the one who rescued Jiang Zhaoguo

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,920
who saved Jiang Zhaoguo this afternoon.

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,680
Really?

85
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,279
Why don't you investigate it then?

86
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,160
For nothing? I will.

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,959
The nun covered her face

88
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,399
she couldn't see her face at all

89
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,079
moreover, that place is French Concession,

90
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,639
today, there were explosion and shots

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,519
we didn't even have time to run away

92
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,519
why bother investigating a nun?

93
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,360
In your opinion,

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
do you think that nun

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,839
who pretended to be me?

96
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,639
Ding Qiuyang will take care of you

97
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,360
ding Qiuyang will take care of you for me.

98
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,680
Also,

99
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,639
he will also help you

100
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,040
your future career development.

101
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Why didn't you mention it before?

102
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,240
I have a friend like this.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,160
He only became a director in the past two years.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,560
Also,

105
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,240
If a spy bothers you again,

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
you can ask him for help.

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
Isn't he a director?

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes

109
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,040
but he has

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,800
he has many ways to do it.

111
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,959
How are you going to Chongqing this time?

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,560
Is this a secret too?

113
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,720
Will you call me

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,160
when you arrive in Chongqing?

115
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,839
Of course I will.

116
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,800
Of course I will contact you.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,720
That's good.

118
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,839
It's good that

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,959
even when I'm not around.

120
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,399
All right.

121
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,199
Then you

122
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,720
take care.

123
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,639
This time,

124
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,920
Is it real?

125
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,759
Of course it is.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,240
Of course it is true.

127
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,120
I love you.

128
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,560
Me too.

129
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,759
Let's go now!

130
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,920
I'll beat you to death, anti-Japanese elements!

131
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
- Brother Qi! - Seventh Brother!

132
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:17,879
What happened?

133
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,600
Chief Chen

134
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,399
he was drunk

135
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,120
how could he stab someone with my knife?

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,160
You killed this man?

137
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,399
He was anti-Japanese.

138
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,040
What evidence do you have?

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,800
He passed by our table

140
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,559
he called us traitors.

141
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,240
Isn't this evidence?

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
How dare you kill someone

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,960
because they scolded you?

144
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,759
Scolding me is scolding Chairman Wang,

145
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,679
and the empire of Japan.

146
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,039
If he should be dead or not.

147
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,440
Calm down, calm down.

148
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,879
Calm down!

149
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,679
Section Chief Chen!

150
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,399
Section Chief Chen?

151
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,559
We are colleagues after all.

152
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
How dare you hit me?

153
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,559
Cool down.

154
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,639
How dare you hit me?

155
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,720
Keep calm. Keep cool.

156
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,440
I'll bring him with me.

157
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,559
I'll sober him up.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,279
-Come on. -Let go of me.

159
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,000
Come on.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
He beat me with the second best.

161
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,639
Brother Qi!

162
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,639
You jerk! What are you?

163
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,159
How dare you hit me?

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,840
Brother Qi!

165
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,279
Don't lose the great for the little.

166
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,440
I'll kill him!

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,679
Forget about it.

168
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,200
Second best knife.

169
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,879
Forget about it.

170
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,399
- Beat me! - He...

171
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,440
Brother, forget about it.

172
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,679
Don't bother.

173
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,440
How about this?

174
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,279
I'll beat him to death later.

175
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:25,799
What about

176
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,759
I will beat Chen Jiaping.

177
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,399
Don't argue with him, okay?

178
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
How dare you hit me?

179
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,159
Ling Xiao, cool down. Cool down.

180
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,360
Come on.

181
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,679
Come on.

182
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,399
Wipe your sweat.

183
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,519
What's this?

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,679
A woman's thing.

185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,039
Haven't you changed it?

186
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,120
Why would you steal from a woman?

187
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
I did change it.

188
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,000
I used to steal lingerie.

189
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,879
But now you can see.

190
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
This sachet is considered elegant.

191
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,440
Have I made progress?

192
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,200
You know what?

193
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,559
I didn't steal this.

194
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,000
I picked this up.

195
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,720
Which girl does he belong to?

196
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,000
It's from the Left Double-peach.

197
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,600
Where did you find it?

198
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,120
Do you remember that some time ago,

199
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,440
the warrior under the mountain pretended to be the Communist Party of China

200
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,600
to identify Chen Jiaping.

201
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
Zhao An even hung him on the tree.

202
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,440
When I found him.

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,320
After Chen Jia Ping is killed,

204
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,440
his woman is yours.

205
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,639
I can't control that woman.

206
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,799
I smelled her perfume satchel.

207
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,200
To find you.

208
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,919
Look, it's made of yun brocade.

209
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,799
I didn't expect that

210
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,120
you can buy good things at the train station.

211
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,279
How did you know you bought them from the train station?

212
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,960
She said it herself.

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
On the day she first came to Shanghai,

214
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,200
when Zhao An interrogated her,

215
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,399
It's fragrant.

216
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,879
Where did you get it from?

217
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,399
She was bought at the railway station.

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,960
Didn't she come from Wuhan to Shanghai?

219
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:52,799
That's right.

220
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,879
But this kind of perfume satchel made of yun brocade craftsmanship

221
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,440
Is a unique skill in Nanjing.

222
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,320
And it is only sold in Pukou Station, Nanjing.

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,960
What does that mean?

224
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,519
It means Zuo Shuangtao was lying.

225
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,000
You know what?

226
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,919
Zhao An is doomed.

227
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,639
What?

228
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,240
I said that

229
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,240
zhao An is doomed.

230
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,879
Zhao An is going to die.

231
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,759
It's none of my business.

232
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,879
Do you really think I know nothing?

233
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,240
Old Luo.

234
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,960
Those rumors about the company

235
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,720
are just nonsense.

236
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Don't believe them.

237
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,840
I didn't ask you anything.

238
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,559
That there's a rumor.

239
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,200
What rumor?

240
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,960
Shoot.

241
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,480
What exactly is a rumor?

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,759
Zhao. Zhao An.

243
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,440
That jerk Zhao An forced me.

244
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,159
He's so powerful.

245
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,639
How would I dare to resist?

246
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,720
Old Luo.

247
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,399
Please forgive me.

248
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,159
We've been married for years,

249
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,720
and I've done so much for you.

250
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,639
Please.

251
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,399
Do you think ordinary men

252
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,120
would forgive such a thing?

253
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,320
Am I an average man?

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,120
I don't know.

255
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,679
You should fight for

256
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,480
for yourself.

257
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,559
Does it still hurt?

258
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,480
It's much better after blowing.

259
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,320
You are also one of them.

260
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,080
Aren't you afraid that Zhao An will pick on you?

261
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,919
Why would I be?

262
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,440
It's not like you.

263
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
You were quite timid before.

264
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,840
But you can't simply kill people.

265
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,240
I found something.

266
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,519
Ever since we got married,

267
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,519
I have

268
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,799
with great sense of righteousness.

269
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,559
Do you think it's the power of love?

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,519
I think

271
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,120
we got married.

272
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,720
You've become more and more slick.

273
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,360
However,

274
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,639
feng Qi is actually

275
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,279
Is the most brutal

276
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,159
and most ambitious man in Zhao An's reign.

277
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,039
Do not mess with him in the future.

278
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,519
By the way,

279
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,320
what did you do in the business today?

280
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,919
Any new task?

281
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
A secret mission.

282
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
But it doesn't matter to tell you.

283
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,159
You're my wife after all, right?

284
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,639
The Chongqing side

285
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,399
are secretly having peace talks with the Japanese government.

286
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
Peace talks?

287
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,759
Are calling a halt?

288
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,399
How is that possible?

289
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,159
Both sides have sent representatives

290
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,679
to Shanghai to exchange their views.

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,919
But the Japanese military strongly opposed it.

292
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,000
And also listed the representatives of both sides

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,679
are the targets of assassination.

294
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,879
Officer Kimura assigned this task to Zhao An.

295
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
And Luo wanted to take the credit,

296
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,159
so he sent me to investigate

297
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,799
I have found out about the time

298
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,799
and the meeting place.

299
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,320
Where is it?

300
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,879
It's in a villa on Yaerpei Road.

301
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,840
I originally wanted to get some scraps

302
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,159
to deal with Luo.

303
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,559
But I didn't expect Zhao An to go

304
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,840
he brought his men to besiege the villa.

305
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,000
Then...

306
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,279
All the negotiators were arrested.

307
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
Two of them.

308
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,679
The others ran away.

309
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,240
What happened to the two

310
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,200
what happened?

311
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,000
That must be

312
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,159
why are you so interested in this?

313
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,159
I'm so worried about you.

314
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,120
Worried about me?

315
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,440
Alright.

316
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,759
Then I will tell you

317
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,480
how I survived

318
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,559
and survived in an desperate situation?

319
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,519
Chen Jiaping is

320
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,720
Is as light as a swallow,

321
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,159
she can climb over the wall,

322
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,240
and jumped...

323
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,159
And jumped to the villa.

324
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,600
But Luo told me

325
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,879
I must not let Zhao An

326
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,480
we meddled in this.

327
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,559
So I can't let Zhao An find me.

328
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,080
The situation was

329
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,480
was extremely urgent.

330
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,200
Zhao An shut the front

331
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
and the back door

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,879
and surrounded.

333
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm trapped on the second floor.

334
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,279
You can't fly even if you have wings.

335
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,279
Today I saw that

336
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,159
the extra man

337
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,559
Is Chen Jiaping.

338
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,440
And then?

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,919
And

340
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,360
I'll tell you after you sleep.

341
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,919
No, you haven't finished.

342
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,559
You really want to know?

343
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,120
Alright.

344
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,840
But today,

345
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,679
breaking the wall and breaking the tiles,

346
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,639
look at these.

347
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,279
My feet are swollen.

348
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,720
What if I can help?

349
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,960
I might be able to tell you another story.

350
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,240
You wanted me to wash your feet?

351
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,360
What are you thinking?

352
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,240
I was just messing with you.

353
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,160
What about

354
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,400
Is the strength okay?

355
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,759
Are you going to tell me or not?

356
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,000
I will talk. Talk.

357
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
At that moment,

358
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,960
a trail of footsteps came from the corridor.

359
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I thought Zhao An was coming up.

360
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,359
What should I do?

361
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,480
I will jump off the building.

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,480
If I jump,

363
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,279
or I will fall to my death

364
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,160
or be disabled.

365
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,920
So at this critical moment

366
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,440
when it was a critical moment for me,

367
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,440
I showed my true colors.

368
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
I made a prompt decision

369
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
and make a leap.

370
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,200
What about

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,039
he went under the bed.

372
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,400
I meant that

373
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,359
when Zhao An caught those two,

374
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,119
honey, calm down.

375
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,039
I have to start all over, right?

376
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Tell me about it.

377
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,640
But the one who came up wasn't Zhao An.

378
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,200
It was Jiang Zhaoguo, the representative from Chongqing.

379
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,920
Let me add some water for you.

380
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't worry.

381
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Just carry on.

382
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,920
Go on.

383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,440
Alright.

384
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,200
Jiang Zhaoguo sounds strange.

385
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
It was like magic.

386
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,079
And pulled a grenade out of nowhere.

387
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,000
After the explosion,

388
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,680
the villa was completely silent again.

389
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,279
I immediately got out from under the bed

390
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,799
ran to the window and looked out.

391
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,839
To see a car,

392
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,160
was driven by a nun.

393
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,039
A nun?

394
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,799
Have you seen a nun drive?

395
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,880
Neither have I.

396
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,359
I only saw this nun

397
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,279
the gun in left hand

398
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,640
with the right hand holding the grenade,

399
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,799
how could she drive?

400
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,960
That's not important.

401
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,000
Look at the nun raising her pistol

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
to shoot

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,200
zhao An would flee for nothing.

404
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,240
Then she opened the door

405
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,960
and pulled Jiang Zhaoguo into the car.

406
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,160
To be honest,

407
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,240
I thought that

408
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
Is this nun disguised as a man?

409
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
How can there be such strong women?

410
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,240
Before Zhao An could react,

411
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,880
they drove away.

412
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
They disappeared without a trace.

413
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,799
And then?

414
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:02,640
Then?

415
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,759
I want to know how she will die.

416
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,079
I'll let you sort it out next time.

417
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:08,839
Alright.

418
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,599
Honey, are you tired?

419
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm not tired.

420
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,960
Don't wash it.

421
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,039
Leave it to soak.

422
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,039
Let me knead your shoulders.

423
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,839
Go on.

424
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,079
Give me a massage.

425
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,960
Am I being treated like this?

426
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,559
Go on.

427
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,480
How is it with the two people caught and caught by Zhao An?

428
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,519
Zhao An?

429
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,279
The two of them

430
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,640
then take them away.

431
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,279
Then...

432
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,319
Locking her in the business

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
being tortured to death, right?

434
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,640
I've never heard that Zhao An brought anyone back to the business.

435
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,720
She must be hiding it somewhere.

436
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,279
Where?

437
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,599
Then how could I know

438
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,440
this is not right.

439
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,079
Left Pair Tao.

440
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,960
Why do you care about these two people

441
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,359
you care more about them than me?

442
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,880
What?

443
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,160
That's not concern.

444
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,799
I just have strong curiosity.

445
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,519
You have to hear the ending of the storytelling.

446
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,359
Alright.

447
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,359
I'll ask around, okay?

448
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,799
I'll tell you when I know.

449
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,119
Alright.

450
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,880
She really wanted to set me up.

451
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,559
If I'm right,

452
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,160
guoguo definitely wants to save the two arrested people.

453
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,759
This girl is desperate

454
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,480
hello, Mrs. Luo.

455
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,279
Where are you going?

456
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,079
Captain Zhao.

457
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,240
I need to deal with something outside.

458
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,480
Great.

459
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,079
Give me a ride.

460
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Where are you going?

461
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,359
Where are you going?

462
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,839
Wherever you are.

463
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,519
Today...

464
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,039
What's up

465
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,240
forget about it.

466
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,799
I can't.

467
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,519
I miss you

468
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,400
hello?

469
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,839
Mr. Chen, this is Han Lu.

470
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,720
These are the financial statements for last month.

471
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,799
They've been signed by the manager

472
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,200
okay, I'll go to the finance bureau later.

473
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:22,960
Miss,

474
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,720
here's a bouquet of lilies.

475
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,680
Welcome to our newly-opened

476
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
golden Rose Florist.

477
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,480
I don't like lilies.

478
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,559
I know you will.

479
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,359
And you'll often come here to buy flowers later.

480
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,759
I thought you went to Chongqing.

481
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,640
You saved Jiang Zhaoguo.

482
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,599
Do you want to accuse me of disobeying orders?

483
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,559
You misunderstood me.

484
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,319
I refused this operation before

485
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,640
Is that I couldn't make it.

486
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,759
But you exceeded my expectation.

487
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
Zhao An still caught two people.

488
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,440
Our mission is not completed yet.

489
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,400
It becomes

490
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,759
In the future.

491
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,440
That's right.

492
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,359
You must be ready to

493
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,440
to lurk in Taihe Trading House.

494
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,240
Director Guan Yongshan of the Second Military Commission Division

495
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,680
has approved the proposal.

496
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,200
In the market.

497
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,039
You just want that, right?

498
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,839
Right?

499
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,319
Look at these two.

500
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,359
Can you tell which is fake?

501
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,680
There are lots of

502
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,079
a large number of counterfeit money.

503
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,599
As far as I am concerned

504
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,319
the watermark technology was provided by England

505
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,319
It's extremely hard to counterfeit

506
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,799
and most of the legal coins

507
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,519
were printed for us by the Americans.

508
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,519
They have the best printing technology.

509
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,359
The Japanese army

510
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,000
spent nearly two years researching

511
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,200
he also failed to develop

512
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,920
that can fake the real ones.

513
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,640
Then how did they get the counterfeit?

514
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,079
A German submarine

515
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,599
defeated an American warship in the Pacific

516
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,559
and seized a large number of unfinished tokens.

517
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,279
They sold these to the Japanese government

518
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,160
and it has greatly facilitated

519
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
to Japanese research.

520
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,480
Our mission is to

521
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,759
to investigate

522
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,640
and destroy this counterfeit plan.

523
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,319
The development of counterfeit money

524
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,720
Is a huge and professional project.

525
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,599
But we don't have any clues now.

526
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,599
But your Taihe Firm

527
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,759
Is directly under the Japanese Military Police Headquarters,

528
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,279
and it has an inseparable relationship

529
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,119
the Japanese Army economically.

530
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,839
This will definitely lead to a breakthrough in our investigation.

531
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,000
I can take your order

532
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
but I have a condition.

533
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
What's that?

534
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,440
Don't touch Chen Jia Ping again

535
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,640
he is the best cover for you.

536
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
I won't touch him.

537
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,279
I wonder what kind of fan association

538
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,599
for your fans.

539
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,839
One who risks life for stars like you.

540
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,799
Is Mr. Jiang safe now?

541
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,359
You saved him.

542
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
I just helped a little.

543
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,880
The other person saved Mr. Jiang.

544
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,559
Is that someone you know?

545
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,359
Kind of.

546
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,599
Not really.

547
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,799
I know.

548
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,960
But I still don't know

549
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,880
mr. Jiang just left like that

550
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,960
he left nothing to you.

551
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,039
Kind of a promise.

552
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,279
Then why

553
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,519
ms. Han Lu didn't leave with Mr. Jiang?

554
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,599
You guys should be asking that question.

555
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,920
I'm sure Mr. Jiang

556
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,279
your own reason.

557
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,519
And Du Chun, the translator from Jiang Zhaoguo.

558
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,519
You must save him.

559
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,440
Before he worked for us,

560
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,799
he translated for Iwami,

561
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,839
for the Military Affairs Division of Japan's Army Ministry.

562
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,880
The research and printing of the counterfeit money

563
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,480
was the military lesson.

564
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,119
But two people would be caught.

565
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,839
And the other was up to his fate.

566
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,039
You are still the same.

567
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,000
Do you know where Zhao An has locked him up?

568
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,880
He's not in the business.

569
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,640
Isn't Chen Jia Ping in charge of general affairs?

570
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,359
He's involved in many things.

571
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,240
Try to find some clues from him.

572
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,880
What?

573
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,759
I don't want to drag him into this.

574
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,640
I will come up with something.

575
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,160
Alright.

576
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,960
Also, I have your file.

577
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,039
I've sent it to the headquarters of the Military Statistics Bureau.

578
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,720
Come up with a code name for yourself

579
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,960
chief Guan.

580
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,160
And Boss Dai

581
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,160
they need to know your movements at all times.

582
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,920
Call him five of hearts.

583
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Why not?

584
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,200
I heard that there's an undercover Communist

585
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,839
there's a Communist Party spy in the firm named Four of Clubs

586
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,519
my five of hearts

587
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm just one ahead of him.

588
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,559
Four of clubs.

589
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,799
Five of hearts.

590
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,359
Let's see who will win

591
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,039
will win in the end.

592
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,920
I haven't decided

593
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,519
whether I should wear the ring he gave me.

594
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,440
So the promise Mr. Jiang made

595
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,599
It's a ring.

596
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,519
May I take the liberty of asking

597
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,440
Is this a diamond ring?

598
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,640
Miss Han Lu.

599
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,559
Please don't misunderstand.

600
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,359
Here's the thing.

601
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,680
When I married Zuo Shuangtao,

602
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,359
I decorated and bought furniture.

603
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,519
I ordered the banquet and bought a wedding dress.

604
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,759
Basically, I have used up all of my savings.

605
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,359
That's why I didn't buy

606
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,319
when I bought the ring.

607
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,920
That's why she kept complaining

608
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
so I want to see

609
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,440
what it's like

610
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,880
what it's really like

611
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,559
I really bring

612
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,079
this box

613
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,880
looks more refined than mine.

614
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,920
What a big diamond ring!

615
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,440
How much is this?

616
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,119
This is two carat.

617
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,440
This is about

618
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,799
around one thousand yuan.

619
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,319
About one thousand yuan?

620
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,400
I'll tell her

621
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,519
let her dream for two more years.

622
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Actually,

623
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
the diamond is smaller,

624
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,920
or no diamond,

625
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,359
It doesn't matter.

626
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,680
The most important thing is her mind.

627
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,359
All the matters that matter.

628
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,440
That's right!

629
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Miss Han Lu.

630
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
Will Mr. Jiang contact you again?

631
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,160
He said he would call me again.

632
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,519
If that's convenient.

633
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,200
I want to ask Mr. Jiang a favor.

634
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,440
He passed out again.

635
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,559
Splash water.

636
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,240
Forget about it.

637
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,720
Captain Zhao,

638
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,319
let this pass?

639
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,599
It's true that these two people

640
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,079
where Jiang Zhaoguo is.

641
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,519
If you keep doing this,

642
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,839
he'll be dead.

643
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,279
I heard that Officer Kimura will be back tomorrow.

644
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,440
Why don't we

645
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,559
hand them over to Military Police Headquarters

646
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,680
to interrogate them.

647
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,480
That's reasonable.

648
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,799
Mosquitoes are also flesh.

649
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,359
This way, I'll be able to make a report.

650
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,720
Why did Officer Kimura let us

651
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,000
to us?

652
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,880
To help

653
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,039
so that Military Police Command

654
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,880
to clear them of this matter.

655
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,599
Actually, Jiang Zhaoguo and the two negotiators

656
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,759
figured out the truth behind the attack.

657
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,640
But they don't have any evidence.

658
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,279
If we let the two of them know

659
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,799
that this operation

660
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,240
are behind this.

661
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,880
Are behind this.

662
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,880
And then let them go.

663
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,440
And let them spread the news everywhere.

664
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,079
What's the result?

665
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:03,720
Captain.

666
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,799
You're saying that...

667
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,079
To threaten Officer Kimura with them?

668
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,640
We're going to die.

669
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,480
Don't die.

670
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,039
It's awful.

671
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,400
Now the two of them

672
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,799
are the bargaining chip to save our lives.

673
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,880
Should we continue to lock them

674
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
lock them up here, right?

675
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,039
Not only must she be locked up,

676
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,920
but also guard them tightly.

677
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,160
If they run away,

678
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,319
we'll be screwed.

679
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes

680
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,519
come on.

681
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:45,759
What about

682
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,000
I think I know

683
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,400
where Zhao An hides her.

684
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,519
Where do you hide him?

685
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,079
Hong Yun Hotel.

686
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,319
How did you know that?

687
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,559
I told you that

688
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,359
I'll get back to work.

689
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,119
Don't.

690
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,799
You need to tell me the truth.

691
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,000
I won't do anything to you.

692
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:09,559
He...

693
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,519
He took me there

694
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
this is the place where you would meet before.

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,519
Right?

696
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,160
In the past,

697
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,559
In the past?

698
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,480
What?

699
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,039
What?

700
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,039
He always took me to Grand Hyatt Hotel.

701
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,759
But this time, he took me there.

702
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,039
Then?

703
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:39,640
Then?

704
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
Then?

705
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,240
And...

706
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,559
Then I found out

707
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,400
he also knows the owner of Hong Yun Hotel well.

708
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,480
Very well.

709
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,200
What?

710
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240
And what?

711
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
After he asked me to leave,

712
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,599
he stayed there.

713
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,720
It seems very important to him.

714
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,920
I've told you everything,

715
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,240
what more do you want me to do?

716
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,519
Zhao An.

717
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,279
Hongyun Hotel.

718
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:29,920
Mrs. Luo,

719
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,000
who are you waiting for?

720
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,039
You scared me.

721
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,920
Didn't we agree to get off work together?

722
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,960
Where have you been?

723
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:22,719
I went out

724
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,039
I went out for a few business.

725
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:24,760
Come on.

726
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,559
Let's go home.

727
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
What's the matter?

728
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,920
I just followed

729
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,880
the Big Spoon.

730
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Why are you following him?

731
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,079
He always reports false accounts.

732
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,119
He said he was on a mission,

733
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,199
but in fact, he was taking them to stroll the streets.

734
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,559
As a result, I incurred a lot of money.

735
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,519
My boss blamed me for not examining him strictly.

736
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,079
I saw him sneaking out again today.

737
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,960
I wanted to catch him in the act.

738
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,000
What's the result?

739
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,119
Finish the book that we finished yesterday

740
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,519
that we didn't finish yesterday.

741
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,519
We have a new one.

742
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,480
Then hurry.

743
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,760
Tell me about it.

744
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,920
Last time we talked about

745
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,159
zhao An arrested two people

746
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,920
captured two men?

747
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,760
But I don't know where it is.

748
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,360
Have a guess

749
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,159
where I followed him.

750
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,239
Where?

751
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Hong Yun Hotel.

752
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,800
Hong Yun Hotel?

753
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:18,760
I thought it would be

754
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,159
I was wondering why the big spoon went to Hongyun Hotel.

755
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,199
I...

756
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,840
Honey.

757
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,760
I'm hungry now.

758
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,639
How about we eat and talk?

759
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,079
Alright.

760
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,000
Eat.

761
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,599
Boss.

762
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,440
Two oilseeds,

763
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,000
and two eggs.

764
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,679
Alright.

765
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Hurry.

766
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Come on.

767
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,119
Alright.

768
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,000
Go on.

769
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,519
Why did Zhao An go to Hong Yun Hotel?

770
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,280
So I found a hidden corner

771
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,480
I hate it.

772
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,119
I tried to find out what he was doing.

773
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,639
But he didn't go in there

774
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,800
he went to find

775
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,880
who are helping him out.

776
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:50,960
I have thought it over

777
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,039
you invited others to stay in a hotel,

778
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,360
I'll be the one to blame.

779
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,400
I made a prompt decision

780
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
and I followed him.

781
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,679
Then...

782
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,519
Guess who I ran into inside?

783
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:03,920
Who?

784
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,000
I ran into Zhao An's man.

785
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
What double-dealing?

786
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,000
That Chen Shugan

787
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,840
are all there.

788
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,000
However

789
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,800
honey.

790
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,360
Why does the scoop

791
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,800
ends up with Zhao An's men?

792
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,400
You have got it wrong.

793
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,199
Datao works for Luo

794
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,039
they are

795
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,159
are still enemy.

796
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,199
So Diaoyao

797
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,639
Is not with them anymore.

798
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,679
My father arranged it.

799
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,599
Why did Luo arrange that?

800
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:27,000
Mister.

801
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,960
Egg and oil root.

802
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,960
Please enjoy.

803
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:29,599
Thanks.

804
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,440
Luo arranged him to

805
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,920
naturally I'm unaware of anything.

806
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:33,800
Think about it.

807
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,840
Zhao An caught those two

808
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,599
he didn't report the case

809
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,639
you even hid it away.

810
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,400
If they escape,

811
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,840
and Officer Kimura even found out.

812
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,719
Think about

813
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,039
what will happen to Zhao An?

814
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,519
But if Luo is extremely versatile,

815
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,239
to catch these two again,

816
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,639
I'll be able to stand up and win.

817
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,199
Is this perfume satchel sold by you?

818
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,400
You seem to be me.

819
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,519
Have you seen

820
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,519
this woman before?

821
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,320
How can I remember?

822
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,599
Think about it carefully.

823
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,960
Did she buy the perfume satchel from you?

824
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,400
Yes

825
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,599
she came here.

826
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,000
When did she buy the perfume satchel?

827
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,880
More than a month ago.

828
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,320
As for the details,

829
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,519
let me think.

830
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,280
It should be

831
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,679
oh, right.

832
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,039
The 16th of April in the lunar calendar.

833
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,599
I was bought on Xiaoman's day, the 15th of April,

834
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,559
she was sold at the railway station.

835
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,159
She was the first one who came to buy.

836
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,239
So I remember it clearly.

837
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,159
The 16th of April in the lunar calendar.

838
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,119
In the imperial calendar.

839
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:00,719
Do you want it?

840
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Want it?

841
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,559
Fifty cents.

842
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,280
Hey,

843
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,800
one yuan.

844
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,840
The 16th of April in the lunar calendar.

845
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,239
The 16th of April in the lunar calendar.

846
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,079
Is the 22nd of May in the Solar Calendar.

847
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,079
When Colonel Shanxia came to Shanghai

848
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,159
tell me something.

849
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,760
When she bought the perfume satchel,

850
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,440
about what time was it?

851
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,880
It was pretty early.

852
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
And it's not even 7: 00 a.m.

853
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,480
The train No. 514 that Colonel Shanxia took

854
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,119
It starts at 7: 45,

855
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,000
great.

856
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,440
They all match.

857
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,360
Don't take it away.

858
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,480
What?

859
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,199
Are you refusing to pay?

860
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,159
I won't return the money.

861
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,159
You know what?

862
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,559
How much is this perfume satchel?

863
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,320
Star anise.

864
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,440
It's not right.

865
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,320
One tael of silver.

866
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,360
I'll give you 50 times of the price.

867
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
But you need to go somewhere with me.

868
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
Repeat what you just said.

869
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,039
Where are you going?

870
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,000
Shanghai.

871
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:57,880
It's so far away.

872
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,639
What about my business?

873
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,280
I guarantee that when you go to Shanghai,

874
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,960
that you find everything delicious, delicious and fun

875
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,039
a hundred times as much.

876
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,599
I'll go for that one hundred times.

877
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:09,719
Great!

878
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,199
Alright.

879
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,360
Only 100 times as much.

880
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,320
I'm used to bad luck.

881
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,159
Everyone knows everyone

882
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,639
how can it be my turn?

883
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,360
How can you prove it?

884
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,039
Write me a letter of guarantee.

885
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,519
Why are you so troublesome?

886
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,840
I won't go if you don't write it down.

887
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,119
Alright.

888
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:28,559
Write it.

889
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,960
I will write it.

890
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,760
You write it.

891
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
What's your name?

892
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,800
Feng Qi.

893
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Just write that I'm Feng Qi and I promise Li Youtian.

894
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,360
My name is Li Youtian.

895
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:41,800
Go on.

896
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,320
To ensure Li Youtian's safety

897
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
when he's in Shanghai.

898
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:46,800
Also...

899
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,800
Continue the story.

900
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,159
What's the rush?

901
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,679
It's rare for me to go to Shanghai.

902
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,480
I have to bring some specialties for my wife and kid.

903
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,679
Write the code again.

904
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,760
I promise to help Li Youtian

905
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,880
the Three-yellow Chicken from The Hongxiang Story.

906
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,400
The Hongxiang Record?

907
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,960
There are also

908
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,599
the red bean cake of Fu Yun Zhai

909
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,519
and make sure

910
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,639
all the travel expenses

911
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,840
and the expenses of the restaurant.

912
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,360
Are you finished?

913
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,880
You've rushed me.

914
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,960
All right.

915
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,679
If you urge me,

916
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,199
I wrote the name of the hotel wrong.

917
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,320
Even if there's one mistake,

918
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,559
as long as the meaning is right.

919
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,320
Come on.

920
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,360
Give me two more.

921
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,559
Two yuan? What?

922
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,960
The paper and pen.

923
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,639
Here you are.

924
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,719
Alright.

925
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,840
Why are you looking at me?

926
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,400
Interesting.

927
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,800
Look at you.

928
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:08,719
Where are you going?

929
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,360
Throw cucumber slices.

930
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,760
What happened? You're so nervous.

931
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,360
Go to bed.

932
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,039
Go to bed first.

933
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,039
I'll read a book.

934
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,559
Go to bed early.

935
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,840
You have to work tomorrow.

936
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,519
Goodnight.

937
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,280
Night.

938
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,840
Tonight,

939
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,719
their people

940
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,039
will go to Hong Yun Hotel to save them.

941
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,760
She looks like

942
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,880
I don't think she will join the operation.

943
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,840
But I can't be sure.

944
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,519
Anyway, I can't sleep for the night.

945
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,000
I have to watch her.

946
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,920
Guoguo.

947
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:33,920
What's wrong with you?

948
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,480
What happened to you?

949
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:35,599
What happened to you?
