1
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,840
Hello?

2
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,840
How are you?

3
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,879
Don't worry. I'm fine.

4
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:25,960
Alright.

5
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,039
What's the address

6
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,680
I'll write it down.

7
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,599
Alright.

8
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Got it.

9
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,840
Be there or be square.

10
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,000
Did Jiang Zhaoguo call you just now?

11
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,400
Is that

12
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
If this is Jiang Zhaoguo's address.

13
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,759
Your computer is no. 45A3-8.

14
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,720
Was captured from Juntong.

15
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,319
Because of the special habit of transmitter,

16
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
caused abnormal wear of the telegraph key.

17
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,160
So the reporter could identify the message

18
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,199
to distinguish the message

19
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,040
was sent

20
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
45A3-8.

21
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,759
Miss Han Lu.

22
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,800
You didn't expect that

23
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,600
we are reunited again.

24
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,319
Why are you smoking so much?

25
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
Nervous?

26
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,120
What?

27
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
Even smoking is not allowed!

28
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,720
Why did you arrest me?

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,879
You colluded with the Chongqing government

30
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,920
why don't I arrest you?

31
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,800
That I colluded with the Chongqing government

32
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,519
do you have evidence?

33
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,079
Who is Jiang Zhaoguo to you?

34
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,519
We were friends before.

35
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,720
But we never saw each other for a long time.

36
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,680
Is that a crime?

37
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
(We got definite intel.)

38
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,639
Jiang Zhaoguo arrived in Shanghai recently.

39
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,759
He looked for you.

40
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,040
No one.

41
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,319
You helped him rent a house.

42
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,800
He never came to you?

43
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,199
That I rent a house means he came to me before?

44
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,519
You're stubborn.

45
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,079
You are really more cunning than we thought.

46
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,680
You found out that our people were following you,

47
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,319
so you didn't ask Jiang Zhaoguo

48
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,800
to rent the apartment

49
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
and in order to interfere

50
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,319
and mislead our investigation,

51
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
to pretend to be Jiang Zhaoguo,

52
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,079
you pretend to be preparing for the negotiation,

53
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,120
right?

54
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
But you hadn't expected that, right?

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
Some of us

56
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,560
from Chongqing,

57
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,600
back from Chongqing.

58
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,160
All the things you said

59
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,519
Is just your speculation.

60
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,879
Speculation.

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
How about this?

62
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,279
Does it look familiar?

63
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,720
You wrote it, Fuxu Lu?

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,279
I think Jiang Zhaoguo

65
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,920
he should be here right now.

66
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,839
What's next?

67
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
It's not written.

68
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,399
What's next?

69
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,319
The specific address...

70
00:06:59,319 --> 00:06:59,800
Go on.

71
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,959
I'm a friend of the warrior under the mountain.

72
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,600
You'll regret

73
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,519
you'll regret it.

74
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,680
Return the warrior below the mountain.

75
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,199
The warrior is dead.

76
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
Which means he is still alive.

77
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Even if he is alive.

78
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,839
Tell me or not?

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,079
It's fine.

80
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,079
There are no so many buildings on Fuxu Road.

81
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,639
Feng Qi

82
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,720
search one by one

83
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,279
until we find Jiang Zhaoguo.

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
Okay, I'll do it now.

85
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,639
Do you think it's worthwhile

86
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,959
to protect Jiang Zhaoguo?

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,839
Do you think he will protect you?

88
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,720
We have plenty of ways to make him talk

89
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,759
and get him to testify against you.

90
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,319
Once you are convicted

91
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,399
that you colluded with the Chongqing government,

92
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,079
this beautiful face

93
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,120
cut your pretty face.

94
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,879
You're so pretty.

95
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,840
Miss Zuo.

96
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,039
Nothing. He just fainted.

97
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,320
Miss Zuo,

98
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,480
you received my telegram.

99
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,799
Right.

100
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
I'll be right there.

101
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
What's wrong, Ms. Zuo?

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Help me break the chain.

103
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:16,720
Alright.

104
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,639
Go look on the deck for a hammer or something.

105
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,600
Xiaowu, the people on the deck

106
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,120
where is she?

107
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,240
Xiaowu.

108
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,759
Xiaowu, get up.

109
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,879
What happened?

110
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,399
I think he fell asleep.

111
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,960
Has fallen asleep.

112
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,679
The boat is about to depart.

113
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,279
Stop sleeping.

114
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,320
Come on, get up.

115
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,639
Don't fall asleep, Xiaowu.

116
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,360
Don't move.

117
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,159
High Fang.

118
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,600
Left Shuangtao has been using you.

119
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,799
Can't you see that?

120
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,320
It's none of your business

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,080
I'm willing to.

122
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Idiot.

123
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
Do you know what you're doing?

124
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,039
Of course I know.

125
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Give me the key.

126
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,639
To her?

127
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,679
Alright.

128
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,080
You are ruining your future.

129
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,879
Perhaps my future

130
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,679
Is opposite to yours.

131
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,000
Back off!

132
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
Hurry!

133
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
When did you find she was missing?

134
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,960
About...

135
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,080
Around ten o'clock.

136
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,679
It was cold today.

137
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,600
I ran to knock the door.

138
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,080
I wanted to ask if I would need an extra bed with quilt.

139
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,200
I knocked and no one answered.

140
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,879
I opened the door

141
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,360
there's no one there.

142
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,679
Alright, go on.

143
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,080
Thanks.

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,919
To visit her house.

145
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Come on.

146
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,720
I didn't expect them to treat

147
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,759
In this way.

148
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
You turn on a sixpence so quickly.

149
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,639
After these two days,

150
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,039
I feel that

151
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,360
the line between friend and foe

152
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,639
Is suddenly blurred.

153
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,799
You are saying that

154
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
I was your enemy,

155
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,879
now you're your friend.

156
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,879
But if I were your friend,

157
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,600
Is it impossible for us

158
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,639
Is it impossible for us to do that?

159
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,240
So it's better

160
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,799
to be an enemy.

161
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,080
I underestimated Chen Family Ping before.

162
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
If it wasn't for him,

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I would have been a sinner.

164
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
You didn't mean to hurt me.

165
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
But why did you force me

166
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,840
and threaten me?

167
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,120
Do you know why?

168
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Have some coffee

169
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,600
and warm her up.

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,799
Chen Jiaping changed the secret letter

171
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,720
your identity

172
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,559
did he also know?

173
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,840
He just doesn't want Zhao An to cause trouble to me.

174
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:15,360
I think the coffee you make

175
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,480
Is much better than the coffee

176
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,799
than the Ksenka coffee shop.

177
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,279
When the war is over,

178
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,840
I might as well open another cafe.

179
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,960
Business must be good.

180
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,000
But it's still lonely

181
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,799
to run a café by myself.

182
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Today,

183
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,559
I don't know how to thank you.

184
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,279
You wanted to kill me before, didn't you?

185
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,279
You are actually not bad.

186
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,919
No, I'm really bad.

187
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,679
I'm selfish.

188
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,759
Withdrawn,

189
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,919
and paranoid.

190
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,679
And a person who would do anything to get what he wants.

191
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,879
I think

192
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
you are just immature.

193
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,039
Like a big boy

194
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,480
and didn't know

195
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,960
how to get what I want.

196
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
That's because I know

197
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,840
the thing I want,

198
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,039
that's why he did those bad things.

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:29,879
Oh, right.

200
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,919
This transmitter...

201
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,279
You want me to take it back?

202
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,480
I want you to send a telegram

203
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
to your superior.

204
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,600
So you must use your transmitter.

205
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,240
That's right.

206
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,679
But I don't have the combination book.

207
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,799
There is some transcribed texts in the box

208
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,080
and the translated text.

209
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,120
And the translated text

210
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,799
give me one night.

211
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,759
I can do it.

212
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,279
Believe you can do it.

213
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,240
Cold Dew must have been back before.

214
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,759
And she was captured by Zhao An's men.

215
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
I have warned her repeatedly.

216
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
Why did she come back?

217
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,720
Probably waiting for an important phone call.

218
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,759
It's decoded.

219
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,080
Miss Zuo.

220
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,720
Sorry.

221
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,600
Did I disturb you?

222
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,039
No, I'm not.

223
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,440
It worked, didn't it?

224
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,840
That's right

225
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,799
this is a random number.

226
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,000
That is, we use a mathematical formula

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,399
based on the single table,

228
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,919
so that different characters with the same code

229
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,559
to interfere with opponent's analysis.

230
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,200
But the random numbers

231
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,320
Is not infinite.

232
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,919
Usually

233
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,960
Is supplemented by an ancient poem.

234
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,320
To people

235
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,039
this is confusing

236
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,480
who doesn't know much about it.

237
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,200
But I've already mastered

238
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,879
and the comparison of coded messages and clear texts.

239
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,159
I've discovered

240
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,080
this rule,

241
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,039
Is no problem for me.

242
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,840
I don't know much

243
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,919
about what you said.

244
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,720
But I think

245
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
you're really something.

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,759
Now it's good.

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,960
You can inform your superior.

248
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,039
However,

249
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,080
I know.

250
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,440
This is confidential.

251
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,440
I can't be there.

252
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,159
I'm going to work.

253
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
Thank you.

254
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,480
Will you

255
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,160
will you visit the firm again?

256
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,359
That's great.

257
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,440
She still can see you.

258
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:10,680
Come on.

259
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,039
Are you sure you've checked every flat?

260
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,279
We pretended to be the Concession Police

261
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
to search for the wanted criminal

262
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,720
I've searched every house on Fuxu Road.

263
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,079
But I didn't find Jiang Zhaoguo.

264
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,480
"Fuxu Road"

265
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,160
Are you sure she wrote this

266
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,920
when she answered the phone?

267
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,799
That's right.

268
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm going

269
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
to report to Officer Kimura.

270
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,160
I thought there was a breakthrough today.

271
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,839
Now I'll be scolded if I go there.

272
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,240
Wait for me.

273
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,440
Then I'll ask about Cold Dew.

274
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,880
Yes

275
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,400
where is she currently imprisoned?

276
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,920
In the warehouse in the parking lot behind.

277
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,279
No one will know

278
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,640
after all, Han Lu is a star.

279
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,880
She has great influence.

280
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,480
Keep her safe.

281
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,680
Don't let anyone know that

282
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,880
she was locked up there.

283
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,160
Understood.

284
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,119
Don't worry.

285
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,839
Fuxu Road isn't Jiang Zhao Guo's address.

286
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,640
I told you that

287
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,200
I have no idea

288
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,480
where Jiang Zhao Guo is at at all.

289
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,839
You all make wild speculations.

290
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,920
What do you want?

291
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,440
Touch it!

292
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,680
Let go of me.

293
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,519
Do you feel that?

294
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,720
On your forehead?

295
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,000
You know what that is?

296
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,160
This is the barrel

297
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,519
for five minutes.

298
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,279
To see the deep round mark.

299
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,920
The barrel of the gun against my forehead

300
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
the barrel of the gun against my forehead

301
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,000
fired a bullet

302
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,599
break my head

303
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,519
with your brains!

304
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,200
Where is Jiang Zhao Guo?

305
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,079
I don't know.

306
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,759
Did you forget what I said yesterday?

307
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,640
I'm going to cut your pretty face

308
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,160
to cut your pretty face.

309
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,000
Feng Qi,

310
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,319
I'm asking you one last time,

311
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,039
where is Jiang Zhaoguo?

312
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,240
I don't know.

313
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,799
You're stubborn.

314
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,519
Cut them off.

315
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,519
This is your last chance.

316
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,200
Are you really not going to tell me?

317
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,799
Terrible woman!

318
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,319
You bit me!

319
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,119
Terrible woman!

320
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,359
You can't act forever!

321
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,319
Stop!

322
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,960
Zhao An.

323
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,079
You're so bold.

324
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,720
How many days you dare to do that?

325
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,319
This is Detective Naoki Zhongzuo,

326
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,319
commander Ueda Naoki,

327
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,559
good day, sir.

328
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,319
We came just for Ms. Han Lu.

329
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,480
When Commander Shanxia was dying,

330
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,960
entrusted the affairs

331
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
to Mr. Zhongzuo.

332
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,920
He especially told me

333
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,319
to take care of Ms. Han Lu.

334
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,400
Yes

335
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,559
officer Uchida.

336
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,119
We suspect that

337
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,279
that Ms. Han Lu

338
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,279
colluded with the representative of Chongqing, Jiang Zhaoguo.

339
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,680
Do you have evidence?

340
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,119
Yes, you have.

341
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,559
I'm saying concrete evidence

342
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,599
but not groundless accusations.

343
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,680
Are being confirmed.

344
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,720
Is there anything?

345
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,920
There is.

346
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,119
You're stubborn.

347
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,200
Ms. Han Lu, are you alright?

348
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,640
She's fine.

349
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,799
We've just started.

350
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,799
Untie it for Miss Han Lu.

351
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,240
Yes

352
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,279
untie it!

353
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,279
Come on, Mr. Zhongzuo.

354
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,599
This way, please.

355
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,160
Audacious in the extreme

356
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,559
go to Taihe Trading Firm

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,519
alright.

358
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,119
Come on.

359
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,720
It's here.

360
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,440
Miss Cold Dew, are you alright?

361
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,039
I'm alright.

362
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,119
Thank you, Officer Uchida.

363
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
Darn it, that woman is merciless.

364
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,279
Captain.

365
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,960
Naoki Uchida...

366
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,880
How does he know we caught Cold Dew?

367
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,279
And he asked me?

368
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,640
There must be someone behind this

369
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,880
hello, Section Chief Chen

370
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,759
xiucai Qian

371
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,160
chief Chen

372
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,039
has the magazine I ordered arrived?

373
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
What magazine?

374
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,160
Xinguang?

375
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,160
Chief Chen

376
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,599
why are you so interested

377
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,960
reading beautiful women's posters?

378
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,599
It's because

379
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,720
the cover is the celebrity Miss Han Lu?

380
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,160
Alright. Let me find one for you.

381
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,319
It's found.

382
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,480
It's found

383
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,599
come on, Chief Chen

384
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,599
xiucai Qian

385
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,839
do you think Miss Han Lu

386
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,519
Is beautiful no matter how she looks?

387
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm just a guard.

388
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,759
How can I enjoy a celebrity like that?

389
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,440
My job is to watch the door.

390
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
No need to look at superstars.

391
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,599
Okay. We're leaving.

392
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,559
The cover is still alive.

393
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,799
Miss Han Lu.

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,519
Why are you here?

395
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,160
Don't make trouble.

396
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,200
Look who's here.

397
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,799
Uchida Officer.

398
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,880
I'm a fan of Miss Han Lu.

399
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,079
I don't know if it's convenient for me.

400
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,319
Please sign this for me, Ms. Han Lu.

401
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,960
It's okay. Let me help him sign it.

402
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,559
It won't take long.

403
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,720
Miss Cold Dew.

404
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,200
He must really like

405
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,960
the movie with Miss Han Lu very much.

406
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,119
Thank you for telling Ueda

407
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,960
no. 72 Yaerpei Road.

408
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,480
Hello?

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,920
How are you?

410
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,480
I've found an apartment for you.

411
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,440
You

412
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
those people didn't bother you, did they?

413
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,799
Don't worry. I'm fine.

414
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:45,759
Alright.

415
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:46,960
What's the address

416
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,720
I'll write it down.

417
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,839
No. 72 Yaerpei Road.

418
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
Alright, got it.

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,839
Be there or be square.

420
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,359
Thank you, Miss Han Lu.

421
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:18,880
Two o'clock this afternoon.

422
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,319
What did she say?

423
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,359
Ms. Han Lu is very weak.

424
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,319
Don't make trouble for her.

425
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,839
That's right.

426
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,359
Help Ms. Han Lu to my car.

427
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,799
I'll send her to the hospital.

428
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,240
Yes

429
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,519
come on.

430
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,160
Hurry up!

431
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,200
Slowly.

432
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,119
Be careful, be careful.

433
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,599
Be careful

434
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,200
alright.

435
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
Come to my office later.

436
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,880
What are you doing?

437
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,680
These two Japanese

438
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,599
now they're in Shanghai.

439
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,079
If you have the ability

440
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,799
find them out?

441
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,960
Who are they?

442
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,359
The background is very complicated.

443
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,920
Zhao An forced confessions by Cold Dew

444
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,200
It also has something to do with this.

445
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,799
Now Zhao An has lost.

446
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,640
It's our chance.

447
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,200
No. 72 Yaerpei Road.

448
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,279
Please come in

449
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,680
chief Chen

450
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,119
brother Feng Qi

451
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,359
my hand was slightly injured.

452
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,559
I have to go to the hospital.

453
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:58,839
Brother.

454
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,880
It's not a minor injury.

455
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
You have to go now.

456
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
The wound is small.

457
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,720
I want you

458
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,519
I asked you to write an injury confirmation.

459
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,599
Only then can I get the public funds.

460
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,839
To go to the hospital.

461
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,920
I got it.

462
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,839
Are you just talking about these bureaucratic

463
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,559
and make all these inexplicable procedures.

464
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,400
Really

465
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,559
If we got shot while carrying out a mission,

466
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,319
we need to fill out a form to be saved?

467
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,599
Ridiculous.

468
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,079
All these red tapes

469
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,039
could delay things.

470
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
How were you injured?

471
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,079
That witch from Cold Dew bit me.

472
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,680
The cold dew?

473
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,279
Sorry, Chief Chen

474
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,079
I forgot you're a fan of Cold Dew

475
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,519
It's alright.

476
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Fans belong to fans.

477
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,119
I'm your brother, that's all.

478
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,920
How were you injured again?

479
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,599
It's caused by cold dew.

480
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,319
I'm sorry, my mouth stinks

481
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,279
I'm sorry, Chief Chen

482
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,839
brother Feng,

483
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,799
let's just do it.

484
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,279
How do you mean by that?

485
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:57,880
No rush.

486
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,599
Let me check for you.

487
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,799
The fourth rule...

488
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,000
The sixth article

489
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,880
let's have a look.

490
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,880
Article 7 (3)

491
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,640
A work-related injury refers to any violence that someone suffers

492
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,559
Is violence, accidental injury,

493
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,599
and accidental injury

494
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,160
can be deemed as industrial injury.

495
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,240
That's right.

496
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,319
I got injured on the job.

497
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,720
But brother Feng Qi

498
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,079
to catch Han Lu?

499
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,599
It was your and Captain Zhao's private act.

500
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,759
Both Officer Naoki and Manager Luo

501
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,920
can't agree with it.

502
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,599
It can't be considered as performing official duties,

503
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,119
and it can't be counted as a work-related injury.

504
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,680
Right?

505
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,359
Listen to yourself.

506
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,039
Are these for nothing?

507
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,720
Brother Feng Qi,

508
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,079
I'm doing it impartially

509
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,119
chief Chen

510
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,119
I think you're suspicious

511
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,759
you're abusing the power for your personal revenge.

512
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
Brother Feng,

513
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,079
abusing public power to retaliate against him is not right.

514
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,359
Captain Zhao.

515
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:49,880
Captain.

516
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,839
You've signed the wrong one.

517
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,680
Captain Zhao, I'm so sorry.

518
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,039
It's all my fault.

519
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,440
Sorry that you had to come here in person.

520
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,319
Call me next time.

521
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,119
I'll send them to you.

522
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,440
There is no next time.

523
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,240
Captain, don't leave!

524
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,240
It's good that you're here.

525
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,119
Please tell him the reason

526
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,559
chief Chen didn't think it was an industrial injury

527
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,279
brother Feng Qi,

528
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,160
If you really think I abused my power to retaliate against him,

529
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,839
go to Mr. Luo

530
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,200
or complain to the Military Police Headquarters.

531
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,880
Captain Zhao, I'm

532
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,519
I'll do it impartially.

533
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,119
It's just a small wound.

534
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,799
Didn't you know how to dress a wound?

535
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,319
He wouldn't consider the industrial accident as an accident.

536
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,720
Pack it yourself.

537
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,720
Alright, Captain.

538
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,400
I will do it myself.

539
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,400
I know how to do it.

540
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,279
My ex-girlfriend Xiao Fang studied in Japan.

541
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,640
Captain Zhao will send it to you later.

542
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,839
She taught me.

543
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,200
I made it myself.

544
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,799
It's better than the hospital

545
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
something's wrong Chief Chen

546
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,680
left Shuangtao wants to jump off the building.

547
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,200
Left Shuangtao wants to jump off the building.

548
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,640
Guoguo.

549
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:36,599
What are you doing?

550
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,119
Come down!

551
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,240
Chen Jiaping,

552
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,960
are you getting a divorce?

553
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,680
If you divorce me,

554
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,960
I will jump.

555
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,599
Let's come down first.

556
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,680
Don't come any closer.

557
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
Lean back.

558
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,640
Alright.

559
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,000
If I don't come,

560
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,039
If you have something to say,

561
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,799
we can talk about it at any time, okay?

562
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
I can come down.

563
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,319
Apologize first.

564
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,799
Why should I?

565
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,440
Why should I?

566
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,880
You wronged me in the first place.

567
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
You hit me?

568
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,200
No one has hit me

569
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,960
no one had beaten me up in my whole life.

570
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,599
And you hit me badly.

571
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,640
My face still hurts now.

572
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,759
Why are you coming back?

573
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
You don't want to apologize, do you?

574
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,440
Are you going to apologize or not?

575
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,720
All right.

576
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,640
Can't I apologize?

577
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,440
It's my fault.

578
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
It's my fault.

579
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,039
I shouldn't have slapped you.

580
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,599
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:52,720
Come down.

582
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,200
Come on.

583
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
Come down.

584
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,200
I can't do this.

585
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,920
You should apologize alone.

586
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,440
This can't be.

587
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,359
This is between us.

588
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,759
Who else will apologize to you?

589
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:06,960
I...

590
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,000
I am mean.

591
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,400
I threatened Ms. Zuo with the letter.

592
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,039
That's why these things happened.

593
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,519
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,160
But I hope

595
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,799
you won't leave the firm because of this.

596
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,559
Because here,

597
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,440
someone needs you.

598
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,519
I wanted to say that

599
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,279
chief Chen

600
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,119
guoguo.

601
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,079
He has apologized to you.

602
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,359
Stop messing around.

603
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:43,960
Come down.

604
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,799
I can't.

605
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,359
One more person to apologize.

606
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,359
It's me.

607
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,839
I was wrong.

608
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,799
I'm sorry.

609
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,079
I'm so confused.

610
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,359
I hurt you

611
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
and our relationship.

612
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,920
I don't want to lose you.

613
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,599
You're the only one I can rely on in this life.

614
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,160
So,

615
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,400
honey, please forgive me.

616
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,920
Please give me

617
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,119
give our relationship another chance.

618
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,279
Please?

619
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,079
Everyone makes mistakes.

620
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,319
Did you forget what you said at the wedding?

621
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
You said that

622
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,839
you're not perfect.

623
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
I'm not perfect either.

624
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,640
However

625
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,680
but the two of us are perfect

626
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,759
will be perfect.

627
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,000
You really remember.

628
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,519
Then

629
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,680
let's be perfect together

630
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,680
alright?

631
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:58,279
Alright.

632
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,440
But I still can't forgive you.

633
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,000
You kept pushing yourself.

634
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,159
She's educated.

635
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,360
Why are you like a shrew?

636
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
You don't forgive me?

637
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,920
I won't forgive you!

638
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,760
At the door just now,

639
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,159
why were you holding Cold Dew?

640
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,639
I didn't hold her.

641
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,159
She fainted. I'll help her.

642
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,400
Funny.

643
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,719
Anyone else wouldn't faint.

644
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,480
You fainted?

645
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,360
You still held her for such a long time.

646
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,480
Don't let it go.

647
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,400
Alright, alright.

648
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,719
I'm sorry! It's my fault!

649
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,960
That's all for now!

650
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,239
Will we have a meeting?

651
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,880
No one is here.

652
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,360
You are the most numerous to watch the crowd.

653
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,920
That's it?

654
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,079
Why don't you two talk

655
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,360
close the door and talk slowly.

656
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,400
Drive a duck onto a perch

657
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,800
put on such an act

658
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,440
to make everyone think that we're back together again.

659
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,239
Right?

660
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,920
You're not bad too.

661
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,920
Left Shuangtao is back.

662
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,639
She not only came back,

663
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,400
but also forced me to make an act with her in the firm.

664
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,079
And made a conclusion about why she left

665
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,920
and why she came back.

666
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,639
I'm thinking

667
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,280
If the military commander

668
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,639
urgent mission next time?

669
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:02,960
It's possible that

670
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:04,960
maybe this time

671
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,519
this time.

672
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,920
Old road.

673
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,440
Don't expect me to leave again this time.

674
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,199
I won't do it.

675
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,639
It's not your decision.

676
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,920
Or me.

677
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,239
This was determined by our organization.

678
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,639
Now the situation has changed.

679
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,239
I have to reconsult the organization.

680
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,360
I'll write an application.

681
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,360
And ask the organization to approve me staying here.

682
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,719
I can guarantee

683
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,000
my identity will not be affected

684
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,079
because of Zuo Shuangtao.

685
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,719
I have a mission to complete.

686
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:30,920
I'll write it now.

687
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,800
I'll take your lousy inkstone.

688
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
Don't be anxious.

689
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,760
You have applied,

690
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,039
will it take some time for the organization to reply?

691
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,039
Now the key problem is that

692
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,440
since Zuo Shuangtao is back,

693
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,639
how will you handle your relationship with her?

694
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,239
I think

695
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,599
If I keep acting like I don't know anything,

696
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
It would seem that I was trying to hide it.

697
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,639
I might as well confront her.

698
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,079
Since she is back,

699
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,280
she must have thought out how to explain it to me.

700
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
Then I'll take the opportunity

701
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,119
and pretend to believe her explanation.

702
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,239
To cope with it for a while.

703
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,920
It shouldn't be a problem.

704
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,280
Old fellow.

705
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,880
Have you decoded the secret letter

706
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,719
the last time?

707
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,360
We decoded it.

708
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,199
It's very valuable

709
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,519
Is an

710
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,920
by a Dayan Military spy

711
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,360
who is hiding in Yan'an

712
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,800
there are spies in Yan'an

713
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,119
are secretly searching.

714
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,000
I heard that they haven't found any results yet.

715
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:30,800
The contents of the secret telegram

716
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,639
about the economic and financial situation in Yan'an.

717
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Is not top-secret.

718
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,440
But the warrior under the mountain

719
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,119
put so much importance on the secret telegram,

720
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
It shouldn't be the content,

721
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,719
but the spy named Dayan,

722
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,559
dayan?

723
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,280
They're really strong.

724
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,960
When did you learn to cook?

725
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,480
I always know how to cook.

726
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,239
Why come back?

727
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm your wife.

728
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,440
The couple...

729
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,039
I asked why you came back.

730
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,000
The unit I worked in Wuhan

731
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,920
was abolished from the administration.

732
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,159
If I have nothing to do there,

733
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,599
I might as well

734
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
stay in Shanghai

735
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,760
with my husband.

736
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,760
Left Shuangtao.

737
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,639
I'm asking you one more time.

738
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,880
Why you're back!

739
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,719
You really don't have any feelings for me?

740
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,920
Guoguo, didn't we already agree?

741
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,239
This will be the best...

742
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,400
For both of us.

743
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,920
Now that you're back,

744
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,320
don't you know how much trouble will it cause?

745
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,000
Don't you know?

746
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,199
I lost contact with my organization.

747
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,559
What organization?

748
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,000
Military Command.

749
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,239
What's up

750
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,039
I've never seen a military commander before.

751
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,239
No, I haven't seen any alive.

752
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,960
I'm teasing you.

753
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,519
How could he be Juntong?

754
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
My organization

755
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,000
It's called Blood Soul Group.

756
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,079
When I was in Wuhan.

757
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,360
What group?

758
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,519
Just some patriotic young men

759
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,440
and want to do something to fight against Japan and save the country.

760
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,400
Aren't you really the military commander?

761
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,400
Are you really not Jun Tong?

762
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,159
The military leaders are ruthless.

763
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,719
Look at me.

764
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,239
Really?

765
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,599
Then why don't you go back to Wuhan?

766
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,840
Didn't I say that

767
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,800
I lost contact with my organization.

768
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,280
My superior has been missing.

769
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,519
If I couldn't find him,

770
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,599
so I couldn't contact my organization.

771
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,199
I can't believe it.

772
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,280
It must be you

773
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
got a new mission?

774
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,880
Is there any new mission?

775
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,559
Our organization...

776
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,840
In our organization.

777
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,440
With hammers everywhere,

778
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,119
with hard work.

779
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,360
After all,

780
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,480
Is an anti-Japanese organization.

781
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,639
If Luo and Zhao An find out about this,

782
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,480
I become a family member against Japan.

783
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,400
You must not involve me.

784
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,360
Are you alright?

785
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,360
There are many organizations like us,

786
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,239
then there are so many central commanders,

787
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:26,760
the Chinese Communist Party

788
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,239
we can't catch them.

789
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,119
Who would care about us?

790
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,320
How can I get you into trouble?

791
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,119
Gao Fang also knows your identity.

792
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,360
Is it proper that

793
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,320
his words are no proof.

794
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,960
Now that you're back,

795
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,880
what if he threatens you again?

796
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,400
I promise he won't threaten me.

797
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
Why did you...

798
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,559
Why do you have so many questions?

799
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,199
Timorous?

800
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,599
It's not your style.

801
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,480
It is not like you.

802
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
If you're too timid

803
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,480
you would take such a risk that day.

804
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,320
To help me at the cafe.

805
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,400
I was having second thoughts out of desperation.

806
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,000
When I think of it now,

807
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,239
cold sweat.

808
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,400
I don't know if you're really scared

809
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,039
or feigning fear.

810
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,119
Of course, I'm scared.

811
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,159
Even if you don't involve me in this,

812
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,920
If your organization knows about me,

813
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:22,960
and kill me to keep my mouth shut?

814
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,480
What should we do?

815
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,280
The biggest case our organization ever investigated

816
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,360
which was to burn the grain storage of Wang puppet troops.

817
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:32,000
Isn't killing me a bigger case?

818
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,480
You won't betray me, right?

819
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,239
What if I betray you?

820
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,320
Then I'll...

821
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,960
What?

822
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,880
I will...

823
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,639
Fight?

824
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,519
Don't.

825
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,199
I'm more scared.

826
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,280
That's right.

827
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:56,519
Alright.

828
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,639
Left Twin Peaches.

829
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,199
I don't have to betray you.

830
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:03,119
But you have to keep me safe.

831
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,559
As long as you don't betray me.

832
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:09,159
I'll not only keep you safe,

833
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,960
and I will be your wife.

834
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,800
And cook for you every day.

835
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,000
To be honest,

836
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,519
were you a little happy

837
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,000
are you a little happy?

838
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,239
No, I'm not.

839
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,000
I know that

840
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,039
you are only half-truths with me.

841
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,159
Which part is false?

842
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,679
The lips are fake.

843
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:42,639
But my heart is real.

844
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,400
Eat more.

845
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,519
Just eat.

846
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Why are you afraid of me poisoning her?

847
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,280
I'll show you some too.

848
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,320
It's not poison.

849
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,960
It's salty.

850
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,199
What to do now?

851
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,599
She was finally sent away.

852
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,639
And now they're back.

853
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,400
It seems

854
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,960
she is planning to lie low for a long time.

855
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,599
Maybe because of this,

856
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,760
because of this.

857
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,679
The worst thing is that I have a mission tomorrow.

858
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,960
Anything tomorrow?

859
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,599
I have something to do with the business tomorrow.

860
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,599
You have things to do on Sunday?

861
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,039
It's pretty tiring to be a traitor.

862
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:41,079
I'm a traitor with high aspirations.

863
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,360
What about you?

864
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,199
What are you going to do tomorrow?

865
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,920
My uncle-in-law asked me for something.

866
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,119
OK.

867
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,360
Just go with your work tomorrow.

868
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,880
I'll go back to work.

869
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,320
2 p.m. tomorrow.

870
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
No. 72 Yaerpei Road,
