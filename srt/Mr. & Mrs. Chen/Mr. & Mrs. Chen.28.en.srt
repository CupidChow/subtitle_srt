1
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,439
I did use you.

2
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,319
But when I saw you,

3
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,519
to see you.

4
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,000
What about you?

5
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,280
Are you happy?

6
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,439
I knew it.

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,799
I don't want you to be involved.

8
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,519
I want you to leave safely.

9
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
Why do you still want to marry me?

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
You won't go?

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,920
I think

12
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,120
I'll fulfill my promise to you.

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Really?

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,040
But if I marry you,

15
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,919
It's just to kill Yamashita.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,639
Will you believe it?

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,120
He would.

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
No matter what.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you think I love you?

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Certainly.

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
You should be confident of yourself.

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,479
Look how proud you are.

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
You're really something.

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,479
I thought you were killed by Officer Uchida.

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,919
I was trying to save myself.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
I told Ueda that

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,360
as long as I follow Wang Dapu,

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,319
we might have a chance to get the copper plate.

29
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,360
Uchida trusts you.

30
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,000
Right.

31
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,960
He trusts me more than you do.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,639
Is he mad at me?

33
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,400
The Japanese gave the order.

34
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,199
If I don't hand you over to the Imperial Prison, OK?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,520
That's right, Jiaping.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,120
Look at yourself.

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,719
You were put in the detention center.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,840
But the Japanese never tortured you.

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,520
They are all people, Manager Luo.

40
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,439
To help you

41
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,560
to plead for you.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Look at this.

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,560
Shuangtao defended me.

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,000
Look at this.

46
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,039
All right.

47
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,479
I know you are wronged.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,800
I will

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,879
I'll hold a banquet for you

50
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,120
get rid of the old to make way for the new

51
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,439
by the way, Luo,

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,159
how is the business recently?

53
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,719
Still the same.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
Without Zhao An,

55
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,800
this is much quieter.

56
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,560
That's strange.

57
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,719
Zhao An has so many lives.

58
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,159
How can he be the five of hearts?

59
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,039
How many lives

60
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,039
of Wang Tianmu's hands?

61
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,479
We've already pledged our allegiance here.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,639
That's right.

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,479
Now,

64
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,720
zhao An has finally pulled out the candle.

65
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,800
From now on, Taihe Trading Firm

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,399
will be controlled by us.

67
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,519
Do you remember Xiucai Qian who guarded the door?

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Even he

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,839
want to seek help from me.

70
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,000
And work for me.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,319
Many people nowadays

72
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,800
they should know about themselves.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,199
Qian Xiucai,

74
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
by the way,

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,759
copper coins of the Communist Party of China

76
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,639
the copper coins?

77
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,240
I didn't only see

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
at the same time.

79
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,560
The Japanese have been dying for this.

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,319
A combination of military damage and economic damage.

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,399
It seems that the Japanese executives

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,360
has changed their thinking.

83
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,240
What a pity!

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,639
If I can get this bronze plate,

85
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,439
let alone this is your car,

86
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,639
I didn't even bother to sit in Naoki Uchida's car.

87
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,959
You only talk big things.

88
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,199
Think about our future.

89
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,079
Now Japan and the United States are going to war.

90
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm afraid it's inevitable.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,839
The situation

92
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,279
the situation in the future.

93
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,279
Come on.

94
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,000
Shuangtao.

95
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,639
Go back and have a rest

96
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,199
I have a few more words with Jiaping.

97
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,040
Newspaper. Newspaper.

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,360
What's the matter?

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
I know you are wronged.

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
Have a good rest.

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
Don't go to work in a hurry.

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
There's another thing.

103
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,720
I made a deal recently.

104
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,199
I have to find someone I'm trustworthy.

105
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,600
Someone you trust.

106
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,439
Well, there?

107
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,480
The big spoon doesn't work well.

108
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,319
I still need you the most.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,680
What deal?

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,759
I'll tell you when.

111
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,360
But you have to remember

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,319
what I told you in the car.

113
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,639
The Japanese are unreliable now.

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,319
We have to think about our own future.

115
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
You're making it sound unclear.

116
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
But I'm telling you that

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
don't think I'll forgive you.

118
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,959
Have a good rest.

119
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,759
I can understand now.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,959
To protect your identity,

121
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,639
you secretly helped me.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,839
I thought they got information

123
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,560
we got the information from you.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,199
For example, the time you saved people in Hongyun Hotel.

125
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,079
Were leaked to me on purpose.

126
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,480
You have helped me before.

127
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,839
Just like the time that you killed Feng Qi.

128
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,279
Without your evidence,

129
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,839
I wouldn't have

130
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,519
just confirm Feng Qi's crime.

131
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,240
Do you think

132
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,839
are we different bedfellows?

133
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,040
It is.

134
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,319
But that doesn't count

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
even the dream of our couple

136
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,199
will eventually come together.

137
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,680
So you brought back

138
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,279
some files about the CPC

139
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,360
he wanted me to see

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,160
Including the files of Lu.

141
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,800
Gave a lot of thought to this.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
Back then, I made up my mind

143
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,319
to win you over.

144
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,839
But I can't be honest with you.

145
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,639
So I can only

146
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,160
In a subtle way.

147
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,360
I have to say that

148
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,959
you've been very helpful

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,759
the ideological work.

150
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,600
Because I know you.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
I know you.

152
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,799
What kind of person you want to be.

153
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,440
Think about

154
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,120
the one where our respective missions

155
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,600
Is that Ci'an Hospital?

156
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,720
You must have been following the clue to the magpie.

157
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
That's why you appeared there.

158
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,279
That's right.

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,120
We're investigating

160
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,080
the formula of the paper used for the coin currency stolen by Juntong spies

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,279
and the copper plate.

162
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,679
Now thinking back,

163
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,480
you are really good at acting.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,360
She knew about my identity,

165
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,840
but pretended to be scared.

166
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,120
If a man can act,

167
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,159
he must be forced by your women.

168
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,000
And confess yourself like this?

169
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,279
Come on.

170
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,480
How many other dramas and lies

171
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,000
and how many lies you told me.

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,639
I swear.

173
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,399
Aside from my identity,

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,120
about my identity.

175
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,480
I don't believe that.

176
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,399
When a man lies,

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
It's only the first and countless times.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,039
You've lied to me before.

179
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
That's different.

180
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,799
Women lie

181
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
so that men won't be sad.

182
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,600
When a man lies,

183
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,360
Is purely to lie to women.

184
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,559
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,639
You intentionally exposed yourself that day,

186
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,639
so you could join us

187
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,320
to raid the counterfeit factory with us?

188
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
I only saw that there is so much evidence

189
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
and you didn't have a reason to think so

190
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,799
and became anxious.

191
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,120
Of course,

192
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,639
the most important thing is your safety.

193
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,720
The last sentence

194
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,399
really touches me.

195
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,600
Did you start to suspect me

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,679
after that operation?

197
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,039
I should've doubted you,

198
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,240
but I didn't expect that

199
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,360
that Zhao An replaced it.

200
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,679
It was a nice design.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,759
What do you mean by that?

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,000
Did you think

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,639
that I should be inferior to you?

204
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I didn't say that.

205
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,120
Otherwise, I won't let you know more

206
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,480
the Communist Party's anti-Japanese actions

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,840
and the communist ideology.

208
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,240
I don't know either

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,600
I know you well enough.

210
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,559
Don't worry.

211
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,000
It's enough for you to know me

212
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,399
knowing me

213
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,919
and you know us.

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,840
I have now completely broken

215
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,240
with Juntong.

216
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
Would you accept an ex-military unification member?

217
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,519
I'll testify for you!

218
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,080
You're not like Jiang Zhaoguo and the others.

219
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,399
You always insisted

220
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,159
our call for unity

221
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,399
that we have called for.

222
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,039
Your thoughts and actions

223
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,080
In thought and action.

224
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm ready.

225
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,080
Alright.

226
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,200
I'll report to the organization as soon as possible

227
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,360
so that one day,

228
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,840
that we can all

229
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,080
as soon as possible.

230
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm looking forward to that day to come.

231
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,639
Alright.

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,639
But we need to be more careful

233
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,679
while waiting.

234
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,200
After all, you've taken away the copper plate from Jiang Zhaoguo.

235
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,879
He must be

236
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,000
he must be so exasperated that

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
assassination.

238
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,320
That's what he did.

239
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,120
I know how they are.

240
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,159
They can't handle me.

241
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,120
Now we have the copper plate.

242
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,759
When we find the paper formula of the coin,

243
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,639
the real counterfeit factory

244
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,559
my mission is over.

245
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,759
I've got to finish

246
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,720
with you.

247
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,399
Four of clubs,

248
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,080
five of hearts.

249
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
We're officially together.

250
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,039
Pay more attention to your safety.

251
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,080
As for the business,

252
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,919
let's not go there.

253
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,960
I'll talk to Luo Guanqun

254
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,399
tell her that my wife worked so hard for me

255
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,600
and she's resting at home.

256
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,159
You should stay at home.

257
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,080
I won't go anywhere.

258
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,039
Come on.

259
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
What about you?

260
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,960
I have to...

261
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,720
I need to contact my superior.

262
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
Who is your superior?

263
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,960
How do you usually contact?

264
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,600
My superior is...

265
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,480
My superior is the Communist Party of China.

266
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
The way we communicate with each other

267
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,759
that's a communist ideology.

268
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,679
That means he didn't say anything.

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
He still doesn't treat me as one of his own.

270
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,000
The copper coin has been recovered.

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,120
Please indicate when and where to exchange the coins.

272
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
In this operation,

273
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
In the operation.

274
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,919
She might not stay here for long.

275
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,200
Zuo Shuangtao has known my identity.

276
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
She has broken with Juntong

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,399
to join the underground organizations of our Party.

278
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,759
Please approve it.

279
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,200
Come in.

280
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,639
Manager Luo,

281
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,080
there is a response.

282
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,960
What about

283
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,320
he agreed to our asking price.

284
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,879
Next,

285
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,399
one step at a time.

286
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,320
Follow the plan.

287
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,440
Yes

288
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,320
nice to meet you, sir.

289
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,000
I've booked a cafe on the second floor.

290
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,279
This way, please.

291
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,679
902.

292
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
The magpie is in 902.

293
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,799
Hurry!

294
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes

295
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,159
mister.

296
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,399
This place is sealed off.

297
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,879
Get out of here!

298
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,879
Let go of me!

299
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,159
We've searched every body.

300
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,279
I didn't find anything.

301
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,799
That's impossible.

302
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,480
I found something.

303
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,639
The formula of the coin paper

304
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,799
Is on him.

305
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,599
Who's that?

306
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,200
Who are you?

307
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,359
You don't want to tell me?

308
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,920
What are you talking about?

309
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,559
I don't know.

310
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,039
What are you doing?

311
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,680
What do you want?

312
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,119
See that?

313
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,960
See that?

314
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:01,960
Boss.

315
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,079
What to do with that magpie?

316
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Not to be worth a hair

317
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,599
I suspect that the magpie

318
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,440
hid the formula in her wound.

319
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,599
So I opened it with a dagger.

320
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,279
But I didn't find it.

321
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,480
But I found a piece of brown paper.

322
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,920
This proves my judgment is right.

323
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,519
But maybe someone

324
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,079
maybe someone took it earlier

325
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,640
chief Chen

326
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,000
sit down

327
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,240
second Blade.

328
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,200
Seeing me back,

329
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,960
right?

330
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,519
How would I dare to be disappointed?

331
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,920
I was so scared.

332
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,880
No, I didn't mean that.

333
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,519
We were surprised and happy

334
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,839
you also saw the ending

335
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,319
and Chen Dugu.

336
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:40,920
I've seen it.

337
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,440
Thanks to your wife, she alerted me.

338
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,680
You didn't forget the task

339
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,720
I gave you, right?

340
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,400
I wouldn't dare to forget it.

341
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,160
I've been following Dazhao

342
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,400
any findings?

343
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,039
Tai Scoop has been acting abnormal recently.

344
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,599
He seems to be secretly contacting someone.

345
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,279
But he was afraid to expose his whereabouts.

346
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,559
He changes a different phone booth

347
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,640
every time he calls.

348
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,200
That's it?

349
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,359
I haven't finished.

350
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,920
Big Scoop knows me.

351
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,119
I didn't dare to get too close to him.

352
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,400
Later on,

353
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,880
I paid off a beggar.

354
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,839
To approach him when he made the call.

355
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,279
According to the beggar,

356
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,640
he was negotiating with the man on the phone about a price.

357
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,400
He said he wanted 500 little yellow croakers

358
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,759
no one is missing.

359
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,960
Five hundred little yellow fishes?

360
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,279
That means 30 jin of gold!

361
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,519
That's right.

362
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,720
I didn't know these treasures

363
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,240
could be sold for so much.

364
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,799
Who's on the end of the phone?

365
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,480
Do you know

366
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,759
I don't know.

367
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,799
That's it?

368
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
She even went to the camera shop.

369
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,839
What?

370
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,839
He bought a developing tank and fixing powder.

371
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,480
Are you going to develop photos?

372
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,599
Exactly.

373
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,200
He even put the developed photos in an envelope

374
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,599
the photos in an envelope.

375
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Who was it addressed to?

376
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,039
That's right.

377
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
I remade the envelope.

378
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,119
Look at this.

379
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,119
That's great.

380
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
How did you get this letter?

381
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,119
That day, I followed Dashao

382
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,279
I saw him putting a letter in the mailbox

383
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,160
In An De Road.

384
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,839
It was 8 in the morning

385
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,680
I know the postman

386
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,480
to pick up the mail at 9: 00 a.m.

387
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,599
I used the one hour between that

388
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,480
of the mailbox with this one hour

389
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,519
and found the letter in no time

390
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,400
oh yeah

391
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,480
besides the envelope, I also recreated the photo.

392
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,359
I mean, where are you?

393
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,599
You can't just take them out all at once.

394
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,480
I don't want to give you

395
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,599
so frightened, right?

396
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,200
Well,

397
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,839
both surprise and joy.

398
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,839
What deal?

399
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,119
I'll tell you when.

400
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,720
But you have to remember

401
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,559
what I told you in the car.

402
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,720
The Japanese are unreliable now.

403
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,519
We have to think about our own future.

404
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,119
Alright.

405
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,720
When you opened the envelope,

406
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
when you opened the envelope, right?

407
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,359
No, it's not.

408
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,640
On the seal,

409
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,240
was opened after being exposed to steam.

410
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,519
So it left no trace behind

411
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,640
chief Chen

412
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
I decided to be a good person

413
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,920
I'm still not used to it.

414
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,279
I don't have much experience.

415
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,000
I need your advice.

416
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,039
The second one.

417
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,279
The way you pretended to me

418
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,240
with your two pedicure blades.

419
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,599
How he performed in front of me.

420
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,119
I never thought

421
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,079
and become a good man again?

422
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,440
That's right.

423
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,359
When I first came into the underworld,

424
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,559
I always think the world is so dangerous.

425
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
One must refrain from evil deeds

426
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,559
only by doing the most evil.

427
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,200
But now she's a good person.

428
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:58,839
Come in.

429
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,119
Officer Uchida.

430
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
You are Qian Chengyi's

431
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,799
yes

432
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,480
but everyone calls me Qian Xiucai.

433
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,079
You wrote the exposure letter?

434
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,079
Saying that Zhao An was actually killed by Luo Guanqun.

435
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,279
Yes

436
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,279
although there is no direct evidence,

437
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,079
but I think it's a reasonable inference.

438
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,279
How long have you been in the reception office?

439
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,200
More than two years.

440
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,759
What exactly are you going to do?

441
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,519
Receiving and distributing newspapers and letters.

442
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,880
Look at this.

443
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,000
Tell me if you remember anything.

444
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
Check the postmark.

445
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,640
The sender's address should be around An De Road.

446
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,519
It could be anyone.

447
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,160
To post a letter around An De Road.

448
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,880
What does it mean?

449
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,240
You're right.

450
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,160
You're right.

451
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,960
Officer.

452
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,480
Can I turn on the lamp?

453
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,079
On

454
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,319
this letter...

455
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,400
Is probably

456
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,839
from our firm.

457
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,759
And mailed them.

458
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,079
Why did you say that?

459
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,240
The envelope is made of cowhide paper.

460
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
The paper won't seep easily

461
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,400
good tenacity

462
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,440
It is the first choice for making the envelope.

463
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,359
But there is a shortage of supplies these years.

464
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,400
Now the available envelopes

465
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
have been replaced by cheap kraft paper.

466
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,039
Those who continue to use cored paper envelopes

467
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,400
are the departments and agencies

468
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,799
that are working for the new government.

469
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,039
It is said that this kind of paper

470
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:07,200
will not see through light.

471
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,440
And it is a strong secret

472
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,319
as for An De Road,

473
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,920
that work for the new government

474
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,839
only Taihe Business Firm

475
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,799
It seems I got the right person.

476
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,359
Please check the envelope.

477
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,240
Sir,

478
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,359
this is confidential.

479
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,400
It's inappropriate with my position.

480
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,240
I think it's suitable.

481
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,720
Yes

482
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,480
this movie is very boring,

483
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,759
I suggest you not watch it.

484
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm going to marry Yamashita Takeru.

485
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
Do you look down on me?

486
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,519
I wanted to escape.

487
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,839
And I wanted to die.

488
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,400
But then I decided to stay.

489
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,480
Jiang Zhaoguo wanted me to stay here.

490
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,920
But in the end, I've made this choice

491
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,279
just for him.

492
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,279
Then for what?

493
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,920
I don't know either

494
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,480
I have sacrificed everything for him.

495
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
My body

496
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
and my soul.

497
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,799
And my dignity.

498
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,400
I did everything

499
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,640
but I felt that I was wrong

500
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
totally wrong.

501
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,880
Can I do something about it?

502
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,680
What?

503
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,839
I know I don't know you well.

504
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,680
But my intuition tells me that

505
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,680
you are not like them.

506
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,880
I won't inquire about your identity.

507
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,799
I just wanted to believe you.

508
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,839
So I think

509
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
If you can let me do something.

510
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,279
For a worthy reason,

511
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,079
a noble faith.

512
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,160
In order to make my life

513
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
to regain value,

514
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,920
then...

515
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,920
What do you want to do?

516
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,519
Right now,

517
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,200
who can get close to the warrior.

518
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,720
He never told me his secrets.

519
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,359
But I know he is very powerful

520
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,240
and is planning something evil.

521
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,799
Aren't you afraid of danger?

522
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,039
Not really.

523
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,000
Don't you fear that

524
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,319
you'll lose the reputation

525
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,160
or status,

526
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,359
a halo?

527
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,400
Don't be.

528
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,680
I'm not afraid of death.

529
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,559
But I'm afraid of dying meaninglessly.

530
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,240
Why are you back so late?

531
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,079
Your superior replied to you.

532
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,279
The application

533
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,480
I've submitted it to your organization.

534
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,839
I can join your organization now.

535
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,839
Don't be anxious.

536
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,880
Get me a glass of water.

537
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
The superior

538
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,400
asked me to investigate you

539
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,200
Investigate you for a while.

540
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,720
You didn't get approved.

541
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,440
Inspection doesn't mean you haven't approved.

542
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,440
This is a serious and serious matter.

543
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,960
It's not all about your own will.

544
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,799
However,

545
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
the organization has agreed

546
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,079
to assist me with work.

547
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,440
So I can help you.

548
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,000
To support you?

549
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Luo Guanqun asked me

550
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,759
he asked me to see him tomorrow morning.

551
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,079
There must be something very important.

552
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,160
He asked you to rest for a while.

553
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,079
That means he needs me to the time.

554
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,680
I'm thinking

555
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,960
that he has got

556
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,079
the formula in Magpie's hands?

557
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I didn't expect that

558
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,079
jun Tong had a fight

559
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,039
for the magpie for a while.

560
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,400
Finally, they got caught behind.

561
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,599
Luckily,

562
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,720
luo Guanqun is just trying to get some leverage.

563
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,720
In this way, we'll get our chance.

564
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
What is your plan?

565
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,079
Let me check first.

566
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,440
How Luo Guanqun dealt with Yamashita, right?

567
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,599
And then choose the right opportunity.

568
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,440
I want to take part in the operation.

569
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,559
According to your organization,

570
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,960
I can help you.

571
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,640
Alright.

572
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,839
You finish reading those books first.

573
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,559
Why do you read these?

574
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,799
Actually, I was thinking that

575
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,039
If Luo Guanqun might think this simple.

576
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,400
He wrote an anonymous letter

577
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,920
and made an anonymous phone call.

578
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,319
And even bargain with her.

579
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,559
I don't believe that there is no strategy

580
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,079
you are worried about exposing it.

581
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,559
If it is exposed,

582
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,880
luo Guanqun and I will be screwed.

583
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,640
But I still can't understand

584
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,720
what it has to do with reading these books.

585
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,359
Tomorrow afternoon,

586
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,519
tomorrow afternoon

587
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,000
to buy clothes for the wedding.

588
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,640
You'll go with Han Lu.

589
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,039
Found a place.

590
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,079
In the Gu House.

591
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,920
A three-story Shikumen house.

592
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,839
It's secluded.

593
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,000
The line of sight is fine.

594
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,799
Which is very convenient for us to monitor.

595
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,039
One more thing.

596
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,279
I also connected a phone line

597
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,400
to get there directly.

598
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,960
The phone company.

599
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,359
We'll never find that location.

600
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,039
Take me there directly.

601
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,000
All right.

602
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,279
Manager Luo didn't come?

603
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,920
It's none of your business.

604
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,880
Yes, that's right.

605
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,319
It's Mr. Luo's paper?

606
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,880
Section Chief Chen

607
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,240
are you here for work?

608
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,559
Right.

609
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
So many things happened in the firm recently.

610
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,480
I'm so glad to have you back.

611
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,400
Right.

612
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,279
We have fewer and fewer

613
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,240
In our business.

614
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,599
That's right

615
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,839
chief Chen

616
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,759
I've heard what happened to you

617
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,160
It's really remarkable that

618
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,200
you're really amazing.

619
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
Why didn't you read your Chronicles of the States of Eastern Zhou?

620
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,440
I've finished.

621
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,279
Finished.

622
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,960
I thought you would watch it over and over again.

623
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,160
You don't need to read it over and over again

624
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,559
you don't have to read it over and over again?

625
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,680
Chief Chen

626
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,920
he's here

627
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:11,960
where is Luo?

628
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,839
He's waiting for you.

629
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,000
Where is he?

630
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,519
He's not here.

631
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,839
Let me take you there.

632
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,400
Alright.

633
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,720
Drive the car.

634
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,680
No, I won't.

635
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,319
Don't drive.

636
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,119
Manager Luo said that

637
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,599
driving in and out.

638
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,519
Caught too much attention.

639
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,720
Let's walk there.

640
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,400
Alright.

641
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,160
Who will that be?

642
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,960
This place.

643
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,039
Why did Luo meet me here?

644
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
We'll find out after we enter.

645
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,159
Is he in the room?

646
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,239
Yes, he's waiting for you.

647
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,559
Brother,

648
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,119
what a shabby place this is!

649
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,000
This is my command center.

650
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Knock it off.

651
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,760
You don't have to command so shabby.

652
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,280
Someone offered me a lot of money

653
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,880
to buy the thing I have

654
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,079
what's that

655
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,440
the formula of coin paper

656
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,880
the formula of coin paper

657
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,719
I heard about it.

658
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,320
Why do you have it?

659
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
We are the only ones

660
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,880
only you and I,

661
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,480
big spoon.

662
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,400
The three of us know it.

663
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,320
If the deal goes down,

664
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,119
our heads

665
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,639
land on the ground together.

666
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,079
Brother,

667
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,559
we've done so much business.

668
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,719
Why do we have to be killed this time?

669
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,000
Do you know who you made deals with this time?

670
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,719
Who?

671
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
Martial arts master under the mountain.

672
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,199
Martial Master of the Mountain.

673
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,559
Scared?

674
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,480
Chief Chen

675
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,199
you can't leave?

676
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,320
You've already known too much.

677
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,480
Come here.

678
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,440
Have a seat

679
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,239
chief Chen

680
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,440
have a seat

681
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
and let Manager Luo finish.

682
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,760
Well, brother.

683
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,400
I'm just a pawn on the stage.

684
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,079
I can't sing in this play.

685
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,960
Stop that

686
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,800
you managed to escape from the detention center of the Military Police Headquarters.

687
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,199
You should do this.

688
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,159
Ten big yellow croaker,

689
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,719
ten fishes?

690
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,960
Or yellow croaker?

691
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,880
I can't do that either.

692
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
My life is ruined.

693
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,400
What's the use of money?

694
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,679
You know what?

695
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,119
As long as you use your wits,

696
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,880
you'll be able to do it.

697
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,559
Then brother,

698
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,960
what do you want me to do?

699
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,199
You know

700
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,920
about the current situation?

701
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,719
In the future,

702
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,159
more and more miserable.

703
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,679
You don't want to

704
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,559
end up in a corner?

705
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,360
I don't want to.

706
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,639
The Japanese are not reliable anymore.

707
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,280
What do you mean?

708
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,440
Can I rely on money?

709
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,199
Money every day.

710
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,119
Soon the money will become a pile of waste paper.

711
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,360
Gold

712
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,400
you can only count on holding gold.

713
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,119
Aren't you afraid of the Japanese collapsing?

714
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,079
Aren't you scared?

715
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,239
The Communists are back against us. Are you scared?

716
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,079
Aren't you scared?

717
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,639
Aren't you scared that the National Army is back?

718
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,960
Or not?

719
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,440
Let the moon shine on the lakes.

720
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,719
Don't be afraid that you can catch the golden hook anywhere.

721
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:50,960
Enough!

722
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,320
Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother.

723
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,599
Stop reciting your stupid poem.

724
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,280
What the hell do you want me to do?

725
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,280
My good friend.

726
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,599
These words

727
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,199
are from "Liang You."

728
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,840
Then this person

729
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,920
he will be one of those who subscribed to Good Friend.

730
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,239
How is the investigation going?

731
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,159
No news yet.

732
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,519
What's the name of the person

733
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,679
you mentioned before?

734
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,599
Is Qian Chengyi

735
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,880
are you sure that

736
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,599
he'll be able to find out the truth?

737
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,199
If he is in Taihe Trading Firm,

738
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,559
he knows that everyone there

739
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,960
you have to believe that some people will stop at nothing

740
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,719
to go upwards.

741
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm going to prepare the kimono

742
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,199
to prepare the kimono for the wedding.

743
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,679
Once we have something,

744
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,679
call Juchuan Riqiao Shop immediately.

745
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,480
Yes

746
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,559
mr Yamashita

747
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,760
has brought Miss Han Lu here.

748
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,119
She's waiting for you outside.

749
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,159
I shouldn't have let such a beautiful lady

750
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,519
I should have done it.

751
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,000
Mr. Yamashita,

752
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,400
what's the matter?

753
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,800
That man called again.

754
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,719
He wants to make a deal today.

755
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:23,960
Time and place

756
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,119
how to conduct the transaction?

757
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,800
There is a public phone booth beside Pacific Music Store

758
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,320
near Pacific Music Store on Waima Road

759
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,719
he asked you to go there alone.

760
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,760
Wait for him to call you there at 3 p.m.

761
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,440
You are going alone.

762
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,239
That's too dangerous.

763
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,960
He also said

764
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,519
he will be watching nearby.

765
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,280
Once you find someone is with you,

766
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
cancel the deal.

767
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,239
I will arrange good people in advance

768
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,719
around the phone booth

769
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,480
tell them to never hide

770
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,519
and don't be discovered.

771
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,440
Yes

772
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,480
however,

773
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,519
according to my judgment,

774
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,320
the real exchange place

775
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,079
wasn't that phone booth

776
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,679
he still changes his address.

777
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:02,079
I'll pretend to follow him

778
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,679
to protect you.

779
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,440
Catch the blackmailer at the same time.

780
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,320
Remember that

781
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,480
the formula is the most important,

782
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,719
the most important part is catching him.

783
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,679
Yes

784
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,760
put the gold in the car.

785
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,199
Yes

786
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:26,360
what about

787
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,440
my beautiful Miss Han Lu.

788
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,320
Have you found your favorite style?

789
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,719
Your eyes are blind.

790
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,800
I must go to the store

791
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,440
and try it on in person.

792
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,519
I'm very sorry.

793
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,639
Something came up.

794
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,519
I won't accompany you now.

795
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,480
But don't worry.

796
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,559
As soon as I'm done,

797
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,840
I'll come and keep you company.

798
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:48,880
Alright.

799
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,519
Luckily, I have an appointment with Zuo Shuangtao.

800
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,159
I won't be alone anymore.

801
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,559
Left Shuangtao.

802
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,480
From Taihe Trading Firm?

803
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,320
Right.

804
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,800
Her husband Chen Jiaping is my good friend.

805
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,920
She knows Japanese kimono culture very well.

806
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,360
She can give me advice.

807
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,239
That you are willing to wear a kimono

808
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:08,800
I'm really

809
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm very pleased.

810
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,679
There're too many people.

811
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,719
We can't investigate one by one

812
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,679
mr. Yamashita,

813
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,840
the outer road is ahead.

814
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,159
Hello?

815
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,280
This is Underhill.

816
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:49,719
Five minutes from now,

817
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:52,000
there is a phone booth

818
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,880
telephone booth.

819
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,719
If you are late,

820
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,400
the deal is off.

821
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,280
the deal is off.
