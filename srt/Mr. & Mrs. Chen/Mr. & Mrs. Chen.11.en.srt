1
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,359
Gao Fang.

2
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,799
Get out of here!

3
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,560
Great!

4
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,719
Great!

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,400
You two are really here.

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
Jiaping.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,760
You've been targeting Zuo Shuangtao for a long time, haven't you?

8
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,439
If I hadn't been told that

9
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,280
I wouldn't know.

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Sir. Sir.

11
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,439
Stop fighting!

12
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,159
Get out of my way!

13
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,079
Let go of me!

14
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,000
Stop fighting!

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,879
Get out of the way!

16
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,879
Section Chief Chen

17
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,120
back off!

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,479
Cool down. Calm down.

19
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,520
Get out of the way!

20
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,319
Where else did you go?

21
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,080
Chief Chen,

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
where did they go?

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
It's obvious.

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,680
About the hotel.

25
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,719
Second best.

26
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,919
Stop this nonsense.

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,680
We are innocent!

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,919
If you are innocent,

29
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,439
then Captain Zhao and...

30
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,400
Are you alright, brother?

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
That careless?

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
What is this?

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,560
Don't move.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,240
Give it to me.

35
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:28,840
Give it to me.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
Don't move.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Speak it out.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,000
What is written in it?

39
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,560
Tell me. What's this?

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,000
Brother.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
Is it a secret letter?

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,639
Have a look.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,479
Give it to me.

44
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,240
Don't move.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Double-peach.

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,599
The one I love.

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,479
Brother.

48
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,199
I will.

49
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,560
Are you all right

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,560
It's been a while,

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
as long as you can.

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,080
I asked around several times before I found out

53
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,120
that you were in Shanghai,

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,520
you left Wuhan.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
Without telling me.

56
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,719
I think you really had a change of heart.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,439
In fact, in the past six months,

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,319
I noticed that

59
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,840
you've really stopped loving me.

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,039
But I still can't believe

61
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,039
you would be so heartless.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,080
I've been tossing and turning

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,479
I toss and turn on sleep

64
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,360
I couldn't get over them.

65
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,080
I always think of the time we spent together.

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,520
At that time,

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,879
your blue pendant...

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,199
While I miss you,

69
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,719
I can't see you for a day,

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
Is like three months.

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,960
One's nobility lasts forever

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,159
I want to hold an umbrella

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
= Hold an umbrella for you, =

74
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,919
♪ Making a pot of tea ♪

75
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,039
♪ As you count our time ♪

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,759
I just want to be like that.

77
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,080
Enduring as the universe

78
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,439
did you write that?

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,039
I didn't write that.

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,080
You didn't write that?

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Gao Fang said he didn't write it.

82
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,280
Who then wrote it?

83
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,959
Who wrote this?

84
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,079
Got it?

85
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,720
Repeat.

86
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,759
After meeting Gao Fang at Qinka Cafe,

87
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,240
first confirm the secret letter in your hand.

88
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,720
And find a chance to poison the coffee.

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,959
I finally understand.

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
Guo Guo is trying to assassinate

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,759
to get back a secret letter.

92
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,240
But then the secret letter was lost for some unknown reason.

93
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,480
She once suspected that I took the letter.

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,879
So Gao Fang has the secret letter.

95
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,000
And used it to force Guoguo to date with him.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,240
Now Juntong wants to kill Gao Fang,

97
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,240
but Guoguo must not know that

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,279
her meeting with Gao Fang was seen by Zhang Shuyun.

99
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,079
And Zhang Shuyun will definitely tell Zhao An about this.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,439
So Zhao An must have watched

101
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,120
are under Zhao An's watch.

102
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,920
Guoguo's identity

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,240
will be exposed.

104
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
You two are really here.

105
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,879
Jiaping.

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,120
You've been targeting Zuo Shuangtao for a long time, haven't you?

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
If I hadn't been told that

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,439
I wouldn't know.

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,399
You two are so bold.

110
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,000
Jia Ping.

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,079
He and I

112
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,879
In Wuhan.

113
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,759
What connections?

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,759
What's their relationship?

115
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,040
Isn't that obvious?

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
It's true that

117
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,360
with him for some time.

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
I didn't expect that Left Shuangtao

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,120
being at the same time

120
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,000
who knows if there are only two boats?

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,279
Get out of here

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
jiaping.

123
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,199
We won't have much time

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,639
It'll be short.

125
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,480
You're going to be with him forever.

126
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,000
Spend the rest of your life with him.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,279
You told me that you can do that

128
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,040
he is the sour person.

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
Those are just words.

130
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,879
I am not serious at all.

131
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,680
You are not taking it seriously.

132
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,199
Why do you leave this letter?

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
I just received this.

134
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,519
I wanted to get rid of it.

135
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,160
But then I couldn't find it.

136
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,759
I thought it was lost.

137
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,399
You thought it was lost?

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,360
You were too excited

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
when you received this letter?

140
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,360
What do you want from me?

141
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,079
Back then, the wars were so fierce,

142
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,560
and we were far apart.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,199
I wrote to you.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,879
Two months?

145
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,079
I didn't receive any reply in two months.

146
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,399
I didn't dare to think

147
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,360
If we can still be together.

148
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,759
How can we survive till tomorrow?

149
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,920
I don't even know.

150
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,279
We're the same.

151
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,959
That's right.

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,839
Than a relationship.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
What's up

154
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,879
who made you the judge?

155
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
How dare you hit me?

156
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,519
Scram!

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't want to see you again!

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,000
Scram!

159
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Come on.

160
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,160
Come on.

161
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:19,879
You haven't seen her before?

162
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,560
It is.

163
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,160
Why are you having this?

164
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,120
I...

165
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,800
Did you steal this from Zuo Shuangtao?

166
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,920
Say something.

167
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Tell me the truth.

168
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,600
Yes

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,759
I took it from her.

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,879
I have always

171
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,960
secretly.

172
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
So when she came to work that day,

173
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,159
I took this from her pocket

174
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,039
when I moved things.

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
So you threatened my wife

176
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,000
to threaten my wife

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,840
to date with you.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,960
Right?

179
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,399
Right.

180
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,480
Alright.

181
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,799
This is the last time.

182
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,559
What else did you do with my wife?

183
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,720
I didn't do that.

184
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,360
I really just came out

185
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,159
to talk to her.

186
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,720
I didn't do anything else

187
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
that's enough, Jiaping.

188
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,039
Cool down.

189
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,240
Come on.

190
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,679
Captain Zhao.

191
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,120
Why are you here?

192
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,440
I was passing by.

193
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,960
And wanted to come in for coffee.

194
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,639
There's a matter between you two.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,279
Alright, it's over.

196
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,120
We can go now.

197
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
Coffee.

198
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
There's a letter in your pocket

199
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,559
second knife

200
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,840
Is it interesting?

201
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,840
Gao Fang and Zuo Shuangtao just wanted to have a cup of coffee

202
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,639
are you involved?

203
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,960
You insist on helping Chief Chen to find out the truth

204
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,399
and find a love letter

205
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,799
a love token.

206
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,000
To look for them?

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,039
Got it?

208
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,679
You let Chief Chen

209
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,159
to deepen Zuo Shuangtao's misunderstanding

210
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,159
you don't want to tear down the house?

211
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,679
No.

212
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,159
How to explain this?

213
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,639
How, how can I explain?

214
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,159
Explain it.

215
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Scram.

216
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,360
It's exhausting to act.

217
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,240
Luckily, we had a good chemistry.

218
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Is this what you want?

219
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,720
Don't you ask me what it is?

220
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,879
If you want to tell me,

221
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,279
you can't be threatened by Gao Fang.

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,960
You can at least make a guess.

223
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,080
I don't want to guess.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360
It is just me.

225
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,519
Just muddle along.

226
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,559
Find a way to earn money.

227
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,840
I don't want to know

228
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,600
I don't want to know.

229
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,399
And I'm not interested either.

230
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,279
In addition,

231
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,559
It won't do me any good

232
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,039
to know your secret.

233
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,440
Then how did you know

234
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,679
gao Fang threatened me with this?

235
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,039
When you met Gao Fang at the Mega Park,

236
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,519
zhang Shuyun saw you

237
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,120
and Lu Fangfang heard about it.

238
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,360
How careless.

239
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
Who would have thought

240
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
In the end, women's gossip helped me.

241
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,159
No matter what,

242
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,960
thank you.

243
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,879
Don't thank me.

244
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,759
I owe you an apology.

245
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,720
I deducted the reputation

246
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,799
a bad reputation for you.

247
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,639
And slapped you.

248
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,519
Is it alright?

249
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,559
Nothing serious.

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,519
Instead,

251
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,720
for you,

252
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,399
and I made it clear

253
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,159
and making things worse.

254
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,600
He'll be laughed at for a while.

255
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,240
That's right.

256
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,120
And from now on,

257
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,759
I will have more in common with Luo Guanqun.

258
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,039
You came to Shanghai

259
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
to Shanghai for this, right?

260
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,600
Now that you've got one,

261
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,399
I will leave.

262
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,279
Do you think

263
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,480
I used you?

264
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,919
I didn't.

265
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,240
Look at this.

266
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
We both

267
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,919
solve each other's problems

268
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,240
Isn't that good?

269
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,559
I was thinking

270
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,080
I just realized that

271
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,440
you've taken every detail into consideration.

272
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
If it weren't for the slap in the face,

273
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,519
I couldn't have left so easily.

274
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,399
If you are a special agent,

275
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,360
you must be the best.

276
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,639
Stop messing around.

277
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,919
Am I a special agent?

278
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,480
At most, I'm a thief who got beaten up.

279
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,960
Right?

280
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,600
I learned a little something.

281
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,679
Why are you with the traitors?

282
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,559
Think about it

283
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,519
In Shanghai Beach,

284
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,559
right?

285
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,639
To make a living.

286
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,000
But I think

287
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,879
you also have this.

288
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,879
What?

289
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,919
That's a secret.

290
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,720
You have a secret from me.

291
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,559
But I'm worried about you.

292
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,759
We just got married,

293
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,240
not long after we got married.

294
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,000
If they suspect you again.

295
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,240
They won't.

296
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,200
Think about it.

297
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,679
You cuckold me.

298
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,240
And I slapped you.

299
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,480
The situation today,

300
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,159
Isn't it normal that

301
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,879
to part ways.

302
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,080
He won't suspect.

303
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,000
That's what you want.

304
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,639
Right?

305
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,879
Right now,

306
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,200
for the two of us,

307
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,600
this...

308
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,440
That's the best result.

309
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,240
Right?

310
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,639
Right.

311
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
It's just a play.

312
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,440
It's just that...

313
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,679
Our acting skills are so good.

314
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Your acting

315
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,840
I almost bought it.

316
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,679
What about you?

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,399
When you are young?

318
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,480
That they almost bought it.

319
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,480
If this is a movie,

320
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,840
I hope it can go on and on.

321
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,519
Goodbye.

322
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
Why didn't you kill Gao Fang?

323
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Many things

324
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,200
are not solved by murder.

325
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,679
How did you do that?

326
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,120
I have my way.

327
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,840
He returned the secret letter to me.

328
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,679
Here he is.

329
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,599
I didn't see it.

330
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,839
Maybe you didn't care.

331
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,880
To convince him.

332
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,960
A woman can find other ways.

333
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,480
Especially when

334
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,079
who likes you,

335
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,240
but I clearly saw

336
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,000
you poisoned the coffee.

337
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,880
I've changed the poison into water.

338
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,039
If Gao Fang is still alive,

339
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,279
you will take actions.

340
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,799
But in that case,

341
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,079
I can't tell you that I got it.

342
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,799
You made an order again.

343
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,599
Zhao An has been monitoring Gao Fang and me.

344
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,559
If I hadn't made the decision,

345
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,519
wouldn't be here to talk.

346
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
I won't forgive you

347
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,359
I won't argue with you.

348
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,400
Get on the boat first

349
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,599
and leave Shanghai first.

350
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,559
Where?

351
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,559
To Jiaxing.

352
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,400
There is a connecting line.

353
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,319
And then try to get to Chongqing.

354
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:47,920
Come on.

355
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,160
I'll keep an eye on

356
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,839
I'll keep an eye on it for you.

357
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,119
I'll contact you when I find her.

358
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,599
Alright.

359
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,640
Alright.

360
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,039
Take care then. I won't see you out, bosses.

361
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,799
Don't.

362
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,200
Nice calligraphy.

363
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,200
It seems that you are in a good mood today.

364
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:36,799
Old road.

365
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,200
This is a secret letter from Jun Tong.

366
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,599
Gao Fang has translated part of the letter.

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
The rest

368
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,920
please arrange experts to continue deciphering the secret letter.

369
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
Since the secret letter

370
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,039
Is so important to the military,

371
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,799
there must be classified information in it.

372
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,400
And my contacts.

373
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,839
Left Twin Peach.

374
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,640
Has evacuated.

375
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,400
The crisis is over.

376
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,160
Can I request to

377
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,559
to stay undercover?

378
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,279
But they still can't relax their vigilance.

379
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,759
How is the secret peace talk going?

380
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,400
The two Japanese delegates

381
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,640
we haven't got any clue at the moment.

382
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,279
But I found something new.

383
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm investigating into it.

384
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,359
According to some information,

385
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,200
It is very likely that Jiang Jieshi

386
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,279
his policy of resisting Japan and allowing communism

387
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
and even recognize the so-called Manchukuo.

388
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,519
That's not peace talks.

389
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,039
It's obviously a betrayal of the country.

390
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,599
But without hard evidence,

391
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,240
chongqing will never admit it.

392
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,799
Your mission is

393
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,640
Is extremely important.

394
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,119
Understood.

395
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,680
Today,

396
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,599
bring anything?

397
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,720
You can take whatever you want.

398
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,559
But not this one.

399
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,839
It is the flower-and-bird pattern pen carved by Ming Wanli.

400
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,599
The treasure of my store.

401
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,039
You

402
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,240
absolutely not.

403
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,440
I need to have a talk with you.

404
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,480
Has been married for only a few days.

405
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
Why is it like this?

406
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,359
I was even cuckolded.

407
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,440
If it were you, would you be able to bear it?

408
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,880
Considering the overall situation.

409
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,599
How could I?

410
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,640
How could I consider the overall situation, Lao Luo?

411
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,920
It was only one day.

412
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,279
It has been spread throughout the business.

413
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,279
When I came in,

414
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,960
everyone looked at me wrong.

415
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,240
It's like my face is...

416
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,880
My face has turned green.

417
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,160
My face is green now?

418
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,839
Alright, alright.

419
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,519
It's not green.

420
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,160
It's empty.

421
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,039
Everyone is.

422
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,279
Men should be broad-minded.

423
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,000
Otherwise, how could you succeed?

424
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
I don't want to achieve great things.

425
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,799
As long as you can achieve great things.

426
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll stay with you

427
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,799
It's enough as long as we have food to eat.

428
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,519
Look at yourself.

429
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,200
Where is Miss Zuo?

430
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,079
She ran away.

431
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,039
Won't you look for her?

432
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,279
How can I?

433
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,519
I'll give her a slap.

434
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,559
I can find her temper back.

435
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,240
It's a waste to my vegetable and oil business.

436
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,279
What do you mean by that?

437
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,160
This is your business.

438
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,720
Your brother's face is not your face?

439
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:34,839
Alright!

440
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,240
You're not reliable at all.

441
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,400
What do you mean by that?

442
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,960
When I'm at my worst and wronged,

443
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,920
you can't comfort me,

444
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,119
are you hitting me when I'm down?

445
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,759
Are you my brother?

446
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,799
I see you as my brother.

447
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,960
Do you treat me as your brother?

448
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,079
Last time, you told me you like this stuff.

449
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,440
So I gave you all the trouble to find it.

450
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
I... What else would I do if I found them?

451
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
I... I'll just pout.

452
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Don't!

453
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,559
She is your treasure?

454
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,559
Back off!

455
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,759
Don't!

456
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,039
♪ My dear... ♪

457
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,039
Let go of me.

458
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,640
I was joking just now.

459
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
I apologize.

460
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,960
Let go of this hand!

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,559
All I said was just angry words.

462
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
You're not reliable,

463
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,160
who can I rely on?

464
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,039
Where did you get that?

465
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,480
Not your business.

466
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,039
You know what?

467
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,680
Zhao An is to blame for this.

468
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,519
He's everywhere.

469
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,359
What's the news about Feng Qi?

470
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,839
This guy comes and goes like a ghost all the time.

471
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,400
He must have a secret mission.

472
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Do you have any news?

473
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,359
When I went to the Military Police Headquarters for a meeting,

474
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,279
I heard what Kimura said to Zhao An.

475
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,279
I only heard one name.

476
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,880
Jiang Zhaoguo.

477
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,839
Jiang Zhaoguo?

478
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,359
Right.

479
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,400
I don't know

480
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,519
If he is related to Feng Qi's recent mission.

481
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,400
No idea.

482
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,559
That sorrow

483
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,400
that sadness can be contagious.

484
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,440
Happiness could be contagious.

485
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,680
So,

486
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,240
to be with you,

487
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,839
that I am sadder

488
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,680
or happy?

489
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,480
High Fang.

490
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,680
I know you have a lot of worries.

491
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,640
But as long as we face the reality together,

492
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,519
It will all pass.

493
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,759
Give me a smile.

494
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,559
It's ugly.

495
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,680
He learned from me.

496
00:23:59,039 --> 00:23:59,599
Got it.

497
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,519
Jia Ping,

498
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,119
this is the person in charge, Xiao Jin.

499
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,119
This newspaper is full of news

500
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,519
you can ask him whatever you want.

501
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,119
Entertainment gossip.

502
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,359
Celebrity gossip.

503
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,440
The news broke.

504
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,759
The sexy photos.

505
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,680
We have everything we want here.

506
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,559
What do you want to know?

507
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,720
You know Cold Dew?

508
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:38,759
Working in our field,

509
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,279
how could I not recognize Cold Dew?

510
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,799
Another name

511
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,920
his name is Jiang Zhaoguo.

512
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:43,839
Do you remember that?

513
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,599
Jiang Zhaoguo.

514
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,960
That's a strange name.

515
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,799
You associate the names Jiang Zhaoguo

516
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,920
and Cold Dew together?

517
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,000
Jiang Zhaoguo.

518
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,559
Cold Dew?

519
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,640
Hold on.

520
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,960
No wonder he's a bit strange.

521
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
It was two years ago.

522
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,000
That mysterious boyfriend of ours,

523
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
his name was Jiang Zhaoguo.

524
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,720
He was an officer in the Foreign Ministry of the Nationalist Government at that time.

525
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:22,759
Thanks.

526
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:23,880
Go on.

527
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,039
Now I know

528
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,559
why they want to look for Cold Dew.

529
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,279
What's wrong with you?

530
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,400
You don't have eyes?

531
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,039
Sorry.

532
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,839
Sorry.

533
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,680
Sugar-coated haws.

534
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,559
Miss.

535
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,319
I'll contact you when I get something about the house.

536
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:14,839
Take care.

537
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,359
Alright.

538
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,319
Take care.

539
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,559
You two, stop right there.

540
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,200
That's right, you two.

541
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,079
I said you two are

542
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,559
couple or couple?

543
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,559
You're pretty with big eyes

544
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,400
this is for breathing.

545
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,039
We're both men.

546
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
We are both men.

547
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,400
They are going to the same place every day,

548
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,160
In the French Concession?

549
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,359
Such a wide road.

550
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,319
Don't be too bossy.

551
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,839
Don't bluff here.

552
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,759
Don't think I don't know

553
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,519
are the two of you

554
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,039
that pretty lady who just came in?

555
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,799
There are so many people on the street.

556
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,119
How did you say we followed her?

557
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,400
Let me tell you this

558
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,400
I'm police from French Concession

559
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,799
don't let me see you sneaking around

560
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,799
you are sneaking around in French Concession.

561
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,279
Mind your own business.

562
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,759
Look at it, please.

563
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,240
No. 22 Beidang Road, French Concession

564
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,279
this area is a high-end residential area

565
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,319
the people living here are high-class.

566
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,960
It's not only a beautiful place,

567
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,559
but also

568
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
there's also a 24-hour patrol

569
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,559
of course, the price will be a little higher.

570
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,839
Price is not a problem.

571
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,400
I hope

572
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,640
I don't want anyone to know about my rent

573
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
I rented a house here.

574
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,359
Don't worry.

575
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,519
We won't reveal

576
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,559
any customer information.

577
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,720
You're here.

578
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,000
Miss Cold Dew.

579
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,440
Jiaping.

580
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,720
Why are you here?

581
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,359
Can I talk to you in the car?

582
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,400
About what?

583
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,440
About a friend of yours.

584
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,319
Miss Han Lu.

585
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,119
You rented the apartment for your friend, right?

586
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,559
What?

587
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,799
You follow me?

588
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,359
Don't.

589
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,039
Please don't misunderstand.

590
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,720
We didn't follow you

591
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,720
we followed the person who was following you.

592
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,240
I didn't see anyone following me.

593
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,440
If Ms. Han Lu finds out,

594
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,759
those colleagues of mine

595
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,519
would have been shot long ago.

596
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,720
So you are

597
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,119
can you tell me

598
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,480
the story of your friend.

599
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,640
If Ms. Han Lu still doesn't want to

600
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,119
don't want to tell me,

601
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
I can reveal some information to you first.

602
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,319
The Chongqing government is planning secret peace talks

603
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,839
with the Japanese Prime Minister.

604
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,920
But the Japanese military tried to stop them

605
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,960
and also listed all the negotiators

606
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,519
are targeted for assassination.

607
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,960
The Chongqing government

608
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,559
jiang Zhaoguo, Deputy Director of the Asia Department

609
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
jiang Zhaoguo

610
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,000
the Chinese side this time.

611
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,799
I'm just an actor.

612
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,279
And I'm not interested in politics.

613
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,119
I don't know this person

614
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,279
this person.

615
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,359
Alright.

616
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,599
However,

617
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,440
I need to remind Ms. Han Lu that

618
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
the person following you is Zhao An's men.

619
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,920
So the apartment you rent is no longer safe.

620
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,559
Can I get out of the car?

621
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,599
Certainly.

622
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:29,799
Hey.

623
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,960
It's me.

624
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,200
Have you rented the apartment?

625
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm being followed.

626
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Two people

627
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,279
followed me to the leasing company.

628
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,039
What?

629
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,799
What...

630
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,079
Did you see what kind of people they are?

631
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
I met a friend of mine.

632
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,799
I knew those two guys.

633
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,440
They are from a secret intelligence station

634
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,400
of Military Police Headquarters.

635
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,880
Are you in danger?

636
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,079
No, I'm not.

637
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,160
But about the house...

638
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,000
You don't have to mind the house.

639
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,799
I'll figure it out myself.

640
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,920
Sorry.

641
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
That I wasn't able to help you.

642
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,000
It wasn't.

643
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,279
It's my fault.

644
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,000
I shouldn't

645
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,759
Involve you in my work.

646
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,039
I'm worried about you.

647
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,519
If those people

648
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,799
find you too?

649
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,720
Don't worry.

650
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,240
They won't find me.

651
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,519
The place I live is very secluded.

652
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,359
What's your job

653
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,599
you're here in Shanghai?

654
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
This...

655
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,599
I can't tell you.

656
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
Is it dangerous?

657
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,599
My job is

658
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,680
It's dangerous.

659
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,079
Will you stay in Shanghai

660
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,559
after you finish this job?

661
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,680
Will you go back to Chongqing?

662
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,359
It's still doubtful.

663
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,799
It'll depend on the results of my work this time.

664
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,400
So I have to leave

665
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,160
we don't see each other anymore.

666
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Two days later,

667
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,440
at this time,

668
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,200
I will get in touch.

669
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,839
I'll contact you later.

670
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,599
Is there anything else?

671
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll give you an address then.

672
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,519
Did you come to see me?

673
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,480
I wanted to see you.

674
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,559
What for?

675
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:11,960
I want to...

676
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,000
I want to take you with me.

677
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,920
Two years ago

678
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,440
two years ago,

679
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,559
I will go with you without hesitation.

680
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,279
I won't hesitate to do so.

681
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,359
But now,

682
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,160
I know that...

683
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,640
I meant that

684
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
If you're willing to.

685
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,240
What?

686
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,160
Why are you showing up now?

687
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,400
I...

688
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,519
It took me two years

689
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,119
to gradually forget the pain,

690
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,240
I started my career again

691
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,839
and my life will be

692
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,000
but now you're here again

693
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,279
and make these past memories vivid.

694
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,679
Why aren't we starting?

695
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,599
The river is blocked.

696
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,559
After that,

697
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,239
we'll leave then.

698
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,679
Go back to sleep.

699
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,639
Stop.

700
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:48,840
I knew it.

701
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,440
At that moment,

702
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,239
you read the contents of the note.

703
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,039
Who is Wild Horse?

704
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,000
My superior.

705
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,039
The telegram said

706
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,480
the secret peace talk has been leaked.

707
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,880
Military Police Command has taken action.

708
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,679
What's going on?

709
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,480
Recently, Chongqing and the Japanese government

710
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,679
with the Japanese government in Shanghai recently.

711
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,440
This isn't the first time.

712
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,880
What's the outcome?

713
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,840
Wild Horse wants us to protect the delegates.

714
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Why should we leave Shanghai?

715
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,199
The peace talk is not as simple as you think.

716
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,760
Will bring serious consequences

717
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,400
the consequences will be enormous.

718
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
If the peace talks can end the war earlier,

719
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,639
If the peace talks can end the war?

720
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,599
You are too childish!

721
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,400
If I continue to lurk,

722
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,039
I'll complete the mission.

723
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,519
Your mission has been completed.

724
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,880
You're disobeying my order.

725
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,760
An order.

726
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,880
Orders are business.

727
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,480
You can do business with some people,

728
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,519
there are some businesses you can't do.

729
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,599
You didn't say that to me.

730
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,719
You said obeying orders is our vocation.

731
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,679
I am telling you this

732
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,840
because I thought you were one of us.

733
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
And refuse to carry out the task.

734
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,519
How will you explain it to your superiors?

735
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,760
I'll tell them that

736
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,599
there's a car crash

737
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
around the river

738
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,559
we didn't use the radio station.

739
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,760
So we didn't receive any orders.

740
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,360
Also,

741
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,239
we received a message

742
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,559
jiangmian will unblock it tomorrow night.

743
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,840
Before that,

744
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,639
until now.

745
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,280
You should think carefully

746
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,280
how to perform well

747
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,960
how can you show yourself

748
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,039
you've made for yourself.

749
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,559
That's it.

750
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,800
Has anyone been there?

751
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,760
Only Cold Dew came and went.

752
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,039
What is she busy with?

753
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,880
She's bought a lot of things.

754
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:56,920
What's that

755
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,159
tea, red wine,

756
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,480
and some food.

757
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,000
And wine.

758
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,840
It's quite romantic.

759
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:04,920
What food?

760
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,880
Chen Gangmu who was following her said that

761
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,840
she also bought some Chinese and Western food ingredients.

762
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,960
And went to a Japanese food store.

763
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,559
We followed the right place.

764
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,199
This negotiation seems to take a long time.

765
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,000
Jiang Zhaoguo told her to come here to make preparations.

766
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,159
That person

767
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,840
should be Jiang Zhaoguo.

768
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,440
Then we should

769
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,840
and don't alert them.

770
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,599
When the Japanese representative comes,

771
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,119
are here.

772
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,199
What is Han Lu up to?

773
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,559
Xiaowu, eat.

774
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,119
When the boat leaves,

775
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,280
to take off her chain.

776
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,119
Great.

777
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,079
We received another telegram from the Mustang.

778
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,760
Still asking?

779
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,039
Leave them alone.

780
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,199
What's up

781
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,440
miss Cold Dew?

782
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,400
You know what

783
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,239
what a stupid thing you've done?

784
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,280
What did I do?

785
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,480
The man who went with you to No. 22 Beidang Road

786
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,920
Isn't Jiang Zhaoguo, right?

787
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,159
He's the actor you found in the crew.

788
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,000
In your last movie, Spring,

789
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,280
he plays a bank manager

790
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,199
you can't cover for Jiang Zhaoguo.

791
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,360
Don't mind my business.

792
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,679
It's not about whether you can do it or not.

793
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,000
If you do that,

794
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,119
will only put you in more danger.

795
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,079
If Zhao An finds out

796
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,400
you set the trap

797
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,880
that's distracting them.

798
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,199
Then they'll consider it a fact.

799
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,840
You had connections with Jiang Zhaoguo.

800
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,960
Not only is he connected,

801
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,079
you're still trying to cover up Jiang Zhaoguo.

802
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,000
I told you before that

803
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,440
jiang Zhaoguo was the target of Zhao An's assassination.

804
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
And now you

805
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,920
are the only clue to find

806
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,239
to find Jiang Zhao Guo.

807
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,440
What will Zhao An do?

808
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,079
Then what should I do now?

809
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,440
Leave here with me right away.

810
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,920
I haven't finished shooting my new movie yet.

811
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,679
Filming a movie can be unexpected.

812
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,920
Everything that's finished and not released is still there.

813
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,119
Say goodbye to your new movie.

814
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,239
Miss Cold Dew.

815
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,880
The hotel is owned by French.

816
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:43,119
One can enter only with an invitation.

817
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,639
You're safe here.

818
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,559
Thank you.

819
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,079
Don't thank me.

820
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,880
You should thank my friends

821
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,599
knowledge in the French Concession.

822
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,000
Chengzi,

823
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,119
It's my pleasure to serve you.

824
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,800
Thank you.

825
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,079
Miss Han Lu.

826
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,079
Now, you can tell me

827
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,639
jiang Zhaoguo's situation?

828
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,719
He was

829
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,000
In the Foreign Ministry of the Nationalist Government.

830
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,079
She used to be in charge of the concession affairs.

831
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,280
So he often came to Shanghai for business.

832
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,719
I knew him two years ago.

833
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,559
But this time, he suddenly appeared,

834
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,519
I don't know what happened.

835
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,760
He just wanted me to help him rent a house.

836
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,000
Do you have his contact?

837
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,519
No, I haven't.

838
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,880
He came to see me.

839
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,000
Have you set a time

840
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
to meet again?

841
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,679
It's not.

842
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:34,559
Alright.

843
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,000
Miss Han Lu...

844
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,920
Have a good rest in the hotel.

845
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,920
He will bring you food every day.

846
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,400
Don't open the curtains.

847
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,440
Don't leave the hotel even half a step.

848
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,480
Got it?

849
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,800
Alright.

850
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,440
See you

851
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,800
Is he in danger?

852
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,039
Very dangerous.

853
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,760
Can you protect him?

854
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:58,800
I'll try my best.

855
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,400
See you

856
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,239
where are you going?

857
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:33,199
Jiaxing.

858
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:34,159
How many people are there?

859
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:35,440
Three.

860
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,159
Cargo Pass, please.

861
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,400
They are all here.

862
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,119
Pass?

863
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,800
And apply for the vaccination certificate.

864
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,199
We didn't prepare this before the vaccination certificate.

865
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,519
Recently there is dysentery in Shanghai.

866
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
You must have an epidemic prevention certificate when you enter and leave the pier.

867
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,880
For those who don't, please go to the infirmary at 16th Shop

868
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,679
to be examined.

869
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,360
And make up for it.

870
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,360
Okay, I'll go now.

871
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
The three of you must go.

872
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,239
Sir, I...

873
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,519
Someone inside has a fever.

874
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,519
The other person takes care of her.

875
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,360
How about I go there

876
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,199
I can go by myself.

877
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,280
That's not okay.

878
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,000
Look at that.

879
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,159
Sorry for the trouble.

880
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,880
Alright. Hurry up.

881
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,280
We'll send the boat when we finish the card.

882
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,920
Alright.

883
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,440
After two days,

884
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
at this time,

885
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,400
when it's time.
