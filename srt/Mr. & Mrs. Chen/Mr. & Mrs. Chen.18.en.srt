1
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,200
Captain Zhao and his fellows have caught a CCP member.

2
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,120
He's dead.

3
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,640
And asked me to throw it away.

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,239
My goodness.

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,200
Second best.

6
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,239
What now?

7
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,920
Hold on.

8
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,599
Don't you know

9
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,480
the burning sun

10
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,319
the yang is vigorous.

11
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,879
Ghosts won't be able to find the way to Sheol.

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,280
What does it have to do with me?

13
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,719
Of course it's your business!

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,520
He can't find the way,

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
once he sees the corpse moving,

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,639
especially such a tragic death.

17
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,479
There's no way to get rid of them.

18
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,599
Really?

19
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,719
Then what should I do?

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
Put a coin in his mouth.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,439
Then you can ask for directions.

22
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,199
That makes sense.

23
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,240
Thanks.

24
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,039
These

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,960
was given to me by the comrades from Yan'an today.

26
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,120
Old fellow.

27
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,759
Tomorrow morning,

28
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,319
I'll have a meeting with the officers of the intelligence station

29
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,639
with the officers of the intelligence station.

30
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,560
You must keep a close eye on

31
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,959
the business and the Military Police Headquarters.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,959
Take care of the external security.

33
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,000
Get in the car.

34
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,759
Come on.

35
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,399
Boss, please.

36
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,399
I have an appointment with my friend in the private room upstairs.

37
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,800
Okay, please come in.

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,319
Mr. Lu,

39
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
I've finally found you.

40
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,839
Captain Zhao.

41
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,079
Why are you here?

42
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Come here

43
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,360
we ran into Chen Jiaping in the calligraphy shop

44
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,160
and then I followed him here.

45
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,319
Chief.

46
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,240
Should we rush in now

47
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,879
and arrest him?

48
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,360
Old Lu is a Communist.

49
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,360
But the one

50
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,800
be not necessarily Communists.

51
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,439
To act rashly,

52
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,279
It won't be a wasted effort.

53
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
It's the end.

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,319
But my inkstone is a fake.

55
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,839
You even closed down the shop.

56
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,480
What's wrong?

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,079
Are you afraid that I would call?

58
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,079
Mr. Chen?

59
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,120
Is it necessary for a inkstone?

60
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,639
I have something to do today.

61
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,759
I met some friends there.

62
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,279
Alright.

63
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll go up first.

64
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,680
It's OK to talk business.

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,319
What are you doing?

66
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,319
It seems we have a situation at the old road.

67
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,480
Should we evacuate?

68
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,439
There are spies at the door.

69
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,439
Destroy the documents immediately.

70
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,800
Chuan, Leizi.

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
You may enter the tea house first,

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,519
keep an eye on the old path.

73
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,879
I will see

74
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,959
and how many people the meeting was with.

75
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,639
Captain.

76
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,040
There she is.

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,399
Give me the money for your inkstone.

78
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,959
Then we can talk it over.

79
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,920
No, Mr. Chen.

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't have so much money with me.

81
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,000
No problem.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Take my car.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,199
Go to your store and get some money.

84
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,319
This is your car.

85
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,959
That's right.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,480
Mr. Chen.

87
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,600
You are my regular customer, too.

88
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,560
We don't even have a basic level of trust

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,879
trust each other.

90
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,639
They seem to be having a fight.

91
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,079
Chen Jiaping knows that his old path was exposed,

92
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,839
he's here to save him.

93
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,639
Now you are just an old crafty man.

94
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,879
Quickly, say nothing.

95
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,360
Get in the car.

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,879
Take the money.

97
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,079
How could you do that?

98
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,519
Captain!

99
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,199
It'll be too late if we don't act now.

100
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
It might be a trick

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,639
to distract us.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Don't forget that

103
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,439
there are Communists in the tea house?

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,600
They want the communists

105
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,079
have a chance to get away.

106
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,079
The tree trunk.

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Take a few people with Chen Family Ping and their old paths.

108
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,839
Yes

109
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,920
chuan and Laizi

110
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,519
follow me.

111
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,040
Are you sure the sacrificed comrade

112
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,560
smoked Leaf Tobacco?

113
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,560
That's right.

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,959
Your contact.

115
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,839
Under Zhao An's watch.

116
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,279
Your identity has been revealed.

117
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,800
The reason I didn't arrest you right away

118
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,959
so that I can rely on you to attract more comrades.

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,879
Are they with Zhao An?

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,560
Right.

121
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,000
Distract them first.

122
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
We'll hurry up.

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,959
Stay with him!

124
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,040
Stay with him.

125
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,360
Usual.

126
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,560
You must leave Shanghai.

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,759
If I leave,

128
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,240
your identity will be revealed.

129
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,559
My...

130
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,960
I was only a frequent visitor

131
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,360
a frequent visitor to the bookstore.

132
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,919
That you got the fake inkstone.

133
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,000
And ran into you.

134
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,720
To reason with you.

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,000
Give me my money back.

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,360
If I can continue

137
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,279
I can continue this play.

138
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
But you didn't follow me to the store.

139
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,279
I suddenly disappeared.

140
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,600
How will you explain that?

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,000
When you arrived at the tea house,

142
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
you found yourself being followed.

143
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,960
I was at a loss when I appeared

144
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,159
you used the opportunity to leave with me

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,320
at most, I was just used by you.

146
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,600
It's far-fetched.

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,480
Too far-fetched.

148
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
That Luo Guanqun

149
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,679
I'm afraid that

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,399
won't trust you anymore.

151
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,480
We'll talk about it later.

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Alright?

153
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,320
There is a steamed stuffed bun shop after the junction.

154
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,519
I know the owner.

155
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,639
He can testify for me.

156
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
I'll put you down there.

157
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,600
Which room is the woman we quarreled in?

158
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,840
I don't know either

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
as soon as he got up the stairs,

160
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,799
he was stopped by another customer.

161
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,279
They talked for a while

162
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
then they quarreled.

163
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,639
Are all your private rooms upstairs?

164
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,120
Yes

165
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,200
hey, Mr. Lu.

166
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,559
Why did you ask me to park here?

167
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,960
Why don't you go to your shop?

168
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,799
Well, Mr. Chen,

169
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,840
that you have lost your temper.

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,799
And you wouldn't have to

171
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,440
how am I supposed to run my business?

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,279
Are you thinking about your business now?

173
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,679
When you sold my fake inkstone,

174
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,840
why didn't you?

175
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,679
Boss Cao, let me ask you something.

176
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,600
If someone gets sick here,

177
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,559
will you pay for it?

178
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
I will pay for sure.

179
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,200
Did you see her?

180
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,919
Give me the money!

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,360
Come on.

182
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,279
Mr. Chen!

183
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Please.

184
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
Don't go to my store.

185
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:15,840
I promise.

186
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,600
I will get the money from the store right away

187
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,399
and bring it to you.

188
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,840
Where are you going to find me?

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The place you work.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
I... I know.

191
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,440
I've been there.

192
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,080
Hey, Mr. Lu.

193
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,480
Don't play tricks on me.

194
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,159
I promise you.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,679
Don't worry.

196
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,159
Mr. Chen,

197
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,840
what's the matter?

198
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,720
Nothing.

199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
For selling my fake inkstone.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,720
Is business good?

201
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,039
Careless

202
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,200
how many private rooms are there?

203
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,679
There are 12 rooms in total.

204
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
Are they all filled?

205
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,879
All eight rooms are occupied.

206
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,840
There are private rooms on both sides.

207
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,679
It smells of smoke.

208
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,240
There's a customer smoking.

209
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,240
Smoking.

210
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,039
Not from smoking.

211
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,279
Really?

212
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Have you received

213
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,720
do you like it

214
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,480
It's for Su Jin.

215
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,840
Miss.

216
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,440
Could you please speed up?

217
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,159
It's something urgent.

218
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:45,639
What's your emergency?

219
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,000
I have an emergency.

220
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,279
Alright.

221
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,000
Alright.

222
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
I'll hang up then.

223
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,679
I have something to do today.

224
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,159
Thank you.

225
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,320
Please take care of the family.

226
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,879
Please contact Yinzhen.

227
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Alright.

228
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,480
Goodbye.

229
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:24,799
Stop!

230
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,559
Stop!

231
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,840
I want them alive!

232
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,279
Catch him alive!

233
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,200
Chase them!

234
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,559
Chase!

235
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,240
Slow down!

236
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,320
You go that way.

237
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,159
I'll go this way.

238
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,679
Yes

239
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,639
old Road.

240
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
Let's go now!

241
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,840
You can't get away from me.

242
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,679
Take her away.

243
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,159
Stand in the same compartment.

244
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,600
Stand properly.

245
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Stand properly.

246
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,879
Captain.

247
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,679
Where is Old Lu?

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,919
Caught him.

249
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,279
Not really.

250
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,039
What do you mean?

251
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,039
Caught her.

252
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,600
But no one on our side did.

253
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,639
By who?

254
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,600
The big scoop.

255
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,320
The big scoop.

256
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,240
He was about to be captured.

257
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,159
But Tom suddenly appeared

258
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,480
and took him away.

259
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,720
Why did he take him?

260
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,320
He said he found out that he belongs to the Communist Party.

261
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
How could he know about him?

262
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,000
This...

263
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,320
I don't know either

264
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,600
where is Chen Jiaping?

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We lost part of the track

266
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,759
when we ran into him again,

267
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,399
chen Jiaping was gone

268
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,120
I can't believe

269
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
these things

270
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,360
were provided by a Communist.

271
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,639
There are some good things.

272
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,240
But what you can achieve

273
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,039
but what I draw would be pretentious

274
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,159
and flattering trash.

275
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,879
The portrait fits him.

276
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,679
What a pity!

277
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,159
Don't waste any more time.

278
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,000
Wear your tricks

279
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,320
torture?

280
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,360
Torture?

281
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,440
Torture them?

282
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,799
Let's do this.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,519
Mr. Lu is a man of culture.

284
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,440
I wouldn't do that to you.

285
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,639
The meat that has been cooked for so many days

286
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,319
It's rotten.

287
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,200
I can smell the meat.

288
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,799
No meat

289
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,039
captain!

290
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,319
What to do now?

291
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,759
Luo Guanqun has my way.

292
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,279
Once he comes clean,

293
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,759
they'll take away all the Communists

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,759
will be destroyed.

295
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,559
We need to find out these communists

296
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,720
find out these Communists

297
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,599
she is our last hope.

298
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,240
Yes

299
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,319
have you found anything?

300
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,920
Alright.

301
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,000
Got it.

302
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,759
We went to Yumo Calligraphy and Painting.

303
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,440
If we look through anything,

304
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,799
there's someone you like.

305
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,799
I'll send you back.

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,559
I do have someone I like.

307
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,400
That's my toilet paper!

308
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
Or the Loong Xiang Ink Paper?

309
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:16,799
Not really.

310
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,640
None of those are my favorite.

311
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,079
We are all here for tea.

312
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,440
We are drinking tea...

313
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,559
It's against the law to drink.

314
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,400
Right.

315
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,640
Shut your mouth before you tell me!

316
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
If you don't,

317
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,759
you will be doubly guilty

318
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,799
captain Zhao,

319
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,279
the tea drinkers in the eight private rooms on the second floor

320
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,039
are all here.

321
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,839
Have you checked them out?

322
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes, I have.

323
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,359
Have also searched him one by one.

324
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,160
Didn't find any clue.

325
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,559
The Communists are among you guys.

326
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,759
Let me tell you the truth.

327
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,119
We have arrested Old Lu

328
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,079
who is his fellow?

329
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,359
To come forward

330
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm giving you a chance to plead guilty.

331
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,319
To plead guilty.

332
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,279
And we'll let it go.

333
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,960
Think it over.

334
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,240
Even if you don't admit it now,

335
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,480
old friend

336
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,119
will confess soon

337
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,200
and come to identify you.

338
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,400
Show yourself!

339
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,680
You have checked it.

340
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,359
Who do you think is the biggest suspect?

341
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,720
These two

342
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,960
tried to escape through the window.

343
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Why would I escape?

344
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,160
We...

345
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,799
You're waiting for your old path.

346
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,240
You're from the Communist Party?

347
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,960
Sorry.

348
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,759
He does not know

349
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
we don't even know this man.

350
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,039
Why did he run away?

351
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,519
Little Lan.

352
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,480
Xiaolan.

353
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,359
Officer.

354
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,359
I'll tell you the truth.

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,480
I...

356
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I am a married man.

357
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,599
She is a married woman.

358
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,519
We came out secretly to meet her.

359
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,880
As for your investigation,

360
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
we don't know.

361
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,720
We were afraid of being discovered.

362
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,039
That's why we jumped out the window to escape.

363
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,079
You're lying!

364
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,240
Then you belong to the Communist Party.

365
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,279
I swear

366
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,599
I'm really not...

367
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,640
Sir,

368
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,359
you can't wrong me.

369
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,519
Captain Zhao.

370
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,279
You have a clue?

371
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:55,920
Go on.

372
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,319
I found there were three tea drinkers in Hai Yue Hall.

373
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,079
But they ordered four tea sets.

374
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,240
Haoyue Hall?

375
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,119
That's right.

376
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,200
She's from Haiyue Hall?

377
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,039
Who's the private bathroom?

378
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,359
Who are you from Haiyue Hall?

379
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,960
I have one last question for you.

380
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,680
Who is our guest?

381
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,519
Step forward!

382
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,160
We are

383
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,240
you're a Communist.

384
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,920
You're waiting for your old path.

385
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,200
We're waiting for a friend.

386
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,079
His name is Guan Dajiang.

387
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,279
He was a leather merchant.

388
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,440
You're waiting for his old path.

389
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,640
You are from the Communist Party.

390
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,079
We are really not.

391
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,720
Officer.

392
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,400
You need proof.

393
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,400
That's him.

394
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,799
This is Guan Dajiang.

395
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,720
Who are you?

396
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,880
I run leather goods business.

397
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,279
I met with several colleagues today

398
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,240
to have some tea and chat

399
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
he was delayed by something.

400
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,839
You're a bit late.

401
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,640
I saw a "Closed" sign outside.

402
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,599
So I came in to see what the problem was.

403
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,759
You lied.

404
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,079
You're a Communist.

405
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm in leather goods business.

406
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,759
You all are lying.

407
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,359
You all belong to the Communist Party.

408
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,000
Sir,

409
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,880
the shop is at 355 Da Xi Road.

410
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
You can check it out if you don't believe me.

411
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
That's nothing.

412
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,720
You all belong to the Communist Party.

413
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Brother, calm down.

414
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,759
What are you doing?

415
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,680
Luo Guanqun is racing with me.

416
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,920
I can't lose.

417
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,680
Check it out.

418
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,279
Brother.

419
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,000
I have an idea.

420
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,519
I have an idea.

421
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,240
Mr. Lu is really meticulous.

422
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,599
And he didn't give us any clue.

423
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,079
But because of that,

424
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,279
these documents revealed your secret.

425
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,880
We have investigated them.

426
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,119
You live alone.

427
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,039
You can spend all your food and shelter there.

428
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,519
However,

429
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,759
send some daily necessities

430
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,079
to this address.

431
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,599
What are you trying to say?

432
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,680
You have family.

433
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,000
Because of your work and missions,

434
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
you're afraid of hurting your family,

435
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,680
and you care about them silently.

436
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,319
That's why you send all these things to them.

437
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,440
I don't have any family.

438
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,279
No. 78 Luban Road.

439
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,799
It's easy to find.

440
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,279
What do you want to do

441
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,079
this.

442
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
A pair of tiger padded shoes.

443
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,880
500g of osmanthus candy cake.

444
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,160
And a toy car.

445
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,559
Are these for children?

446
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
How old is that?

447
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,839
Is he cute?

448
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,799
Don't touch them!

449
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,759
They are innocent.

450
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,039
Alright.

451
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Let's get back to the topic.

452
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,759
You still won't say anything?

453
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,880
Have you thought it over?

454
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
Show me your hands.

455
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,559
Why are you shaking?

456
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Why are your fingers burnt?

457
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,519
I have been smoking for 20 years.

458
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,079
But my fingers are yellow.

459
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,079
Is very normal, right?

460
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,960
No, that's not right.

461
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Not smoking.

462
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,920
Did you burn the documents?

463
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,480
Nothing.

464
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,079
I have been drinking tea.

465
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,039
This is the last time.

466
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Are you a Communist?

467
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,519
Officer.

468
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,160
Everyone says you're a Communist without evidence.

469
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,720
Which company are you from?

470
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,160
This is your idea?

471
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
Great.

472
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,599
Which company are you from?

473
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,960
We're from Military Police Headquarters.

474
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,680
Catch communists like you.

475
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,359
Alright.

476
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,519
Take me to the Military Police Headquarters.

477
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,079
Do you think I dare not?

478
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,480
Take him back.

479
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,200
I want to know

480
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,759
yes

481
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,079
captain Zhao.

482
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,279
I'm busy.

483
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,480
Mr. Luo, why are you here?

484
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
I heard you caught Gong Dang.

485
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,680
Let me take a look.

486
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,039
Right.

487
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,720
We're working on it.

488
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,240
He'll find out soon.

489
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,640
We have some clues.

490
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,480
He...

491
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,279
Are suspicious.

492
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,880
You suspect this gentleman?

493
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,599
I have the evidence.

494
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,319
Do you know who he is?

495
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,119
Boss Cheng.

496
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
And good friend of Boss Yu.

497
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,359
Controls half of the cotton yarn business in Shanghai

498
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,240
the Military Police Command

499
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,759
as our honored guests.

500
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,440
He always keeps a low profile.

501
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,640
You said he's the Communist Party's

502
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,839
this officer is being unreasonable.

503
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,880
He beat Boss Cheng up.

504
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,880
Sorry

505
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,839
my eyes don't recognize you.

506
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,119
I was investigating the Communists.

507
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,319
How about this?

508
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,519
You'll slap yourself ten times

509
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,240
In front of Boss Cheng!

510
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,839
Forget about it.

511
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,200
What?

512
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,319
If you don't want to hit me,

513
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
then I'll call Kimura to come.

514
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
To judge for Master Cheng.

515
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,680
Are you satisfied?

516
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,000
Boss Cheng,

517
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,200
are you satisfied?

518
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,079
I'm talking with my friend about private matters.

519
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
And it's not convenient to reveal my identity.

520
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,319
No wonder this man

521
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,039
mr. Cheng,

522
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,759
(Please be magnanimous.)

523
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,960
Shall we leave now?

524
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,519
Certainly.

525
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:11,960
Come on.

526
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
Mr. Cheng is wronged.

527
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,079
Come on.

528
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,160
Open the door.

529
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Release all these people.

530
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,799
I can't release them.

531
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Continue the investigation.

532
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,160
No need for you to do that.

533
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,799
Which two?

534
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,640
They are from Dongli Hall.

535
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,880
Boss.

536
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,119
These two.

537
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,519
The big spoon!

538
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,680
Take these two away.

539
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,640
They're the CCP.

540
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,279
That's not it.

541
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,119
We are not CCP members.

542
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,720
Not us.

543
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,000
Right.

544
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,440
You got it wrong.

545
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,319
We are not

546
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,319
we are not Communists.

547
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,079
Arrest them!

548
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,440
Yes

549
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,079
take her away.

550
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,759
You're wrong!

551
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,400
We got the wrong person.

552
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
We didn't do it.

553
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,240
It's a misunderstanding.

554
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,480
You got it wrong.

555
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,839
It's really not us.

556
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,759
Sir,

557
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,799
how do you know they're from the CCP?

558
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,400
How would I know?

559
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,279
Do I need to tell you?

560
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,480
I've been following Lao Lu for a long time.

561
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,279
Even if he is arrested,

562
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,240
the case

563
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,720
we're considered collaboration, right?

564
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,960
You work in a stable.

565
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,279
Why would I collaborate with you?

566
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,000
Captain Zhao,

567
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,160
you always have this problem.

568
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,799
If you touch things you shouldn't?

569
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,160
What bad habit?

570
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,279
Captain.

571
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,119
The rest of the team...

572
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,680
The...

573
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,480
Everything?

574
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,319
Everything?

575
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,680
One is Chen Shaoxiong,

576
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,559
the other one is Bai Yao.

577
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,200
At first he insisted that

578
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,319
he was selling dirt and tobacco.

579
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,160
So he tortured them

580
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,559
by the Communist Party?

581
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,680
I thought the Communist Party is powerful.

582
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,359
They're

583
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,359
Is also made of flesh.

584
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,319
And you know pain.

585
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:26,599
Are you breathing?

586
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,079
He's not dead.

587
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
He should have passed out.

588
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,359
This is not bad.

589
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,640
You can ask him.

590
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,200
If Chen Shaoxiong

591
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,920
are you all Communists?

592
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,079
Don't hit me.

593
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,359
I said that

594
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,240
I'm a Communist Party member.

595
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,039
I'm a Communist.

596
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,599
Do you know his old tricks?

597
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,640
Know him.

598
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,079
That's right.

599
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,559
What are you doing in Hai Ban Xian Teahouse?

600
00:29:59,079 --> 00:29:59,960
Let's go for a meeting.

601
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,279
Meeting?

602
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
What meeting?

603
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,920
What is it?

604
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:04,759
I'll unlock it.

605
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,519
I'll open the door.

606
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,359
Speak louder.

607
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,880
He's a bit harsh.

608
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,359
Give him some time.

609
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,599
He is in our hands.

610
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,079
Everything.

611
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,160
Take your time.

612
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,599
I always think there's something wrong with those two.

613
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,079
They won't.

614
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,480
Lu told us personally.

615
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,359
That they met in Dongli Hall.

616
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,839
And he knows that

617
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,640
lie to me,

618
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
he'll kill his family.

619
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,720
Manager Luo,

620
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
I'll go down and take a look.

621
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,640
Get out of my way.

622
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,039
Get out of the way.

623
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,519
Uncle.

624
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,680
Please.

625
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,680
Give me some money.

626
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,720
Let me smoke.

627
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,920
Let me smoke.

628
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,200
Give me some money.

629
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,440
Let me smoke some grandpa.

630
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,839
Please, sir.

631
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,519
Give me some money to smoke.

632
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,680
Just one sip.

633
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,880
Get in the car.

634
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,440
Please give me some money.

635
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Just one bite.

636
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,960
Uncle.

637
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,440
Where to?

638
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,160
Back to the interrogation room.

639
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,640
Alright

640
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,240
just one bite.

641
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,200
After this junction,

642
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
there is a steamed bun shop ahead.

643
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,599
I know the owner.

644
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,640
He can testify for me.

645
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,319
I'll put you down there.

646
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,279
What are you thinking about?

647
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,279
Have you ever thought about it?

648
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,920
Zhao An has already known my identity.

649
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,880
He will never let go

650
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,720
those who wanted to meet me.

651
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,799
When I stopped you at the tea house,

652
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,359
you hadn't met them yet.

653
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,720
So Zhao An can't find

654
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,279
which room it was in,

655
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,519
what will Zhao An do if you know him?

656
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,720
Search all the boxes on the second floor.

657
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
But just now,

658
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,559
we made a lot of noise at the stairs just now.

659
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,839
This is a warning to the comrades.

660
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,240
I believe they will take action

661
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,119
and destroy the important documents as well.

662
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,519
Zhao An won't let it go like this.

663
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,799
He won't let them go.

664
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
And even hurt the innocent.

665
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
In that case,

666
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,160
I can only save you.

667
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,759
What's more important,

668
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,319
even if you use the reason you mentioned,

669
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,440
luo Guanqun wouldn't believe it.

670
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,920
Because agents are worthless

671
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,119
they'll be worthless.

672
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,640
What do you want me to do?

673
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,200
You're going to leave me in the lurch?

674
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,640
I'm not blaming you.

675
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
I just want to say that

676
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,160
I can't just walk away.

677
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,599
Do you have any idea?

678
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,599
I remember the first time we met

679
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,279
you can tell which few spies

680
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,880
you can tell what model of gun

681
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,000
was in his hand.

682
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,559
How many rounds are left?

683
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,240
And kill them one by one.

684
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,759
I thought he was really something.

685
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,240
He was so much better than me.

686
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
If we can save them,

687
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,079
If you can successfully lurk

688
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,000
and complete the mission,

689
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,799
I'm willing to sacrifice everything

690
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,960
Including my life,

691
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,039
you must cooperate with me.

692
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,920
This is an order

693
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,519
I must be captured by Zhao An's men.

694
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,799
Wake up.

695
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,599
Who are you?

696
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,200
It's the Communist Party.

697
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,319
Communist Party?

698
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,880
What on earth do they do?

699
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,960
Communist Party.

700
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,039
Communist Party!

701
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,119
Communist Party!

702
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
As expected.

703
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,880
It's dust.

704
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,039
Smoke?

705
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,320
You really sell smoke and dirt.

706
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,920
Go to Lu's house

707
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,880
and bring the family here.

708
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,880
Yes

709
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,480
It's not Zhao An.

710
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,320
It's Luo Guanqun.

711
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:23,920
That's Luo Guanqun.

712
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,239
The story goes like this...

713
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,840
I went to the tea house...

714
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,760
On the way there,

715
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,840
zhao An was following you.

716
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,239
Zhao An had caught Lao Tian earlier,

717
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,599
that CCP member.

718
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,239
So he's following you again.

719
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,039
I suspect that both Tian and you are CCP members.

720
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
But I didn't want Zhao An to get you killed.

721
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,000
So you took me out of the tea house

722
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,239
to get rid of Zhao An

723
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,760
for Luo Guanqun to catch me.

724
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,199
That's right.

725
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,079
This is why

726
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,800
I tried so hard to get rid of her.

727
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,360
Why didn't you arrest me and hand me over

728
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,320
and hand me over to Luo Guanqun?

729
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,679
I'm afraid you have a gun.

730
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,440
I dare not do anything.

731
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,840
After I released you, I contacted Luo Guanqun

732
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,639
he can come and support me.

733
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,039
When the horse spoon shows up,

734
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,679
and capture you as well.

735
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,000
Then I...

736
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,400
Find my

737
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,920
where I was.

738
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,159
The Guangming Cinema?

739
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I will make Dazhao appear near there.

740
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,360
And you happen to appear at the gate of the cinema.

741
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,519
Easily caught by the big spoon

742
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,400
but you must remember that

743
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,679
you can't be found by Chen Qianmu.

744
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,000
I know.

745
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,199
I'm like a chicken

746
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,440
being watched by two eagles.

747
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,199
Can only get into your mouth.

748
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,199
That's right.

749
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,800
However, Lao Lu...

750
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,280
Being caught is only the first step.

751
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,280
Next, you'll betray.

752
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,840
Betrayed?

753
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,159
Only by betraying

754
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,360
can you save those comrades.

755
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,719
How could Luo Guanqun believe that I betrayed them?

756
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,480
He won't easily believe you.

757
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,960
So, make him think

758
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,599
he has found your fatal weakness.

759
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,880
What weakness?

760
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,599
My family.

761
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,719
Do you know my family

762
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,360
I know that

763
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,320
I would forge some letters and receipts

764
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,480
I will forge some letters and receipts

765
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,679
don't worry.

766
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,360
Did you catch him?

767
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,239
No one's at home?

768
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,480
His wife and kid are supposed to be dead.

769
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,239
What?

770
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,679
He is dead.

771
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:31,559
That's right.

772
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:32,599
He...

773
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,880
His room is clean and tidy,

774
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,679
It feels like he has no one

775
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,679
for many years.

776
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,119
I also found a photo.

777
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,440
It was a picture of Lu with his wife and kid.

778
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,719
There's an incense burner next to the picture,

779
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,679
and some tributes.

780
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,079
This old man bought these

781
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,880
It wasn't really for his family.

782
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,599
It is used as a memorial ceremony.

783
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,800
Once Luo Guanqun thinks you have betrayed,

784
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,480
he'll ask you to identify the other comrades.

785
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:09,679
The other comrades.

786
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Only by identifying the others,

787
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,760
to ensure the safe evacuation of our comrades.

788
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:15,880
How can we?

789
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,119
Those innocent people will be hurt?

790
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,320
It won't hurt

791
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,920
I have a friend who is the detective in the concession

792
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,639
I saw the record

793
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,599
on those people with ex-criminals.

794
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,559
I couldn't find you at the tea house,

795
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,719
so I was looking for you everywhere,

796
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,719
on the second floor of Dongli Hall.

797
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,360
Keep in mind that

798
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,400
there are two persons in Dongli Hall on the second floor.

799
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,880
These two people worked for Avenue Government

800
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,320
the Shanghai Municipality to sell Yandi.

801
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,559
But later, Yanyan and Dirt were

802
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,559
when the Japanese monopolized it,

803
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,519
they started trafficking in human beings again.

804
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,840
And killed several people.

805
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,320
Commit the most heinous crimes

806
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,000
but those two drug dealers

807
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,679
wouldn't admit to being Communist Party of China

808
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,679
don't worry.

809
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:55,679
Luo Guanqun has a lot of ways to get them to admit that.

810
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,920
Then Luo Guanqun will discover the flaw sooner or later.

811
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,440
Right.

812
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
This is the key.

813
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,719
When Luo Guanqun finds out you've been cheating him,

814
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,079
he will surely hate you to the core.

815
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,639
He will use the cruelest means

816
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,199
and torture you

817
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,440
and make you wish you were dying.

818
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:18,960
You are scaring me?

819
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,239
Alright.

820
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,239
Let's do that.

821
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,920
Communist

822
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,440
are not afraid of intimidation.

823
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,920
Yumo Calligraphy and Painting shop.

824
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,079
It was found under the floor.

825
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,960
Is it valuable?

826
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,960
I don't know.

827
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,199
You should have a look.

828
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,679
We've been deceived by the old man.

829
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,000
Can we arrest those tea drinkers?

830
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,440
And interrogate them?

831
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,920
Yes, they left the address.

832
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,639
Do you think the Communist Party of China

833
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,480
will give us true information?

834
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,039
It's all my fault.

835
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,960
I was cheated by these forged letters

836
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,199
and documents

837
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,039
I really thought his family was in Shanghai.

838
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,639
We were too careless.

839
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,360
I should have sent people to his place earlier

840
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,679
a horse scoop?

841
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,559
Boss Lu.

842
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,440
You should lie to us instead of us.

843
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,440
Mr. Luo and I took care of your business

844
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,159
chief Chen

845
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,960
rabbit Shoulder Zihao?

846
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,639
Are they useful?

847
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,519
Mr. Lu,

848
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,679
manager Luo,

849
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,960
pencil box with flower-and-bird pattern.

850
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,880
Is it useful?

851
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,719
Mr. Lu,

852
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,960
you don't have to be like this.

853
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,880
Open your calligraphy and painting shop

854
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,760
and live your life, aren't you?

855
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,840
Alright.

856
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,840
Yes, of course.

857
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,800
To drive out the Japanese invaders.

858
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,800
And get rid of you traitors and lackeys!

859
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,519
I haven't had such a good life

860
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,000
such a good life in a hundred years.

861
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,000
I won't be able to find out anything.

862
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,880
I'll leave now.

863
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,440
Hold on.

864
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,079
What do you mean?

865
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,280
Kill him now!

866
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,440
No. Old Luo.

867
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,760
I'm not good at that.

868
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,079
No retrial?

869
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,360
I trust you.

870
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,760
He won't say anything.

871
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm not a good shooter.

872
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,760
If you miss it,

873
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,880
don't laugh at me.

874
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:41,360
What do you mean?

875
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,400
The blanks I loaded

876
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,360
suspects that I'm in cahoots with him.

877
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,840
I didn't say that.

878
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,119
Right.

879
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,079
We are in cahoots.

880
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,239
I went to Yumo Calligraphy and Painting Shop

881
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,519
Is to pass him a message.

882
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,920
To connect with each other.

883
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,760
And today,

884
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,920
we worked together

885
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,440
to identify the two drug dealers

886
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,199
he did this

887
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
to gain time for the CCP

888
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,719
to gain time to escape.

889
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,119
Also,

890
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,280
the four of clubs is me.

891
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,199
I am the four of clubs.
