1
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,120
Are you sure it was a magpie?

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,200
As sure as a gun

3
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,359
I've ordered you to stop the mission.

4
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,719
Why are you still following him?

5
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,079
I don't want to give up easily.

6
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,760
Is it because you don't want to give up easily?

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,599
Do you have no other motives?

8
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,000
At least you knew that Magpie died.

9
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,599
He didn't have the formula

10
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,840
the man from Chongqing.

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
(made a deal with Magpie to meet and exchange with him)

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
At Da Hua Hotel to make a deal.

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,240
But the Japanese followed and attacked him.

14
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,800
Magpie ran away.

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,080
I followed Zuo Shuangtao to find the clue.

16
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,400
And found Magpie.

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,599
But it died of an accident.

18
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,080
And she came across Kimura Kenzo during the process.

19
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,520
But he had no choice but to kill him.

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,479
Besides, Zuo Shuangtao told me about his military identity.

21
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,520
To learn from her that

22
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,199
that Chongqing planned to sabotage the Border Region's economy

23
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,919
to carry out a sinister plan to destroy the economy of the Border Region.

24
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,080
That's what the magpie and the goose

25
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,520
why the magpies and the geese lurk in Yan'an.

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,680
And succeed.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,759
Papers for sale.

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,319
Sell my papers?

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,639
Selling news.

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,159
Smoke and fire.

31
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,960
Why are you so late?

32
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,639
There was a traffic jam.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,319
Where's the bicycle yesterday?

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,759
Could it break

35
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,599
after you sit there.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
What do you mean?

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
I didn't say you are fat.

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,919
My bike is old.

39
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,599
Scallion pancake.

40
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,400
I bought it for you.

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,120
No, I won't.

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,479
To talk to your people?

43
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,280
What's up

44
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,639
what's the new?

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,840
How can you speak like my superior?

46
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,439
Of course I'm anxious.

47
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm with you,

48
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm really annoyed and anxious.

49
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,240
One thing is very strange.

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Help me analyze it.

51
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,080
Alright.

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,879
What is it?

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,719
Before Magpie agreed to go to the hospital yesterday,

54
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,120
to make a deal with our people.

55
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
But they got exposed.

56
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,319
The deal fell through.

57
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:18,800
The formula

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
the formula should be on the magpie.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
But I didn't find it

60
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,240
then who took it?

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,439
If he didn't have the formula,

62
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,399
without the formula

63
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,759
I don't think he's so bold.

64
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
But Kimura is also looking for magpies.

65
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
That means they haven't got the formula either.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,560
That's right

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,279
that means

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,360
after he left the trading place,

69
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,439
and on the way to the hospital

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the formula was missing

71
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,040
I guess that

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,800
that he hid the formula in his wound

73
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,800
when I saw the corpse,

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
there are new stitches in the wound.

75
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,360
Have you analyzed it?

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,399
Please give me some time

77
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,560
to think it over.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
You scared me.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,879
Why are you so interested in the formula?

80
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,720
Because the formula

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,439
no matter it falls into our hands

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,399
or the Japanese,

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,959
It will be devastating to

84
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,639
to the economy of the Chinese Communist Border Region.

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
Guoguo is disappointed with Juntong

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,240
with each passing day.

87
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,399
And is willing to align with our ally.

88
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,040
We can cooperate with her in the future.

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,120
We can develop and cultivate her.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,480
You look so strange at me.

91
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,639
Strange?

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,519
You can't see if you love me or fear me

93
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,279
love me or fear me?

94
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,199
Love?

95
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,600
You're saying that out of fear.

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,519
See?

97
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,319
Admit it.

98
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,800
Fear tells lies.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
You don't love her.

100
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,879
If I say love but I'm afraid, will you believe me?

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,079
You don't believe me.

102
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,560
Then how am I supposed to answer?

103
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,839
Women can only ask questions.

104
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,399
It's your man's business.

105
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,279
Then you're being unreasonable.

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,519
So please answer.

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,639
Love me or fear me?

108
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,439
I'm afraid that you don't love me.

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
Just eat.

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,759
The car won't break down.

111
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,079
No food.

112
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,319
Drive your car.

113
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,800
It won't break down.

114
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,519
News for sale!

115
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,160
Why are you so late?

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
Something bad happened.

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,360
What happened?

118
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,920
Last night

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,600
officer Kimura died on duty.

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,920
What did you say

121
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,040
the mourning ceremony will be held soon.

122
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,399
The new chief will also come.

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,720
Hurry up.

124
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,279
He died while doing the duty.

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,759
What a surprise!

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,959
It's said that the murderer who killed Kimura's chief

127
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,560
was his informant.

128
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,079
♪ Against the wind for years ♪

129
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,079
Once the boat capsized in the gutter,

130
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,079
by the way, Manager Luo,

131
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,120
the batch of goods

132
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
was dispatched from Wuxi.

133
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,399
It will arrive in Shanghai in two days.

134
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,879
Put the goods in the warehouse

135
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,360
don't move for now.

136
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,319
Why not?

137
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,120
It's the right time to sell it at a higher price.

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,759
Kimura is dead now.

139
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,160
Don't you know

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,639
the Military Police will make trouble next.

141
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,879
We must be cautious at this time.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Otherwise,

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,279
when did you come?

144
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,600
I just arrived.

145
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,439
You were so spooky.

146
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,560
I was so scared.

147
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,759
You are so bold that you dare not breathe.

148
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
Stand properly.

149
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,519
The next chief will arrive soon.

150
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,240
Who's the new chief?

151
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,200
Lieutenant Naoki Ueda.

152
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,519
Uchida.

153
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,799
It's the day Miss Han Lu was caught by Zhao An.

154
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,600
It's Ueda that

155
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,679
who took Cold Dew away, right?

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I don't know much

157
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
his background.

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,399
He should be with the warrior under the mountain.

159
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:49,840
That's right.

160
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,879
He is Chief of Secret Service,

161
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,519
and Huang Mu Wei's hardcore bro.

162
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
What's up

163
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,679
It's fine.

164
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,840
Take it easy.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,879
Captain Zhao.

166
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,879
If Officer Kimura is dead,

167
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,120
Is our backer gone too?

168
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,000
Mumu Village is a small hill.

169
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,440
Plan Shan is our biggest backer.

170
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,639
Understood.

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,000
And Huang Jinming was killed.

172
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,480
And Kimura wouldn't have left us alone,

173
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,559
he won't spare us.

174
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,799
He managed to escape this time.

175
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
He died well.

176
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,399
Officer.

177
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,679
My name is Qian Chengyi.

178
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,440
The rich money

179
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,080
to succeed.

180
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,039
The successful

181
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,279
xiucai Qian.

182
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,759
Scram!

183
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,039
I have no interest in killing people.

184
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,200
Is so cheap.

185
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
It is too cheap.

186
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,279
Go in.

187
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:22,919
Yes

188
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,320
come in.

189
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,159
Good day, sir.

190
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,799
Officer Uchida wants me to report

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,279
how your opium plan

192
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,399
with your opium plan?

193
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,360
I've recently opened two more transport lines

194
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,519
to the Kuomintang-controlled area in northern Zhejiang.

195
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,080
The carrying capacity has doubled.

196
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,960
Great.

197
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,879
Please report to me directly

198
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,679
directly report to me.

199
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Yes

200
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,039
I thought you'd left Shanghai.

201
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,960
How would the Japanese know my whereabouts?

202
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
I was followed by the Japanese.

203
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,799
My plan is ruined, you know?

204
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
So you suspect that

205
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,320
I betrayed you?

206
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,279
You asked to see me for one last time.

207
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,639
For the last time?

208
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,159
Shoot.

209
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,519
Just shoot.

210
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,159
You must've colluded with Yamashita

211
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,639
to lure me out, right?

212
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,759
Right

213
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,399
so, shoot!

214
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,279
What are you doing?

215
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:01,919
Shoot!

216
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Are you out of your mind?

217
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,360
Gunshot!

218
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
Go check it!

219
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,080
Do you believe me now?

220
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
You alerted the military police.

221
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,679
Follow me.

222
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
Someone from the mountain must have followed you.

223
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,519
Why did he follow me?

224
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,960
It's not as simple as you think.

225
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,759
His investment in making films

226
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,039
Is just a cover.

227
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,480
The Shan Plan I came to investigate

228
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,039
must be related to him.

229
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
I just want to make movies.

230
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,399
I don't want to be involved in the Shan Project.

231
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,320
No way.

232
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,279
I need to escape from that demon as soon as possible.

233
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,440
You can't run away from him,

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,720
Instead, you have to go back to him.

235
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,480
Why?

236
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,799
Because he's using you.

237
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,120
But you could also use him.

238
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,759
You want me to be

239
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
and be your informant.

240
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,399
Do you know what

241
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,759
what Yamashita did to me?

242
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,639
As long as I can succeed in this mission,

243
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,519
all the credits

244
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,519
for all the credit.

245
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,960
Credit?

246
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,320
Who's that?

247
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,200
Come with me.

248
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,200
Mr. Guo,

249
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,679
I brought some clean clothes

250
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,759
and food for you.

251
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,080
Who is he?

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
He's Guo Yun.

253
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,519
One night last week,

254
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,559
I just got off work

255
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,559
I was about to leave the set,

256
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,120
I heard some noise in the props warehouse.

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,240
I thought the prop master was not off duty

258
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,679
so I went to say hello.

259
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,919
To my surprise,

260
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,399
several Japanese gendarmes rushed in

261
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
and searched everywhere

262
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,879
so I hid him here.

263
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,879
He has a special smell on him.

264
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,919
Of plate cleaning solution.

265
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,600
Did he tell you anything?

266
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,080
He can't remember anything?

267
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,720
He just said that

268
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,000
sunshine.

269
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,720
I want to see the sun.

270
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,919
I don't want to work for the Japanese anymore.

271
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,240
I don't want to work for the Japanese!

272
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,000
So you must be involved

273
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,799
the Japanese's counterfeit money printing?

274
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,639
Chief Chen

275
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,240
guoguo.

276
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,799
I'm back

277
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,399
look at this.

278
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,320
I queued for 20 minutes

279
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,200
I waited in line for 20 minutes.

280
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,279
Thank you, honey.

281
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Such a sweet talker.

282
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,960
Come on.

283
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,600
Try it.

284
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,120
It's really good.

285
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Since you've been so well recently,

286
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,919
can you do me another favor?

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,559
Alright.

288
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,200
What else do you want to eat?

289
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,039
I'll go and buy some for you.

290
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,519
I want

291
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,399
the sewer map of Shanghai.

292
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,600
You choked.

293
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,039
Come on.

294
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,080
Have some soda.

295
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,519
What?

296
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,960
That I'll drug it again?

297
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
Look at what you are doing.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,599
Don't

299
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,480
don't try to drag me into this.

300
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,559
Move over.

301
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,400
We are a couple.

302
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,480
Will you help me or not?

303
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,599
I will take action.

304
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,039
Also,

305
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,400
once my identity is revealed,

306
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,480
you can't help me

307
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,480
you will be screwed as well.

308
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,160
So you're helping yourself by helping me?

309
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,400
Are you extorting me?

310
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,559
That's how you blackmail me.

311
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,519
However, Guoguo...

312
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
The thing you want,

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,559
to get the thing you want?

314
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,200
It's said that it's a war secret.

315
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,839
They've all transferred it from the Ministry of Industry

316
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,039
to the archives of the Military Police Headquarters for safekeeping.

317
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,279
The Constitution

318
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
military Police Command?

319
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,839
You think it's so simple

320
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,079
as simple as lining up for ribbon fish?

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,359
You're not my husband

322
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,680
my husband who manages to think quickly.

323
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,240
Next time,

324
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,200
just add something to the soda water

325
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,039
and make me faint.

326
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,559
Let's eat.

327
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,279
The military has clues about the counterfeit factory.

328
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,279
There may be an important operation in the near future.

329
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
The time is tight.

330
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,200
To get approval for using Juntong

331
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,359
to get more information.

332
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,440
To wipe out the counterfeit factory,

333
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,480
the formula and copper plates that we lost

334
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,279
can be found.

335
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,759
He can take part in the operation to destroy the Japanese counterfeit factory.

336
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,279
But keep a close eye on the Military Commission

337
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,440
Is there any other purpose in asking for the map?

338
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,880
You must be cautious.

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,359
Don't expose your identity.

340
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,039
Lu Fangfang, there's no way

341
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,119
she's here.

342
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,079
What to drink?

343
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,160
Latte please.

344
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,319
Hello

345
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,240
a latte, please.

346
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,079
All right, sir.

347
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,079
Have a seat.

348
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,240
What about

349
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,039
do you have what I asked you to bring?

350
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,160
Yes, I have.

351
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,240
You told me

352
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,680
you made me look like a spy.

353
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,880
Great.

354
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:37,960
This one?

355
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,960
Yes, that's it!

356
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,880
It's against the rules

357
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,920
to wear it.

358
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,559
You must return it before getting off work.

359
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,599
Got it.

360
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,160
Then I'll return it to you.

361
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
Why are you looking at this?

362
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,759
I...

363
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,240
My friend from Changzhou

364
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,920
to bid for a sewer project.

365
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:56,960
He wants to know about

366
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,000
what type of pipes

367
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,119
the sewer pipes in Shanghai use?

368
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,200
It is unexpected that all these things

369
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,519
have become military secrets.

370
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,000
That's how Japanese are.

371
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,920
They even charge the price

372
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,640
you made it look like a military secret.

373
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,000
I need to use the bathroom.

374
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,720
Alright.

375
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,039
All cleaned up.

376
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,720
In cooking.

377
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,480
I learned this before.

378
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
You tricked me again.

379
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,039
How could I learn?

380
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:54,960
This

381
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,599
a quick response out of desperation.

382
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,480
All are forced by your evil spirit.

383
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,599
Just like the little baby who can't swim

384
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,519
Into the water.

385
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,880
The water.

386
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,960
And the same thing.

387
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,839
Really?

388
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,200
What a surprise!

389
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,559
That he's still alive.

390
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,519
I have to kill him again.

391
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,720
Your military commander

392
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
you always engage in assassination.

393
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,319
Might serve as a deterrent to others.

394
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,759
But the cause of national salvation

395
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:26,559
then

396
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,640
these methods alone, right?

397
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,759
What do you think we should do then?

398
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,000
You'll understand one day.

399
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,279
What you just said

400
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,640
I read about it in Xinhua Daily.

401
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
Makes sense.

402
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,440
Why Shangshan Hu is still alive

403
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,440
he seems to have disappeared recently.

404
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,480
What on earth he's doing,

405
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,000
what is he discussing with Ueda?

406
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,119
Do you want to know

407
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,359
what do you use it for

408
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,039
the sewer map?

409
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,839
You become smarter this time.

410
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,559
I'll tell you then.

411
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,519
I won't listen to your advice.

412
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,160
Please don't.

413
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,160
Listen to this.

414
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,079
I have a mission tonight.

415
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,680
You

416
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,160
stay at home.

417
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,880
Don't run around.

418
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
Ancestors,

419
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,519
where do you get into trouble again?

420
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,160
Don't worry.

421
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,279
I just need to meet my superior.

422
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,240
Please warm up the quilt at home,

423
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,119
wait me back

424
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:41,839
I won't...

425
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,200
Alright then.

426
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,960
Take care of yourself.

427
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,359
Director Jiang,

428
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,440
this is Left Shuangtao.

429
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,839
Last time I was in danger in Yalpei Road villa,

430
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,039
you dressed up as a nun and saved me.

431
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,599
It's me.

432
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,720
Left Twin Peaches.

433
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
That lurk in Taihe's trading house

434
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,720
which provided us with a lot of information.

435
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,480
Did you get the water pipe distribution map?

436
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,440
We got it.

437
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,359
Director Jiang found

438
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,039
a printer who worked in a Japanese printing factory.

439
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
This man's name is Guo Yun,

440
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,880
he was kidnapped by the Japanese.

441
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,240
He had dysentery a while ago,

442
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,839
the Japanese wanted to kill him,

443
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,000
so they wanted to kill him.

444
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,799
According to Guo Yun's memory,

445
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,839
the counterfeit factory was built underground,

446
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,480
as he didn't walk out of the ground,

447
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,440
he walked from the factory to the sewer.

448
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,359
The Japanese are so cunning.

449
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,519
Like a mouse,

450
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,759
they are hiding in the city ground,

451
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,400
but no one knows where they are.

452
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,000
That Guo Yun

453
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
do you know which part of the city

454
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,640
where in the city you walked through the sewer?

455
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,039
And the sewers are almost the same.

456
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,799
But the only thing he remembers is that

457
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,880
he's gone for about 15 minutes.

458
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,599
Then he saw

459
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,160
there's a sewer number

460
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,720
It's 43361.

461
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,119
Is unique.

462
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,759
So we can use this to determine

463
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,359
where in the city

464
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,640
was located in the city?

465
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,039
It happened to be a rainstorm on that day.

466
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,359
The water pipe was broken.

467
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,920
The Japanese soldiers

468
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,079
were swept away by the flood.

469
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,119
Found it.

470
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,880
433661.

471
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,839
Huxi Chaoyang Road.

472
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,119
Guo Yun said he walked for 15 minutes.

473
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,000
Guo Yun said he left for 15 minutes.

474
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,160
He started off from the underground factory.

475
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,119
He's within 15 minutes' distance.

476
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,079
If someone is within 15 minutes' distance,

477
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,039
It must be the counterfeit factory

478
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,559
but even if it's that,

479
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
the scope is still too wide.

480
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,240
All we have is a clue.

481
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,839
Who is there?

482
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:44,799
Don't.

483
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,519
Don't shoot.

484
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm Zuo Shuangtao's husband.

485
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,000
Why are you here?

486
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,920
Go back.

487
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,599
You're here.

488
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,759
Where can I go back?

489
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,119
You won't be back?

490
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,359
Director Jiang,

491
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,279
I can explain.

492
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,519
I promise that

493
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,000
he knows nothing.

494
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,319
He's too worried about me.

495
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,640
That's why he followed me.

496
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:03,920
Jiaping.

497
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,599
Come on.

498
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,440
Explain it.

499
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,680
Brothers,

500
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,119
I'm Zuo Shuangtao's husband.

501
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
I only look at my wife.

502
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,519
Go out in the middle of the night.

503
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,839
I was a little worried.

504
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:16,799
But then I thought about it,

505
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,200
I was an adult.

506
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,599
I was alone in my room.

507
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,279
My head was shining green.

508
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,839
So I followed my wife here.

509
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,279
I didn't mean to do it.

510
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,079
You heard

511
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,559
what we said just now?

512
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,160
Just a little bit.

513
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,599
We know

514
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,160
you already knew?

515
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,720
You are the military...

516
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,680
You must be human.

517
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,039
Sorry.

518
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,279
I guessed wrong.

519
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:40,799
Sorry!

520
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,799
You're right.

521
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:42,920
Director Jiang, here's the thing.

522
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,880
Listen to me.

523
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,039
Although he is a traitor,

524
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,519
he must be an idle fellow.

525
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,440
He is very timid.

526
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,920
I promise that

527
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,920
he won't tell us anything.

528
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,279
If not,

529
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,160
you don't have to kill him

530
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,920
I'll kill him myself.

531
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,799
My wife would definitely do that.

532
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,640
You shut up.

533
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,160
Director Jiang,

534
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
here's the thing.

535
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:07,000
He got a lot of information for me.

536
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,000
He was not on our side,

537
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,039
but

538
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,880
he made an indirect contribution.

539
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,759
He was the one

540
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,319
who helped me get these sewer maps.

541
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,119
How about this?

542
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,720
Please allow me to say something.

543
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:20,960
What is it?

544
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,160
Actually,

545
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,720
I did hear you outside.

546
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,640
But after analysis,

547
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,559
still haven't found out why.

548
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,279
Is it convenient

549
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,160
have a look.

550
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,000
Let me see Guo Yun.

551
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,799
Maybe I can help you find some clues.

552
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,920
If I help you find out any clues,

553
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,400
please let me go home.

554
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,839
Please forgive me.

555
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,319
I'll go home.

556
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,799
I have to warm the bed

557
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,440
and wash my wife's feet.

558
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,000
It seems that

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
you are such a good man.

560
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
Brother, look.

561
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,039
If you can keep me,

562
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,039
might be of some use.

563
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,000
If you kill me,

564
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,480
my wife would be a widow.

565
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,319
What a shame!

566
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,599
Although Chen Jiaping is a traitor,

567
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,759
he's innocent

568
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,240
yes

569
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,400
how about giving them a chance?

570
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,359
Thanks.

571
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,079
I'll give you ten minutes.

572
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,680
If you don't find it

573
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,279
If you don't find the exact location

574
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,400
the exact location of the underground factory,

575
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,319
don't worry.

576
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,640
Have a seat.

577
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,160
Just 10 minutes.

578
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,240
I'll adjust the watch

579
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,279
to 11 o'clock sharp.

580
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,960
Here we go.

581
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,680
Action!

582
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,480
Brother.

583
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,200
Take it easy.

584
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,519
Can you help me think about

585
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,559
of the day when I was kidnapped?

586
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,160
Thank you.

587
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,240
I used to be a technician in Changxing Printing Factory.

588
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,160
Six months ago,

589
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,319
on my way back from work

590
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,480
I was kidnapped by several people

591
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,359
they covered my face with a black cloth behind,

592
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,119
and put me in the car

593
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,640
how long has it been?

594
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
It's a long time

595
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,759
It's about two hours.

596
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,720
Maybe they made a detour on purpose.

597
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,559
The car stopped.

598
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,400
I was taken to a place

599
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,680
It seemed to be a factory.

600
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,480
I heard loud machinery.

601
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
After that,

602
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,759
I went to the counterfeit factory.

603
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,319
That's when they

604
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,359
they took off the black cloth for me.

605
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Then try to recall

606
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,160
In the counterfeit factory?

607
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,279
The most,

608
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,960
at the most,

609
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
more than 40.

610
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,519
However,

611
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,559
new people will come from time to time

612
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,759
and people will leave as well.

613
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
They said they were leaving.

614
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,920
Or she was killed.

615
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,799
Those with poor skills

616
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,759
and have serious illnesses.

617
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,160
And those who don't obey orders,

618
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,279
they all died.

619
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Do you know someone who works?

620
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,839
No.

621
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,759
I work with some other printers.

622
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,160
We couldn't talk to each other,

623
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,200
or ask each other's name.

624
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,240
We call each other by numbers.

625
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,119
I'm No. 75.

626
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,960
Then,

627
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,519
did you see the other staff?

628
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,079
We have a plate-maker,

629
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,200
or a copper engraver.

630
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,559
We operate in different areas.

631
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,079
The Japanese forbids our contact.

632
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,759
We already asked you

633
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,039
all the questions you asked.

634
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,440
Jiaping?

635
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,640
Why don't you change your perspective

636
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
and ask some details

637
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,920
that we haven't expected before.

638
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,640
Have you guys been to other places?

639
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,079
We ate and slept there.

640
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,319
What do they eat then?

641
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,079
Two dishes for lunch, steamed stuffed bun.

642
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,960
And rice porridge rolls in the evening.

643
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,599
One day a week

644
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,319
one day a week.

645
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:42,920
Then...

646
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,480
Can you see out of the window?

647
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,799
There are a few transom windows.

648
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,160
But all are boarded up.

649
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,240
You can't see anything.

650
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,319
Then...

651
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,799
Did you hear something outside the window?

652
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
Sometimes,

653
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,480
It seems that I can hear

654
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,440
when I think back,

655
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,880
It's like the sound of a ship's whistle.

656
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Sirens?

657
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,000
Are there more in summer

658
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,960
In summer or in winter?

659
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
You can hear it in summer

660
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,039
In winter,

661
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,279
barely.

662
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,480
And barely audible.

663
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
What kind of sound was that?

664
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,519
Do you still remember?

665
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,359
I can't learn it.

666
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
How about this, brother?

667
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:31,920
You come and listen

668
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
I'll imitate it.

669
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,240
Alright?

670
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,200
He is...

671
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,000
It's...

672
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:39,960
Help me think about it.

673
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,559
The number of interruptions

674
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,599
and length of interruptions.

675
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,119
Recall it carefully.

676
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,359
Let's go on.

677
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,440
And

678
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,119
I think

679
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,599
sounds like that.

680
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,759
Are you sure that's it?

681
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,519
I am sure.

682
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,519
Two long tones.

683
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,920
I've located the counterfeit factory.

684
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,119
That's good.

685
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:45,960
Ten minutes.

686
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,559
Tell me about it.

687
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,440
Sir,

688
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,240
thank you.

689
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:02,720
Thank you.

690
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,279
Please leave.

691
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,199
Is this how you treat him?

692
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Let me tell you something.

693
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,280
With one condition.

694
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,639
You're not qualified to negotiate terms with us.

695
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,159
He can talk.

696
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,079
Find the counterfeit factory,

697
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,840
will you make a plan to

698
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,679
and destroy it?

699
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,440
Certainly.

700
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,559
But before that,

701
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,480
I need to make sure

702
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,280
you're looking for the right place.

703
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,440
If we want to take action,

704
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,280
left Pair Tao.

705
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,880
Will join your operation or not?

706
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,800
She is

707
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,599
the best special agent.

708
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:48,679
We hope she can attend it.

709
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,280
Alright.

710
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,519
My term is

711
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,199
I'll take part in the operation together.

712
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,800
Why?

713
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,000
Why?

714
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,800
Of course it's for my wife.

715
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
It's such a dangerous operation.

716
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,239
To do such a dangerous operation?

717
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,360
If my wife dies,

718
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:07,840
If my wife dies?

719
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,840
Haven't we had enough sweet time?

720
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,440
And we've been working hard

721
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,199
to have a son and a half daughter.

722
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,480
We can't let your action

723
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,559
and affect our work.

724
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,880
What are you talking about?

725
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,400
Didn't we agree last night?

726
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,719
Did you really

727
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,159
just for Zuo Shuangtao?

728
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,400
Or what?

729
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,400
Shouldn't a man

730
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,519
a man should sacrifice everything

731
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,960
for the woman you love?

732
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,159
Right, Director Jiang?

733
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,519
Alright.

734
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:48,880
I promise you.

735
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,400
That's why you've taken so long to talk.

736
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,400
Where is the counterfeit factory?

737
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,519
Don't be anxious.

738
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,360
Tell you everything.

739
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,519
Director Jiang

740
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,719
has passed the serial number of the sewer

741
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,400
and determine a range roughly, right?

742
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,159
That is to say,

743
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,360
chaoyang Road in Huxi

744
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,800
within 15 minutes' journey

745
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,800
guo Yun also mentioned that

746
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,599
he often heard the sound of ship whistles

747
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,000
In the basement.

748
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That means

749
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,920
the counterfeit factory

750
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,039
along the Huangpu River,

751
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,360
there are a lot of places near the river.

752
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,000
That's right.

753
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
So I asked him about it.

754
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,639
Do you hear it most in summer

755
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,039
In summer or in winter?

756
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,000
We all know

757
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,079
wind

758
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,760
It can spread sound.

759
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,760
The summer wind in Shanghai is southeast.

760
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,119
This proves that

761
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,239
the counterfeit factory

762
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,360
It's at the northwest of Huangpu River.

763
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,400
Certainly,

764
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,880
this is not much different

765
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,719
be the same in essentials while differing in minor points

766
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,079
so I also asked

767
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,679
what kind of sound did Guo Yun hear?

768
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,840
The sounds of the ships are different.

769
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,880
And the intervals

770
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,320
have different meanings.

771
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,280
One tone is short, it means you're coming from the starboard side of the east ship.

772
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,719
Two short voices mean you'll meet from the starboard side of the east ship.

773
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,960
One is long

774
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,639
to leave the berth or pier.

775
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,960
The captain of two songs

776
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,639
for the ship

777
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,840
will go through the lock.

778
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,440
So Guo Yun heard two long tones.

779
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,559
That means

780
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,480
the counterfeit factory

781
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,679
near the ship gate of the Huangpu River.

782
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,519
Jiaping.

783
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,039
You know so much

784
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,880
thank you, honey.

785
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,679
Certainly.

786
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,760
The machines making counterfeit money.

787
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,960
Would make a lot of noise.

788
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,119
If we want to avoid detection,

789
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,079
and other voices to cover it up.

790
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,800
I found this area

791
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,559
It's a factory area,

792
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,800
so I concluded that

793
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,840
the counterfeit factory is hidden beneath this factory area.

794
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,280
This area is all factories.

795
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,440
How can you be sure

796
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,840
the underground of which factory?

797
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,199
There are many factories here,

798
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,880
those with Chinese capital

799
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,760
some are controlled by the Japanese.

800
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,599
However, the Japanese

801
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,760
would choose to be built

802
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,320
In a place controlled by the Japanese.

803
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,280
Two of these factories

804
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,159
are controlled by the Japanese.

805
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,639
One is a chemical factory

806
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,199
the other's a military garment factory.

807
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,360
According to what Guo Yun said,

808
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,280
when he passed through the factory,

809
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,199
he only heard the sound of machinery.

810
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,960
But I didn't smell the chemicals.

811
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,840
So I think

812
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,599
the counterfeit factory

813
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,119
there is a counterfeit

814
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,280
really?

815
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,440
My analysis is very accurate.

816
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,119
However,

817
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,480
everything you said

818
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,360
Is only speculation

819
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,840
If the counterfeit factory is here or not.

820
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,119
Before we act,

821
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
before we act.

822
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,000
Alright.

823
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
But if Director Jiang

824
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,800
you've just agreed

825
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,000
to join the operation.

826
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,280
I'm a man of my words.

827
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,199
However,

828
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,119
I have another question to ask you.

829
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,599
Please go ahead.

830
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,960
This Japanese military clothing factory

831
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,239
how can we get in?

832
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,679
We followed Zuo Shuangtao last night,

833
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:19,159
I was told that Juntong has obtained important clues.

834
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,800
With the clue, we may destroy the counterfeit factory at one stroke.

835
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,760
The missing formula and copper plate.

836
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,199
Could be found.

837
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,960
He decided to take part in the raid

838
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
In the name of protecting Zuo Shuangtao.

839
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,679
Due to the urgency of the situation,

840
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,119
so the approval was not obtained.

841
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,000
And report it

842
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,679
and report to the organization after taking action.

843
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,840
Four of clubs.

844
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,199
That's very kind of you.

845
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,400
He asked me out for a ride.

846
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,880
It's time to relax.

847
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,119
Brother.

848
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,280
This is what I'm thinking.

849
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,880
Now that Chief Kimura is dead,

850
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,760
little Doudou needs a new owner.

851
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:53,159
But who else is qualified to ride him

852
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,400
who could ride Little Bean?

853
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,280
Good point.

854
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,440
Bringing a horse is different from riding.

855
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,199
Riding on the horse

856
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,559
they've got better vision

857
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,039
your vision has been broadened too.

858
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
The air above is fresh.

859
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,320
Brother.

860
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,800
Enjoy your ride.

861
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,440
And take a walk.

862
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,400
Alright.

863
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,719
Brother.

864
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,519
That's like the Yama King,

865
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,719
another Ma Zhang Fei comes.

866
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,239
Hey.

867
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,800
Brother, slow down.

868
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,400
This...

869
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,519
Brother.

870
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,360
How is it?

871
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,280
What about

872
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,239
don't touch me.

873
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:30,760
I can do it myself.

874
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,559
Myself.

875
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,599
OK?

876
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,840
Slowly.

877
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
I can do it myself.

878
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,400
How is it?

879
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,320
Can I?

880
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,480
The horse ridden by a Japanese

881
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,960
has the same urination

882
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,559
brother.

883
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,960
Please don't be angry.

884
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,280
I'll talk to Little Bean later.

885
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
Just ride for a while.

886
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,519
For real?

887
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,599
And got all tangled up.

888
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,320
Brother.

889
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,480
Brother, don't go.

890
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,960
Stand here for a while.

891
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,440
What about

892
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,800
brother, wait!

893
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:10,599
Brother.

894
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,480
Wait!

895
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:11,840
Brother.

896
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,519
Hold on.

897
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,239
It's fine.

898
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,159
Go back to your work.

899
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:15,599
Brother,

900
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:16,480
brother!

901
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,320
You hurt Little Bean.

902
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,639
You must apologize to it.

903
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,079
It dropped me.

904
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,000
I'll apologize to it.

905
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,079
That works.

906
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,079
Then go back with me.

907
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,400
I'll ask Little Bean to apologize to you.

908
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,519
That's fine.

909
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,719
Brother, how about this?

910
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,639
Go back with me,

911
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,400
I apologize to both of you.

912
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,199
No need.

913
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,440
Get back to work.

914
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,519
Brother.

915
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,920
The three of us must apologize to each other.

916
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,320
Listen to me.

917
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,400
Why should I apologize?

918
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,960
You're my elder brother.

919
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,239
That little bean dropped you.

920
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,559
When you dropped you.

921
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,519
But you made it uncomfortable again.

922
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:47,840
You should apologize to it.

923
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,920
Then I caused this.

924
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,079
And I raised Little Bean.

925
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,920
So I must apologize to both of you.

926
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,360
You're abnormal?
