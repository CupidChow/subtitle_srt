1
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,319
As a husband,

2
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,200
I also want to save my wife's face.

3
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,879
I will serve the empire twice in the future.

4
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,560
Family security! Family peace!

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,439
You jerks!

6
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,920
Take off your clothes!

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Stop!

8
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,359
Officer Mu Cun,

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,120
today is my niece's

10
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,120
my niece's wedding day.

11
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,200
Isn't it too much

12
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,640
to do this?

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,640
Yes, Chief Yamashita is in trouble.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,519
I hope our cooperation

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,319
our cooperation.

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
Since we want to cooperate,

17
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,960
It's just a pity that

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,319
get a woman

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,639
to bring her to the room for examination.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Alright?

21
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,439
Alright.

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,400
Take them away.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,960
Jia Ping.

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
Jia Ping, are you alright?

25
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,000
Keep searching.

26
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,280
Chen Jiaping,

27
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,240
If you keep yelling,

28
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,560
the scoop.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,759
What do you think of

30
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,759
about the assassination in the mountain just now?

31
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,960
I just don't understand.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,479
How do you think the assassin got in there?

33
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,280
Also,

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,960
what did the commander do in the storage room?

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Zhao An is behind all this?

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Zhao An?

37
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,960
Zhao An wanted Kun to identify Left Shuangtao.

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,960
But he got killed.

39
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,800
Left Twin Peaches again?

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,039
Who is the Left Pair Peaches?

41
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,639
Let's investigate

42
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,560
we have investigated Zhao An, too.

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
After searching,

44
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,800
with her investigation.

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,599
Left Shuangtao has problems.

46
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
I can't blame her for the problem.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,840
You stupid fool.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,080
Now Zhao An is in trouble.

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
He will take the blame.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,879
This will be our chance.

51
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,360
What's up

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,160
your hands are so cold,

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
and shaking.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,240
Such horrible thing happened just now.

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,279
I'm scared.

56
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,240
Of what?

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
It has nothing to do with us.

58
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,759
You know I'm timid.

59
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,279
Especially when you see a dead person,

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,879
I can't sleep well these days.

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,480
Old Luo.

62
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,480
Do you still remember

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,759
when we first got together,

64
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,279
the one you always took me to

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
you used to take me to?

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,199
Yes, I remember.

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,879
The wedding today

68
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,680
ended in a sloppy way.

69
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,560
I didn't have enough to eat

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,399
and scared to death.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,759
Please

72
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,040
take me to the Forbidden City again.

73
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,360
Alright?

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,040
Right.

75
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,480
It's been over two years.

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,279
We haven't had midnight snacks together, have we?

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,759
Alright.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,759
Thank you.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,680
It hurts a lot, right?

80
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,439
Luckily, his heart is not hurt.

81
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,839
Guoguo.

82
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Sorry.

83
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,240
I didn't protect you well.

84
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,240
The Japanese don't even treat us as human beings.

85
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,800
Why do you still work for them?

86
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,079
I know.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,399
When I have enough money,

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,120
when I've earned their money.

89
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,879
Right now,

90
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,959
I have my plan.

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,079
Trust me.

92
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
But I have my plans.

93
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,279
I'll accompany you

94
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,600
to accompany you.

95
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,279
You're going to work in the firm?

96
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,839
Guo Guo.

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
It's very dangerous to work for a Japanese.

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,319
What's your business?

99
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,360
Besides, what can you do to a business?

100
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,759
My major is accounting

101
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,680
and I can get Luo Guanqun to agree.

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,040
But most importantly,

103
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,560
I can go to the firm

104
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,040
to take care of my husband.

105
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
Your husband

106
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,600
works better than painkillers.

107
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,079
Call him again!

108
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,439
Hurry up!

109
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Was about to die.

110
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,199
Stop joking around.

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm being serious.

112
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,759
Honey.

113
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,879
That would be great if there's no war.

114
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
This will end.

115
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,120
I still disagree with you

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,839
you want to work in the business.

117
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,600
You're my wife.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,519
You have to listen to me.

119
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,480
Today. We'll listen to you.

120
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Today?

121
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,079
If you don't listen to me,

122
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,759
my wound hurts again.

123
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,360
Captain Zhao.

124
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,120
Shuyun.

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
It's me.

126
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,000
You are the only one who didn't give me up.

127
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,600
No matter when it is,

128
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,080
I will never give up on you.

129
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,720
Shu Yun.

130
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,440
Why not?

131
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,360
You're useless to me.

132
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,240
Chief Kimura.

133
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,159
Spare my life, Chief Kimura.

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,200
You asked Chen Jiaping to marry Zuo Shuangtao?

135
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,519
It was your idea.

136
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,039
It was also your idea

137
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,320
to attend the wedding.

138
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,720
You have got one bad idea after another.

139
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,000
The hole is getting bigger and bigger.

140
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,960
You're the one who caused Colonel Yamashita's death.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,960
And brought Kun to the wedding.

142
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,120
That's right.

143
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,159
Was proposed by Commander Yamashita himself.

144
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,639
It's not our fault.

145
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,600
What? We?

146
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,120
No, I...

147
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,759
Sorry.

148
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,240
Please forgive me.

149
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,720
Understood.

150
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,159
Do you mean that

151
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,519
I must be responsible for

152
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,799
for Commander Yanxi's death.

153
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,320
You want to tell me

154
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,840
you're the one who made

155
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,600
on yourself?

156
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,279
I don't dare and I won't.

157
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,639
I don't dare and I won't.

158
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,200
I won't and dare not.

159
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,799
Shut up.

160
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,519
Shut up.

161
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
No, no. Officer Kimura, listen to me.

162
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm collecting funds

163
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,559
for the launch of Shan Plan.

164
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,879
You can kill me.

165
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,600
Never mind

166
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,120
my life is not valuable.

167
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,759
But if I don't get the funds,

168
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,799
the progress of Shan Project will be delayed

169
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,440
and the great empire.

170
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,159
Are you threatening me?

171
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,519
No, I don't dare to.

172
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,919
And I won't.

173
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,679
Shut up.

174
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,480
Shut up.

175
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,919
Shut up.

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,279
Zhao An,

177
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,440
your life is over.

178
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,039
It's over.

179
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,159
She is just temporarily staying with me.

180
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,960
- Yes, Your Majesty. - That's right.

181
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
If you fail again in this mission,

182
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm going to throw your life

183
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,039
like trash.

184
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,919
Like the trash?

185
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,840
In the latrine pit

186
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,759
and the latrine.

187
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
Don't... don't kill me.

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,039
Please.

189
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,559
Officer Mu.

190
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,080
Officer Kimura.

191
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,679
Thanks.

192
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,879
Thanks. Thanks.

193
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
Thanks.

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,039
Officer Kimura.

195
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
The Left Double-tao.

196
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,919
Aren't we checking on the Left Twin Peaches?

197
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,039
Left Shuangtao's birthday

198
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,879
zuo Shuangtao's birthday was engraved on Kun's pendant.

199
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,559
I don't think that's a coincidence.

200
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,039
Trust me,

201
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,120
or it's another possibility.

202
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,559
This is a trap set up by Kun and Zuo Shuangtao.

203
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,480
To lure you into that room.

204
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,360
Trust me.

205
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,080
Don't waste your time

206
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,240
left Pair Tao

207
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,639
they two

208
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,159
(You should know)

209
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,320
The most important task in this world?

210
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,039
Right.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll do my best

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,879
to find the two negotiators.

213
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,559
Rest assured.

214
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,039
They're married now.

215
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,039
Let's not

216
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,919
and raise fish.

217
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,519
And watch.

218
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,720
How's your injury going?

219
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,480
I won't die.

220
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,679
Oh, right.

221
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
Have the photos I took

222
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,320
have you been developed?

223
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,600
The documents we captured are very valuable.

224
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,759
However,

225
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,639
these documents of Zhao An

226
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,080
these documents

227
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
this is only a small part of the whole picture.

228
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,919
This is still

229
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,639
It's a major breakthrough.

230
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,720
We only heard about

231
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,039
about Plan Shan.

232
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
But I didn't get any further information.

233
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,000
I've reported it to our superior.

234
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,840
Your next task

235
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,519
to investigate Plan Shan.

236
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:14,639
Got it.

237
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,559
That's right.

238
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,159
Luo Guanqun and Zhao An both suspected

239
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,759
suspected Zuo Shuangtao

240
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,320
Is the assassin who killed Martial Master under the mountain.

241
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,240
But I didn't take that seriously before.

242
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,200
I think that's just a coincidence.

243
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,879
But, on the wedding,

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,840
zuo Shuangtao's behaviors were very odd.

245
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,039
I'm thinking

246
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,679
she may also be a member of Anti-Japanese Organization?

247
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,240
You are right.

248
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
And she offered to

249
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,000
to work in the firm.

250
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
Although I didn't agree.

251
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,200
With her temper,

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,919
to stop her.

253
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,840
I was thinking that

254
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,360
I wondered if she might have

255
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,960
has an insidious task as well.

256
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,080
I will report

257
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,360
to our superior as soon as possible.

258
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
And carry out further investigation on Zuo Shuangtao.

259
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,159
You're husband and wife after all.

260
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,360
No matter what her real identity is.

261
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,879
The first thing you should do

262
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,799
Is to protect your identity.

263
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,759
Keep a close eye on her next move.

264
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,399
Don't let it affect your mission.

265
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,840
The situation is getting more and more complicated now.

266
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,399
Utterly mystified

267
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,559
luo Guanqun, let me tell you something.

268
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,759
If a hair in Left Pair Tao goes missing,

269
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,840
I will never let you off!

270
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,720
How come

271
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,200
so bad-tempered?

272
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,200
Look at yourself.

273
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,879
You're injured. Don't you recover yet?

274
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,799
You only come to work after having a good rest.

275
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,519
It was because of you.

276
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,600
How could you allow Zuo Shuangtao

277
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,039
to work here?

278
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,759
Boss Yu personally came to see me.

279
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,440
I wouldn't give him face.

280
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,080
Furthermore,

281
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,519
It is only good for you two

282
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,559
that's right.

283
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,159
You didn't see that

284
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,559
for us.

285
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,799
Where?

286
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
Zhao An is defeated now.

287
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,919
We need to follow up the victory with hot pursuit.

288
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,399
Boss Yu discussed with me.

289
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,919
He had a batch

290
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,600
a batch of urgently needed rapeseed oil

291
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,200
and asked me to be a salesperson.

292
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,919
We hoard it for three months

293
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,120
then we got word that

294
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,960
that rapeseed oil has soared

295
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,720
and then I sold it.

296
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,399
After they sold it.

297
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,240
If it weren't for Zuo Shuangtao,

298
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,399
I wouldn't be able to talk to Boss Yu.

299
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,519
You can't agree

300
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,480
that Zuo Shuangtao is working here?

301
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,320
She's just here to show us.

302
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,039
You were afraid she might be in danger.

303
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,799
I was more scared than you.

304
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,879
I don't care about you.

305
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,360
You have to promise me that

306
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,440
that Zuo Shuangtao

307
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,320
no dangerous jobs.

308
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,000
I promise.

309
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,919
I give you a million guarantees.

310
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:50,879
Come here.

311
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,679
Have a seat.

312
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,679
Zhao An has Mu Cun's support.

313
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,120
Who's your backer?

314
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,720
How could you hurt Zhao An

315
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,639
by doing so much?

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
What does Kimura want?

317
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,200
Business and money.

318
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,840
Business and money are with us.

319
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,320
Kimura will take advantage of it.

320
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Alright.

321
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,440
You are right.

322
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,960
I hope you can

323
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,399
on the day of your comeback,

324
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,600
don't forget about me.

325
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,879
Don't worry.

326
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,279
Forget who?

327
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,639
I won't forget you either.

328
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,240
By the way,

329
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,919
do you remember?

330
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,600
In your wedding,

331
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,240
why did Zhao An call Kun there?

332
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,919
Let go of him.

333
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm not suspecting Zuo Shuangtao.

334
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,120
How can I let her work here otherwise?

335
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,519
Then why ask me this?

336
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:48,960
Come on.

337
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
Sit down.

338
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,960
Your personality is so...

339
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,679
Zhao An has fallen into his trap.

340
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,840
He's still short of one breath.

341
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,279
We need to throw a stone to him.

342
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
What stone?

343
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,519
The murder of Commander Shanxia.

344
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,839
You need to find more evidence to prove Zhao An's negligence.

345
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,480
Speaking of which,

346
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,319
that reminds me of a strange thing.

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
Feng Qi left early

348
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,200
feng Qi left early.

349
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,000
Before the wedding,

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,039
before the wedding?

351
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,279
That Feng Qi left in a hurry.

352
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,720
Although it might have nothing to do

353
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,319
with the assassination of Martial Master under the mountain,

354
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,640
It's hard to avoid reminiscent.

355
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,920
Then you should investigate Feng Qi.

356
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,319
How am I supposed to do that?

357
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,720
I have no evidence

358
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,599
what if he really has something to do with me?

359
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,160
You're really

360
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
what do you think of

361
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,599
It made you suspect it

362
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,119
why don't you investigate it?

363
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,319
Of course it's fine if I can't find it out.

364
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,680
Isn't it better to find it out?

365
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
You don't understand that.

366
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,200
It's me.

367
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,119
Captain.

368
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,160
I found those two Japanese

369
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,519
near Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai.

370
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,119
But after I followed them around Mingzhe University,

371
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,200
when I intercepted them.

372
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,240
I've been searching here for a day.

373
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
I don't even see any personal hair.

374
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,079
Wait for me there.

375
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,480
I'll be right there.

376
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,200
Alright.

377
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,640
Why are there so many people

378
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,279
why are there so many people today?

379
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,240
Dysentery broke out these days.

380
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,359
Many Japanese servicemen and their families have become ill.

381
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,279
The hospitals are full.

382
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,680
I can tell that

383
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
the two of them are in the Army General Hospital.

384
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,200
I'll do it tomorrow morning.

385
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,559
Are you going to the Army General Hospital to kill someone?

386
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Are you not asking for death?

387
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,759
Did you forget that Officer Kimura said

388
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,640
that this must be kept a secret

389
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
you can't have anything to do with us.

390
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,680
What should we do then?

391
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,519
To find a killer

392
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,759
disguised as a cleaner and entered the hospital.

393
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,519
After that,

394
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,160
cut the weeds and dig up the roots

395
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:09,759
captain.

396
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,039
You are considerate.

397
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,640
I'll deal with it now.

398
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,680
I know the man in a gray windbreaker.

399
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,799
He is a killer.

400
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,960
Whose nickname is Big Ghost.

401
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,519
How many lives he got?

402
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
She was staying in the French Concession

403
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,440
but the strange thing is

404
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,559
zhao An wanted to kill someone.

405
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,440
Why didn't his men do anything?

406
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,039
And wanted to find another killer?

407
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,599
After following this ghost,

408
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,599
who Zhao An's target is.

409
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,039
Do you want me to go with you?

410
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,599
It's alright

411
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,160
he has been active in French Concession for a long time,

412
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,039
he might have seen you.

413
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,880
I'll go on my own.

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
Be careful.

415
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,599
Have you set a time for negotiation?

416
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,440
Yes

417
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,160
don't worry.

418
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,680
I've told them to be ready.

419
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,079
But I hope our negotiation

420
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,400
successfully this time.

421
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,480
To fight for the Japanese empire

422
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
and occupy China peacefully.

423
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,160
Yes

424
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,720
don't worry.

425
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,680
You two

426
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,000
to Ward 103 downstairs.

427
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,960
Why?

428
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,920
The ward on the second floor

429
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,680
Is going to be the isolation ward.

430
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,799
Please pack your things.

431
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,160
The medicine room has spilled some medicine.

432
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,279
Please clean the room.

433
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,119
All right.

434
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,440
Alright.

435
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm a killer.

436
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,359
Someone wants to kill you.

437
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,559
Someone wants the information you have.

438
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
We don't know

439
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
I call the shots.

440
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,799
But I've been asked for more information.

441
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,640
So as long as you tell me

442
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,920
the information I want,

443
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,880
and I'll spare your lives.

444
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,880
I won't be patient anymore.

445
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,920
We can't...

446
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,480
I can't tell.

447
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,799
He'll kill us.

448
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,400
Then tell him false information.

449
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,799
How did he find us?

450
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,440
Is the secret of the peace talks

451
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
with the Chongqing government is revealed?

452
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,119
It seems that I can only make the cut.

453
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,680
Don't.

454
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,920
Who's that?

455
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,559
Why did Zhao An send killers

456
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,799
to kill two Japanese?

457
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
Who are these two Japanese?

458
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,400
Could they be anti-China or anti-war?

459
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,240
It's a pity that I can't understand

460
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
speak Japanese.

461
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,799
Left Twin Peach.

462
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,880
Think oneself clever

463
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,160
and disobeyed the military order.

464
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,200
Not only did I lose the

465
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,960
the letter we tried so hard to get

466
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,160
and continued to lurk arbitrarily.

467
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,279
Do you really see me as your superior?

468
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,799
Is there any organization?

469
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,279
I think it must be taken by someone in the business

470
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:00,960
Inside the business.

471
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,559
That's why I continued to lurk.

472
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,599
I must be able to find it back.

473
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,279
Everything. You think

474
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,759
you think you can go undercover so easily this time?

475
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,839
Luo Guanqun told me

476
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,799
asked me to go to work in the business in three days.

477
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,640
Plus the relationship between my uncle and benevolence,

478
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,799
I will definitely stand on the ground.

479
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,359
Don't think I don't know.

480
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,400
If you continue to stay in Shanghai,

481
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,319
don't you just want to be with Chen Jiaping?

482
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,839
I didn't!

483
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,839
Don't make excuses.

484
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,880
I disobeyed your order.

485
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,079
Please punish me.

486
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,759
Not to mention the punishment,

487
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,480
or execute you.

488
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,000
You can execute me, but I won't regret.

489
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,039
You're so stubborn.

490
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,279
I agree that you can stay in Shanghai.

491
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,119
Your mission is

492
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,039
use the pretext of your work in the firm

493
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,079
to keep looking for the whereabouts of the secret letter.

494
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,079
Yes

495
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,119
you should make acting look real.

496
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,759
Watch a movie,

497
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,359
and have a candlelight dinner,

498
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
all of your actions

499
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,160
should be like a newlywed couple,

500
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,799
most importantly,

501
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,640
don't let Chen Jia Ping suspect you.

502
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,079
Yes

503
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,759
I will complete the task.

504
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,880
Never disobey orders again.

505
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,200
It's your turn now.

506
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,759
What's the matter?

507
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,000
Before Ms. Han Lu

508
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,440
with Manchu Pictures

509
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
manchu Pictures Film Studio, right?

510
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,920
Yes

511
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,079
I think

512
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,240
you're proficient

513
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,039
of Japanese as well.

514
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,160
I can't say it completely.

515
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,720
With normal communication.

516
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,640
Here's the thing.

517
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,200
I want to ask Ms. Han Lu to help me

518
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,960
to translate a few Japanese.

519
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,720
But it doesn't have complete sentences.

520
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,000
Some parts.

521
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,319
And my pronunciation is probably not standard.

522
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,240
What is it?

523
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,960
I'll try.

524
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,519
Thanks.

525
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,720
I copied it on some paper.

526
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,279
I mentioned the peace talks with the Chongqing government.

527
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,119
And the leakage of secrets.

528
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,119
The Chongqing government's peace talks

529
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:26,920
thank you.

530
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,319
Also, don't tell anyone

531
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,799
we can't tell anyone about it,

532
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,519
really?

533
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,519
As expected.

534
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,119
Talking with smart people

535
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,640
Is such a pleasant one.

536
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,119
Miss Han Lu.

537
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,640
To keep a secret for me again.

538
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,960
Then I knew

539
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,799
you men have many secrets.

540
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,000
I have to keep a secret,

541
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,640
you have to keep countless secrets.

542
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,359
I think Ms. Han Lu

543
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,839
Is a person with many secrets.

544
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,400
Maybe one day

545
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,200
I'll tell you my secret.

546
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,839
Captain! Captain.

547
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,079
They are gone.

548
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,119
Where did he go?

549
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,599
We've looked around the hospital for ages but couldn't find him.

550
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,319
Feng Qi!

551
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,039
Why are you like a second knife?

552
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:23,880
You can't accomplish anything.

553
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
You can't make things worse.

554
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,559
Hey,

555
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,319
a fake doctor suddenly appeared,

556
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,759
the operation would have been a success.

557
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,920
Fake doctor!

558
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,640
Did the big ghost see his face?

559
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,920
He said he was wearing a mask.

560
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,960
Because she was wearing a mask.

561
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,400
Why did you ask me to watch a movie?

562
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
You are married, can't you watch a movie?

563
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,960
Alright.

564
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,480
But how can you ask me to watch the Cold Dew movie?

565
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,519
I didn't expect that she acted.

566
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,519
If I knew, I wouldn't buy it.

567
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,559
Hurry up.

568
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,440
Are you really angry?

569
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,079
I'm going to the bathroom.

570
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,480
Left Pair Tao.

571
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,400
What are you doing?

572
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,199
I should be asking you that.

573
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,440
What are you doing here?

574
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,920
Why did you pretend to be a pedlar?

575
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,039
Why didn't you leave Shanghai?

576
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,719
I...

577
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,320
I have to make it real when acting.

578
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,079
Watch a movie,

579
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,760
and have a candlelight dinner,

580
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,320
all of your actions

581
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,760
will be like a newlywed couple,

582
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,280
why do you want to kill Chen Jiaping?

583
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,719
This is an order

584
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,079
he's useful.

585
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,280
He can't die.

586
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,039
If I don't execute the mission, I can't report it.

587
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,880
So it is a conspiracy

588
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,119
Is nothing but a conspiracy.

589
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,960
No wonder they chose the French Concession.

590
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,039
What?

591
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,000
It's easy to get away once you succeed.

592
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,800
Captain Liu asked us to do that,

593
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,800
for him to do that.

594
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,320
Go back.

595
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,119
I will explain to Captain Liu.

596
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,119
I promise he won't give you a hard time.

597
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,280
Look at this.

598
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,480
We once

599
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,280
successfully assassinate the warrior under the mountain.

600
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,480
It's because you believed in me.

601
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,159
Right?

602
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,360
Yes

603
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,440
the highlight of Cold Dew has just passed.

604
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,559
Just read it.

605
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,639
I'll eat melon seeds.

606
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,159
To watch your cold dew.

607
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,800
It's really good.

608
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,199
Since you treated me to the movie,

609
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,960
how about I treat you to dinner?

610
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
What would you like to eat?

611
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,039
You're the boss.

612
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,280
It's my call.

613
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,000
Home is peaceful.

614
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,719
Miss Cold Dew.

615
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,119
Miss Cold Dew.

616
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,119
Can you sign them for me?

617
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,519
Alright.

618
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,480
That's right.

619
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,280
Super stars are different.

620
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,079
Thank you

621
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,039
jia Ping, be careful!

622
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,199
Calm down.

623
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,079
Calm down.

624
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,440
Brother,

625
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,559
calm down.

626
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,360
What do you want to know?

627
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,000
And you can tell me

628
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
whatever you want.

629
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,880
Calm down.

630
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,480
Put the gun down!

631
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:45,599
Step back!

632
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,920
Or I'll shoot.

633
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,920
According to Shuangtao,

634
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,719
chen Jiaping was also there

635
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,920
and the secret letter was with him.

636
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,679
Since it can't be retrieved,

637
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,440
It will never be leaked.

638
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,800
You have to remember that

639
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,519
the longer Chen Jiaping lives,

640
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,159
the longer Left Pair of Peaches is in danger.

641
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,679
For Left Twin Peaches,

642
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,519
I will complete the mission.

643
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,239
Stop looking.

644
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,559
Stop looking!

645
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,719
Arrest him!

646
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,079
Are you alright?

647
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,119
I was shocked.

648
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,719
Jia Ping

649
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,760
are you all right?

650
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,239
Miss Cold Dew.

651
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,159
It's fine.

652
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,440
Thank you

653
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,639
for reminding me.

654
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,000
Who he is,

655
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,360
and why did he kill you?

656
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,360
I don't know either

657
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,920
who is anti-Japanese.

658
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,960
Chengzi,

659
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
take care of the shooting case.

660
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:23,679
It can't be recorded

661
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,360
and the reporters can't know it.

662
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,960
Also,

663
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,320
the body will be richly buried.

664
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,639
Okay. Don't worry.

665
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,360
Miss Han Lu.

666
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,400
Why are you here?

667
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,159
Every time my movie was released,

668
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,679
I sat among the audience

669
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,920
and watch with them.

670
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,119
I want to know their reaction.

671
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,440
Oh right.

672
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,360
Guoguo.

673
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:57,719
Come on.

674
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,760
I forgot to introduce her to you.

675
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,960
This is my wife, Zuo Shuangtao.

676
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:04,760
Hello

677
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,440
guoguo.

678
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,159
No need to introduce him.

679
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,679
You know her?

680
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,719
Of course, I know him.

681
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,920
The Goodwill Ambassador of Japan

682
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
to be a super star like Cold Dew.

683
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,480
In fact, the description of me in many newspapers

684
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,840
was inaccurate.

685
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,960
I think it's right.

686
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:24,760
About Jia Ping

687
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,480
didn't you say you're her fan?

688
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,840
But you are also good friends.

689
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,079
I only met Miss Han Lu once or twice.

690
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,559
You guys can talk. I'm leaving now.

691
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:39,480
I'm going with you

692
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
don't follow me.

693
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,840
I have my own business to deal with.

694
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,079
Jia Ping,

695
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,360
did I make her misunderstand?

696
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,639
That won't be necessary.

697
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,000
Go back.

698
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,039
I will explain to Captain Liu.

699
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,400
He won't give you a hard time.

700
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,000
Alright?

701
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Kun!

702
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Sorry.

703
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,679
Why don't you have breakfast with Zuo Shuangtao?

704
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,480
We are having a fight recently.

705
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,400
We are eating alone.

706
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,880
Fight with each other after only a few days of marriage.

707
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,239
Old road.

708
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,920
Quarrel of no reason,

709
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,239
Isn't that more like a couple?

710
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,760
It's true.

711
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,559
The Shan project hasn't made much progress recently.

712
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,159
But we got something unexpected.

713
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:49,840
What?

714
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,239
Have you heard that

715
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,320
the Chongqing government is having secret peace talks

716
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,559
with the Japanese government.

717
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,920
Peace talks?

718
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,639
One year ago,

719
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,039
jiang Jieshi once told

720
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,440
to Du Shishan, the head of the Hong Kong Office,

721
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,760
and had peace talks with Japan

722
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,400
they also discussed the Japanese policy.

723
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,519
But later Japan decided to support Wang Jingwei

724
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,400
then the peace talks would be over.

725
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,960
The peace talk is now restarted.

726
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,199
There may still be a conspiracy against our party.

727
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:19,719
Got it.

728
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,559
I'll find out the truth as soon as possible.

729
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,719
One more thing.

730
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,159
I think Zuo Shuangtao

731
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,480
more and more suspicious recently.

732
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,239
Before Kun died,

733
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,920
when Kun looked at Zuo Shuangtao before his death.

734
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,000
I suspect that they know each other.

735
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,119
And I think about the doubts in the wedding,

736
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,719
they must be a team.

737
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,400
Or they might be members of a anti-Japanese organization.

738
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:47,199
But why did Kun want to kill you?

739
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:48,800
From the Left Shuangtao.

740
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,079
Insists on working in this firm.

741
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,840
Could it be that she wants to sneak into the firm?

742
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,400
But my existence

743
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,119
Is the biggest threat to her.

744
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,800
Left Shuangtao wants to kill you.
