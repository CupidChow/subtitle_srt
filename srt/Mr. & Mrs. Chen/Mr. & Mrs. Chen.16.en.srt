1
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,200
Do you think

2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,599
feng Qi really bandaged Jiang Zhaoguo?

3
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,239
Then I don't know.

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,560
Would anyone know how Feng Qi was bandaged?

5
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,120
And colluded with Jiang Zhaoguo

6
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,959
to frame him.

7
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,640
I want to ask Mr. Jiang a favor.

8
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,319
What is it?

9
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,200
I think he will accept.

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,760
This is the thing.

11
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,640
Can Mr. Jiang

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
an interview with the reporters

13
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,760
bandage his injured right arm

14
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,159
with an eight character helix.

15
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,120
This is the procedure

16
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,360
we must see clearly

17
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,039
you must look at his right arm that has been bandaged properly.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
That's a strange request.

19
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,039
But it doesn't seem that

20
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,599
to you.

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,639
Honey,

22
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,520
you've read too much unofficial history.

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
We don't have so many conspiracies.

24
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,680
At most, God will grant us that

25
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,319
that Feng Qi is evil.

26
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,639
And this Huigan?

27
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,879
He woke me up.

28
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,240
Found out about him.

29
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,840
Anyway, in short,

30
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,560
feng Qi deserves to be unlucky.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,560
I think so.

32
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,159
After work,

33
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,759
about this big spoon,

34
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,199
In Juntong's hand

35
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,360
It really was Feng Qi who sent a message to Jun Tong?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
It's his handwriting.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sure it can't be fake.

38
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,159
Would it be someone framing him?

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
He is so smart.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,639
No one can frame him.

41
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,240
Feng Qi who suspected you

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
I had him followed.

43
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,000
He went to Pukou Station in Nanjing

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,719
to look for a vendor who sells perfume sachets.

45
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,479
Feng Qi has the perfume satchel?

46
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,919
What's wrong? Trouble?

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,879
Who's the man following him?

48
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,280
His name is Li Youtian.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,039
Smart enough?

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright.

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,879
I want him to do something for me.

52
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,719
Could it be that Li Youtian

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,759
and deceived Feng Qi

54
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,520
totally different meanings.

55
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,360
And then select a few words to cut out

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,000
to frame Feng Qi?

57
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,439
I will explain it.

58
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,039
You write it.

59
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,199
To guarantee Li Youtian's personal safety

60
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,560
after he arrives in Shanghai.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,919
I promise to help Li Youtian

62
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,199
the Three-yellow Chicken of The Hongxiang Story.

63
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,719
Red bean paste of Fu Yun Zhai

64
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,120
for the travel expenses.

65
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,560
And food.

66
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,080
You read too many detective stories.

67
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,919
Who would have thought so much

68
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,719
and frame him?

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,319
That makes sense.

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,240
It's Feng Qi anyway.

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
She deserves to be unlucky.

72
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,719
Right.

73
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,639
Come on.

74
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,360
I really don't know you well.

75
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,319
They said you're a traitor who muddles along.

76
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
You can be really brave sometimes.

77
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,240
Not only with courage, but also with ideas.

78
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,120
I don't know what exactly

79
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,639
what on earth

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
my belief.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,199
That is...

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,040
My beloved...

83
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,040
And what I'm passionate about.

84
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,439
What do you love?

85
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,680
Money,

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
and home.

87
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,079
Come on. Let's go home.

88
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Luo, you wanted to see me?

89
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Come here.

90
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,079
What is this smell?

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,720
Zhao An was here.

92
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,240
Really?

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,639
He's in charge of raising horses now.

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,560
That's why...

95
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,959
It smells of horse dung.

96
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,680
That's heavy.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,560
You're still in the mood for painting?

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Because of the horse manure smell?

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,000
I got the inspiration.

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,639
Look at the map of a horse.

101
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,680
This is abnormal!

102
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,319
Why are you here?

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
The handover work.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
His work in the Trading Group 3

105
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,560
The job is mine now.

106
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,240
You're responsible for a part of it.

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,079
Then what?

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,240
What about the General Affairs Section?

109
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,319
Do it as you're the Chief of General Services.

110
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,079
He's just temporarily transferring the work to me.

111
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,480
But I really hate the word temporary.

112
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,839
Do you understand

113
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,120
got it.

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,839
What about you?

115
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,560
I'll double your salary.

116
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,360
As for the extra money

117
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
It depends on your own ability.

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,639
Where are Zhao An's people?

119
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,199
Have been sidelined.

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,120
I've given everything I can to Dasao.

121
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,160
You finally made the difference!

122
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,879
As your brother,

123
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,519
to have some soup.

124
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,959
I got you a car.

125
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,519
I'll take your wife to work.

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,240
No, I have a motorcycle.

127
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,120
Take this.

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,360
Thank you, brother.

129
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,279
By the way, I want to ask you something.

130
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,800
Did Zuo Shuangtao come by train?

131
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,399
What do you mean?

132
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,120
Old Luo.

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
Look at yourself.

134
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,120
Feng Qi kidnapped Mu Cun,

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,199
It's a serious matter.

136
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
I have to write the examination report

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,439
stating the doubt.

138
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,199
Otherwise,

139
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,079
can you understand me?

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,800
I asked her last night.

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
She said there was a man who liked her

142
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,199
there was a man who liked her

143
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
he knew she was studying in Nanjing,

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,079
so I bought her a perfume satchel in brocade.

145
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,800
Although she didn't like the man,

146
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,160
she liked this perfume satchel very much.

147
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,319
So it was kept.

148
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,759
That's it?

149
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,319
When Zhao An asked her the question,

150
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,079
why didn't she tell us honestly?

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
She was afraid that I would know it.

152
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,519
If I knew it, I'd be anxious.

153
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,759
That's why she said she bought it at the railway station.

154
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,279
I didn't expect it to be such a big deal.

155
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,399
Will you believe it?

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,040
Will you believe

157
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,399
If I tell you she didn't like that man, will you believe it?

158
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,519
I will.

159
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,720
You believe it?

160
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,439
You doubted it.

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
In this day and age,

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,319
women can be wild.

163
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,120
About women's wild behavior.

164
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
Anyway, I won't believe

165
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,639
I won't believe it.

166
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,399
I trust my wife anyway.

167
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,959
I've been practicing these two swords for decades.

168
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,079
I've never killed a nobody.

169
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,959
What a surprise!

170
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,879
Would use it to cut grass and feed horses.

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,839
How can I

172
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
how can I accept humiliation here?

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
The God wants me dead.

174
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,199
I'll be against the God.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,879
Thank you for your hard work.

176
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,439
You want to die?

177
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,639
What are you doing?

178
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,480
Captain!

179
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,399
What's up

180
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,199
the horse is too hot-tempered.

181
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,120
His foot kicked me in the ass.

182
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,199
He kicked you?

183
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,519
How...

184
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,840
You're so stupid.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,240
What can you do?

186
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,279
I will do it.

187
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,759
Be careful.

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,919
Brother, what's wrong?

189
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,039
Brother. You...

190
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,360
Why are you so careless?

191
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,600
Scram!

192
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,679
Easy for you to say.

193
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,720
Clean the horses' bodies if you can.

194
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,639
I will go then.

195
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,639
Watch this.

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Hold on!

197
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Put the knife down.

198
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
If the horse

199
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,960
loses a hair,

200
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,559
I will take it!

201
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,039
I'll take your life.

202
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,600
Watch this.

203
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,080
Captain!

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,840
Don't let him show off.

205
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,799
Have some water.

206
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,039
When he comes out,

207
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,759
where did you kick?

208
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,279
You kicked him?

209
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,480
Where did you kick?

210
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,559
Don't hold it!

211
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,159
What a good horse.

212
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,879
That's a good horse.

213
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,960
Does his horse become stupid because of the kick?

214
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,480
He kicked me in the head.

215
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
Little Pea.

216
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,679
Little Pea?

217
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,879
That's my name for it.

218
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,720
Is it useful?

219
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,759
Kimura named it Takeda Nobuxuan.

220
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,120
Your name is Little Bean?

221
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
Soybean.

222
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,080
Brother.

223
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,039
You call it Songxuan Takeda?

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,399
Let's see if it responds.

225
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,440
Nobuxuan Takeda.

226
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,120
Little Pea!

227
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
I won't fight.

228
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,879
Since horses are so good to you,

229
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,120
from today on,

230
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,240
bathe the horses.

231
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,879
Alright?

232
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,679
It won't be a problem.

233
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,159
The tree trunk.

234
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,879
We have

235
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
a new mission.

236
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:42,840
Team Leader,

237
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,559
we have a new mission?

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Transporting feed.

239
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,080
This is interesting.

240
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,000
Ten little Indians

241
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
one will choke to death, then nine will remain.

242
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,600
♫ Nine little Indians sleep on one end ♫

243
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,720
One wakes up, and then eight.

244
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,440
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhu.

245
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,639
Hello

246
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,600
please tell me

247
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,159
you have important information for me?

248
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,720
Here's the thing.

249
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,200
I studied banknote printing technology

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
at Morgan Bank in the US.

251
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,480
One of my colleagues is a bronze carver.

252
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,799
Then we returned home together.

253
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,559
Three months ago,

254
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,240
he gave me a call

255
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,879
he said

256
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,480
he suspected that he was being followed.

257
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
We lost contact after that.

258
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,519
Until recently,

259
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,399
one day he suddenly found me.

260
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
He said that he was kidnapped

261
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,799
he was imprisoned in an underground factory

262
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
and he was forced to work in counterfeiting

263
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,919
later, he had acute appendicitis

264
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,720
and was sent to the hospital.

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,799
So he had a chance to escape.

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
He asked me to help him out of Shanghai

267
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,000
he warned me that

268
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,159
those people were also trying to find me.

269
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
They want me to strengthen my guard.

270
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,919
I've bought a ticket for him.

271
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
When he got home,

272
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,919
he was gone.

273
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,200
My home was in a mess.

274
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,519
Obviously,

275
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,399
that group found him again

276
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
and took him away.

277
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,919
After that, I found I was being followed

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
I was almost kidnapped.

279
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,519
And moved to French Concession.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,279
Do you know who

281
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,080
who caught him?

282
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,559
He was a special agent of the Military Division of Japan's Army Division.

283
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Where is the underground factory?

284
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,960
I don't know.

285
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,399
He said he was kidnapped

286
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,759
and on the way to the hospital

287
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,960
on the way to the hospital,

288
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,080
that he drove around deliberately

289
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,919
he couldn't tell how near it was,

290
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,200
all he knows is that it's underground.

291
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
And never gets to see sunlight.

292
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,320
Work, food and shelter

293
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
It's all there.

294
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
How many people are there?

295
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,279
Dozens of them.

296
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,679
Some are engaged in printing,

297
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,120
or plate-making,

298
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,000
or copper carving,

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,679
about bronze sculpture

300
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,320
they are also well-equipped.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Most of these people were kidnapped.

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,399
As long as they didn't cooperate from work

303
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,080
or incompetent at work,

304
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,480
they will be executed.

305
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,440
He witnessed three people being executed on the spot.

306
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,639
Actually, that colleague

307
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
knows a little Japanese.

308
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,799
Once, he eavesdropped on their conversation.

309
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,759
He said the counterfeit operation

310
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,799
was called Plan Shan.

311
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,759
Plan Shan?

312
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
I heard that in addition to the legal coins,

313
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,159
the Japanese are still trying to forge

314
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,919
the Chinese Communists are using the Border Region.

315
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,600
When counterfeiting currency is widespread,

316
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,240
the Chongqing government's economy

317
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,559
will be severely affected,

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,799
even the people in the districts under the Kuomintang's control

319
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,080
will also make their lives worse.

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
This is strange.

321
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,559
Why doesn't it play two tricks?

322
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
They are good friends.

323
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,120
Captain Zhao.

324
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,480
Does it still hurt?

325
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,200
I give you a kick. Try it.

326
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,320
Brother.

327
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,879
Don't shoot, Brother!

328
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
Turn around.

329
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,519
Don't shoot, brother.

330
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:52,919
What are you doing?

331
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't talk. It's fine.

332
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,240
Brother.

333
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,159
Calm down, brother.

334
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Stop!

335
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,799
Who are you?

336
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:05,960
We are...

337
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,200
We are from the horse farm.

338
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,120
To pull the feed.

339
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,720
Why did he call you Captain Zhao?

340
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,559
The farm has several teams.

341
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,120
I'm the leader of the feed team.

342
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,720
Continue your work.

343
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,519
Is not allowed to tell me

344
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,000
don't tell me they're here.

345
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,759
Yes

346
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,120
we are here to do business. Don't worry.

347
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,720
Brother.

348
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,519
Have you seen a woman with injuries

349
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,840
In a brown coat?

350
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,639
Not really.

351
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
We've been working.

352
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,240
And didn't see anyone passing by.

353
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,399
Thanks.

354
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,320
Brother.

355
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,519
You betrayed me.

356
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,519
I didn't do that.

357
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,919
I said I didn't see anyone here.

358
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,680
Shoot!

359
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,160
Put the gun down!

360
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,960
Put the gun down!

361
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,640
Put it down!

362
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,880
Has been chasing me for more than half a month.

363
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,920
Was almost killed by you

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
was almost killed by you.

365
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,799
You traitor.

366
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,319
All of you

367
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,200
are too soft-hearted.

368
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,240
Can't achieve great things.

369
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,240
Shoot now.

370
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
And kill me.

371
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,359
You won't be able to escape.

372
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,279
Who are they?

373
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,200
Anti-Japanese elements.

374
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,880
Should we arrest them?

375
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,119
You're hurt, brother.

376
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,519
Sorry.

377
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,200
Brother.

378
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,039
I almost got you involved.

379
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,759
We are fine.

380
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,440
You're heavily wounded.

381
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,920
And it's still bleeding.

382
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,160
The bullet is still inside.

383
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,480
We need to go to the hospital.

384
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,640
I can't go to the hospital.

385
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,400
Are you from Chongqing or Yan'an?

386
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,759
I'm only a Chinese.

387
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,599
I asked too much.

388
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,039
We are also Chinese.

389
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,200
The tree trunk.

390
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,039
Isn't your cousin in a private clinic?

391
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:56,920
Right.

392
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,440
My cousin has great medical skills.

393
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,960
To help you get the bullet out.

394
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,599
That's right

395
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,119
don't bother.

396
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,359
Hurry and get the stool!

397
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,160
Brother!

398
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,400
Hurry up!

399
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,359
Sit down!

400
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,839
You saved us.

401
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,359
We should repay your kindness.

402
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,839
You are severely injured.

403
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,279
You'd be dead if you didn't get the surgery.

404
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,200
Really?

405
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:20,880
Far away?

406
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,200
It's not far.

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
But I should have told my cousin first.

408
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,079
I think so.

409
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,400
Go to your cousin's place

410
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
ask him to send the other patients away first.

411
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,799
Brother, what's your name?

412
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,720
Call me Old Tian.

413
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,680
Brother Tian.

414
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,039
You call me Zhao?

415
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,119
He is called Trunk.

416
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,759
You're stuck here.

417
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,880
Take my scooter.

418
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,359
I'll pull you slowly there.

419
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:42,720
The tree trunk.

420
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,960
Go there now

421
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,920
go to your brother's

422
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,599
and be ready to welcome us.

423
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,240
Alright?

424
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,200
Brother Tian.

425
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,640
Believe me.

426
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,079
But,

427
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,480
who loves him more than I do?

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
How long have you been together?

429
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,000
Do you love him very much?

430
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,759
Miss Cold Dew.

431
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,119
You

432
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,079
but didn't you already

433
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,559
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,160
I shouldn't show up this way.

435
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,640
No, it's not.

436
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,519
I'm the one who should apologize.

437
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,640
I'm glad that Mr. Yamashita is still alive.

438
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,000
But I was so rude

439
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,559
I was so impolite.

440
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,559
Do you know that

441
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,519
when people are dying,

442
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,000
they could see themselves out of their bodies.

443
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,359
In that moment,

444
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,319
I truly saw myself.

445
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,599
If I can survive,

446
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
I will make a fresh start.

447
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,640
My life will never

448
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,119
you must have been hurt badly.

449
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,960
Two-thirds of my lung was removed.

450
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,279
Can't be a soldier anymore.

451
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,759
Mr. Yamashita is working at

452
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm just an ordinary businessman now.

453
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,119
I love movies.

454
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,880
I made this movie

455
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,119
Is the first movie I invested in.

456
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,519
With Miss Han Lu in the team.

457
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,759
I believe that

458
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,920
will be a big success.

459
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,680
So you invested in this film.

460
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,160
No wonder a star like Yang Liu

461
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,240
celebrity like Chen Juanjuan

462
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,240
like Chen Juan Juan.

463
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,640
Compared with Miss Han Lu,

464
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,000
they are only suitable to play bit roles.

465
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,920
Not at all.

466
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,480
My career has stagnated for most of the time.

467
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,359
The audience almost forgot about me.

468
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,279
But I will never

469
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,240
I'll never forget you.

470
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,799
By the way,

471
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,920
mr. Yamashita.

472
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,960
Mr. Yamashita,

473
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,920
I'm sure you know

474
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,880
that my heart already has someone.

475
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,599
Do you mean that

476
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,440
mr. Jiang?

477
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,599
Although what I did

478
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,480
was an improper act,

479
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,279
but I really can't bear

480
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,319
to see Ms. Han Lu

481
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,599
be cheated

482
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,359
and disappointed.

483
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,759
I believe that tomorrow's drama

484
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,480
will be more exciting.

485
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,680
Then...

486
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,720
I'll leave now.

487
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,039
How's the injury?

488
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,920
Luckily, the artery isn't hurt.

489
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,799
We'll schedule the surgery ASAP.

490
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,640
Alright.

491
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,839
Brother Tian.

492
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,319
Dr. Han is here.

493
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:41,839
Don't worry.

494
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,720
Everything?

495
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,480
I have. Don't worry.

496
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,559
Dr. Han is our informant.

497
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,480
Absolutely reliable.

498
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:11,960
Captain,

499
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,279
who exactly is Tian?

500
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,359
The Communist Party of China

501
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,000
how did you know?

502
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
Do you remember the guy in the coffee coat?

503
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,839
And told Tian

504
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,720
he was almost killed by Tian

505
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,519
they were almost killed by Tian.

506
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,920
Maybe they came from Yan'an.

507
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,119
The Ping-Han Railway is a must-pass route.

508
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,759
That makes sense.

509
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,559
Tian said Coffee Coat is a traitor.

510
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,599
What's going on?

511
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,799
I guess he's trying to eliminate traitors in the CCP.

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,160
We hunted him all the way here.

513
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,079
Then why don't we arrest him

514
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,480
arrest him?

515
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,839
Do you need to use your brain?

516
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,599
The CCP has a very hidden transportation line in Shanghai.

517
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,480
Tian is injured.

518
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,160
He let the traitor escape again.

519
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,119
He'll definitely contact their people.

520
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,079
We must not alert them

521
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,799
to set traps

522
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,759
to capture the tiger and the dragon.

523
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,000
Got it.

524
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,839
Come on.

525
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:10,839
Captain.

526
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,440
Slow down.

527
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,680
This man is called Magpie.

528
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,119
He's one of our sleeper in Yan'an.

529
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,119
He arrived in Shanghai recently

530
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,000
but he's gone missing.

531
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,200
I need to find him.

532
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,480
Why did we place undercover agents

533
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,759
In Yan'an?

534
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Don't ask so many questions.

535
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
Ask nothing.

536
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
There must be a lot of conspiracy.

537
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,480
What did you say

538
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,000
nothing.

539
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,039
There's more.

540
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,519
There's only one clue.

541
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,799
He has a lover in Shanghai

542
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,720
whose name is Cai Hongling

543
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,119
she's a dancer from Xianle Ballroom.

544
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,839
You have to find a way to approach her.

545
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,599
Why are you looking for a magpie?

546
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,240
He has something important in his hand.

547
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,039
What's that

548
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,039
hello?

549
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,799
Mr. Chen.

550
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,000
Hello

551
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,920
miss Cold Dew.

552
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,680
Miss Han Lu.

553
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,440
I called to ask if Mr. Chen

554
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,759
If Mr. Chen is free tomorrow morning.

555
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,039
He should be.

556
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,079
What is it?

557
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,240
I have something

558
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,519
for your help.

559
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
Is it about the Fans Association again?

560
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,200
Pretty much.

561
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,920
Alright.

562
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,640
Where should we meet then?

563
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,480
How about you come to my house?

564
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,319
To Ms. Han Lu's house?

565
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,559
For Miss Han Lu's house?

566
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,599
I can't explain it to my wife.

567
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,319
I'm so relieved

568
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,920
If you're here.

569
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,440
I don't want

570
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,759
I don't want those I hate to do.

571
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,920
Your voice

572
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,440
sounds a little hoarse.

573
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
Maybe he's been too tired recently.

574
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,839
That's a deal.

575
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,960
Tomorrow morning,

576
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,480
I will be at home.

577
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,039
Alright.

578
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:26,920
Be there or be square.

579
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,720
I don't want

580
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,240
I don't want those I hate to do.

581
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,680
I'll be at home

582
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,319
I will be at home...

583
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,440
Why did she say that?

584
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,480
Miss Cold Dew?

585
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,960
Miss Cold Dew.

586
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:51,759
I am off work

587
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,920
don't you know that I'm with No.76?

588
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,920
And said to me that

589
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,480
oh, right.

590
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,640
Recently,

591
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,599
do you have any suspects?

592
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,559
No one

593
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,599
we've got the valuable intel

594
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,240
the rewards can be double.

595
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
You informants are the most profitable.

596
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,880
I don't want to be a informant anymore.

597
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,240
Be an informant?

598
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,839
Is it Captain Zhao?

599
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,640
Old Tian seems suspicious.

600
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,759
What's the matter?

601
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Where is he?

602
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,279
Still upstairs.

603
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,079
Calm him down.

604
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,400
I'll be there soon.

605
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,559
Alright.

606
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,880
Hold on.

607
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,599
Inform the Military Police.

608
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,680
Why not?

609
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,400
It's none of your business.

610
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,880
I asked you to inform the military police.

611
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:01,960
Yes

612
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,599
old Tian!

613
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,599
Old Tian!

614
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,079
Old Tian!

615
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,400
Who's that?

616
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,519
High Fang.

617
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,279
High Fang.

618
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,000
It's late. What's up?

619
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,799
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

620
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,759
To say goodbye.

621
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,880
Come in.

622
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,039
You've been here before?

623
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,480
It's my first time here.

624
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,880
You want to ask me

625
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,400
know you live here?

626
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,720
I didn't know until you were here

627
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:47,759
where is Chen Jia Ping?

628
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,000
Not at home?

629
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:49,960
Working overtime?

630
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,920
She's coming back.

631
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,640
Sit down.

632
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,880
We don't have ground coffee at home.

633
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,160
I'll bring you some tea.

634
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,119
No need.

635
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,960
I'll leave after I talk to you a few words.

636
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm leaving Taihe Trading Firm.

637
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,039
Why?

638
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,039
In Shanghai,

639
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,519
there was a reclusive English communications specialist

640
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,200
named Eisen Mayer.

641
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,319
I paid him a visit some time ago.

642
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,519
He admired me.

643
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,319
And he promised

644
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,319
he would take me as his student

645
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,640
he'll be my student.

646
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,160
The salary is very good.

647
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,559
I'm quite interested in it.

648
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,880
But you can't leave our firm

649
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,319
to leave our firm as you wish.

650
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,559
I submitted the application.

651
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,839
I wanted to go back to take care of my sick grandma.

652
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,720
And I purposely made myself unproductive

653
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,119
In my recent work

654
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,240
and frequently make mistakes,

655
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,000
they probably think I'm useless

656
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,039
that I'm useless.

657
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,839
That's the only reason

658
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,400
for that reason?

659
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
It's not my job

660
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,799
It shouldn't be that easy.

661
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,599
But you know

662
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,480
when someone leaves,

663
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,680
who can stay?

664
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,240
And I've decorated a lot of houses

665
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,279
and got some blood.

666
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,440
These days,

667
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,279
to do without money.

668
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Actually,

669
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,680
I didn't think that place suited you.

670
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,200
It's great.

671
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,680
To learn from the British experts.

672
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,680
I'm happy for you.

673
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,759
And look forward to seeing a better you.

674
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,720
Thank you.

675
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,640
How about

676
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,519
I'll be your brother.

677
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,799
Alright.

678
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,920
Who wouldn't love

679
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,720
who wouldn't?

680
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,200
Alright.

681
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,559
That's a deal.

682
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
Sister, I'm leaving.

683
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,400
How can I contact you later?

684
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,599
Don't worry.

685
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,720
I won't go too far.

686
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,559
I still have to protect you.

687
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
By the way, Ats,

688
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,239
that's it.

689
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,159
Search this place!

690
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,719
The military police?

691
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,679
He called the military police.

692
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
You killed their people?

693
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,159
They'll never forgive you.

694
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,119
Leave now!

695
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:08,760
Leave me alone.

696
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,599
Brother Tian.

697
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,159
I brought you here.

698
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,400
It almost cost your life.

699
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,760
If I leave on my own,

700
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,199
am I still a Chinese?

701
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:15,920
Come on.

702
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,639
Search this place.

703
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,039
Leave the scene to other departments to investigate.

704
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:40,840
Come on.

705
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,559
Brother Tian.

706
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,719
Come stay at my place tonight.

707
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,599
No, I won't.

708
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
I can't involve you in this anymore.

709
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,800
I know you won't believe me

710
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,360
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

711
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm just worried.

712
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,119
You're very weak now.

713
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,199
You're familiar with the place.

714
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,119
Can you help me find an inn

715
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,400
to stay here?

716
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,199
Alright.

717
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,199
Jia Ping.

718
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,639
You're finally awake.

719
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,239
Did you stay here with me for the whole night?

720
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
I was thinking,

721
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,679
what if you wake up and

722
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,519
there's no one there,

723
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,360
In this empty room.

724
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,960
Then I really don't know

725
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,239
If it's heaven or earth.

726
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I wish this place is heaven,

727
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,840
but I don't want you here.

728
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,800
Don't you think

729
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,719
whether it's me

730
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,039
or you,

731
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,320
shouldn't be here?

732
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,079
You must think I'm a fool, right?

733
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,239
To be honest,

734
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,079
there are many hurdles in life,

735
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,679
some are hard to overcome.

736
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,039
But you have overcome it

737
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,960
In this way.

738
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,960
Is a little tragic,

739
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,920
but it's worth it.

740
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,719
Go back now.

741
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,519
If the man I love abandons me,

742
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,559
but stays with another woman outside all night,

743
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,519
I'm going to kill him!

744
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,639
Do you think she'll never do that?

745
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,320
You may say that,

746
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,199
I know you love each other.

747
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,760
I really envy you.

748
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,760
It's so quiet now.

749
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,760
It's like the silence before the war broke out.

750
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Next,

751
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,880
I'll be facing the reporters coming in all directions.

752
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,239
Who won't blame me for anything.

753
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,239
The producer,

754
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,360
the studio boss

755
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,599
when I think about all these,

756
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,039
I'd rather stay here

757
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,239
then...

758
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,320
Think about one more thing.

759
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,679
I have to face my lovely wife

760
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,360
I have a feeling that you will be fine.

761
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,960
Go back.

762
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,880
I won't do another stupid thing.

763
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,679
Captain Zhao.

764
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,960
As you expected,

765
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,079
old Tian changed another hotel early in the morning

766
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,480
how are you tracking her?

767
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,119
Yes, he has.

768
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,719
He transferred to the Hotel Changlai which is three blocks away.

769
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,039
Captain

770
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,760
why doesn't he trust you even though

771
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,679
why doesn't he trust you?

772
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,320
I didn't save him to make him believe in me.

773
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,920
Even if he did,

774
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,760
he won't reveal where he's hiding.

775
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,079
I know the Chinese Communists well.

776
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,119
He's very cunning.

777
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,519
Why did we save him then?

778
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,480
Track down sb. by following clues

779
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,800
now Dr. Han is dead.

780
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,679
The clues about him are gone.

781
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,159
He will think the danger is over

782
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,400
and make a move when the opportunity comes.

783
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,000
I'll get people to

784
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,559
to follow him all the time

785
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,639
remember that

786
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,159
follow him.

787
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,480
We must change a man every half hour.

788
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,719
Don't repeat.

789
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:58,840
Got it.

790
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,320
After my observation and research in the past two days,

791
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,519
I found that little beans can't eat leguminous grass.

792
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,800
Look at the poop.

793
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,199
Severe indigestion.

794
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,719
I know Little Doudou well.

795
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,559
You'll be bored

796
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,800
you will be in a bad mood.

797
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,440
When you're in a bad mood, your life isn't beautiful.

798
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,480
It seems we should eat alfalfa grass.

799
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,239
You really use yourself as your groom?

800
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,199
I love one line of work.

801
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,840
You know nothing.

802
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,440
Captain!

803
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,360
Captain!

804
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,119
How is it?

805
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,480
There's some progress.

806
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,199
Old Tian went to the newspaper office.

807
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,280
For what?

808
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,039
A missing person article.

809
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,599
(The age of 37)

810
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,599
Thirty-seven years old.

811
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,280
It's a secret code for them to contact each other.

812
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,280
Right.

813
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,880
But we can't read it.

814
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:18,800
It's okay if they don't understand.

815
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,159
That means Tian

816
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,000
get in touch with his people.

817
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:23,840
That's good.

818
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,360
I need two clothes for him.

819
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,840
I'll personally follow them tomorrow.

820
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:28,639
Yes

821
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,760
brother. Brother.

822
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,960
I heard you talking about farmland.

823
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,079
If we can let Little Pea spread joy in the field,

824
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:35,840
to run a few steps,

825
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,920
I believe there must be a lot of benefits.

826
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,519
Scram.

827
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:13,559
Mister.

828
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,199
Is there a fire?

829
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
What is your cigarette?

830
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:27,960
Old Blade.

831
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,079
Made in Britain.

832
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,159
This lighter is...

833
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,760
Lanson diesel lighter.

834
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,960
It's made by the USA.

835
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,360
Nice to meet you.

836
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,679
Hello

837
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Hello
WEBVTT
