1
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:41,250
The money you demand.

2
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,991
In exchange for Bonita’s freedom for good.

3
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,427
A house and land as you requested.

4
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:49,242
All current debts paid in full.

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,362
Queen?!

6
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,401
This is the first time…

7
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:54,000
Queen!

8
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:54,979
Look at her.

9
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:57,881
You’re dragging her down.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,559
You’ve turned Queen…

11
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:00,988
into someone she’s not.

12
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,776
If you really love money…

13
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,479
I’ll buy you back to me.

14
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,738
No matter how much you pay…

15
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:09,632
I don’t want to force myself to do something I don’t want to.

16
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:12,527
And I don’t want to be with someone I don’t love.

17
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,635
I won it all.

18
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:20,648
Just take it!

19
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,875
Take this, so you can get a ride home.

20
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,678
No need.

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,613
I still have plenty of money.

22
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,147
My daughter’s girlfriend is rich.

23
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:34,083
I’ll never run out of cash.

24
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,148
I’ll go get more at home first.

25
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,584
I’ll come back for sure.

26
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,360
What are you staring at?

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,673
Just wait until I get back.

28
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,063
You should get some rest, Queen.

29
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,520
It’s okay.

30
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,629
I’m good.

31
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:45,593
But right now, you’re pushing yourself too hard.

32
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,478
The meeting is tomorrow.

33
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,027
I can’t lose.

34
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you know that…

35
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:56,807
you’re not in this alone, Queen?

36
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:07,144
So she’s looking for a new dorm.

37
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,223
If I tell Queen…

38
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,452
I’m so dead.

39
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,573
I’d like to propose a new site.

40
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:13,214
It’s located near the planned Skytrain line, scheduled for completion in 5 years.

41
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:15,709
If the project proceeds as planned…

42
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:20,821
Its overall potential will surpass the current site in the slum area.

43
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:25,414
The average return will also be nearly 30% higher.

44
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,483
I’m sorry to interrupt, Keeraphat.

45
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,473
But the site you’re proposing…

46
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:33,184
The Skytrain hasn’t even been constructed yet.

47
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,334
And it’s still uncertain whether the construction will actually happen.

48
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,124
Isn’t that too risky for our project?

49
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,368
But I have additional data for the project…

50
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:45,845
The details and also…

51
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:46,867
And also what?

52
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,022
We already discussed this in the last meeting.

53
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,810
I only asked for some time for the board to review the information.

54
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:57,756
But if everyone is interested in this new proposal…

55
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,867
We can vote on it right now.

56
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,257
So we won’t waste any more time.

57
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,150
Of course.

58
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,635
If that’s the case…

59
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,464
Let’s proceed with a secret ballot.

60
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:23,508
Hold on.

61
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,615
I think we should just raise our hands to vote.

62
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:29,602
So we’ll know who agrees…

63
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,418
And who disagrees with Keeraphat.

64
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,607
Then we’ll go with Songpol’s suggestion.

65
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:43,144
If anyone agrees with changing to the new site…

66
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,320
Please raise your hand.

67
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:31,166
Pim.

68
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,449
Why did Songpol call us here?

69
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,038
Please wait for a moment.

70
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:37,718
Hold on.

71
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,824
What’s going on here?

72
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,628
I have all the evidence of Songpol’s corporate fraud.

73
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,671
Anyone who supports him…

74
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,114
will be considered an accomplice.

75
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:57,037
I’m simply here to inform you.

76
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:05,557
What is this?!

77
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:08,987
What is this?!

78
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:10,695
Our names are on it!

79
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:38,338
What is going on here?!

80
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:40,781
What are you all doing?!

81
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:45,806
Please excuse me.

82
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:48,207
The company’s investigation team is here.

83
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:49,821
Songpol.

84
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:53,039
We need to investigate possible misconduct involving you.

85
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,584
What are you talking about?!

86
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,893
Do you even have any evidence?!

87
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:58,881
Please cooperate with our further investigation.

88
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,262
This way, please.

89
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:05,539
Don’t you think this fake evidence can do anything to me!

90
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:09,016
Excuse us.

91
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,209
This way, please.

92
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,605
Let go!

93
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,034
Do you know who I am?!

94
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,398
I said let go!

95
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,025
This might be my last project…

96
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,855
as a businesswoman.

97
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:29,879
Because after this, I’m entering politics.

98
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,946
But as long as I remain the president…

99
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:36,296
I will make sure everything is done transparently…

100
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:38,525
and with clarity.

101
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,322
This meeting is concluded.

102
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:14,997
Give it to me!

103
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:16,345
It’s mine!

104
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:17,454
Give it!

105
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,637
It’s mine!

106
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,599
Where are you taking it?!

107
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:23,802
My boss sent me to take the money back.

108
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,227
If you want it back…

109
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,589
Go talk to my boss yourself.

110
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:31,947
Here!

111
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,813
I’m leaving you.

112
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:06,335
And now that I’ve got what I wanted…

113
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,517
You’re no use to me anymore.

114
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,601
No matter how much you pay…

115
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,226
I don’t want to force myself to do something I don’t want to.

116
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,599
And I don’t want to be with someone I don’t love.

117
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,432
(See you at the club tonight!)

118
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,118
(Mom)

119
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:41,501
Queen.

120
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,377
Who told you to come here?

121
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,353
I’m sorry.

122
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:52,345
No one did.

123
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:54,929
I came on my own.

124
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,490
In case you wanted to know…

125
00:14:58,853 --> 00:14:59,626
How’s Babe doing…

126
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,528
What she’s up to…

127
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:01,274
Where she is…

128
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:01,907
And if she’s safe.

129
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:02,889
I don’t want to know.

130
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,000
Queen.

131
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,314
I was going to tell you that…

132
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:09,586
Babe’s looking for a new dorm right now.

133
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:10,405
Where?

134
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:14,423
Thought you said you didn’t care.

135
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,265
I don’t.

136
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,672
Please don’t refuse it, Queen.

137
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:26,832
Just admit you want to know.

138
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:35,686
I’m sorry.

139
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:08,976
Here you go, Bie.

140
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:10,023
This one’s for Queen.

141
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:48,945
Queen.

142
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:52,730
I know how much you want to know about Babe.

143
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,490
For me doing this…

144
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:56,786
I should even get an extra bonus.

145
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:06,960
Queen.

146
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,785
I’m being serious.

147
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,055
Babe isn’t safe right now.

148
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,304
I think I should…

149
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,491
If I didn’t tell you to do anything, then don’t.

150
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:16,755
But…

151
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,219
(Bo!)

152
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:21,107
(Come out here right now, Bo!)

153
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:22,678
(Bo!)

154
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,595
Come out here right now!

155
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,824
Go get Bo and Queen to come talk to me!

156
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,524
Please, I must ask you to leave.

157
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:36,202
I’m not leaving!

158
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:38,714
Go get those two to come out and talk to me now!

159
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:40,930
Hurry!

160
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,882
There she is.

161
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,232
May I ask what this is about?

162
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:48,974
You even dare to ask me that?!

163
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,646
You sent someone to take my money back.

164
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,775
Bonita isn’t here.

165
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,800
You dumped her already?!

166
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,655
Serves that ungrateful daughter right!

167
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,547
How’s that?!

168
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:05,396
Ran off to live with the rich.

169
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:07,135
And ended up getting dumped.

170
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:08,843
That’s karma for her.

171
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:11,568
Whatever! I already sold her to you.

172
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:14,160
I don’t care where she ends up.

173
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,075
It’s none of my business.

174
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,135
Give me back my money.

175
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,020
But when you signed the contract...

176
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,486
Queen paid everything exactly as stated in the document.

177
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:24,239
Before you accuse me…

178
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,615
You should have enough evidence.

179
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:29,242
I’m not someone who breaks her word.

180
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:32,693
Please follow the terms you signed in the contract.

181
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,330
Here’s the evidence you wanted.

182
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:38,083
You sent your guy to take my money back.

183
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,923
Then told me that if I wanted it back…

184
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,447
I had to come to this address.

185
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,507
Here I am!

186
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:43,516
Give me my money!

187
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,125
I’m not someone who breaks her word.

188
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,728
Where do you think you’re going?!

189
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:58,935
So you lied?! You said you’d give me money!

190
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:00,196
Queen!

191
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:01,737
Queen isn’t running away.

192
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:03,282
But this piece of evidence…

193
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:04,800
isn’t enough to accuse her.

194
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,633
Please, I have to ask you to leave.

195
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:15,971
What is this?!

196
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:17,870
You’re the one who took my money!

197
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,204
I’m not leaving!

198
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:21,964
Come out here, Queen!

199
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:23,413
Come out here right now!

200
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,763
I want my money back!

201
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,299
You rich people!

202
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,324
My throat’s hurting!

203
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,750
Give me my money!

204
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,436
It’s just a piece of paper.

205
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,169
Who would even do that?

206
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:42,667
There’s only one person who wants to discredit me.

207
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:49,087
Kongtup.

208
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:50,490
I knew it!

209
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:01,031
(I’m giving you one last warning.)

210
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:03,274
(Don’t even think about becoming my rival.)

211
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:07,219
I knew it.

212
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:08,401
He never quits.

213
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,152
Queen.

214
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,395
I think you shouldn’t get dragged into his game.

215
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,180
I’m actually going crazy!

216
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,762
What are you trying to say?

217
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:24,354
I heard you’ll be campaigning in the community tomorrow.

218
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:27,187
I just wanted to cheer you on.

219
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,994
Wish you the best of luck, Queen.

220
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,700
If you’re thinking of playing dirty…

221
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,211
Don’t think you can do anything to me.

222
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,535
We’re not in the same league.

223
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,904
You should think carefully, Queen.

224
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,932
About who’s really the one…

225
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:44,933
Holding the upper hand right now.

226
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:02,033
King.

227
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:03,685
We’re in big trouble again.

228
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,857
Are you okay, Dad?

229
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:29,917
It’s Wasin.

230
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:32,813
He somehow found evidence that I committed fraud.

231
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:34,001
And he submitted it to the party.

232
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:39,494
What did the party say?

233
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,711
They expelled me, what else?

234
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,087
Then…

235
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,498
Did you really do it?

236
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,460
I didn’t!

237
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:49,682
You’re my son!

238
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:50,965
And you don’t even believe me!

239
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,483
Who else would?!

240
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:03,063
Wasin…

241
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:20,160
Hey, King!

242
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,296
You came all the way here…

243
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,735
Is there anything you want?

244
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,919
You really enjoy this, don’t you?

245
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,974
Messing around with everyone.

246
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:30,894
But hiding like a coward yourself.

247
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,153
You can’t just accuse me like this, King.

248
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:44,552
Do you even have any evidence…

249
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,908
that I’m behind all this?

250
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,737
Your beloved sister…

251
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,777
Brought everything on herself.

252
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,012
I didn’t even have to lift a finger.

253
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,604
Don’t push me to do this again, Kongtup.

254
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,672
Come on, King.

255
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:06,916
Do you really think…

256
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:08,998
I’d ever do anything to Queen?

257
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:19,469
My dad didn’t do it, really.

258
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:22,625
Wasin framed my dad and got him expelled from the party.

259
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:28,166
The evidence could have been fabricated.

260
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:30,301
I’m sure my dad didn’t do it.

261
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,729
Are you that sure?

262
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,495
Yes!

263
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,636
I’m sure!

264
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,857
Can you guys talk to Wasin for me?

265
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,509
What do you want me to say?

266
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:42,932
Just have your father destroy that evidence.

267
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,261
He’s not my father!

268
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:45,774
And another thing…

269
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,598
What your father did wasn’t right.

270
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:49,758
I told you my dad didn’t do it.

271
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:52,102
I was the one who sent the evidence of your father’s corruption.

272
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:54,132
You…

273
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,348
What do you mean?

274
00:27:57,504 --> 00:27:58,161
Kongtup.

275
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,163
Calm down.

276
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:03,373
I’ll have all the evidence Queen submitted…

277
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:04,463
to be re-examined.

278
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,337
They’re just dumb pieces of paper.

279
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:07,831
Why check them again?!

280
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:09,994
Just get rid of them and it’s over.

281
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,168
You’re scared the evidence might be true.

282
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:14,222
And your father will turn out to be a crook, right?!

283
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:14,977
Queen!

284
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:16,143
Kongtup!

285
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:17,457
I told you to calm down!

286
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,594
The evidence you found…

287
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,355
You don’t even know if it’s real.

288
00:28:21,355 --> 00:28:22,170
Fine!

289
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,138
I’ll have the documents checked again.

290
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,095
If it turns out to be true…

291
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,414
Will you admit that your father…

292
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:27,979
Queen!

293
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:28,814
Stop it now!

294
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:29,905
Calm down right now, Kongtup!

295
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,445
Did you frame my father, Queen?!

296
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:33,756
Kongtup, I told you to calm down!

297
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,725
Kongtup…

298
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:43,150
How many times do you want me to check the documents…

299
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,349
If someone’s guilty…

300
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,557
They’re guilty.

301
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,659
Queen.

302
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:58,299
You two remember this.

303
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,219
I will destroy your lives…

304
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,932
Just like you did to me.

305
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,125
Don’t even think about it.

306
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:23,946
You don’t have to worry, King.

307
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,967
Isn’t your sister so talented?

308
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:29,317
What could I even do to her?

309
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,302
She won’t die because of me.

310
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:13,348
Have you seen the news, Queen?

311
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,824
I just gave my statement to the police.

312
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,300
The footage shows me at the scene.

313
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:23,536
Right now, the police are still investigating the case further.

314
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,068
How did you end up in that clip?

315
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:33,056
After Babe’s mother came to the university…

316
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,701
I decided to follow Babe.

317
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:36,700
And then…

318
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,353
I happened to witness the crime.

319
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,199
Since you’re a witness…

320
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,791
Just be more careful for now.

321
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,976
Are you worried about me?

322
00:30:58,444 --> 00:30:59,826
I’m just saying.

323
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:01,210
Let’s go.

324
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,085
I thought you were worried.

325
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,592
Good afternoon.

326
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:17,575
I’m Queen…

327
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:18,743
Keeraphat.

328
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:20,678
Candidate Number 1.

329
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:23,656
I’m a new candidate in this district.

330
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,269
I want to help develop our community.

331
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
I want to take care of the people…

332
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,155
To be someone everyone can rely on…

333
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:33,963
To listen to every concern.

334
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:36,714
I won’t just develop the area…

335
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,247
But I’ll also help strengthen our sense of community.

336
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,537
And we will move forward together as one.

337
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,125
Good luck, Queen!

338
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:56,555
You’ve got my support.

339
00:32:01,063 --> 00:32:02,875
Good afternoon.

340
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:04,151
I’m Kongtup…

341
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:05,254
Candidate Number 2.

342
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:08,516
Vote for my party…

343
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,395
and we will move forward together.

344
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:21,161
Thank you.

345
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,411
For being here today.

346
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,364
Thank you for supporting our party.

347
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:27,909
Vote for Number 1…

348
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
And I won’t let you down.

349
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,522
Thank you for supporting our party.

350
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:02,037
Vote for Number 1…

351
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:04,582
And I won’t let you down.

352
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:20,616
Queen!

353
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:26,123
Bo?!

354
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:35,165
Babe?!

355
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:37,104
Are you okay, Queen?

356
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:51,590
Protect Queen!

357
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:52,381
Get her out of here!

358
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:52,882
Hurry!

359
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,522
Go!

360
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:48,482
How are you feeling, Queen?

361
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:52,484
The doctor said the bullet just grazed you.

362
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:54,008
But you should stay for observation.

363
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,231
If everything’s fine, you can go home soon.

364
00:34:58,831 --> 00:34:59,715
I’m fine.

365
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:02,790
I think this time…

366
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:04,337
Kongtup has gone too far.

367
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,350
So it was one of Kongtup’s men?

368
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:09,949
I don’t think so.

369
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:12,191
When Kongtup came in…

370
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,866
I was watching him the whole time.

371
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,504
Nothing seemed off.

372
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:22,773
Then, Sam…

373
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:23,336
Yes?

374
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:25,144
Find out who’s behind this.

375
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,459
And report to me right away.

376
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,155
Yes.

377
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:39,824
King.

378
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:43,314
Is everyone else safe?

379
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,313
Everyone’s safe.

380
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:47,711
You don’t have to worry.

381
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:01,822
Are you alright, Queen?

382
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:06,558
I’m alright.

383
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,201
Then let me ask you again.

384
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,919
Is there something you want to do, Queen?

385
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:43,957
Sam.

386
00:36:43,957 --> 00:36:44,457
Yes?

387
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,205
Go back and look after Queen.

388
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,146
You don’t have to drop me off.

389
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,466
I’ll go home myself.

390
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:49,724
Yes.

391
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:02,471
Wait.

392
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:12,285
I’m sorry.

393
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:14,905
I know I broke my promise.

394
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,490
I’ll stay away from Queen.

395
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,332
If you want to go in, then go.

396
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:28,908
Sorry?

397
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:34,277
Just don’t forget what we agreed on.

398
00:38:01,903 --> 00:38:02,825
What are you doing here?

399
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:08,755
You dare to come back here?

400
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,905
I handed everything to you.

401
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:13,414
And you still blew it.

402
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,738
You think chances like that come twice?

403
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:25,348
I’m not surprised at all…

404
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:27,326
Why that girl chose Queen.

405
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:32,405
What do you mean?

406
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,861
Because you’re an idiot.

407
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,312
You really thought we could ever get near her again after this?

408
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:45,757
I guess it was wrong of me…

409
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,265
to ever let you handle it.

410
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:52,843
I know.

411
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:54,181
What you want.

412
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,948
You can’t even do something this simple!

413
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:58,212
I know

414
00:38:58,213 --> 00:38:59,835
You’re capable of doing so much more.

415
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:02,645
You just have to unleash what’s inside you.

416
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:03,983
And you…

417
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,435
will get exactly what you want.

418
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,483
You sent that clip to me...

419
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:16,217
Then you handed it over to the police.

420
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:20,923
You pushed me into killing Queen.

421
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:28,269
You set me up?

422
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:33,045
I just knew what you wanted.

423
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:35,248
I was just trying to help.

424
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:36,260
That’s all.

425
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,267
Stay out of my business!

426
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,078
Good evening, Queen.

427
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:33,674
I’m booking my girl for tonight.

428
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,109
Bie is already booked tonight.

429
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:46,189
I’ll pay double.

430
00:41:49,022 --> 00:41:50,429
Of course.

431
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:20,064
Bo…

432
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:26,632
Bo…

433
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:37,097
Bo…

434
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,722
You said you would leave my life.

435
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:16,794
Then why did you come back?

436
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:23,541
Follow the plan.

437
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,055
Tomorrow, on stage…

438
00:43:33,926 --> 00:43:35,211
Take Queen down.

439
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,987
Why did you choose to leave my life?

440
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:56,261
I’m scared.

441
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,708
I’m scared to hope.

442
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:04,252
I don’t want to aim too high…

443
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,270
It hurts when you fall.

444
00:44:14,408 --> 00:44:16,408
I’ve told you before…

445
00:44:19,445 --> 00:44:21,016
If you don’t want to get hurt…

446
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:25,808
Then hold on to it tightly.

447
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,204
Come sit here.

448
00:44:59,289 --> 00:44:59,900
Babe.

449
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:49,651
I don’t like seeing you cry.

450
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:54,055
All this time…

451
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,461
Did I ever make you feel that way?

452
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,006
I’m certain…

453
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:08,121
That I never did.

454
00:46:12,198 --> 00:46:13,074
But still…

455
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:15,841
You just have to argue with me about everything, don’t you?

456
00:46:49,698 --> 00:46:51,667
I’ve given in to you on everything…

457
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,737
I don’t give this chance to just anyone.

458
00:47:11,653 --> 00:47:13,980
Are you really going to give me another chance?

459
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:27,735
Come back and be my favorite again…

460
00:47:31,078 --> 00:47:31,852
Babe.

461
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:55,954
Are you alright, Queen?

462
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:48,910
Do you think…

463
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:51,372
a wolf and a rabbit could fall in love?

464
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:53,209
Their first test…

465
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:54,823
would be trust, wouldn’t it?

466
00:49:55,188 --> 00:49:56,064
I brought you money.

467
00:49:56,064 --> 00:49:57,318
In exchange for Bo.

468
00:49:57,987 --> 00:49:59,129
Thank you.

469
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:01,101
For always being by my side.

470
00:50:02,573 --> 00:50:03,204
Babe!
