1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:44,052
I knew you’d be here.

3
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,549
Mom’s waiting, are you ready?

4
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,831
We just came back from Dad’s funeral, King.

5
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,588
Mom didn’t even show up.

6
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,838
But she wants us to go to someone else’s birthday party?

7
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:05,007
It’s been ten years. Queen…

8
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,861
since we last lived as a whole family.

9
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:10,878
Things haven’t been the same for a long time.

10
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:17,862
At first, I thought I wouldn’t feel anything about all of this.

11
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:25,901
But honestly, I just couldn’t help it.

12
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,322
Well, there’s nothing strange about it.

13
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,322
He’s still our father, after all.

14
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,911
It’s time, Queen.

15
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,911
At least let Mom see you there.

16
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:38,696
Happy birthday.

17
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,696
Happy birthday, Wasin.

18
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,085
Thank you, Poom.

19
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,397
Thank you, Sakda.

20
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:48,336
Hmm, I’ve just heard the news about your son, Sakda.

21
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:50,967
Your son will be running in the next election, right?

22
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:53,848
That’s great! Best of luck to him.

23
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,762
Thank you, Wasin.

24
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,762
Word really does get around fast.

25
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,733
And what about your district?

26
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,526
As party leader, have you considered anyone yet?

27
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:10,379
Nowadays, everyone’s after fresh, young faces in politics.

28
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,818
That’s why I had to send my son in.

29
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,007
Well, I’m still considering.

30
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,093
I’ve heard a rumor, is it Queen?

31
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:21,942
Word does get around fast.

32
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,276
Oh! I totally forgot...

33
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:27,306
Today was Jenphop’s cremation, wasn’t it?

34
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:30,243
No wonder she wouldn’t feel comfortable at a party right now.

35
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,604
What are you gentlemen talking about?

36
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:37,320
Looks like you’re having a pleasant conversation.

37
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,012
We were just talking about your talented daughter, Kirin.

38
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:43,526
I was thinking of introducing my eldest son to her.

39
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,957
Well, that’s rather unfortunate, Sakda.

40
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,382
Well, I can’t deny that.

41
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,008
There they are…

42
00:03:58,202 --> 00:03:59,871
King and Queen.

43
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,826
You two must be so proud of King and Queen.

44
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,826
They’re truly remarkable.

45
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,534
Thank you, Sakda.

46
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,919
Please, excuse me.

47
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:08,071
King, see to the guests for me.

48
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:10,872
Yes, Mom.

49
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,847
Come here.

50
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:28,095
Why are you dressed like this?

51
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,635
Today was Dad’s cremation, Mom.

52
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,356
You didn’t even go.

53
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,857
But made me celebrate someone else instead.

54
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:36,963
Wasin is not someone else.

55
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:41,470
He’s my husband. And he’s your father.

56
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,803
He is not my father.

57
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:44,605
We’ve talked about this many times, Queen.

58
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,584
Today is Wasin’s birthday.

59
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,858
Can’t you at least save face for me?

60
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,330
All that Queen’s perfection…

61
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,062
where has it gone?

62
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,007
Wasin wants you to enter politics…

63
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:00,814
No, I won’t.

64
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,001
Will you please stop controlling my life?

65
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:03,501
Queen!

66
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,391
Everything I’ve done…

67
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,162
it’s all for you and King.

68
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,560
But I’ve never felt that way.

69
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:12,311
Isn’t everything you do just for yourself?

70
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:12,921
Queen!

71
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,405
I can’t stay for the celebration.

72
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:31,660
Please, enjoy the party.

73
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:35,122
Queen…

74
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:36,460
Get back here, now!

75
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:02,336
(I’m at the club with Pakinn. Come join, if you wanna chill.)

76
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,382
Uh… Queen, where are you heading?

77
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:09,158
Stay put.

78
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:38,862
Queen...

79
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:40,297
(Mom sent someone after me, didn’t she?)

80
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:41,093
Yes.

81
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,358
Where are you heading?

82
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,849
So I can follow…

83
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:47,687
Huh…?

84
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,227
Where did Queen go, Sam?

85
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:54,259
That way…

86
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,142
I mean…

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,387
Where is Queen heading?!

88
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,156
Ohhh…

89
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:02,574
Ummm…

90
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,760
I don’t know.

91
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:04,381
Bo!

92
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,394
Where are you off to?

93
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,314
You got some cash?

94
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:12,289
I’m off to play cards.

95
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,627
I don’t have any cash, Mom.

96
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,522
Seriously?!

97
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:31,944
You’ve got 500 and you said you’ve got no cash?!

98
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:33,351
Here!

99
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:35,007
Just go wherever you want!

100
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,728
Ha! Got my stake now!

101
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:41,999
Time to make some money!

102
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,330
Geez… calling me now?!

103
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,641
What’s up?

104
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,905
(Where are you? Are you close?)

105
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:23,222
Not yet, wait for me a bit.

106
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,437
Hey! Make sure you have all the papers ready.

107
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:26,970
I’m not riding all the way back again!

108
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,757
(Alright, alright, alright!)

109
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:31,880
(I’ve got everything this time for sure.)

110
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:34,274
(Just call me when you get here.)

111
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,684
Okay, see you. Bye.

112
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,307
Whoa!

113
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,075
Jeez! What’s the rush?!

114
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,564
What happened, Queen?!

115
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,946
You’re late again!

116
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:11,246
Just a little bit!

117
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:23,307
What?!

118
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,443
You actually saw someone shooting?!

119
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:26,975
Yeah! It scared the hell out of me.

120
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,468
I can still picture it in my head!

121
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:29,526
Wait?!

122
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,688
So what did you do?!

123
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,180
I turned this thing on…

124
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,820
and kept honking the horn.

125
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,963
Honked the horn…?!

126
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:34,606
Yes!

127
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,846
I literally went beep beep beep, just like that!

128
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,205
Gosh! Bo!

129
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,618
What were you thinking?!

130
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,586
What if you actually died?!

131
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:45,714
Whatever! I already did it anyway.

132
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Good thing they didn’t come after you.

133
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,788
You’re right…

134
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:53,026
I really shouldn’t have done that.

135
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,798
Here…

136
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,187
You sure you can ride back?

137
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,714
I’ve got to get back to work now.

138
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,275
I’m good.

139
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,338
Just get back to work.

140
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,291
I’m heading home now.

141
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,366
You sure you’ve got everything?!

142
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:04,026
For sure!

143
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:05,421
Okay.

144
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,109
Hey! Wait!

145
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,188
Are you looking for a part-time job right now?

146
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:14,933
What kind of work?

147
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:16,908
A job I’m doing right now.

148
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:21,325
Someone just quit, so Fern, my manager, and I have to find someone new.

149
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:23,796
Do you need money for something right now?

150
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,460
Well, of course I always need money.

151
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,658
But I’ve never done this kind of job before.

152
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:30,906
I’m not sure I could do it.

153
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:32,934
I think I’ll pass for now.

154
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:35,337
At least I’ve got enough for my tuition.

155
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,900
But anyway, thanks for asking.

156
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,048
Alright, it’s up to you.

157
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,981
I’ll just tell Fern to look for someone else.

158
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,110
Go on, get back to work.

159
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:44,458
Right! See you!

160
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:45,615
Drive safe!

161
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,553
And don’t go getting yourself into trouble again!

162
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,677
Call me when you get home.

163
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:50,299
I know, I know.

164
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:50,998
Bye-bye.
Bye.

165
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,137
Can I stop now, sis?!

166
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:08,707
No!

167
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,739
Come on, sis! I’m very sorry.

168
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:23,242
Queen…

169
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:31,948
How are things?

170
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,831
I’m wiped out, King.

171
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:38,018
Queen didn’t even say a word to back me up!

172
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,417
And that’s with sis still abroad!

173
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,911
If she were right here in person…

174
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,512
I don’t even want to imagine!

175
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,762
Still…was it wrong of me not to follow?

176
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,420
Queen told me to stay put.

177
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:55,783
But at least Queen’s safe…

178
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,092
Otherwise, sis would’ve totally killed me!

179
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,109
You talk too much.

180
00:15:59,109 --> 00:15:59,987
Yes?!

181
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,380
I’ll be on my way.

182
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,255
Please excuse me.

183
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Mom and Wasin already know what happened.

184
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,562
They’ve shut the news down…

185
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:17,091
and are now looking into who’s behind it.

186
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,162
Are you alright, Queen?

187
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:25,893
I’m alright.

188
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,805
I know you can handle things well, Queen.

189
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,920
But with the situation right now,

190
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,205
you need to be extra careful, okay?

191
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,165
This is the file you sent me…

192
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,026
and just like you said,

193
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:49,428
both sites come with risks.

194
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:55,499
The first could lead to conflicts with the local community.

195
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:59,236
The second comes with a high risk of not succeeding.

196
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,872
It’s close to the airport, yes,

197
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,577
but it’s outside the city,

198
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:08,428
which doesn’t fit our company’s concept.

199
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:13,969
It seems like we’re being pushed into choosing the local community.

200
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,478
I recognized this problem from the beginning.

201
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:23,284
I just never thought I’d be the one to step into Dad’s place.

202
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,451
But I’ll see this project through.

203
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,480
We still have time to find another site.

204
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:43,760
But there’s another matter we need to take care of tomorrow.

205
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,607
Mm…

206
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:51,345
There’s still a lot we’ll have to go through together.

207
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:53,388
It won’t be easy…

208
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,188
but I have no doubt you can do it.

209
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,965
I’ll always be by your side.

210
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:55,634
Good morning.

211
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,587
Allow me to address the matter directly.

212
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:04,137
I’m aware of the proposal to appoint a new company president.

213
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,123
The intention is for me to step down.

214
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,310
Is that correct?

215
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,908
That’s not quite the right way to put it, Keeraphat.

216
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:31,523
We’re simply concerned with what is appropriate.

217
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,543
This is the position of company president.

218
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:41,713
It isn’t a position for someone who only graduated three or four years ago to step in and take lightly.

219
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,958
Allow me to be honest with you, Keeraphat.

220
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,268
Even with the experience you’ve gained from your father, Jenphop,

221
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,095
we still cannot place our trust in you.

222
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,412
I would rather support Keeta.

223
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:13,369
Is that so?

224
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:14,548
Definitely!

225
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,294
Or do you think Keeta is not suitable for the position?

226
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:21,541
He is your elder brother, Keeraphat.

227
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:32,788
He has the potential, the experience, the knowledge, and the capability that may well exceed yours.

228
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:35,043
Wouldn’t you agree, Keeta?

229
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:41,170
How could you let your sister put herself ahead of you?

230
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:56,516
You have our full support, Keeta.

231
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,258
Thank you, Songpol.

232
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:14,429
But I don’t see it that way.

233
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,510
Queen and I…

234
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,788
we’ve always walked side by side.

235
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,391
Also, I'm more comfortable not to be in the spotlight.

236
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:38,628
And I believe my little sister will definitely be a great leader for us all.

237
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,668
But I, and the others, certainly don’t see it that way.

238
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:45,934
In which every one of us here holds the right to make that decision.

239
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:48,637
That’s correct.

240
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,901
But my father’s decision should be respected.

241
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,225
I will not step down from this position.

242
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,167
But if one day it can be proven that I lack the capability,

243
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,629
then a motion of no confidence may be submitted.

244
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:52,593
This meeting is concluded.

245
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,204
Thank you.

246
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,372
Thank you all for attending this meeting.

247
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,329
Sam, get the car ready.
Yes.

248
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:18,476
I’ve got another meeting to attend.

249
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:19,852
Are you going home now,

250
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,419
or staying at work a little longer?

251
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,295
I just need to check on something.

252
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,229
I’ll be back soon.

253
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,066
Car keys.

254
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,508
Here…

255
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:06,315
Queen?!

256
00:25:09,002 --> 00:25:10,418
Where are you heading, Queen?

257
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,773
Just around here.

258
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:14,314
Stay put.

259
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,310
Seriously?!

260
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,165
Again?!

261
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:20,890
Just around here, just around there, what’s the difference, Queen?!

262
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,502
I’m totally going out of my mind!

263
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,617
Did I take it out…?

264
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:45,986
Yeah! Take this one.

265
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:46,919
Better do it properly.

266
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,694
Don’t you dare blame me if the price drops.

267
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,274
Mom!

268
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:52,485
And that’s another 15,000.

269
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,306
I’m dead broke! Can’t even buy a damn meal!

270
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:56,038
Mom?!

271
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,436
Why are you taking my bike?!

272
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:58,779
To pay off the damn debt!

273
00:25:58,779 --> 00:25:59,709
Hurry up!

274
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:02,498
You’re lucky I didn’t sell it off a long time ago.

275
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:03,484
Bo! What are you doing?!

276
00:26:03,484 --> 00:26:05,244
Mom! That’s my tuition money!

277
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:05,789
So what?!

278
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,454
Shouldn’t you be paying off my debt first?!

279
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:09,157
Or you’d rather see me keep running and hiding?!

280
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:11,005
We’ve got nothing left, Mom.

281
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,389
You’re selling off everything!

282
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:12,889
Yes!
I’ll sell off everything!

283
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,152
And it’s none of your damn business!

284
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,148
Mom…

285
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:22,586
I’m begging you.

286
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,409
Please, don’t gamble anymore.

287
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:26,577
I don’t know how I can keep finding money for you anymore.

288
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:28,121
Bo!

289
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,609
I’m your mother.

290
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:32,292
Your damn job is to bring me money!

291
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,042
You’ve got no right to talk to me like this!

292
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,755
Bua!

293
00:26:36,755 --> 00:26:38,183
Please…

294
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:39,632
just calm down first.

295
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,685
Calm down, Kem?!

296
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:41,718
Please, I beg you.

297
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:42,470
Remember!

298
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,183
You need to bring me the damn money!

299
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:46,585
Let’s go, Bo.

300
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:47,956
Don’t you dare even look at me!

301
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,511
Get the hell out!

302
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:56,788
Bo…

303
00:26:57,497 --> 00:26:58,719
Are you alright?

304
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:00,620
Why did you talk to Bua like that?

305
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:03,697
Mom took my tuition money,

306
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:05,502
and she also sold my bike.

307
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,754
Let’s do this, Bo…

308
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:14,325
I just got some money,

309
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,711
and already sent some to my parents.

310
00:27:18,744 --> 00:27:20,522
How much is your tuition?

311
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:21,803
Let me help you pay for it.

312
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:22,935
No, Kem.

313
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,558
I really appreciate it.

314
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,862
It’s really just you…

315
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:42,309
who’s always there for me.

316
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:54,653
Kem!

317
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,705
I forgot my wallet at home!

318
00:27:58,495 --> 00:27:59,717
Wow!!!

319
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:03,388
Mom! What are you doing?!

320
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:04,838
Bo!

321
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:07,022
You’ve got 5,000 and won’t share a thing?!

322
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:08,413
Please, Mom.
I’ve got nothing left.

323
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,067
Bo!

324
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,775
I’ll just take it to go play cards first.

325
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,363
I’ll give it back once I get the money.

326
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,476
Mom, please.

327
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,279
I’ve really got nothing left.

328
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,545
I’m begging you.

329
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,823
Urgh! You’re annoying!

330
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,446
Fine!

331
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,285
I’ll give you 2,000.

332
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:29,431
Is that enough?!

333
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,540
Bo! Damn you!

334
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,409
Bua!
Calm down!

335
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:36,392
She took all the money!

336
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:37,406
I’ll give it to you.

337
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:38,172
Give me what?!

338
00:28:38,172 --> 00:28:39,229
I have 6,000 with me.

339
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:39,835
So?!
Take this first.

340
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,179
Okay!

341
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,233
Hurry up!

342
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:42,955
For me?

343
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,851
Ugh! You’re so slow!

344
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Whoa! Kem!

345
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,033
I wish I were your parents!

346
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:51,829
Thanks a lot.
Lock up the house for me.

347
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:53,368
I’ve got to run.

348
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:55,770
Damn! I even got an extra thousand.

349
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,790
6,000?! I’m all set!

350
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,061
Bo!

351
00:29:10,993 --> 00:29:11,770
Bo!

352
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,165
Bo!

353
00:29:28,618 --> 00:29:29,423
Bo!

354
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,695
Bo?!

355
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:43,646
Are you alright?!
Are you hurt?!

356
00:29:45,672 --> 00:29:47,172
Watch where you’re going!

357
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,323
Were you trying to get yourself hit?!

358
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:51,588
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.

359
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:53,024
What if I couldn’t stop in time?!

360
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:55,609
I’m sorry, I really am sorry.

361
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:00,033
Bo, are you okay?

362
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,010
Come on, let’s move aside.

363
00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:13,618
Are you hurt, Bo?

364
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:16,589
No…
Thanks a lot.

365
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:45,445
I’ll send you my notes later.

366
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,184
Thanks.

367
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:52,612
Anyway, are you going home now?

368
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:55,907
Not yet.

369
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,976
I don’t feel like seeing my mom right now.

370
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,612
Bo…

371
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:08,571
What about your tuition?

372
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:18,760
Right!

373
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:22,081
Remember that job I told you about the other day?

374
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,614
Yes.

375
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,754
It’s a decent job with decent money,

376
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,208
in case you’re interested.

377
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,745
Mint!

378
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,776
Oh! Ging!

379
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:50,738
Here, I got you the chips, Mook.

380
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:51,851
Exactly 10,000.

381
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,639
Well, well, let me see…

382
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:56,341
Did you get it all?

383
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,942
Are there any missing?

384
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,829
I’m just joking.

385
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:04,969
Thanks, handsome.

386
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:08,449
Here’s a little tip for you.

387
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,292
Whoa! Mook!

388
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,551
A whole thousand?!

389
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:13,010
Thank you so much.

390
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:14,704
Don’t mention it.

391
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,031
If I win more,  I’ll spoil you a little extra.

392
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:17,653
Thank you.

393
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,704
Urgh!

394
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,662
Just take it!

395
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,889
Here, another thousand!

396
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,464
Come on, calm down.

397
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:40,203
Calm down what?!

398
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:44,051
Hurry up! I’m down to my last stack!

399
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:48,981
I’m all in!

400
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:51,669
Bua…

401
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,403
Calm down.

402
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,583
You don’t have to go all in.

403
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,325
What the hell are you talking about?! I’m losing!

404
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:56,539
Just get lost!

405
00:32:58,528 --> 00:32:59,905
I told you to get lost!

406
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:01,798
Kem, stop bothering me!

407
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:12,395
I’m so screwed.

408
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,748
Yes?

409
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:18,732
What the hell did you just do?

410
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,756
I…um…

411
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:22,355
Is that your job, huh?!

412
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,541
If Big Boss didn’t cover your ass…

413
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:28,305
you would’ve been long gone.

414
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:31,626
So what?!

415
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:34,259
Just because you’re good-looking, cool, and bring in customers…

416
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,849
So what?!

417
00:33:39,595 --> 00:33:41,869
Forget about your bonus this month!

418
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,966
And don’t let me catch you doing this again.

419
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,162
Go!

420
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:52,119
Get back to work!

421
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,549
Go!

422
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:56,883
I’m sorry about that.

423
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:06,885
Flip the cards already.

424
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:14,495
Change the damn deck, will you?

425
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:42,062
Come in…

426
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:45,631
Wait here.

427
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:46,871
Mm.

428
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,950
Here you go, go change.

429
00:34:58,974 --> 00:34:59,752
This one?
Yep!

430
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,407
Go on in.

431
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:16,637
Are you serious?!
Yes!

432
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:18,326
Come out.

433
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,128
Whoa! Bo!

434
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:26,060
Look at you!

435
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,004
So stunning!

436
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:29,582
Really…?
Yes!

437
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:33,552
Don’t you think it’s a bit…?

438
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:35,308
Nope!

439
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:36,265
You look amazing.

440
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,617
Whoa!

441
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,544
Absolutely gorgeous!

442
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:45,415
This is perfect.

443
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:47,334
Bo.

444
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:49,231
Remember this well.

445
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:56,348
Our job is just to serve, pour drinks, and keep customers company.

446
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,685
Nothing beyond that.

447
00:35:58,685 --> 00:36:01,220
We have strict rules here, Bo.

448
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,531
Both staff and customers know them well.

449
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:06,747
So you can rest assured.

450
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,094
Just do your best at work.

451
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:11,449
Yes, Fern.

452
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,255
Thank you.

453
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,000
Beautiful.

454
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:17,870
Uh uh…
You really are!

455
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:19,570
Uh uh…

456
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:55,981
I’m still going over the site details.

457
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,894
I actually went to check out the community site today.

458
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:03,048
And honestly, it seems very difficult,

459
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,881
if everyone still insists on choosing this place.

460
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,168
I think so too.

461
00:37:13,055 --> 00:37:16,277
The board also seems to be leaning toward this location,

462
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,572
but there isn’t full agreement yet.

463
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:23,373
They believe this area fits our company’s concept.

464
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:26,449
By simply developing it to match the surrounding areas,

465
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:29,609
the entire area could become perfect.

466
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,976
Well, you know how it is…

467
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,671
People always want perfection.

468
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:42,702
But I really can’t figure out…

469
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,129
if we were to drive them out of this place,

470
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,876
where would they go?

471
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,447
(If you don’t show up tonight…)

472
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:21,029
Hey!

473
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,612
How are you feeling?

474
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:24,006
Customers are coming in.

475
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:24,877
You ready?

476
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:29,943
Mint…

477
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:31,560
I’m actually getting nervous.

478
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,814
Do you think I can really do this?

479
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,449
Come on!

480
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:37,569
You’ve got this.

481
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:39,286
No need to be nervous.

482
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:40,609
You can do it, Bo!

483
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:43,195
Of course you’d say that.

484
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,966
It’s my first day here!

485
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:49,739
Come on…

486
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:50,946
Don’t worry, okay?

487
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:53,849
Fern and I got your back.

488
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,055
When you turn around, you’ll see me.

489
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:56,840
Okay?

490
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,429
Okay…

491
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:03,626
Wait…

492
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:10,868
Wait…

493
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,861
There’s something missing…

494
00:40:14,924 --> 00:40:15,927
What is it?

495
00:40:19,763 --> 00:40:20,741
Right!

496
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:21,985
Your name tag!

497
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:26,232
Not yet.

498
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,977
It’s Bo’s first day here,

499
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,837
but I’ll take care of it right away.

500
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:33,861
Do we have to use our real name, Fern?

501
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:36,315
Nope.

502
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:37,728
We go by work names only.

503
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,385
Here, check this out.

504
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:41,703
Bunny…?
Yes!

505
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,629
It’s cute, right?

506
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:45,821
We don’t use our real names here.

507
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,626
It’s for our safety.

508
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,118
So what’s my name then?

509
00:41:01,153 --> 00:41:01,931
Hey!

510
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,406
Cut it out already.

511
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:06,658
Just because your girl isn’t here.

512
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,185
Can you not ruin the vibe?

513
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,677
Anyway…

514
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,257
You think Queen’s showing up tonight?

515
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:26,615
She’s been gone since yesterday.

516
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,145
She’ll come.

517
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:32,481
Let’s do this.

518
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:34,488
If she doesn’t show up.

519
00:41:35,624 --> 00:41:37,624
I’ll bet you a bottle,

520
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,554
and I’ll even film myself crying outside.

521
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:42,683
You’re in?

522
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,441
I’m in!

523
00:41:44,897 --> 00:41:46,573
And I bet she’s definitely not going to show up.

524
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:49,750
You’d better get ready to cry outside.

525
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,540
She’ll definitely show up.

526
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,939
She won’t.

527
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:55,325
Let’s do this…

528
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:57,299
I’ll just go grab the bottle right now.

529
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:58,506
And you.

530
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:01,441
When you go crying outside…

531
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:03,987
don’t forget to post it.

532
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,672
Please.

533
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,303
Hey…
Look.

534
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,206
Damn it!

535
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:35,141
The usual, please.

536
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,378
Yes.

537
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:47,619
Took you long enough, Queen.

538
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:51,299
(Where are you???)
(You have to come, Queen 🥺)

539
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:52,520
(If you don’t show up,)
(I’ll seriously go cry in front of the club 😩😭)

540
00:42:57,836 --> 00:42:59,287
Just planning to drop you.

541
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,102
Oh, please.

542
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:03,302
If you drop me…

543
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:04,775
who else have you got, huh?

544
00:43:05,454 --> 00:43:08,651
It’s just you, me, and Pakinn these days.

545
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:13,600
Where’s Pakinn?

546
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:16,006
He went to get the bottle.

547
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:19,203
I won the bet.

548
00:43:22,424 --> 00:43:24,075
And where’s the waitress?

549
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:25,061
It’s Pakinn.

550
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,225
Getting all moody,

551
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:27,950
and won’t take anyone but his girl.

552
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,554
So I just told him to go do it himself.

553
00:45:36,554 --> 00:45:38,554
You got this!

554
00:45:38,554 --> 00:45:39,356
Fighting!

555
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:54,877
Did you call for me?

556
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:58,779
Bring me my bottle.

557
00:45:58,779 --> 00:46:00,641
Under the name “Queen.”

558
00:46:02,246 --> 00:46:03,248
Yes.

559
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:05,973
Hey, sweetie.

560
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:08,951
For Queen, make it on the rocks.

561
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:11,113
Just an ice ball will do.

562
00:46:16,712 --> 00:46:17,900
Yes.

563
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,210
Just a moment, please.

564
00:46:23,537 --> 00:46:24,795
I guess she’s new,

565
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,288
haven’t seen her before.

566
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:44,593
For Queen, please.

567
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,095
Yes.

568
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,085
Bo!

569
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,109
How’s it going so far?

570
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,164
Are you good?

571
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,107
I’m good, I guess.

572
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,517
That customer who called for you…

573
00:46:58,517 --> 00:46:59,771
her name is Queen.

574
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:01,333
She’s a businesswoman.

575
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,436
You actually might know her.

576
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:07,225
You always keep up with business news, don’t you?

577
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:09,602
I keep up with financial news,

578
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:11,707
not business news.

579
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:15,966
So…

580
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:16,945
That group,

581
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:18,875
they’re regulars here.

582
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,456
Queen’s pretty reserved, but nothing to worry about.

583
00:47:21,456 --> 00:47:24,803
As for Linn, she’s really sweet and friendly.

584
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,591
And that guy over there…

585
00:47:28,663 --> 00:47:30,106
his name is Pakinn.

586
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:31,684
They’re all loaded.

587
00:47:32,674 --> 00:47:34,674
Queen’s order is ready, Bo.

588
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,050
Fong!

589
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,410
That’s her real name!

590
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,032
Whoops!

591
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:39,249
But Mint, you just called me Fong.

592
00:47:39,249 --> 00:47:40,338
That’s my real name too!

593
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:41,893
Hey! I’m Bunny!

594
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:43,838
And I’m Ray.

595
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:46,882
I’d better take this over now.

596
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:47,987
Thank you, Ray.

597
00:47:47,987 --> 00:47:48,665
Sure thing.

598
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:50,829
Bo, you got this!

599
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:02,524
Excuse me.

600
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:06,552
One more, please.

601
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:07,299
One more?
Yes, I’m parched.

602
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:08,713
Oh! You’re parched?!
Coming right up!

603
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:10,448
Extra ice for me, please.

604
00:48:21,677 --> 00:48:22,888
Here you are.

605
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:46,840
What’s your name? So I can call you properly.

606
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,427
My name is…

607
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:52,422
Babe.

608
00:48:53,374 --> 00:48:54,214
But…

609
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:56,173
I’m called Bee at work.

610
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:00,034
What do you want me to call you by then?

611
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:01,951
Babe? Or Bee?

612
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:05,314
Whichever you prefer.

613
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:06,429
Please excuse me.

614
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:08,787
Babe.

615
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,744
I haven’t seen you before.

616
00:49:16,744 --> 00:49:18,383
Is this your first day here?

617
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,684
Yes.

618
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,227
Why are you still standing?

619
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:33,099
Sit down.

620
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:36,631
Where should I sit?

621
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:47,120
On my lap.

622
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:52,987
You mean…

623
00:49:52,987 --> 00:49:54,898
sit beside you, right…?

624
00:50:14,622 --> 00:50:16,622
Do you have your phone with you?

625
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,282
Yes.

626
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,993
But we’re not allowed to use it while working.

627
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:25,505
I’ve reserved your time for tonight.

628
00:50:26,277 --> 00:50:28,277
You may use your phone.

629
00:50:29,628 --> 00:50:32,278
Find today’s business news and read it to me.

630
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:33,811
Pardon?

631
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:36,913
I said…

632
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:40,987
find today’s business news and read it to me.

633
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:47,409
Yes.

634
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:48,465
Of course.

635
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:58,293
Would you like local or international news, Queen?

636
00:51:00,211 --> 00:51:01,654
You choose.

637
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,210
Alright.

638
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:27,043
I found one.

639
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,643
Why did you stop?

640
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:05,523
I told you to read me the news,

641
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,347
not sit there staring at me.

642
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:13,050
I thought you’d fallen asleep.

643
00:53:25,588 --> 00:53:27,101
Here, take it!

644
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:28,712
What did you do, Pakinn?!

645
00:53:28,712 --> 00:53:30,168
You were just fine a moment ago.

646
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:35,078
Get me a drink, just a soda.

647
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:37,531
Yes.

648
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:40,998
Did you drink my bottle?!

649
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:42,960
It’s half gone!

650
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,698
I’m just in a bad mood!

651
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,190
Cut it out already!

652
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,048
Just because your girl didn’t show up,

653
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:50,372
you just go find another one!

654
00:53:50,372 --> 00:53:51,400
It’s nothing, really.

655
00:53:51,804 --> 00:53:53,155
Easy for you to say!

656
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:53,901
How’s that?

657
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:56,598
It’s not easy to find someone I actually like.

658
00:53:56,598 --> 00:53:57,559
Jeez!

659
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,457
I’ve called a hundred times,

660
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:00,985
and she still won’t pick up!

661
00:54:01,443 --> 00:54:02,886
No idea where she is.

662
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,183
Stop it already!
Here’s you drink.

663
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,324
Hey! Pakinn!

664
00:54:08,324 --> 00:54:09,463
You really went that far?!

665
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:12,442
Pakinn, knock it off!

666
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:13,940
What for?

667
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,788
You told me to find a new girl.

668
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,762
So I’m taking this one.

669
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:19,627
Hey, cutie.

670
00:54:20,084 --> 00:54:21,620
You do side deals?

671
00:54:22,461 --> 00:54:24,461
Hey!

672
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:26,208
Cut it out!

673
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,193
Calm down!

674
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:28,390
Or we’ll all be screwed.

675
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:32,796
We can do it on the low.

676
00:54:32,796 --> 00:54:35,053
So, how much for you, cutie?

677
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:37,712
Please, no.

678
00:54:37,712 --> 00:54:39,346
We’re not allowed to take jobs like this here.

679
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:40,950
Come on, just don’t play hard to get.

680
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,105
Please, let me go.

681
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:43,045
Just come with me.

682
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,949
What should we do, Fern?!

683
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,795
Please, let go of me.

684
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:51,946
Don’t play hard to get.

685
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:53,500
Pakinn, she’s not into it.

686
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,530
Let go of her.

687
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,799
Stay out of this, Linn!

688
00:54:57,164 --> 00:54:58,282
I’ll take care of it.

689
00:55:00,805 --> 00:55:02,132
What if I do?

690
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:11,205
Why’re you getting involved, Queen?

691
00:55:13,874 --> 00:55:15,874
I told you to come read me the news.

692
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:18,853
Hey, Queen!

693
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:20,045
We called them over…

694
00:55:20,045 --> 00:55:21,996
not just for you, you know!

695
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:26,456
But she’ll serve only me.

696
00:55:34,306 --> 00:55:35,378
Come here.

697
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:00,768
I’ve sold you to the den!

698
00:56:00,768 --> 00:56:01,696
What did you just say…?

699
00:56:01,696 --> 00:56:02,969
You’ll pay my debt!

700
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,791
But if you really are getting into politics,

701
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:09,007
that’s unfortunate for you…

702
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:10,646
to have me as your rival.

703
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:13,189
I want a rival worthy of me,

704
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:14,749
not some coward lurking in the shadows.

705
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:16,113
Tell me.

706
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:17,805
Where do I drop you off?

707
00:56:17,805 --> 00:56:19,870
Does dropping me off make you feel better?

708
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:21,423
Bo.

709
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,491
You don’t have to worry at all.

710
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:23,868
I already paid off Bua’s debt.

711
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:25,989
I really don’t understand…

712
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,571
Why would you go this far for me?
