1
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,152
Why are you dressed like this?

2
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:42,108
Today was Dad’s cremation, Mom.

3
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:43,686
You didn’t even go.

4
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,622
But made me celebrate someone else instead.

5
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,071
Wasin is not someone else.

6
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,374
He’s my husband.

7
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,506
I’m begging you.

8
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:51,414
Please, don’t gamble anymore.

9
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,632
I don’t know how I can keep finding money for you anymore.

10
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:54,345
Bo!

11
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,463
I’m your mother.

12
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,596
Your damn job is to bring me money!

13
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,251
Bo!

14
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:07,934
I told you to come read me the news.

15
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,245
We called them over.

16
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,280
Not just for you, you know!

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,579
But she’ll serve only me.

18
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:14,588
Come here.

19
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:26,602
Pakinn, you screwed up the whole night!

20
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,118
Damn it!

21
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,378
What’s your problem?!

22
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:35,663
It’s just one girl!

23
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,248
I’ll go check on him.

24
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,454
Damn it, Pakinn!

25
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:00,247
I think it’s settled.

26
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,191
Just get back to work.

27
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:10,898
Why are you still standing?

28
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,215
Come read me the news.

29
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,754
Yes.

30
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,204
Thank you for helping me.

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,230
I did nothing.

32
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,287
Just start reading.

33
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:48,595
Yes.

34
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,117
Here’s water for everyone.

35
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,814
Hurry up!

36
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,419
Thank you so much.

37
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,016
What is this?!

38
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:35,682
I’m totally broke!

39
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,927
Kem.

40
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,774
Lend me some cash.

41
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,414
I just gave it to you!

42
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,499
I blew it all already.

43
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,637
And Bo hasn’t come back yet.

44
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:50,936
Where am I supposed to get more cash?!

45
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:51,638
What?!

46
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:53,080
Bo hasn’t come back yet?!

47
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,232
It’s almost midnight already!

48
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,161
Why hasn’t Bo come back yet?!

49
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:57,291
How would I know?!

50
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,387
Just give me some cash, I need to keep playing.

51
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:03,943
This is all I’ve got.

52
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:08,674
You’re such a savior!

53
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:09,673
Thanks a lot!

54
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,111
I’m back!

55
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:40,962
Bo!

56
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,242
Kem!

57
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:43,209
What’s up?

58
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:45,959
Nothing.

59
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:49,351
It’s just that Bua told me you weren’t home yet.

60
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,783
I just got off work at the club.

61
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:54,094
I’m exhausted!

62
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:54,753
What?!

63
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,097
You’re working at a club?!

64
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,121
I need to make extra money.

65
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,734
I still haven’t paid my tuition yet.

66
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:09,029
But…

67
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,572
It’s risky, Bo.

68
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:12,599
You’re a woman.

69
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:14,337
So what if I’m a woman?

70
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,143
Can’t a woman work too?!

71
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,665
This kind of work is dangerous, Bo.

72
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:20,564
Men can’t be trusted.

73
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:21,988
Bo.

74
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,028
Use my money for your tuition first, okay?

75
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,806
I haven’t finished paying you back yet.

76
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:28,151
How could I borrow more?

77
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,880
I’m working because I want to be able to take care of myself.

78
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,634
Then, if that’s what you want.

79
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,815
It’s not like you would listen to me anyway.

80
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:41,418
I’m just worried about you.

81
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,992
I know.

82
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,260
That’s why I’m telling you.

83
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,318
Don’t worry.

84
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:50,617
I’m leaving.

85
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:53,353
Where are you going? Not even waiting for me?

86
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:54,562
I’ll walk you there.

87
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:55,855
It’ll be a mess if you get lost.

88
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,732
My house is just right here!

89
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:00,861
Just don’t want you to get lost.

90
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,139
I saw the light was still on.

91
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,122
Just as I thought, you’re still awake.

92
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,814
I’m still reading the news.

93
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:50,328
I think you should get someone to help read the news.

94
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:52,481
They can summarize it for you.

95
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,439
So you can relax a little more.

96
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:56,045
That’s a good idea.

97
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,568
I just had someone read me the news at the club today.

98
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:02,140
Someone from the club?

99
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,730
And you’re already back to work at home?!

100
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:09,132
That’s definitely my little sister.

101
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,606
King!

102
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,562
I’ve found a site that looks interesting.

103
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:17,418
That’s enough, Queen.

104
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,057
We’ll talk about work tomorrow.

105
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,710
For now, you’re going to bed.

106
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,872
Trust me.

107
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,380
Come on, go to bed.

108
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,463
Go to bed.

109
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:36,580
Turn off the lights for me then.

110
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,249
Mmm.

111
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,122
Go to bed.

112
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,036
It’s definitely going to rain.

113
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,074
Bo!

114
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,924
Kem!

115
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,778
You’re heading to class?

116
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:29,509
Mmm.

117
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,708
I got you some congee. Have a little before you go?

118
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,537
Thanks a lot.

119
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:35,969
But I don’t think I can.

120
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,270
The rain’s coming.

121
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,414
Then…

122
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:41,435
You can take my umbrella.

123
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:45,635
It’s alright.

124
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:46,589
I’d better run.

125
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:47,764
I don’t want to get stuck in traffic, too.

126
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:48,639
See you!

127
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,392
So, she’s still studying.

128
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,543
Get in.

129
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:07,444
Are you talking to me?

130
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,325
Just get in.

131
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,505
Why should I get in?

132
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:15,349
Look at your shirt.

133
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:21,684
Get in.

134
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,997
It’s alright, I don’t want to trouble you.

135
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,303
I’m all wet.

136
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,711
I’ll pay you.

137
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,774
Get in the car with me.

138
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:35,192
How much do you want?

139
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:37,578
I don’t do that kind of work.

140
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,811
I’m paying you to get in my car.

141
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:43,084
Not to sleep with me.

142
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,912
Get in.

143
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,633
I don’t like being the center of attention.

144
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,530
I didn’t get in the car because you said you’d pay me.

145
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,680
You’re cold?

146
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,408
There’s a jacket in the back.

147
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,224
Put it on.

148
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
It’s alright, I don’t want to trouble you.

149
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,727
Do I have to pay you to wear the jacket too, Babe?

150
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:12,493
It’s expensive, I wouldn’t dare wear it.

151
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:14,814
Just put it on.

152
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,332
It’s too expensive.

153
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,177
I told you to wear the jacket.

154
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,409
Not to buy it from me.

155
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,814
Or do you want to sit in front of me like this, all see-through?

156
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,446
It’s not like I wanted to look that much.

157
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,418
But I saw you looking.

158
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,116
So, where are you heading?

159
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,484
I’m going to work at the club.

160
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
The place where I met you last night?

161
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:00,722
Yes.

162
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,149
You can drop me off up ahead.

163
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,938
I’ll take you there.

164
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,324
I have something to do around there anyway.

165
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,324
Thank you for the ride.

166
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,824
I should get to work now.

167
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:52,957
Take the jacket.

168
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,090
It’s your pay for getting in my car.

169
00:15:58,178 --> 00:15:59,038
I won’t take it.

170
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,240
What should you do if an elder gives you something?

171
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,542
So, I heard you’re getting into politics.

172
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,481
I don’t think so.

173
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:58,076
Didn’t you have someone following me the other day?

174
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,859
You’re overthinking, Queen.

175
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,335
Who’d ever do that to an old friend?

176
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,884
But if you really are getting into politics.

177
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,175
That’s unfortunate for you.

178
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,875
To have me as your rival.

179
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,188
I want a rival worthy of me.

180
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,531
Not some coward lurking in the shadows.

181
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,693
At the very least.

182
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,696
Have a decent reputation.

183
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,435
And besides.

184
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,181
I haven’t agreed to anything yet.

185
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,777
Why are you getting all worked up, Kongtup?

186
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,771
Are you afraid?

187
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,678
Don’t get ahead of yourself, Queen.

188
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,580
Bo!

189
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,235
Leave it, I’m going in.

190
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,031
Back home at dawn again, Mom.

191
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:49,302
That’s right! My luck is rising!

192
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,725
Look! I’m going to be rich!

193
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:54,666
After my shower, I’m going back for more.

194
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,787
I’ll go in big today.

195
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,857
My luck’s turning!

196
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,309
I’ll be rich in no time!

197
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,584
Why would you go back again, Mom?

198
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,317
I think it’s better if you save the money.

199
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,525
Bo! You don’t know a thing!

200
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,239
That’s how it works, you win, you put more in.

201
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,254
That’s how you’ll get more money.

202
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:15,228
You won this time.

203
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,664
But next time you might lose it all.

204
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,219
What did you just say?!

205
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,924
You said I would lose it all?!

206
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:22,843
Did you just curse me, Bo?!

207
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,609
How dare you?! How dare you curse me like that?!

208
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,497
Watch your mouth!

209
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,164
You don’t like it when I’m in a good mood, do you?!

210
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:31,551
You like making me angry, don’t you?!

211
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,938
You like getting yourself hurt, don’t you?!

212
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:35,012
Fine! If that’s what you want!

213
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:41,533
Big mouth, huh?!

214
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,641
I’ll take every last bit of your money.

215
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:48,575
Won’t leave you a single cent.

216
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,543
Ungrateful daughter!

217
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:51,360
Take it back!

218
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
Forget the shower, I’m pissed off!

219
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,431
Good morning, Queen.

220
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:35,849
What is it?

221
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,176
I heard you’re presenting a new site.

222
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:42,709
And?

223
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,761
It’s really just pointless.

224
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,298
It won’t change anything.

225
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,099
I don't want you to tire yourself out for nothing.

226
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,318
Nothing is ever pointless.

227
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,497
Why don’t you wait to see my proposal first?

228
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,338
Then make your objections.

229
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,133
Just a word of advice.

230
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:21,024
You’d better not go around making enemies.

231
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,550
Especially not within the same company.

232
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:27,261
That can be scary.

233
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,183
Keep watching.

234
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,087
If anything happens, call me immediately.

235
00:21:57,924 --> 00:21:59,033
Is something wrong?

236
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,175
It’s about Queen.

237
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:04,289
I’m worried about her.

238
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,655
The company is a dangerous place, full of ruthless people.

239
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:10,499
I wish she would just leave it all behind and stay with us.

240
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,943
Take it easy.

241
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:14,231
Just give her some time.

242
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:16,334
It’s been ten years.

243
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:18,842
So what if it has?

244
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,711
Queen still hasn’t accepted me.

245
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,967
Just take it slow.

246
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,667
I believe Queen can handle it well.

247
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:02,569
Bo.

248
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,231
Are you sure you’re okay?

249
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,849
I think so.

250
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:13,147
Thanks, Mint.

251
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:18,137
A friend like me doesn’t come around often, you know.

252
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,839
Let me see your face.

253
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:26,721
Did you really cover up your bruises?

254
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,408
Yes.

255
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,248
Why?

256
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,140
Come here.

257
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,289
That hurts, Mint!

258
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,444
Be gentle!

259
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,888
Sorry, I was a bit rough.

260
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:50,906
I’ll do it myself.

261
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,479
I’m definitely catching a cold.

262
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:59,791
Guess you’re calling in sick tonight.

263
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,636
I already called Fern and took the night off.

264
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,097
What?!

265
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,717
When did you call?

266
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:07,326
Last night.

267
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,692
And you told me nothing?!

268
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,121
Why don’t you take the night off too?

269
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:17,140
I can’t.

270
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,664
I have to go to work.

271
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:21,154
I don’t have a single cent on me right now.

272
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:24,403
Is it fully covered?

273
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,129
Come on, Cheers!

274
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:34,743
Cheers!

275
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,031
You can sure drink a lot!

276
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,212
We’re here to drink, aren’t we?

277
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:42,105
Anyone up for a game?

278
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,005
Let’s make a little bet for fun.

279
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:46,212
You really want to play now?

280
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,910
It’s so dark, I can’t see a thing.

281
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,862
Maybe it’s just your eyes, huh?

282
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:53,999
Let’s get started…

283
00:24:58,703 --> 00:24:59,771
What are you doing?!

284
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:01,025
I’m soaked!

285
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:04,559
I’m so sorry.

286
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,545
I will clean it up right away.

287
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:28,783
I’m so sorry.

288
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:30,788
I will clean it up right away.

289
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:40,450
Bie!

290
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:43,320
Get up.

291
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,239
I am very sorry, may I ask what happened?

292
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,763
She spilled the drink on me!

293
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:50,493
Throw her out right now!

294
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:53,796
Of course, I will handle it right away.

295
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:54,598
Come on, Bie.

296
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:56,616
I’m truly sorry.

297
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,202
You!

298
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,300
I sincerely apologize.

299
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:15,359
Let’s go.

300
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:20,803
I’ll never set foot in this crappy club again!

301
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:24,636
Are you okay?

302
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,046
I’m fine.

303
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,355
Alright then…

304
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:30,823
Let’s go have some fun.

305
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:31,807
I got us our usual table.

306
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:32,569
Let’s go.

307
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,818
I’ll go to the restroom first.

308
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,327
Okay, sure.

309
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:09,510
What’s wrong?

310
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:12,854
Nothing.

311
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:13,926
I’m fine.

312
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:30,730
Who did this to you?

313
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:38,854
I’m really fine.

314
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:01,922
Please, just let me go.

315
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:51,475
Why are you crying?

316
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:56,639
Queen.

317
00:28:58,715 --> 00:28:59,879
You haven’t left?

318
00:29:04,391 --> 00:29:06,391
I asked, why are you crying?

319
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:09,636
Who did this to you?

320
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,373
It’s nothing.

321
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:17,133
Babe.

322
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,839
It really is nothing.

323
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,472
Please, don’t push me.

324
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,839
I don’t want to talk about it.

325
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,602
I don’t like seeing people cry.

326
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:45,963
It irritates me.

327
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:48,563
I didn’t mean for you to see me cry.

328
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,824
So, I’m intruding?

329
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:54,012
No.

330
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,269
Please, excuse me.

331
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:58,792
Where are you going?

332
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:00,054
Home.

333
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,178
How are you getting back?

334
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,817
My friend’s picking me up.

335
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,008
An elder’s speaking to you.

336
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,904
You should turn around and answer properly.

337
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,037
Why are you so bossy?

338
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,182
I’m sorry.

339
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,254
I’m feeling unsteady right now.

340
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:43,164
If I said something I shouldn’t have…

341
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:46,257
I’m truly sorry.

342
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,103
Has your friend arrived?

343
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,134
Go wait in my car.

344
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:26,533
Don’t make me pay you to get in the car a second time, Babe.

345
00:31:57,154 --> 00:31:58,428
Why are you staring at me?

346
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,731
I just don’t understand.

347
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:04,924
What do you want from me?

348
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,399
What do I want from you?

349
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:11,503
Yes.

350
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:15,024
Why are you doing all this?

351
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:18,358
Is my misery...

352
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:20,565
fun to you?

353
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,093
I only see you as a little sister.

354
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,836
Hello.

355
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,476
Where are you, Queen?

356
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:47,156
I’m outside.

357
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:50,002
Is there anything you need, Mom?

358
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,840
Wasin and I need to talk to you.

359
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,422
Could you come by?

360
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,436
I’m busy right now.

361
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,190
(Queen.)

362
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:03,035
(Do it for me.)

363
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:12,829
Alright.

364
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:15,581
I’ll come by.

365
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:19,916
You’d better go.

366
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,633
Please, excuse me.

367
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,565
When is your friend coming?

368
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:31,669
(What now, Bo?!)

369
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:33,385
(No one’s actually coming!)

370
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,536
Don’t make a habit of lying.

371
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:44,930
Tell me.

372
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:48,134
Where do you want me to drop you off?

373
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:52,588
Does dropping me off make you feel good?

374
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,068
What are you so angry at me for?

375
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:01,388
Nothing.

376
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:05,085
But you’re getting too involved in my life.

377
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,416
Fine.

378
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:13,011
I’ll stay out of your life from now on.

379
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,216
Was that too harsh?

380
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:46,652
Whatever.

381
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:50,895
Queen.

382
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:52,915
Yes, Queen?

383
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:54,141
(Follow her.)

384
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:56,531
(See that she gets home.)

385
00:34:57,746 --> 00:34:58,932
Got it.

386
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:08,497
That mouth of yours!

387
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,531
How dare you curse me, Bo?!

388
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:14,115
I’m hurt! Mom!

389
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:15,867
I’m drowning in debt because of you!

390
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:16,592
I’m hurt!

391
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,280
You have to pay it back!

392
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,022
I’ve sold you to the gambling den!

393
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:23,287
What did you say?

394
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,727
I’ve already sold you to the gambling den.

395
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,802
You’ll have to pay off my debt.

396
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:30,304
No, Mom.

397
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,012
I’m not going.

398
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:31,839
You are!

399
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,234
They're coming for you tomorrow.

400
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,374
I've already sold you.

401
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:39,522
How could you do this to me, Mom?

402
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:43,114
You have to repay me, Bo!

403
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:49,636
I’m not going.

404
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:51,057
You are.

405
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:52,801
What am I to you, Mom?!

406
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:54,933
How dare you talk back to me?

407
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,787
How dare you disobey me, Bo?!

408
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,760
You’re going!

409
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,730
I’m not going!

410
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:00,999
I'll beat you to death!

411
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:05,065
Let me go!

412
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,476
It’s me, Bo.

413
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:46,957
Take a sip first.

414
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,995
Mmm.

415
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,093
Does it hurt a lot, Bo?

416
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:01,297
No.

417
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,710
Thanks for helping me.

418
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:06,361
It’s okay, don’t make it a big deal.

419
00:37:11,872 --> 00:37:12,916
Kem.

420
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:15,807
Mom sold me off to the gambling den to pay off her debts.

421
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,137
I can’t take this anymore.

422
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:19,917
I don’t want to stay here.

423
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:22,397
Bo.

424
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:23,857
Don’t think too much about it.

425
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:26,957
I…

426
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,437
I’ve already paid off Bua’s debt.

427
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:38,140
My luck’s crap!

428
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:41,215
What’s the rush?

429
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,980
Big Boss sent me to ask.

430
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,929
When will you pay your debt?

431
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,447
I’ll pay when I have the money.

432
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:48,253
Can’t you see that?

433
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:49,711
I’m completely broke.

434
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,478
Hey!

435
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,803
But Big Boss said…

436
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:55,747
If you still don’t have the money.

437
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,423
Don’t bother showing your face here again.

438
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,430
What?!

439
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,579
You've got until the end of this month.

440
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,785
Or Big Boss will go claim your house.

441
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,245
What is this?!

442
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:09,543
You won’t let me come here, so where am I supposed to get the money?

443
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,614
That’s 200,000!

444
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,471
That’s your problem.

445
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,584
Damn Bo!

446
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,286
Bo!

447
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,867
I’ll sell my daughter.

448
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:29,509
She’ll take on my debts.

449
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:30,871
Go tell your Big Boss.

450
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:32,534
Make her your wife, or do whatever you want with her.

451
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,774
That’s up to your Big Boss.

452
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:36,228
That’s a tempting offer.

453
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:41,199
Then bring your daughter to meet Big Boss.

454
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,777
Let’s see how much she’s worth.

455
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,751
Fine!

456
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:54,089
Seksan!

457
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:55,797
What do you want?

458
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,817
How much does Bua owe Big Boss?

459
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:01,957
Why?

460
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:03,443
You’re going to pay it off?

461
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,677
Yes.

462
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,131
You’ve got guts!

463
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,767
But someone like you...

464
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,630
Where would you ever find that much money?

465
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,037
I just have it.

466
00:39:24,023 --> 00:39:25,525
So how much is it?

467
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:31,012
200,000.

468
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:39,542
What?!

469
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,517
Why would you pay that much for my mom?!

470
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,378
And where did you get all that money?!

471
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,867
Well…

472
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:50,845
I had some savings set aside for my parents.

473
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:52,765
But you don’t have to worry at all.

474
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:55,097
And you don’t have to pay me back.

475
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:56,546
I’m glad to help.

476
00:39:59,573 --> 00:40:01,314
I really don’t understand.

477
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:03,318
Why would you go this far for me?

478
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:15,280
I’d do anything for you.

479
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:20,553
I want to take care of you, Bo.

480
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:27,541
Bo.

481
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:35,672
I love you.

482
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,468
Will you be my girlfriend?

483
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:46,875
We’re friends, Kem.

484
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:48,531
Bo!

485
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:49,979
Bo, wait!

486
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:52,087
Bo! Please, wait!

487
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:53,090
Bo!

488
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:55,874
Bo.

489
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:57,829
Can you give me a chance, Bo?

490
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:02,308
It's not about giving chances.

491
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:04,348
But it’s about feelings.

492
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:06,245
I do love you, Kem.

493
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:08,039
But I love you as a friend.

494
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:11,225
And I've never felt more than that.

495
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:15,918
Bo.

496
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,251
Can you open up to me, Bo?

497
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:20,357
Please.

498
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:22,433
Bo.

499
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:28,459
Everything I've done, I did it all for you.

500
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,364
I’ve worked so hard.

501
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,773
Because I want to build a life with you.

502
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,953
I thought that one day, when I was ready…

503
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,968
I’d tell you how I feel.

504
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:40,559
Bo.

505
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,078
But why does it seem like…

506
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:47,378
You've never seen how much love I have for you?

507
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,168
Please don't make this any harder than it already is, Kem.

508
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,690
Everything you've done for me.

509
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,784
I truly appreciate it.

510
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:59,491
But what you just said.

511
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:02,637
I really can’t do it.

512
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:04,849
Bo!

513
00:42:05,712 --> 00:42:07,712
Please, Bo, I’m begging you.

514
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:08,565
If, in the end…

515
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,602
If you’re not happy.

516
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,361
I’ll step back myself.

517
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:18,505
Please, Bo, just give me a chance.

518
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,783
Please stop, Kem. I can only be your friend.

519
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:22,917
Bo!

520
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:25,459
Bo!

521
00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:27,577
Why, Bo?

522
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:28,970
Why am I not good enough?

523
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:31,107
Or what am I missing?

524
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:37,504
Or…

525
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,902
Because I'm not rich?

526
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,902
You think I can’t take care of you, right?!

527
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,773
I can take care of you, Bo!

528
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:53,471
Or…

529
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:57,591
You like rich people?

530
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:04,238
Right!

531
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:05,515
Because I'm not rich, am I?!

532
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,164
And what if it is, Kem?

533
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:12,818
If I want money, if I want a better life, what then, Kem?!

534
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:15,593
And more importantly…

535
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,249
I wouldn't have to rely on anyone like this.

536
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:19,467
It’s pathetic.

537
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:29,779
How could you do this to me, Kem?!

538
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:31,834
Bo.

539
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:33,640
I’m sorry, Bo.

540
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,070
I’m so sorry, Bo.

541
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,501
I didn’t mean to do that, Bo.

542
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:37,854
Please, Bo, I’m so sorry.

543
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:40,027
You can hit me, Bo! Hit me!

544
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:41,128
Please, just hit me!

545
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,089
Stop!

546
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:49,880
I…

547
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,122
I have to go.

548
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:23,554
How much is it for a massage?

549
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:24,553
I won’t charge.

550
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:26,151
What if I like it?

551
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,957
I booked this girl for the night.

552
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:32,991
But I'll let you have her.

553
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:34,601
Even if I tell you.

554
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:35,808
You wouldn’t be able to help me anyway.

555
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:37,495
If you want my help.

556
00:44:37,495 --> 00:44:38,662
Just say it.

557
00:44:38,662 --> 00:44:42,370
I know you’ve had a crush on Bo since forever.

558
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,740
Why don’t you just make Bo your wife?

559
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:45,492
So…
