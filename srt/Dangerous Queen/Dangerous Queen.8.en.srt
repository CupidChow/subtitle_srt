1
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:41,330
Isn’t your sister so talented?

2
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:43,662
What could I even do to her?

3
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,734
She won’t die because of me.

4
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:48,473
Queen!

5
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,193
Bo?!

6
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,209
I’ve given in to you on everything…

7
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,398
I don’t give this chance to just anyone.

8
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:02,694
Are you really going to give me another chance?

9
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,611
Can you try flirting with me in a normal way?

10
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:19,967
Flirting?

11
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,256
Yes.

12
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:28,168
I want us to know each other better.

13
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you not know me yet?

14
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,099
And do you think you really know me?

15
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,229
I don’t know.

16
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,154
Can you call yourself “Phi” for me?
(“Phi” — Thai term for “older one,” showing closeness or affection.)

17
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
Why?

18
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,896
Because I like it.

19
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:12,184
Come sit here.

20
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,473
“Phi” have a story to tell you.

21
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,544
Do you want to listen?

22
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,486
What story is it?

23
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,577
Once upon a time…

24
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:48,968
A family of wolves…

25
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,938
was born.

26
00:03:56,673 --> 00:04:01,368
They dreamed of becoming a perfect family.

27
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:08,858
A father.

28
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:10,234
A mother.

29
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,000
And their children.

30
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,102
All living happily together.

31
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,091
They also had loyal followers.

32
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:26,395
And plenty of food to feast on.

33
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,780
One day…

34
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:35,663
Key…

35
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,488
The youngest wolf pup.

36
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,314
It discovered the truth.

37
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:47,820
That, in fact…

38
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:53,254
Its family wasn’t as perfect as it seemed.

39
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,184
The father and mother never truly loved each other.

40
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,232
Key’s mother decided to leave the pack, taking Key and its older brother with her.

41
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,109
To start a new life.

42
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:26,841
At first…

43
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,463
Key’s mother really struggled.

44
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,240
But in the end…

45
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:39,297
She finally succeeded.

46
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,690
Key always admired his mother.

47
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:01,065
Key listened to everything she taught it.

48
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,169
Until one day, Key’s mother met another wolf.

49
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,430
Key was raised under its mother’s idea of perfection.

50
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:27,008
She shaped it to fit what society expected.

51
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,428
But she never once asked…

52
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:42,746
If it was ever truly happy.

53
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:51,194
So Key grew into a defiant wolf.

54
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,091
All Key ever wanted was freedom.

55
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:02,437
Key did everything it could to free itself from the cage its mother had built.

56
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,614
But one day…

57
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,725
Key came across a little rabbit.

58
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:36,768
The rabbit was a fighter.

59
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:40,028
And Key became interested in it.

60
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,143
It was never afraid of Key, even though Key was a wolf.

61
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,171
It did everything it could to survive.

62
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,000
One day…

63
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:21,922
Key saw it standing in the rain.

64
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,283
So Key called it over to take shelter.

65
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,428
At first…

66
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:42,239
Key thought of it as a little sister.

67
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,035
But as time went by…

68
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:55,193
The little rabbit began to make Key feel something strange.

69
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:14,632
It brightened Key’s life.

70
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,000
It made Key happier than it had ever been.

71
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,663
That rabbit…

72
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:54,000
made Key’s life whole.

73
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,232
And now…

74
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,579
Key has finally found its freedom.

75
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,751
It has found happiness in its own choices.

76
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Key now has a life of its own.

77
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,394
Is that the end?

78
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:30,667
Do you think…

79
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,319
a wolf and a rabbit could fall in love?

80
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,013
If they could…

81
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,027
Their first test…

82
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:46,229
would be trust, wouldn’t it?

83
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,170
Yes.

84
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,649
Then…

85
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,126
Can you trust me?

86
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,653
I’ll be a wolf that’s surrendered only to a rabbit like you.

87
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,855
Can you prove that right now?

88
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:27,245
That this wolf…

89
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,678
is already surrendered.

90
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,918
If I have to surrender to someone…

91
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
That person must be you.

92
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,695
Put it on me.

93
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:43,637
Queen…

94
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:09,470
You don’t have to go this far.

95
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:42,253
Once you put it on me…

96
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:46,035
It means you’ll always stand above me.

97
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,730
Tonight, I’ll love you in my own way.

98
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:52,757
I won’t hold back.

99
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,481
I won’t hide anything.

100
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,428
I forgot to mention…

101
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,428
Even if I’ve already surrendered…

102
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,674
I still bite my master.

103
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:00,457
(I allow you to stand above me.)

104
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:03,102
(I surrender…)

105
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,315
(Because if I were ever to surrender to someone…)

106
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:25,709
(That person…)

107
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:33,059
(would be you.)

108
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:57,104
Did you get to know me better last night?

109
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,482
Do you have to work today, Queen?

110
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,899
You don’t have to call me “Khun.”
(“Khun” — a polite Thai title used to address someone formally.)

111
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:18,576
What do you want me to call you then?

112
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:23,781
It’s up to you.

113
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,799
Baby?

114
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:42,202
Honey?

115
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:47,712
Anything.

116
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,696
There’s no such thing as “anything.”

117
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:55,892
Just tell me what you want me to call you.

118
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,895
Then what do you want to call your lover…

119
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:04,679
Babe?

120
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:25,789
What are you smiling at, Queen?

121
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:29,009
How did you get in here?

122
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:31,588
Don’t you know how to knock?

123
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:33,493
I’ve been knocking for a while.

124
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,178
You’re the one who was spacing out.

125
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:36,369
Who were you thinking about?

126
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,179
Here’s your coffee.

127
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,523
It might be a bit sweet these days.

128
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,008
I have a meeting.

129
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:48,463
Go do whatever you want.

130
00:22:49,362 --> 00:22:49,987
Yes.

131
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,486
What is it, mom?

132
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,561
(Do I need a reason to call you?)

133
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,790
Took you long enough to pick up.

134
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:44,798
(If there’s nothing, I’m hanging up.)

135
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:45,933
I’m broke.

136
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,104
Bring me some money.

137
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:49,944
I don’t have any money, mom.

138
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:51,583
(I don’t believe you.)

139
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:54,115
Or do you want me to go ask Queen instead?

140
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:55,341
(Mom!)

141
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,278
Are you giving it to me or not?

142
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,689
How much do you want?

143
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,283
Just give me whatever you have.

144
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:07,853
I’m going to the gambling den.

145
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:12,860
I’ll bring it to you.

146
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:16,241
But you have to promise you won’t bother Queen again.

147
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:19,135
If it’s not enough…

148
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:20,613
You don’t get to talk.

149
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,488
I have 500,000.

150
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:28,784
(Will you take it or not?)

151
00:24:29,454 --> 00:24:30,996
Of course, I will!

152
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,308
Hurry up and bring it.

153
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,791
I want cash. I’m going to the gambling den.

154
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:35,801
Where do you want me to bring it?

155
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,502
At home, of course, you idiot!

156
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:42,172
I’ll call you when I get there then.

157
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:44,407
Just hurry!

158
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,958
500,000…

159
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:07,225
Queen!

160
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:09,024
Kongtup’s dead!

161
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:11,020
What did you just say?!

162
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,168
Kongtup was shot.

163
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:14,663
We know who did it, but he’s still on the run.

164
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,104
It’s the same guy who killed Seksan.

165
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:18,084
His name is…

166
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:21,452
Kem!

167
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:54,743
I’m almost there.

168
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:57,104
You’re so slow. I’m almost at the den.

169
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:58,253
Hurry up and get here.

170
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:00,279
Where are you?

171
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,104
(Just keep walking this way.)

172
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:03,625
I’ll wait behind the den.

173
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:21,703
Babe!

174
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:23,799
Babe!

175
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:35,669
Babe!

176
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:49,255
Where are you, Sam?

177
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,475
I’m going.

178
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,923
Took you long enough to get here, Bo.

179
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,312
Why didn’t you just wait at home?

180
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:09,219
Give me the money.

181
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:16,952
Now that’s more like it.

182
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:19,973
I already gave you the money, mom.

183
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,322
Please don’t bother Queen again.

184
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,410
Kem…

185
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:34,636
Bo.

186
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:37,104
Finally, you’re here.

187
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:38,624
Where’s my money?

188
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,469
Is it in that bag?

189
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:49,199
What?

190
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:51,296
What’s with the face?

191
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:54,585
You really think this money’s enough?

192
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:56,705
Kem gave me more, so of course I took it.

193
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,096
Kem!

194
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,973
Aren’t the police after you?!

195
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:12,964
What are you doing here?!

196
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:14,684
I brought you money.

197
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:15,727
Money?

198
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,104
Why are you giving it to me?

199
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:20,448
In exchange for Bo.

200
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:24,057
I haven’t seen Bo in ages.

201
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:25,627
How am I supposed to find her?

202
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,280
I have a plan.

203
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:29,621
If you agree...

204
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,894
I’ll bring you the money.

205
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:34,663
How much?

206
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,197
500,000.

207
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:10,214
Where’s Babe?

208
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,138
She went that way.

209
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:24,112
Again, mom?

210
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,736
When will you stop doing this to me?

211
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:29,269
You’re an idiot.

212
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:35,811
Bo.

213
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,343
Stop right there!

214
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:42,892
This is the only way, Bo.

215
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:45,677
I have no other choice.

216
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:46,801
Bo.

217
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:47,599
Stop!

218
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:49,894
Bo.

219
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:53,571
Please run away with me.

220
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,920
You’re everything to me, Bo.

221
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:57,445
Please, Bo.

222
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:00,642
I won’t.

223
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:02,532
Please turn yourself in to the police.

224
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,014
Just take her and get it over with!

225
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,393
Give me my money so I can leave.

226
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:19,482
Quit babbling.

227
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:19,982
So annoying.

228
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:21,440
Shut up!

229
00:30:21,545 --> 00:30:22,104
Kem!

230
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,288
How dare you talk to me like that?!

231
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:25,996
You bastard! You scum!

232
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,147
Give me my money! I said give it to me!

233
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:29,873
Give it to me!

234
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:32,698
You’ve got a big mouth. I hope you get arrested!

235
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:40,646
You played me?!

236
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:43,865
How dare you?!

237
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:44,519
Yes!

238
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,466
For someone greedy like you…

239
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:47,961
can always be fooled by money!

240
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:49,172
So stupid!

241
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,066
Says you!

242
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,629
That’s why Bo could never love you!

243
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:55,572
You played me!

244
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:56,298
Stop it!

245
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:00,847
You played me!

246
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,521
Stop!

247
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,545
Careful, Queen.

248
00:31:31,312 --> 00:31:32,049
Queen!

249
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:40,934
Mom...

250
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,126
Mom!

251
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:02,170
Mom!

252
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:13,574
How could you do this, Kem?!

253
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:22,675
Babe!

254
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:24,501
Babe!

255
00:32:29,902 --> 00:32:30,763
Stop!

256
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:31,902
Or I’ll shoot!

257
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:38,142
Sam!

258
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:40,036
Drop your gun.

259
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:57,381
You just don’t die, do you?

260
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,439
I stabbed you and you didn't die.

261
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,754
I shot at you and you still didn't die.

262
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:05,689
But if I shoot you right now…

263
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,211
Do you think you’ll survive this time?

264
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,376
If you want revenge…

265
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:09,429
Take it out on me.

266
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:10,660
Leave everyone else out of this.

267
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,412
You sure have a big mouth.

268
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:13,588
Fine!

269
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:16,893
Come out here then.

270
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:22,882
Queen!

271
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,022
Get out of the way, Sam!

272
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:27,453
Queen.

273
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:29,694
I said get out!

274
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:39,047
Please stop, Queen!

275
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:42,311
Kem.

276
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:43,685
I’m begging you.

277
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,123
Please, stop.

278
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:48,963
Of course, Bo.

279
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:50,287
Of course.

280
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,394
Then come with me, Bo.

281
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,311
I’ll forget everything.

282
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,442
And the two of us…

283
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:01,113
We will start over together, Bo.

284
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:02,938
Sound good?

285
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:06,862
You know I can’t do that, Kem.

286
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,787
Why can’t you?!

287
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:13,918
Tell me!

288
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,896
Do I have to kill her first?!

289
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,558
Is that what it takes for you to come with me, Bo?!

290
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:20,932
Tell me!

291
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:24,163
I have to kill her, right?!

292
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:27,194
Babe!

293
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:29,013
If someone has to die today…

294
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,311
Let it be me.

295
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:38,497
Babe!

296
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:39,287
Stop!

297
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,980
Is this what I have to do for you to stop?

298
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,693
Is this what it takes?

299
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,942
If me being alive…

300
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,619
Only makes everything worse.

301
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,311
I’ll be the one to go.

302
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:05,000
So it finally ends.

303
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,908
Pull the trigger.

304
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:40,393
Just having you come back to me…

305
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:43,724
Is it really impossible?

306
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,570
It can never be the same, Kem.

307
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,443
Why does my life have to be like this?!

308
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:17,080
Why, Bo?

309
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,245
Answer me.

310
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:24,150
What did I do wrong?

311
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:27,877
Why did everyone betray me?

312
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,108
No one ever saw my worth.

313
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:41,870
Even you…

314
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,467
Bo.

315
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:47,193
I love you more than my own life.

316
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:49,954
But you still turned your back on me?

317
00:36:58,983 --> 00:36:59,770
Babe.

318
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,319
Queen.

319
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,490
I love you, Bo.

320
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,192
Kem!

321
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:06,673
Babe.

322
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:21,532
I’m right here with you.

323
00:38:25,986 --> 00:38:27,466
I can’t take this anymore.

324
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:30,895
If it wasn’t for me…

325
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,312
None of this would’ve happened.

326
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:37,875
But everything that happened…

327
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,388
has led me to you.

328
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,922
I will never let you go.

329
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:49,757
No matter what happens.

330
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,359
I’ll always be by your side.

331
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:03,951
Hold me tight, Babe.

332
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,538
Hold me.

333
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:11,077
You got some cash?

334
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:12,451
I’m off to play cards.

335
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,296
I’ve sold you to the den!

336
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:17,262
Mom!

337
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,203
I’d do anything for you.

338
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:28,015
I want to take care of you, Bo.

339
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:29,443
What did I do wrong?

340
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:33,339
Why did everyone betray me?

341
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:35,084
(Even you…)

342
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:56,485
I really miss your smile.

343
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:05,258
My smile hasn’t gone anywhere.

344
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:14,263
Thank you.

345
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:18,262
For always being by my side.

346
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,209
Stay with me like this for a long time.

347
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:33,991
Are you trying to…

348
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,505
I love you.

349
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:54,821
When someone says “I love you.”

350
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:58,414
What should the other person say?

351
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:25,337
I love you too.

352
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,128
Bonita.

353
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:44,449
Good morning, Kirin.

354
00:45:52,362 --> 00:45:54,009
What brings you here, Mom?

355
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:58,561
I have something to talk to you about.

356
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:05,940
Please, excuse me.

357
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:08,128
No need.

358
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,588
I have something to talk to you too, Bonita.

359
00:46:38,225 --> 00:46:39,192
Here’s your water.

360
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:49,956
Get up.

361
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,406
Get up.

362
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,259
Get up.

363
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:27,698
(Get up.)

364
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:36,741
Yes.

365
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:46,516
If you have something to say, please just say it, Mom.

366
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:51,231
About our deal…

367
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:09,867
What deal?

368
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:19,719
I’m sorry, Kirin.

369
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:23,293
I’m just here to tell you that…

370
00:48:24,813 --> 00:48:26,895
You don’t have to do it anymore.

371
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:35,177
Since Queen has chosen you.

372
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:41,768
Then I’ll have to do everything.

373
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,853
For Queen’s happiness.

374
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,580
Because…

375
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:47,720
You are everything to me.

376
00:49:55,782 --> 00:49:57,103
I’m happy…

377
00:49:58,487 --> 00:49:59,835
to see you happy.

378
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:15,941
But if you ever betray Queen…

379
00:50:16,238 --> 00:50:17,858
I would never do that.

380
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:24,812
We’ll see about that.

381
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:26,449
Bonita.

382
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,695
That’s all I came to say.

383
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,240
Thank you, Kirin.

384
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:43,053
For giving me a chance.

385
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:04,316
Please.

386
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,640
You can wait for Queen here, Babe.

387
00:54:11,617 --> 00:54:14,214
She should be done with her meeting soon.

388
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:16,456
Thank you, Sam.

389
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,463
My pleasure.

390
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:49,765
Bo.

391
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:50,885
Good afternoon.

392
00:54:51,312 --> 00:54:52,252
Good afternoon, King.

393
00:54:52,794 --> 00:54:54,251
You’re here to see Queen, aren’t you?

394
00:54:54,493 --> 00:54:56,575
She’s finishing up some paperwork in the meeting room.

395
00:54:56,575 --> 00:54:57,501
Just give her a moment.

396
00:54:58,058 --> 00:54:59,705
That’s alright. Thank you.

397
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:00,635
Have a seat.

398
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:02,599
Thank you.

399
00:55:05,966 --> 00:55:07,232
So you’re graduating soon, right?

400
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:09,692
Would you like to try working here?

401
00:55:11,457 --> 00:55:13,104
That sounds really interesting.

402
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,455
I’d get to stay close to Queen, too.

403
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:20,449
Has Queen ever told you her bedtime story?

404
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:22,822
How was it? Was it fun?

405
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,572
Yes, it was.

406
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:29,563
For Queen…

407
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:34,047
When she realized how much Mom had to go through raising us on her own.

408
00:55:34,872 --> 00:55:36,274
It changed her.

409
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:40,105
Being labeled as a broken family…

410
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,241
It wasn’t easy for Queen.

411
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,677
But at the same time…

412
00:55:46,357 --> 00:55:48,710
For a woman to raise two children all by herself.

413
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,102
It wasn’t easy either.

414
00:55:54,606 --> 00:55:56,715
She’s remarkable.

415
00:55:58,936 --> 00:56:01,045
Queen has always looked up to Mom as her role model.

416
00:56:02,302 --> 00:56:05,362
Sometimes that made her miss out on her own happiness.

417
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:13,038
If there’s someone who can make her happy.

418
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,935
I’m really glad…

419
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:19,130
That it’s you, Bo.

420
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,110
Yes?

421
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,814
Take care of my little sister for me.

422
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:30,535
Of course.

423
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:33,286
But…

424
00:56:33,411 --> 00:56:34,704
Your little sister…

425
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:37,061
is really stubborn and bossy.

426
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,062
You can be tough on her if you have to.

427
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:43,165
Just don’t ever stop loving her.

428
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:46,944
Yes.

429
00:56:52,697 --> 00:56:53,882
What are you two talking about?

430
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,201
This is my favorite spot.

431
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:39,810
It’s been a year, Babe.

432
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:43,013
You’re still you.

433
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:45,793
And I’m still me.

434
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:09,120
Our worlds…

435
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:12,619
have become one.

436
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:19,511
My world…

437
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:22,091
can’t exist without you.

438
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,758
And mine can’t exist without you either.

439
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:02,898
I’m yours.

440
00:59:07,017 --> 00:59:08,800
You’re the one I chose…

441
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,603
to be my favorite.

442
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:20,378
The one…

443
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:23,029
and only.

444
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,747
I’ve always been Queen’s favorite.

445
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:43,112
But now, you’re mine too.

446
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:48,867
So I’m giving this title to you.

447
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:52,315
Babe’s favorite.
