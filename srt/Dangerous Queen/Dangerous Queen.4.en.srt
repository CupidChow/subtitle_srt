1
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,720
I already paid off your debt at the den, Bua.

2
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,203
Why don’t you just make Bo your wife?

3
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,425
That debt you paid for me…

4
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,035
I’ll take it as the dowry.

5
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:48,192
Good morning.

6
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,038
My name is…

7
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,616
Bonita Piansakul.

8
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:52,307
I’m a second-year student in the Faculty of Economics.

9
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:54,800
Jumping into someone else’s car like this…

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,242
Do you think it’s the right thing to do?

11
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,335
You’d better have a good reason, Babe.

12
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,109
Could you drop me off at the university gate, please?

13
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,295
Let me ask you something.

14
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:08,531
Why don’t you want to go home?

15
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,800
It’s not that I don’t want to.

16
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:12,177
But I just can’t.

17
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:16,760
Why are you smiling?!

18
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:18,007
Come here!

19
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:20,982
We should get out of here.

20
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,064
Queen.

21
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,378
I’m not joking.

22
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,508
I won’t allow that.

23
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:35,929
I’m serious.

24
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,135
So am I.

25
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,621
You’re defying me.

26
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,489
I could defy you even more.

27
00:02:58,763 --> 00:02:59,770
(Where are they?!)

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,561
(Just keep looking!)

29
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,863
Where are you going?

30
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:16,666
You wouldn’t listen to me.

31
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,372
I thought you were different.

32
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:21,880
I thought you were better than those people.

33
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:24,757
But in the end…

34
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:27,907
You’re no different from them.

35
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,301
Check out this one.

36
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,000
This one?

37
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:45,969
Yeah, that one.

38
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:49,462
What are you guys up to?

39
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,730
We’re just hanging out!

40
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:53,041
Who sent you here?

41
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,713
What?! I said we were just hanging out!

42
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,000
Go buy yourself a new one.

43
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
And this, it’s mine now.

44
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,263
Back off!

45
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:23,814
And tell your boss this…

46
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,233
Stay away from my boss.

47
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,129
Get lost!

48
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,085
What were you guys doing?!

49
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:38,324
(I’m sorry, Boss.)

50
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:43,042
Did you get the photos?

51
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,520
(They took the phone.)

52
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:46,181
(All the photos are in there.)

53
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:54,328
Kongtup.

54
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,480
If you want to take Queen down…

55
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:58,667
You have to outsmart her.

56
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:11,533
I've found her weakness.

57
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,140
And I know exactly how to make use of it.

58
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:32,816
Bo!

59
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:34,800
What happened to your lips?!

60
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:36,487
Who did this?!

61
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:37,729
I’ll deal with them!

62
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,000
It’s alright, I already took care of it.

63
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,360
You can’t let this go! We’ve got strict rules here.

64
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,113
I’ll clear this up for you.

65
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:46,800
Fern needs to know about it.

66
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:48,653
Mint!

67
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:50,000
Don’t!

68
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,241
I’m fine.

69
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,737
I don’t want to make it a big deal.

70
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,412
I’m serious.

71
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:20,360
(You wouldn’t listen to me.)

72
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,440
(I thought you were different…)

73
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,024
(I thought you were better than those people.)

74
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:25,388
(But in the end…)

75
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,674
You’re no different from them.

76
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:38,784
Are you okay, Queen?!

77
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,020
Did you take care of everything already?!

78
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,699
Yes, King.

79
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,694
Kongtup’s already making his move.

80
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,399
You’ll have to be even more careful from now on.

81
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,817
This is no big deal.

82
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,583
I can handle everything.

83
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:06,536
I know you can, Queen.

84
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,385
But Kongtup’s not going to stop there.

85
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,639
I know.

86
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:17,678
But there can only be one winner.

87
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,555
(They said I’m your weak spot.)

88
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,503
(I don’t know what that means.)

89
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:37,327
What’s on your mind, Queen?

90
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,235
Nothing.

91
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,122
For the meeting tomorrow…

92
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:54,082
The board will definitely ask about the site for our new project.

93
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,213
I will not use that area.

94
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:58,709
I’ll present a new proposal.

95
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,239
I agree with you on this.

96
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:08,192
There are many other sites where we could build our new project.

97
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,761
Are you ready, Queen?

98
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

99
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:18,557
I’ve prepared everything for tomorrow’s meeting.

100
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:35,251
What is it?

101
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,683
What’s wrong with you?

102
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,631
Drinking all day…

103
00:09:43,755 --> 00:09:45,200
And slacking off like this.

104
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:51,799
I hired you to work.

105
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:55,149
Not to sit around like an idiot.

106
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,955
I think I’ve warned you before.

107
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:09,721
About Bua’s daughter.

108
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,414
If you’d listened to me from the start…

109
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:16,217
She would’ve been yours by now.

110
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,260
For a girl like that…

111
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:19,706
She’s all about the money.

112
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,941
Just like her mother.

113
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:28,842
A cheap girl like that...

114
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,364
How many men do you think she’s been through before you?

115
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,895
It's none of your business!

116
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,776
Alright!

117
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,905
I know.

118
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,843
I was just messing with you.

119
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,773
Let me warn you.

120
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,975
Don’t you ever talk about Bo like that again.

121
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,308
Or I’ll put a bullet in your head.

122
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,470
Alright, I get it.

123
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,112
I was only teasing.

124
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,223
Now give me my gun back.

125
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:09,060
Please?

126
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:14,561
Please?

127
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,129
You’re going to be done for, Kem.

128
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,640
For today’s agenda…

129
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,223
I’d like to discuss the site for our new project.

130
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,791
I would like to propose a new location…

131
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,994
To replace the current site in the slum area.

132
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,226
I believe that site…

133
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,872
isn’t suitable for our new project at this stage.

134
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,160
Not suitable? In what way, Keeraphat?

135
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,702
That site is right in the city center.

136
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,960
With convenient access to transportation.

137
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:15,000
Why risk a new site?

138
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:17,505
When we already have a prime one in hand.

139
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,607
It’s a matter of timing, Songpol.

140
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:22,680
I don’t think it’s suitable yet.

141
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:27,796
And also, the issues that follow would only delay the process.

142
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,655
In which the delay comes from negotiating with residents to reclaim the land.

143
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:36,367
How is that difficult?

144
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,920
Just use the law to move them out.

145
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,961
Do you really think it’s that simple, Songpol?

146
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,118
Of course it is.

147
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,400
It’s just a minor relocation issue.

148
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:49,595
That’s it.

149
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,064
According to the data I have.

150
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,214
This community covers 41 rai.

151
00:12:56,798 --> 00:13:00,000
With more than 1,800 households.

152
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:01,687
Over 8,000 people.

153
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:07,242
What makes negotiations most difficult is their deep attachment to the land.

154
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:10,624
If we rely only on the law…

155
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:15,291
I don’t believe we could relocate them within one or two years.

156
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:19,720
It’s an ideal site, Keeraphat.

157
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,720
It’s spacious and perfect for the project.

158
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,555
Especially, it’s right in the city center.

159
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:31,547
It should be developed like the surrounding areas.

160
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:35,760
Not left as a blind spot.

161
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,552
I still insist…

162
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,624
we can resolve this legally.

163
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,159
The law has its limits.

164
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,872
And so should those who use it.

165
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,150
If the residents resist and protest.

166
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:57,115
Our company’s reputation could be at risk.

167
00:13:57,474 --> 00:13:58,376
Moreover…

168
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:02,791
The site I’m about to propose is just as suitable.

169
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,934
It’s an open space…

170
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,901
That requires no demolition.

171
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,677
It also has convenient transportation access.

172
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:15,827
The only drawback is…

173
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,801
It’s not in the city center.

174
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:28,302
What’s everyone’s opinion on this?

175
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:30,563
I agree with Songpol.

176
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:34,710
This new project should be built on that site only.

177
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,114
I don’t think we need another location.

178
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,367
I agree with Keeraphat.

179
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:44,526
The biggest problem with that site is the residents.

180
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:46,992
Solving it would be complicated.

181
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:49,700
And the new project would be delayed.

182
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,287
Then why don’t we hold a vote?

183
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:55,235
In the next meeting.

184
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:57,418
Why not today?

185
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,463
I’ve already prepared all the data.

186
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,840
Why be in such a hurry, Keeraphat?

187
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,956
Give the board some time to gather information and decide.

188
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:12,054
Then we can vote in the next meeting.

189
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,178
If that’s the case, I have no objection.

190
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,465
This meeting is concluded.

191
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,296
Songpol!

192
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:51,524
May I have a word with you, Keeraphat?

193
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:57,742
Please, have a seat.

194
00:15:59,003 --> 00:15:59,971
Do you know why…

195
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:03,435
you’re not fit to be president?

196
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:08,471
Why is that?

197
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,847
Because you’re different from your father.

198
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,306
Jenphop…

199
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,227
Always put the company’s interests first.

200
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,251
But you…

201
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,668
Even knowing how much profit the company would gain from that land.

202
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,909
Still insist on finding a replacement site.

203
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:30,000
This is not a charity, Keeraphat.

204
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,165
You don’t need to protect those people.

205
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:38,723
Why don’t you go into politics instead?

206
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,567
That way you could truly work for the people.

207
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,129
That’s not what I have in mind.

208
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,919
I just don’t want to exploit anyone.

209
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,548
When they’ve done nothing wrong.

210
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,764
Just be direct, Keeraphat.

211
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:02,494
Everyone knows it.

212
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,095
The reason you won’t relocate the villagers…

213
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:09,859
is because you’re afraid it will affect Wasin’s election, isn’t that right?

214
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,622
That district belongs to Wasin.

215
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,467
There are thousands of people there.

216
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,632
That’s no small number of votes.

217
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:25,597
Think whatever you like.

218
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,102
I only came by to give you a little reminder.

219
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,784
I don’t want to see your efforts go to waste.

220
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,018
Did Songpol come to see you?!

221
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:00,417
Yes.

222
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,851
It seems he won’t give up that easily.

223
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:06,668
He’ll do whatever it takes to push that project through in that area.

224
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:10,948
I think he might’ve made a deal under the table with those construction companies.

225
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:13,940
Anyway, forget about that for now.

226
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,728
By the way…

227
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,382
Yes?

228
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,889
I heard you’ve been a bit distracted lately.

229
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,441
What are you talking about, King?

230
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,308
I’m talking about the girl you told Sam to keep an eye on.

231
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,211
Sam…

232
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,458
Let me ask you straight, Queen.

233
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,493
Do you really like that girl?

234
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:48,745
Why would you think that?

235
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,781
Because I’ve never seen my little sister act this way with anyone before.

236
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:00,182
I see her as a younger sister, that’s all.

237
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,326
Kongtup is using that girl.

238
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:07,736
I just don’t want anyone to get in trouble because of me.

239
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:09,516
That’s it.

240
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,452
You don’t believe me, King?

241
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,129
It’s not that I don’t believe you.

242
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,708
But I think you might be confused about something.

243
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,271
Have you ever done something bad to someone…

244
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:37,056
and couldn’t forget it?

245
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,070
You’re saying this because…?

246
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:44,638
I did something wrong to her.

247
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:48,428
And now she’s angry at me.

248
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,795
So you’re asking me because…

249
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:53,356
you want to make it up to her, right?

250
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:57,308
I’m just asking as a lesson.

251
00:19:58,139 --> 00:19:59,188
Just want to know…

252
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,273
what you’d do.

253
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,413
Then let me give you a lesson, Queen.

254
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:05,627
First…

255
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,869
I’d ask myself.

256
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,639
If that person really matters enough for me to spend time making it right.

257
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:13,599
And the second?

258
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:18,149
I’d ask if I truly feel bad for what I did.

259
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,989
You’re asking me this…

260
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,584
Because you feel guilty toward her, aren’t you?

261
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,062
All I can do is give you that lesson, Queen.

262
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:35,780
In the end…

263
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:37,642
The decision’s yours.

264
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,207
I’m just asking as a lesson.

265
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,699
It’s not like I’m going to do anything.

266
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:02,794
I’m sorry!

267
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,828
Get in my car.

268
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:10,565
I won’t.

269
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,983
Or else, I’ll kiss you right here.

270
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,308
You already see me as a bad person anyway.

271
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:24,781
I’m asking you seriously.

272
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,023
What do you want from me?

273
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,297
Get in my car.

274
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:31,708
I won’t.

275
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,867
I’m not getting in your car.

276
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,828
Not until you apologize to me.

277
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:38,977
What makes you think you can order me around?

278
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:42,413
Then what makes you stand here right now?

279
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:45,128
Babe.

280
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:46,001
Get in the car.

281
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,017
I won’t.

282
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:49,530
I’m not doing what you say.

283
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,308
Not until you say sorry first.

284
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:52,708
Get in the car.

285
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,604
I won’t.

286
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,624
Sorry.

287
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:02,378
For what?

288
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:05,245
That I kissed you.

289
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:07,053
When you didn’t allow me to.

290
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:10,363
You knew I didn’t.

291
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:11,872
Why did you kiss me then?

292
00:22:14,314 --> 00:22:15,662
I already said sorry.

293
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:19,289
Why are you still angry at me?

294
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,484
Let me go, Queen.

295
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,039
Where are you taking me?!

296
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:25,608
I told you to let go!

297
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,214
If you don’t accept my apology.

298
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:34,782
I’m not letting you go anywhere.

299
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:49,171
You just said sorry a moment ago!

300
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,085
Then accept it.

301
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:00,640
Huh? Seriously?

302
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:06,726
I don’t want to talk to a bossy person.

303
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,679
Are you saying I’m bossy?

304
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:13,788
Is what you’re doing not being bossy?

305
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:16,403
You’re forcing me to accept your apology.

306
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,687
I don’t even know if you’re truly sorry.

307
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:26,171
I warned you.

308
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:31,781
If you keep being stubborn.

309
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,419
I’ll kiss you right here.

310
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:43,272
Queen.

311
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:10,308
Alright!

312
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:14,011
I’m not mad at you anymore.

313
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,214
I’ll accept your apology.

314
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,183
Happy now?

315
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:47,900
Birds…

316
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,536
Pretty birds…

317
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:50,215
They’re about to kiss.

318
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,659
Kem.

319
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:25,046
Bo.

320
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:27,858
I’m sorry, Bo.

321
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:31,159
Please, forgive me.

322
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:33,944
Please, give me another chance.

323
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:36,689
I’m begging you, Bo, please.

324
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:39,773
Kem.

325
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:41,688
Just go back, please.

326
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:51,179
Why, Bo?

327
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,448
I promise.

328
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,015
I’ll take good care of you.

329
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:58,712
You know that all this time…

330
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:00,682
Everything that I did was all for you.

331
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:03,132
I just don’t understand.

332
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:04,868
Why are you acting like this?

333
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:09,055
Bo.

334
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,216
Do you not love me anymore?

335
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:15,142
I’ve told you before, Kem.

336
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,274
I only see you as a friend.

337
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,060
Please don’t do this.

338
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,086
Why, Bo?

339
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,289
I promise, okay?

340
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,102
From now on, I’ll take good care of you.

341
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:29,973
You know I’ve always done everything for you.

342
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:32,541
I don’t understand.

343
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:34,864
Why are you like this?

344
00:26:35,824 --> 00:26:36,438
Bo.

345
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,055
Do you really not love me anymore?

346
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:41,786
Why are you trying to get away from me?

347
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:50,113
I’ve told you, I only see you as a friend, Kem.

348
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,521
Please, don’t do this anymore.

349
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,694
Are you scared of me, Bo?!

350
00:26:58,398 --> 00:26:59,420
It’s me!

351
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,454
What did I do to you?!

352
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:04,506
Why can’t you give me another chance?

353
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,237
Is it so wrong that I love you?

354
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,072
It’s that wrong, right?!

355
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:13,601
Tell me!

356
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:14,243
Kem!

357
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:15,365
Is it that wrong?!

358
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:16,700
Let me go! You’re hurting me!

359
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:17,728
Please, let me go!

360
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:18,228
Bo.

361
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:18,759
I’m sorry.

362
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,730
I’m really sorry, Bo.

363
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:23,938
How about this, Bo?

364
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:26,535
Let’s go home and talk.

365
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:27,532
Please.

366
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,008
Let’s go home together.

367
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,639
So this is the one, right, Bo?

368
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,582
The one who’s going to steal you from me.

369
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,268
Why are you messing with my woman?!

370
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,741
What are you saying, Kem?!

371
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,276
I’m telling the truth!

372
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,708
Before she came along, you were good to me!

373
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,058
But after she showed up.

374
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:12,653
You started ignoring me.

375
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,028
Why?!

376
00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:16,984
Is it fun for you?!

377
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,588
If you’re so rich, why don’t you get your own woman?!

378
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,088
Why are you messing with mine?!

379
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,249
Stop it, Kem!

380
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:23,078
I won’t!

381
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:24,179
Why?!

382
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:26,122
Can’t you accept the truth?!

383
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,119
Do you even know what I’ve done for you?!

384
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,424
Everthing!

385
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,611
I took care of you and your mom.

386
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:33,588
I even paid off your debt.

387
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:35,348
And this is what you do to me?!

388
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:38,961
What am I to you?!

389
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,035
A joke?!

390
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,272
What are you doing?! Let me go!

391
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:43,317
Let me go!

392
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:45,308
Let me go!

393
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,706
I’ve never thought before.

394
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,926
That what Seksan said about you was true.

395
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:57,308
He said you were just after money.

396
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:58,774
Why?!

397
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,200
It’s because I’m poor, right?!

398
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,079
So you went to her instead?!

399
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,989
Stop it, Kem!

400
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:03,371
I’ve never thought before.

401
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:05,188
That you’d turn out like this.

402
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:07,024
I used to trust you…

403
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:07,988
love you!

404
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,773
But not anymore!

405
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:12,069
I can never love you.

406
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:15,668
Not even as a friend.

407
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,064
Leave me alone, Kem.

408
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,651
Listen to me!

409
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,627
If I hadn’t wasted my time taking care of you.

410
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:28,828
My life would’ve been so much better!

411
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,668
The reason I’m still poor like this…

412
00:29:31,014 --> 00:29:33,308
is because I have to feed you and your mom!

413
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,948
If it weren’t for you.

414
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:38,612
I would’ve gotten out of this vicious cycle long ago!

415
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:42,667
You…

416
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,072
are nothing but a gold-digger!

417
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:47,954
Let me go!

418
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,082
Let go!

419
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,124
Listen to me!

420
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:55,668
I’m going to destroy you.

421
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,167
Wherever you go, whoever you’re with.

422
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,259
I’ll come for you.

423
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:01,548
You’ll never find happiness again!

424
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:02,411
Kem!

425
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,268
Let me go!

426
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,573
Beg me.

427
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,499
Beg me…

428
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,692
and I’ll help you.

429
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,037
What do I have to give in return?

430
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,018
My satisfaction.

431
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,716
Alright.

432
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:55,828
Good choice…

433
00:30:56,308 --> 00:30:56,977
Babe.

434
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:09,063
What are you going to do?

435
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:12,225
Pay off your debt.

436
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:19,054
Is 500,000 enough?

437
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:22,901
500,000 what?!

438
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:23,839
I don’t want it!

439
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:39,694
Bo...

440
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:40,925
Bo!

441
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,602
Don’t go, Bo!

442
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:44,080
Come back!

443
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:46,018
Let me go!

444
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:47,029
I don’t want your money!

445
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:48,444
I want my woman back!

446
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:50,105
Come back, Bo!

447
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:53,759
Let me go!

448
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,965
Just remember me.

449
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:56,460
One day…

450
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,755
She’s going to play you, just like she did to me!

451
00:32:01,782 --> 00:32:03,592
Let me go!

452
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:57,912
We’ve got nothing left, Mom.

453
00:34:58,215 --> 00:34:59,319
You’re selling off everything!

454
00:34:59,319 --> 00:34:59,823
Yes!

455
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:00,931
I’ll sell off everything!

456
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:01,875
And it’s none of your damn business!

457
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:06,676
Please, don’t gamble anymore.

458
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:08,860
I don’t know how I can keep finding money for you anymore.

459
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:09,756
Bo!

460
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,027
I’m your mother.

461
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:13,569
Your job is to bring me money!

462
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,403
You’ve got no right to talk to me like this!

463
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:18,213
Bua!

464
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,494
Please…

465
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:22,963
I had some savings set aside for my parents.

466
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:25,409
And you don’t have to pay me back.

467
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,877
I’m glad to help.

468
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:30,062
Mom took my tuition money.

469
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:31,836
And she also sold my bike.

470
00:35:32,252 --> 00:35:33,727
How much is your tuition?

471
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,116
Let me help you pay for it.

472
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:36,471
I really appreciate it.

473
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:38,130
It’s really just you…

474
00:35:38,357 --> 00:35:39,164
who’s always there for me.

475
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:47,248
Is it so wrong that I love you?

476
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:49,002
It’s that wrong, right?!

477
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,415
Do you even know what I’ve done for you?!

478
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:56,835
Everthing!

479
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:59,015
I took care of you and your mom.

480
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:01,031
I even paid off your debt.

481
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:05,856
Listen to me!

482
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:08,898
If I hadn’t wasted my time taking care of you.

483
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,130
My life would’ve been so much better!

484
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,311
You…

485
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:14,808
are nothing but a gold-digger!

486
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:19,668
Beg me.

487
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:23,688
Beg me…

488
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,515
and I’ll help you.

489
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,663
Why did you help me?

490
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:01,240
Because you begged me.

491
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,240
Are you not going to ask me?

492
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:22,686
About who that guy was?

493
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:27,566
That’s your personal matter.

494
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,313
Also…

495
00:37:57,389 --> 00:37:58,356
When you’re with me…

496
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,287
Never look down for anyone.

497
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:06,022
Do you understand?

498
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:20,540
What about our deal?

499
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:24,536
What do I have to do to satisfy you?

500
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:32,705
We’ll talk about that later.

501
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:54,182
What are you doing, Babe?!

502
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:57,988
Is this what you want?

503
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,652
The thing that satisfies you.

504
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:09,768
I’ll do what you said to make you satisfied.

505
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:11,975
Get down!

506
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:34,316
Get up.

507
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:41,557
Come here.

508
00:40:58,828 --> 00:41:00,828
Stop whatever you’re thinking right now.

509
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:04,896
I don’t always see through you, Babe.

510
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:12,555
But what you just did…

511
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,142
wasn’t cute.

512
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,159
Go take a shower.

513
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:24,794
We’ll talk after.

514
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:51,956
(What do I have to give in return?)

515
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:53,530
(My satisfaction.)

516
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:57,776
I don’t usually sit like this.

517
00:43:59,557 --> 00:44:00,937
It’s not comfortable.

518
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,735
I’m putting my earphones on.

519
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,258
You can sing as loud as you want, or do whatever you like.

520
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:18,250
I won’t hear anything.

521
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:22,198
Listen to this song.

522
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:08,645
About our deal…

523
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:10,432
What do I have to do?

524
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:16,441
You’ll have to take care of me personally.

525
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,494
In everything.

526
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:23,233
I don’t think I’m capable enough to do that.

527
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,083
I’m not looking for someone capable.

528
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,847
It’d hurt less if you just criticized me directly.

529
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:38,104
You’ll be taking care of me after working hours.

530
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:41,976
Which means after your classes end.

531
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:45,421
But I have to go work at the club.

532
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:48,567
I don’t give this kind of opportunity to anyone.

533
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:49,741
How much do they pay you there?

534
00:47:51,692 --> 00:47:52,865
I’ll pay you double.

535
00:47:59,065 --> 00:48:01,331
It sounds like you think I’m only after money.

536
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:07,728
When you work…

537
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:09,691
you get paid.

538
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:15,426
Staying here with me…

539
00:48:17,073 --> 00:48:19,280
I can guarantee your safety.

540
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,227
And your job…

541
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:28,051
is to satisfy me.

542
00:48:58,183 --> 00:48:59,651
May I ask you something?

543
00:49:03,218 --> 00:49:05,631
Why are you letting me get this close to you?

544
00:49:06,038 --> 00:49:07,093
Do you trust me?

545
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:12,423
That’s the question you should ask yourself.

546
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:17,488
How much I can really trust you.

547
00:49:30,044 --> 00:49:32,044
I will do whatever it takes to make you trust me.

548
00:49:35,994 --> 00:49:37,049
I’ll see about that...

549
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:38,835
Babe.

550
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:23,939
Are you going to sleep standing there?

551
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:29,328
I can…

552
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:32,104
sleep right here.

553
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,222
Come sleep on the bed.

554
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:49,265
Bed it is.

555
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,618
Do you want to fall off?

556
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,340
Queen?!

557
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:56,250
Just sleep properly.

558
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:11,214
There’s something I want to warn you about.

559
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:20,104
Don’t ever do that again.

560
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:29,001
I only trust you 10%.

561
00:52:32,893 --> 00:52:34,421
Please don’t make it zero.

562
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:16,471
I woke up late.

563
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:18,257
Why didn’t you wake me up?

564
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:33,001
Put your shirt on properly.

565
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:37,445
You didn’t see anything, right?

566
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:40,856
If I didn’t see anything…

567
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:42,554
would I have said something?

568
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:51,896
You might be in the news with me after this.

569
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:56,104
Am I getting you in trouble?

570
00:54:58,223 --> 00:54:59,544
I just want to tell you.

571
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:02,482
If someone asks you about this.

572
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:05,923
Just tell them you’re Queen’s.

573
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:08,861
That way, you’ll be safe.

574
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:12,486
If I say that…

575
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:15,542
Won’t you get in even more trouble?

576
00:55:17,337 --> 00:55:18,422
Why would I be in trouble?

577
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,987
Because I’m just some girl.

578
00:55:24,398 --> 00:55:25,483
Who ran away from home.

579
00:55:25,978 --> 00:55:27,122
Working in a club.

580
00:55:27,883 --> 00:55:28,849
But you…

581
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:30,755
You’re from...

582
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:32,807
a wealthy family.

583
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:34,682
And hold a high position.

584
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:38,104
I don’t want anyone to use me to attack you.

585
00:55:39,748 --> 00:55:41,039
Don’t think for me.

586
00:55:41,978 --> 00:55:43,240
I’m just telling the truth.

587
00:55:44,105 --> 00:55:45,514
What’s so bad about being mine?

588
00:55:47,976 --> 00:55:50,104
You know how different we are.

589
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:51,910
I don’t want to aim too high.

590
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:53,845
When you fall…

591
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,897
It hurts.

592
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:00,855
If you don’t want to get hurt…

593
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,708
Then hold on to it tightly.

594
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:18,357
Perfect timing.

595
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,174
Good morning.

596
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:25,829
Good morning.

597
00:56:51,802 --> 00:56:53,802
Is there something you needed, King?

598
00:56:56,305 --> 00:56:59,250
Sam told me my little sister’s got a girl staying here.

599
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,657
So, I just wanted to see for myself.

600
00:57:15,419 --> 00:57:17,567
You’ve seen her now, so why don’t you head back?

601
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:21,487
I just got here.

602
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:22,949
Why are you rushing me out already?

603
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,165
I didn’t think…

604
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:30,951
Babe would be this cute.

605
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:39,815
Her name is Bo.

606
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:45,131
Bonita.

607
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,982
Bo.

608
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,034
Fern told me…

609
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,702
You quit?

610
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,249
Mmm.

611
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,246
I got a new job.

612
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,428
A new job?!

613
00:58:23,746 --> 00:58:24,653
What kind of job?

614
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:26,558
Not telling.

615
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:29,555
So, you’re keeping secrets from me now?

616
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,531
Isn’t that Queen’s car?

617
00:58:44,496 --> 00:58:45,610
What is she doing here?

618
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,143
Bo!

619
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,111
Keep your phone ready.

620
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:55,591
You’re telling me everything.

621
00:59:08,436 --> 00:59:09,491
Hello?

622
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:15,737
Huh?!

623
00:59:17,296 --> 00:59:18,203
What’s going on?

624
00:59:18,737 --> 00:59:19,644
Hold on, Ging.

625
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,578
Bo!

626
00:59:22,578 --> 00:59:25,752
Ging’s mom isn’t doing well and got moved to the ICU this morning.

627
00:59:25,752 --> 00:59:27,815
Can you cover my shift today?

628
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:31,701
I want to stay with Ging, but I don’t want to call in last minute.

629
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:32,923
Please.

630
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:37,186
Sure.

631
00:59:37,186 --> 00:59:38,302
I’ll go in for you today.

632
00:59:38,302 --> 00:59:39,391
You should stay with Ging.

633
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,192
Thank you so much, Bo.

634
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:42,911
We’ve got a lot of reservations today too.

635
00:59:54,578 --> 00:59:55,633
Good afternoon, Sam.

636
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:56,519
Good afternoon, Babe.

637
00:59:56,837 --> 00:59:57,508
Please.

638
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:03,210
Good afternoon.

639
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:11,863
Watch your head.

640
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:13,384
Thank you.

641
01:00:28,689 --> 01:00:30,335
Is there something you want to tell me?

642
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:36,830
I…

643
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,034
I have to work at the club today.

644
01:00:49,624 --> 01:00:50,797
But I have a reason.

645
01:00:58,056 --> 01:00:58,993
What reason?

646
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,426
If it’s not good enough…

647
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:05,803
I’m not letting you go.

648
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:14,367
I’m going to cover Mint’s shift tonight.

649
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:22,975
Mint who works with me at the club.

650
01:01:24,356 --> 01:01:25,263
She’s called Bunny.

651
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:35,520
Mint’s girlfriend’s mom got into the ICU, so Mint’s going to be with her.

652
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:41,176
May I go?

653
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:50,104
That’s up to you.

654
01:01:56,105 --> 01:01:57,455
But I’m going with you.

655
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:06,615
Why?

656
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:10,233
Can’t I just chill there?

657
01:02:13,545 --> 01:02:15,043
Sure.

658
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:17,918
Why can’t you...?

659
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,530
I’ll drop you off at the club first.

660
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:29,707
After I finish work…

661
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,819
I’ll come join you.

662
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,490
Okay.

663
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:39,068
Thank you.

664
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:49,139
Yes.

665
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,453
This way, Queen.

666
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,567
Bie has already let me know you’d be coming.

667
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:13,461
Please, have a seat at your table.

668
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:18,453
Where’s the girl who told you?

669
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,204
Bie’s already been booked for the night.

670
01:03:25,437 --> 01:03:26,787
I sincerely apologize.

671
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:49,279
Would you like me to send someone else to serve you?

672
01:03:49,957 --> 01:03:50,806
No.

673
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,360
I’ll handle it myself.

674
01:03:54,276 --> 01:03:55,036
Yes.

675
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:33,202
Queen just left for work.

676
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:34,398
I’m not here for Queen.

677
01:04:34,546 --> 01:04:35,515
I’m here for you.

678
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,104
If I wanted to buy your secrets from this girl.

679
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:40,497
I could pay you much more than Queen.

680
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:41,638
Ask her then.

681
01:04:41,786 --> 01:04:43,153
I’d like to know that too.

682
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,937
What do you want from me?

683
01:04:45,242 --> 01:04:47,655
Once you’ve crossed the finish line.

684
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:49,420
The victory is yours.

685
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,523
But if you refuse to accept it.

686
01:04:51,523 --> 01:04:53,747
Then you’ve given it up to someone else.
