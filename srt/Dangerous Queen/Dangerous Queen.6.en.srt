1
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,216
What happened last night?

2
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:41,483
You don’t remember?

3
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:43,110
Is there anything I should remember?

4
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,241
Should I remind you what happened?

5
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:47,535
So it’s you.

6
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:48,993
The rich one who’s taking my daughter.

7
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:50,001
Good that you’re here.

8
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,326
I’m her mother.

9
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:52,811
If you’re going to take care of her.

10
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,982
You’ll have to take care of me too.

11
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,376
I’ll pay you 1 million.

12
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,930
And you’ll have to stay away from Bonita.

13
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,595
Do you really want to be above me that much?

14
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,743
If I’m above you…

15
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,052
And you have to look up at me…

16
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:06,512
What are you about to do?

17
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,513
Want to take a shower together?

18
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,999
Queen just left for work.

19
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:13,355
I’m not here for Queen.

20
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:14,659
I’m here for you.

21
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,314
Here’s your water.

22
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,146
Sit on the chair.

23
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:28,726
Yes.

24
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,388
You’re a dream mother to me, Kirin.

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,127
Now I understand why Queen is such an amazing person.

26
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,369
Because she has a great role model.

27
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you trying to flatter me?

28
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:58,702
Not at all.

29
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,549
I’m just happy…

30
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,422
That Queen has a mother that truly loves…

31
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,992
and truly cares about her.

32
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,106
I’ve never had that.

33
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,961
After I got remarried…

34
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,769
I haven’t had much time for my children.

35
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,242
That might be the reason Queen changed.

36
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,000
But I still have expectations for both my children.

37
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:32,805
Even when it comes to their future partners.

38
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,044
I want nothing less than the best for my children.

39
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,510
Someone truly worthy of them.

40
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:50,000
As for you, Bonita...

41
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,468
You’ll never be enough for Queen.

42
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,812
I haven’t even gotten my money back yet!

43
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:22,091
And now the gambling den’s closed.

44
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,525
Where am I supposed to get money now?

45
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,853
Your daughter’s dating someone rich, isn’t she?

46
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,751
Then just get the money from her.

47
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:00,748
Please come back, Bo.

48
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:04,046
Bo…

49
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,339
If you see this clip…

50
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,834
Please know that…

51
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,782
I miss you.

52
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,052
I miss you so much, Bo.

53
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,203
I know that…

54
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,741
You’re with that rich person.

55
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:26,129
The one named Queen.

56
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,808
She used money to buy you from me.

57
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:32,223
She has everything.

58
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:33,173
She’s rich.

59
00:05:34,846 --> 00:05:35,762
But Bo…

60
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:39,674
Can you really leave me like this?

61
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,001
I love you so much, Bo.

62
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,122
Bo…

63
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:50,000
Bo…

64
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,350
But I’m not mad at you, Bo.

65
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:56,826
Because I know…

66
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:00,000
The one who changed you…

67
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:02,592
is that rich woman you’re with.

68
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,852
Queen.

69
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,125
She made you forget about me.

70
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,573
Forgot about our home.

71
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,990
Forgot about your life.

72
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,863
Bo…

73
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,441
If you see this clip…

74
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,005
Please come back to me, Bo.

75
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,832
I miss you.

76
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:28,023
I love you so much, Bo

77
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,263
Please come back.

78
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:32,841
Please come back.

79
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:51,164
You did a great job.

80
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,631
I’m really proud of you.

81
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:57,667
I’ve never thought that…

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Bonita’s mom would go this far.

83
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:05,171
Everything’s going just as I planned.

84
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:06,938
Good.

85
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:19,344
For a dog…

86
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,527
If you feed it once…

87
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,736
It will always come back for more.

88
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:29,703
And I…

89
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,118
will be the one who feeds it.

90
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,571
Yes.

91
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:40,522
But I’ll have to discuss it with Queen first.

92
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,815
I’ve already shut all the news down.

93
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:02,275
And I’ve received the terms.

94
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,730
What would you do next, Queen?

95
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:05,448
Prepare everything according to the terms.

96
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:06,598
Yes.

97
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,050
(Please come back, Bo)

98
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:23,699
(I miss you so much, Bo.)

99
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:24,830
What?!

100
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,810
You scared me!

101
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:27,089
Bo.

102
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:29,608
Isn’t this your mom?!

103
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,874
Yes…

104
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:42,743
It’s gone.

105
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,394
Try clicking it again.

106
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:47,645
It’s really gone.

107
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,184
Bo.

108
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:52,231
I’m late.

109
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,168
I have to go to class.

110
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,126
Or I’ll miss the roll call.

111
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,030
Okay, you should hurry.

112
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:13,012
Where did it go?

113
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:25,175
Babe.

114
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:28,959
Queen.

115
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,316
That clip of my mom...

116
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:31,765
I’ve taken care of everything.

117
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,466
You mean…

118
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,302
You deleted that clip?

119
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:46,998
But there’s still something…

120
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:49,361
I have to take care of.

121
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:51,725
Yes...?

122
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:53,959
Get in the car.

123
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,112
Why…?

124
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,000
Because what I still have to take care of...

125
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:07,809
is you.

126
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:26,712
Where did my clip go?

127
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:35,000
Bo!

128
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:35,964
You!

129
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:40,574
Bo…

130
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:42,730
You really came back.

131
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,127
I’ve missed you so much, Bo.

132
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:47,754
How have you been?

133
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:49,204
Bo…

134
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:50,302
Bo…

135
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,828
Did you miss me at all?

136
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,589
Let’s get straight to the point.

137
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,772
Read it carefully before you sign.

138
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,321
The money you demand.

139
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:38,588
In exchange for Bonita’s freedom for good.

140
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,375
A house and land as you requested.

141
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:47,694
All current debts paid in full.

142
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,463
Queen…?

143
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,735
Can I just sign that already?!

144
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:02,693
Mom…

145
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,385
You’re not my daughter!

146
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:10,732
Will you let your mom sign this?

147
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:22,883
I just told you!

148
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:24,539
She’s not my daughter!

149
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,386
Why would you ask her?!

150
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,646
Yes.

151
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,040
That’s it!

152
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,057
If you don’t stop ruining Bonita’s and my reputations.

153
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:50,231
Let me warn you.

154
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,852
I won’t let you get away with it.

155
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,897
Just leave.

156
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:55,981
You’ve said enough.

157
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:57,656
Get out of my house already!

158
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,182
There’s nothing here left for you to hold on to.

159
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:35,937
Yes.

160
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,280
Bo!

161
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,430
Haven’t seen you in a while!

162
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,380
Good afternoon, Tuk.

163
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:05,506
Here, have this first.

164
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:08,218
Thank you.

165
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,187
Of course.

166
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,666
I’ll get going now.

167
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,331
She’s gotten so pretty.

168
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,643
They’re kicking us out to build a condo!

169
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,611
We’ve lived here for so long.

170
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:22,735
We won’t give in!

171
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:26,518
Where are we supposed to go? There’s nowhere left for us!

172
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:29,659
I was born here! And I want to die here!

173
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:32,120
What should we do now?

174
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,407
Sam.

175
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:54,922
Yes?

176
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:55,581
Go get the car.

177
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:56,625
Yes.

178
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:02,902
Queen…

179
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:04,723
About my mom…

180
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:05,287
Careful!

181
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:26,837
Sam.

182
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:27,337
Yes?

183
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:27,872
Go get the car.

184
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:28,959
Yes.

185
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:35,158
Queen…

186
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,062
About my mom…

187
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:37,688
Careful!

188
00:15:58,394 --> 00:15:59,434
This actually hurts…

189
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:11,541
Queen?!

190
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,422
Queen!

191
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:15,583
This is the first time…

192
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:18,510
Queen!

193
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:19,736
Queen!

194
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:21,119
Queen!

195
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:22,063
Please, no!

196
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:22,783
Please, no!

197
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,030
Queen!

198
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,164
Queen!

199
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,068
Sam!

200
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,564
Queen got stabbed!

201
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:28,745
Please, help!

202
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:29,593
Queen!

203
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,716
Let go!

204
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:03,833
Let me go!

205
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,671
Who are you?!

206
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:05,725
Where are you taking me?!

207
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:06,396
Let me go!

208
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,290
Let go!

209
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,741
Let go!

210
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,131
Sorry about my men.

211
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:29,938
They could be a bit rough.

212
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:34,278
Who are you?

213
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:39,648
I’ve been watching you for a while.

214
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,188
You’re a very interesting person.

215
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:45,588
What do you want?

216
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,551
I saw everything you did.

217
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:58,431
Kem…

218
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:18,855
Let me go!

219
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:30,872
Just get to the point.

220
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:46,553
I know…

221
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,305
what you want.

222
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,280
How’s Queen?!

223
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,290
Queen was stabbed.

224
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,537
Who did this?

225
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:15,220
So someone did this on purpose.

226
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,533
It’s definitely not an accident.

227
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,215
Shut the news down.

228
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,604
No one will know about this.

229
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,161
Yes.

230
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:33,743
Mom.

231
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,377
How’s my daughter?

232
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:38,564
The patient is now out of danger.

233
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:43,068
The wound is on the left side of the abdomen.

234
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,657
No vital organs were hit.

235
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,208
The patient is still unconscious due to the medication.

236
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:49,548
Thank you.

237
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,335
Please, excuse me.

238
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:19,235
Don’t you have an urgent meeting today, King?

239
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:20,739
Yes.

240
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:22,067
But I can postpone it.

241
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:23,312
That’s alright.

242
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:25,018
You should go to the meeting.

243
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:27,188
I’ll take care of Queen here.

244
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:29,601
Alright.

245
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,082
See you later, King.

246
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:37,496
See you later, Sam.

247
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:45,525
Because of you…

248
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,986
My daughter ended up like this.

249
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,328
You came into Queen’s life…

250
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:00,045
because of money.

251
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,481
I’ll pay you.

252
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,426
Tell me, how much do you want?

253
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:10,243
That’s not true.

254
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:11,975
I never thought of it that way.

255
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,902
Are you trying to say you actually care about Queen?

256
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:21,327
Look at her.

257
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,055
Look at Queen right now.

258
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,035
You’re dragging her down.

259
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,814
Taking her to places she should never have gone.

260
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,830
You’ve turned Queen…

261
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:47,188
into someone she’s not.

262
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,206
I never meant to change her.

263
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:55,191
I just…

264
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:56,991
You wouldn’t understand.

265
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,658
How much pain…

266
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:07,639
a mother has to bear.

267
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:13,766
To see her child lying here like this.

268
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:19,086
Because…

269
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,518
You were never loved by your mother.

270
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,591
That’s why you would never understand…

271
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:33,816
That a mother’s love…

272
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,392
is so powerful.

273
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,516
If you truly care about Queen…

274
00:23:57,189 --> 00:23:58,431
You should know…

275
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:00,163
what you have to do.

276
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:08,128
I know.

277
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:25,064
Please, let me stay and take care of Queen until she gets better.

278
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:33,996
And after that…

279
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,270
I’ll leave Queen’s life on my own.

280
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:08,722
Queen.

281
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,228
Are you okay?

282
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,837
It’s nothing…

283
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,172
The doctor said it didn’t hit any vital organs.

284
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:31,738
But you still need to get more rest.

285
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,760
Hold on, Queen.

286
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:15,321
I’m sorry.

287
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:21,339
About what?

288
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:27,456
If you hadn’t gone to my house…

289
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,501
This wouldn’t have happened.

290
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:38,227
It’s not your fault.

291
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:51,756
No matter what you say…

292
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,080
It’s still my fault.

293
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:06,677
Good morning.

294
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:09,850
Good morning, Sam.

295
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,775
Good morning, Babe.

296
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:13,993
Babe!

297
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:15,532
Don’t move yet, Queen.

298
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,682
Babe has been taking care of you all night.

299
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:20,818
Maybe you should let her get some rest.

300
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:22,348
I’ll take care of her.

301
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,175
How are you, Queen?

302
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:47,622
Why did you go there?

303
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:51,325
Because of that girl, right?

304
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,077
I told you before…

305
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:55,137
Please leave Bonita alone.

306
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,192
If you do as I ask…

307
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,270
I will go into politics.

308
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,345
Just like you wanted.

309
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,316
You can’t even do something this simple!

310
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:11,080
How hard can it be?!

311
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,888
You really don’t have what it takes.

312
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:20,742
You couldn’t even kill Queen.

313
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:23,963
Don’t even hope…

314
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,770
That you’ll ever have Bonita as yours.

315
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:32,363
Get out of my business!

316
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:37,371
Let me go!

317
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:38,135
Let go!

318
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,725
Or maybe…

319
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:44,368
Your hatred still isn’t strong enough, Kem.

320
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:48,571
What if I told you…

321
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:51,236
Your Bonita…

322
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:54,087
has already been thoroughly played by Queen.

323
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:02,298
I’ll kill you!

324
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:05,580
You’ll die at my feet.

325
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:14,643
Up until now…

326
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:17,487
I’d say you haven’t been serious enough.

327
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,056
I know.

328
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:22,157
You’re capable of doing so much more.

329
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:27,023
You just have to unleash what’s inside you.

330
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,243
That’s all.

331
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:32,522
And you…

332
00:31:33,507 --> 00:31:35,918
will get exactly what you want.

333
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:44,666
I thought you’d left.

334
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:52,443
How could I?

335
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,456
You’re the one who saved me.

336
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:06,426
Why did you do that?

337
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:10,381
What if you hadn’t woken up?

338
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:20,203
I just wanted to protect you.

339
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:41,412
But you didn’t have to risk your life for me like that.

340
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,152
It’s my right.

341
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:51,224
I have the right to choose what I want to do.

342
00:33:57,676 --> 00:34:00,176
You told me you wouldn’t make me feel scared.

343
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:05,433
Your life is so precious…

344
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,535
More than mine.

345
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,187
For us, there shouldn’t be only one who gives or one who receives.

346
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,584
Your life is just as precious…

347
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:38,924
So precious…

348
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:42,879
To me.

349
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:14,773
Thank you for being safe.

350
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,847
Thank you for still being here to talk back to me.

351
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:47,041
That sounds like…

352
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,525
A love confession…

353
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,802
That doesn’t have the word ‘love’ in it.

354
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,281
I should get going now.

355
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:35,463
I have an exam today.

356
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,056
Thank you.

357
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,736
I’m leaving.

358
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:03,100
Good morning, Sam.

359
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,069
Good morning.

360
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:16,399
Any updates?

361
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,496
We still haven’t found the suspect.

362
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:20,987
There are no security cameras in the area.

363
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,913
And Kem…

364
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,633
We haven’t found him either.

365
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:32,490
Let’s put Kem aside for now.

366
00:38:33,593 --> 00:38:35,376
We have other matters to deal with.

367
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:36,579
Yes.

368
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,620
Any updates from the company?

369
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:47,252
I’m keeping an eye on it.

370
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,363
What brings you here, Mom?

371
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:04,044
You’re leaving the hospital today.

372
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:05,911
So I’m here to take you home.

373
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,071
I’m going back to my place.

374
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,145
Queen…

375
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,511
I’m worried about you.

376
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:18,556
Please, come back to our home for now.

377
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,834
It’s alright.

378
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,496
I can take care of myself.

379
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,299
There’s a party next week.

380
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:43,283
You’re coming.

381
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:47,766
I expect the whole family to be there.

382
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:54,161
Yes.

383
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:16,925
Don’t stress too much about work.

384
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:18,469
I’m worried about you.

385
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:41,930
There’s a party next week.

386
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:43,739
Come with me.

387
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,193
Why do you want me to come with you?

388
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:07,483
What am I supposed to go as?

389
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:24,865
Queen’s favorite.

390
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:45,437
As Queen’s favorite…

391
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,656
You can stand beside me…

392
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:52,493
without fear.

393
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:01,719
How many favorites do you have?

394
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,466
Only one.

395
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:09,511
Will you take it?

396
00:45:24,577 --> 00:45:25,636
Even if you won’t…

397
00:45:27,415 --> 00:45:28,386
I can’t help it.

398
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:32,312
Because I’ve already given it to you…

399
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,032
Bonita.

400
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:02,492
Why do you look so tense, mom?

401
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,502
Can I really say it?

402
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,598
You can say anything, mom.

403
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:13,107
But I’d like to ask you for one thing.

404
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,055
Please don’t do anything…

405
00:50:16,184 --> 00:50:17,760
that would make Queen feel like…

406
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,816
the person she chose isn’t accepted.

407
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:25,138
Love can happen anywhere, mom.

408
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:28,313
And if it’s already happened to Queen…

409
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,818
Shouldn’t we help her protect it?

410
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:29,865
Why are you standing there?

411
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,423
I…

412
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:36,407
Don’t be scared.

413
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,221
I’m right here with you.

414
00:52:03,773 --> 00:52:05,640
I’ve never been to a party like this before.

415
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:07,955
I don’t know what to do.

416
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:29,917
Don’t mind them.

417
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:28,878
King.

418
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:34,408
Take Queen to meet the guests for me.

419
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:35,875
Yes, mom.

420
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:38,062
Queen.

421
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:39,641
Come with me.

422
00:54:39,704 --> 00:54:41,544
I’ll introduce you to Phongthep.

423
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:46,017
Alright.

424
00:54:48,987 --> 00:54:50,191
I’ll be right back.

425
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:07,009
Good afternoon.

426
00:55:11,872 --> 00:55:13,236
Good afternoon.

427
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:18,243
I’m thirsty.

428
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:20,583
Go get me some water.

429
00:55:25,344 --> 00:55:26,184
Yes.

430
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:52,425
May I have a glass of water, please?

431
00:55:52,775 --> 00:55:53,661
Just a moment, please.

432
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:57,615
I knew that face looked familiar.

433
00:55:58,384 --> 00:55:59,304
Look who’s here.

434
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:05,723
I never thought that…

435
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:09,195
Someone like you could be bought by Queen that easily.

436
00:56:13,482 --> 00:56:17,471
You said you didn’t take jobs like this.

437
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:21,184
But turns out...

438
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:24,641
Money could still buy you after all.

439
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:28,595
You’re not wrong for thinking that.

440
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:31,824
It’s just that some people pay to lift others up.

441
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:35,903
While some pay to push them down.

442
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,495
There’s a difference.

443
00:56:41,492 --> 00:56:45,189
Like how Queen bought you and showed you off at an event like this?

444
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,375
How much did she pay for you?

445
00:56:50,384 --> 00:56:51,863
I can give you more than that.

446
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:55,942
We can make a deal in secret.

447
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:06,486
So?

448
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:07,699
Please, let go.

449
00:57:07,982 --> 00:57:09,398
I’m not interested in any offers.

450
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:11,531
Don’t play so hard to get.

451
00:57:11,605 --> 00:57:12,474
I said, let go.

452
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,217
I won’t.

453
00:57:13,217 --> 00:57:15,217
A woman like you would do anything for money, wouldn’t you?

454
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:16,008
Please, let go of me.

455
00:57:16,008 --> 00:57:17,894
(If you don’t have anything good to say…)

456
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,260
Just stay quiet.

457
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:25,729
Don’t act like you’re above everyone…

458
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:28,150
When your thoughts are beneath them.

459
00:57:28,963 --> 00:57:30,963
Don’t drag this place down with you.

460
00:57:35,294 --> 00:57:37,374
You should show more respect to others…

461
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,701
Pakinn.

462
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:00,469
Thank you.

463
00:58:05,593 --> 00:58:07,142
Don’t thank me.

464
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:11,045
I just don’t like people who disrespect others.

465
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:14,453
And right now…

466
00:58:16,043 --> 00:58:19,396
You’re here with Queen.

467
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
But after this, you’re not.

468
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:38,079
If you truly care about Queen…

469
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,135
You should know…

470
00:58:40,907 --> 00:58:41,979
what you have to do.

471
00:58:43,706 --> 00:58:44,619
I know.

472
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:49,114
Please, let me stay and take care of Queen until she gets better.

473
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:51,184
And after that…

474
00:58:51,968 --> 00:58:54,048
I’ll leave Queen’s life on my own.

475
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:04,550
Don’t forget what you agreed with me.

476
00:59:40,574 --> 00:59:42,017
Why are you standing here?

477
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,083
This place belongs to you…

478
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,333
But it’s not mine.

479
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,257
You once told me that…

480
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:05,295
When an elder gives you something, you should take it.

481
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:13,848
Kirin gave this to me.

482
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:17,893
And you should know me well enough…

483
01:00:18,692 --> 01:00:20,692
To know I never take anyone’s money for free.

484
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:22,325
(I’ll pay you 10 million.)

485
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:32,275
I’ll buy my daughter back from you.

486
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:42,545
What are you thinking of doing?

487
01:00:45,094 --> 01:00:47,757
I’m doing what I’ve wanted to do for a long time.

488
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:53,765
I’m leaving you.

489
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:03,348
Why?

490
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:10,603
Because I’ve already got what I wanted.

491
01:01:13,897 --> 01:01:15,473
Are you saying that…

492
01:01:16,722 --> 01:01:18,059
After all this time…

493
01:01:18,964 --> 01:01:20,487
You did everything for money?

494
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:23,842
Yes.

495
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,418
Now that I think about it…

496
01:01:30,092 --> 01:01:31,668
It feels like luck was on my side.

497
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:34,837
That suddenly…

498
01:01:35,874 --> 01:01:37,927
The high and mighty Queen…

499
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,317
Took an interest in a girl like me.

500
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:46,522
Why would I ever throw that chance away?

501
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,208
And now that I’ve got what I wanted…

502
01:01:57,306 --> 01:01:59,518
You’re no use to me anymore.

503
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:05,844
If you really love money…

504
01:02:07,703 --> 01:02:09,703
I’ll buy you back to me.

505
01:02:14,612 --> 01:02:15,869
That won’t be necessary.

506
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:19,437
No matter how much you pay…

507
01:02:21,482 --> 01:02:24,145
I don’t want to force myself to do something I don’t want to.

508
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:29,145
And I don’t want to be with someone I don’t love.

509
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:01,438
If you’re leaving…

510
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:03,232
Then go.

511
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:10,990
You have no right to ever show your face to me again.

512
01:04:49,612 --> 01:04:51,823
Don’t push me to do this again, Kongtup.

513
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:52,944
Damn it!

514
01:04:52,944 --> 01:04:54,538
Bonita isn’t here.

515
01:04:54,744 --> 01:04:55,550
How’s that?!

516
01:04:55,739 --> 01:04:58,561
Ran off to live with the rich.

517
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,745
And ended up getting dumped.

518
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:03,180
Are you really going to give me another chance?

519
01:05:03,555 --> 01:05:05,555
Come back and be my favorite again…

520
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,035
Babe.
