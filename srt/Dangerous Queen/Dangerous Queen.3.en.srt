1
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:39,928
Get in.

2
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:42,335
It’s alright, I don’t want to trouble you.

3
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,303
I’m all wet.

4
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,735
I’ll pay you.

5
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,821
Get in the car with me.

6
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:46,665
How much do you want?

7
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,734
I don’t do that kind of work.

8
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,947
You won this time.

9
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:52,574
But next time you might lose it all.

10
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:54,694
What did you just say?!

11
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:56,419
You said I would lose it all?!

12
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:58,495
Did you just curse me, Bo?!

13
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,151
How dare you?!

14
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,233
Who did this to you?

15
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,726
I’m really fine.

16
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,707
I’m sorry, Bo.

17
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,132
I didn’t mean to do that, Bo.

18
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,457
You can hit me, Bo! Hit me!

19
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:16,773
Stop!

20
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,350
Is there something urgent, Mom?

21
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:40,239
I heard many board members don’t agree with you becoming president.

22
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:43,123
Yes.

23
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,375
I don’t want you caught in that situation.

24
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,068
It might be best if you stepped down.

25
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:58,345
Usually, you never give up on things like this, Mom.

26
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,788
Especially when you know it’s unfair.

27
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:06,944
But you don’t have to play their game.

28
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,770
I’d like you to go into politics.

29
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:15,303
Our party needs new blood to compete with the others.

30
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,845
I’ve set everything up for you.

31
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:22,459
You just have to say yes.

32
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,717
Our party?

33
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,042
You can be honest with me.

34
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:40,649
You just want to do what Wasin wants, right?

35
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:48,325
You don’t want me caught up in those people’s game.

36
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,974
But you want me in your game instead, don’t you, Mom?

37
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,272
That’s not what I think.

38
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:02,355
Queen.

39
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,048
Everything I do is all for you.

40
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,637
I won’t step down as president.

41
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,063
Dad entrusted this company to me.

42
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,902
The only reason I’d ever step down…

43
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,973
is if King takes the position instead of me.

44
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:41,812
Please, no.

45
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,103
There’s one more thing.

46
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,439
Election day is approaching.

47
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,373
You must be more careful.

48
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,922
Don’t let there be any bad press.

49
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:03,133
It could affect the party.

50
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,942
I don’t want your father upset over this.

51
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,026
I only have one father.

52
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,195
I’ll be more careful.

53
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:32,924
Please, excuse me.

54
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:14,070
(I've looked for more information.)
(Last night, Babe was beaten by her mother.)
(And just now too, but someone stepped in to help.)

55
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:32,947
What is it?

56
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,111
(Queen.)

57
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,224
(I dug up more information about Babe.)

58
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,006
Babe’s mother is a gambling addict.

59
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,370
And she keeps stealing money too.

60
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,014
Come on…

61
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,594
Last night you left my message on read.

62
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,648
And now you’re not even talking to me?

63
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:57,969
Queen.

64
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,528
Do you actually want to know about Babe?

65
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,059
(I’ve been running around all night to dig this up.)

66
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,287
(Didn’t even get a wink of sleep.)

67
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:11,731
Queen?!

68
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,604
Did she just hang up on me?!

69
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,015
Queen!!!

70
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:23,752
What?!

71
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,294
Is it in here?!

72
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:01,578
Where did she put it?!

73
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:05,596
(Bo!)

74
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:07,296
(Bo!)

75
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:09,930
(Bo!)

76
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:13,576
(Bua!)

77
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,678
(Bua!)

78
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:16,951
Hang on!

79
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:21,614
What is it?!

80
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,285
Bo isn’t home, Bua?

81
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,085
How would I know?

82
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:26,894
I haven’t seen her, I just got here.

83
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,515
What do you want from her?

84
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,758
It’s nothing.

85
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:34,110
By the way…

86
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:35,330
What?

87
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,775
I already paid off your debt at the den, Bua.

88
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:39,367
What?!

89
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,502
Seriously?!

90
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:42,997
For real?!

91
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:43,741
Did I hear you right?!

92
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:45,981
Yes, for real.

93
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,467
You’re amazing, Kem!

94
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,251
Why weren’t you born my son?!

95
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,666
I’d love you to death!

96
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,043
Wait, Bua.

97
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:57,331
But you have to promise me one thing.

98
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:58,641
What is it?

99
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,500
Can you promise not to hit Bo again?

100
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:03,683
Fine!

101
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:06,885
Fine! I promise!

102
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,416
Why don’t you just make Bo your wife?

103
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,347
That debt you paid for me…

104
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:18,844
I’ll take it as the dowry.

105
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:25,932
I know you’ve had a crush on Bo since forever.

106
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,354
That’s why I’m giving her to you.

107
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,846
Silence? I'll take that as a yes.

108
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,939
Well, since we’re at it…

109
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:35,814
How about a little more?

110
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:38,783
Bua?!

111
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,204
I’m completely out!

112
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,611
That was all of my savings.

113
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:44,389
Come on, Kem!

114
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,332
You love Bo this much.

115
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:49,087
And she’s only worth 200,000 to you?!

116
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:51,125
What a chicken.

117
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,338
I’ll just give her to someone else.

118
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,698
Wait! Bua!

119
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,210
I’ll get more for you.

120
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:05,387
That’s my son-in-law!

121
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:06,675
Okay…

122
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:25,414
You actually fit in my clothes, Bo!

123
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,830
If I could go home, I wouldn’t be bothering you this much.

124
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,838
Come on, don’t think too much about it.

125
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:35,639
If you went home…

126
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,715
your face will get more bruises for sure.

127
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,460
So just use my stuff for now.

128
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:44,966
Thanks, Mint.

129
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:47,906
Bo!

130
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,688
They just posted it!

131
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:54,894
Let’s go check! I’m dying to know if your name is on the list.

132
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:56,234
Come on, hurry!

133
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:03,264
Hurry up!

134
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:04,830
Excuse me, sorry!

135
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:10,928
Bo!

136
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:11,880
Bo!

137
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,063
You made it, Bo!

138
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:15,534
Your name’s right there!

139
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,751
The interview’s tomorrow. You have to nail it, Bo!

140
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,751
Fingers crossed.

141
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:25,015
This scholarship is my only hope.

142
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:28,020
If you get it…

143
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,842
You won’t have to pay tuition anymore.

144
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,204
And when you graduate, you’ll have a guaranteed job!

145
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,716
I’m so excited for you!

146
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:37,464
And you especially, you’ll definitely make it, Bo!

147
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,583
I hope so too.

148
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:45,978
You got this.

149
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:18,014
(I love you.)

150
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:19,991
Will you be my girlfriend, Bo?

151
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,182
We’re friends, Kem.

152
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:28,907
Bo.

153
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,010
Can you give me a chance?

154
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,260
It's not about giving chances.

155
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:35,337
But it’s about feelings.

156
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,436
I do love you, Kem.

157
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,494
But I love you as a friend.

158
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,681
And I've never felt more than that.

159
00:12:58,308 --> 00:12:58,995
So…

160
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,983
I heard you like Bua’s daughter?

161
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:06,373
But you’re looking pathetic like this…

162
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:08,942
Guess you couldn’t make her yours.

163
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,211
I want to be alone.

164
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:19,346
Why are you such an idiot?

165
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,923
There’s nothing special about a girl like that.

166
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,617
She’s just playing hard to get.

167
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,340
Just toss her some cash.

168
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:39,205
And she’ll come crawling back to you.

169
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:44,453
It’s my business!

170
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,583
I’ll deal with it myself!

171
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:50,849
Especially Bua’s daughter…

172
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,094
She’s no different from her mother.

173
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:57,157
You don’t know a thing, shut up!

174
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,751
Did you just raise your voice at me, Kem?

175
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:07,185
Huh?!

176
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:10,658
I’m telling you this…

177
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,538
That girl will bleed you dry.

178
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:15,052
So what?!

179
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,262
You paid off Bua’s debt…

180
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,313
But you still couldn’t make that girl yours.

181
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,214
That girl’s got some nerve.

182
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,497
Already played you for your money.

183
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,724
Why are you such a fool over a worthless girl?

184
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:34,809
Huh?!

185
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:36,254
Stay out of my business!

186
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,024
I’ll let you go this time.

187
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,592
Take it as…

188
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:06,143
I pity a fool like you.

189
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,209
But if you dare mouth off at me again.

190
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,574
I won’t let you off next time, Kem!

191
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:23,596
Let’s go!

192
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,133
Where’s Bie?

193
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,769
She’s already booked for the night.

194
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,124
For real?

195
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,588
Who’d even have the guts to book Queen’s girl?

196
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,409
That table over there.

197
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,020
Queen.

198
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,322
This is the list of students applying for our company’s scholarship this year.

199
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,014
Come pick a wine with me.

200
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:55,817
Yes.

201
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,295
I booked this girl for the night.

202
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:43,492
But I'll let you have her.

203
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,395
I’m going to the restroom.

204
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,216
Queen.

205
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:24,322
About last night…

206
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:25,397
I…

207
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:40,144
Does it hurt?

208
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:42,955
What are you talking about?

209
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,727
All the bruises.

210
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:47,595
No, it doesn’t.

211
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:51,208
What happened?

212
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,038
Please, I’d rather not talk about it.

213
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,899
If you want my help…

214
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,016
Just say it.

215
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:06,441
Even if I tell you…

216
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,062
You wouldn’t be able to help me anyway.

217
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,327
Queen.

218
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:47,738
Has Bie really got you this shaken?

219
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,543
What are you saying?

220
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,099
I’m just being honest.

221
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,744
I’m only saying what I see.

222
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:54,558
We've been friends for years.

223
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,141
How could I not see it?

224
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:57,715
There’s nothing.

225
00:21:58,697 --> 00:21:59,400
No way.

226
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,348
If there’s really nothing, why are you here then?

227
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:04,914
I just don’t want anyone being used by Kongtup.

228
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:06,503
That’s all.

229
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,428
(Don’t forget your papers.)
(I'm going to bed.)

230
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:28,829
(This headache won’t quit.)

231
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,224
Papers…

232
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:35,841
Right!

233
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,098
They’re still at home.

234
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:22,342
Well, well…

235
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:23,978
Pretending you don’t care.

236
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,730
But here you are, right in front of Babe’s house.

237
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:28,209
Stop it.

238
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:32,947
Since I’ve been with you…

239
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,643
Babe’s the first person you’ve ever been this into.

240
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:40,611
So what do we call that…?

241
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,629
You talk too much.

242
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:43,832
Just leave.

243
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,316
You can fool me or anyone else.

244
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:50,017
But your own heart…

245
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:51,890
you can’t fool that, Queen.

246
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,275
Leave.

247
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:57,062
Hold on.

248
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,685
Kongtup’s men are watching you, Queen.

249
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:33,596
Bo!

250
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,081
Bo!

251
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,024
Are you home, Bo?

252
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:38,167
Bo!

253
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,121
Are you home?

254
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:43,989
Bo!

255
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,721
I’m sorry, Bo.

256
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:48,233
Bo!

257
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:50,956
Bo!

258
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:53,041
I’m so sorry.

259
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:54,151
Bo!

260
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:56,592
Please open the door for me, Bo.

261
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,309
Bo!

262
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:04,739
Bo.

263
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:07,625
Bo.

264
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:10,790
Bo.

265
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,410
I’m sorry.

266
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:16,454
Bo.

267
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:18,755
Please open the door for me.

268
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:21,451
Bo.

269
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:22,779
I’m so sorry.

270
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:24,354
Bo.

271
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:26,480
Bo.

272
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:28,914
Bo.

273
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,245
Bo.

274
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,372
Bo.

275
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:35,130
I’m sorry.

276
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,029
Please come back to me, Bo.

277
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:39,272
Please.

278
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,863
I'm sorry, Bo.

279
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:43,360
I was wrong.

280
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:08,551
Kem!

281
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,474
Open the door!

282
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:12,053
Kem! It’s bad!

283
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,234
Kem! This is serious!

284
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:15,726
Kem!

285
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,254
(I’m coming!)

286
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,562
Open the door, hurry!

287
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:20,105
What is it, Bua?!

288
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:22,452
Bo ran away from home!

289
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,821
She took everything with her!

290
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:26,430
What?!

291
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,863
Since when?!

292
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:29,317
I don’t know!

293
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:33,213
I came home this morning and all her stuff was gone!

294
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,709
How am I supposed to get by now?!

295
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:38,938
Bo!

296
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,644
You ungrateful daughter!

297
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:50,429
What is this?!

298
00:28:00,776 --> 00:28:02,003
(Answer me, Bo!!!!!)
(Where are you?!)
(You ungrateful daughter!!!)

299
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,361
(I’m your mother!)
(Come home right now!)
(You worthless child!!)

300
00:28:05,662 --> 00:28:06,638
Just turn it off already!

301
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:09,581
Mm…

302
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:13,940
I thought my life was bad enough…

303
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,615
But compared to you, I’ve got nothing.

304
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:18,999
Yeah…

305
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:27,778
Bo.

306
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,956
You have to nail it today.

307
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:37,216
Mmm.

308
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:40,734
You got this!

309
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:45,122
Right…

310
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:48,294
Good morning, everyone.

311
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:51,366
For this final round of scholarship interviews.

312
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,352
The committee will assess candidates on multiple aspects.

313
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,820
The committee’s decision will be final.

314
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,565
I wish you all the best of luck.

315
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,179
I’m rooting for you all.

316
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:10,956
You got this.

317
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,803
I got this.

318
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:17,829
You got this!

319
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,354
From all the applications we’ve reviewed.

320
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:28,455
Two candidates stand out the most.

321
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:32,037
I believe there’s only one.

322
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:34,636
Who would that be?

323
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:36,555
Warataya.

324
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,197
And for you?

325
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,956
Bonita and Warataya.

326
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:46,479
What do you think, Keeraphat?

327
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,317
Warataya is certainly impressive.

328
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:57,960
In that case, we’ll proceed with awarding the scholarship to Warataya.

329
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,417
But Bonita is just as impressive.

330
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:19,332
Bonita.

331
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,540
Just make the decision fairly.

332
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:28,137
No need to favor me.

333
00:30:58,964 --> 00:30:59,606
Good morning.

334
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,066
My name is…

335
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,341
Bonita Piansakul.

336
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,179
I’m a second-year student in the Faculty of Economics.

337
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,325
The results have been finalized.

338
00:31:57,266 --> 00:32:00,457
This year’s scholarship goes to…

339
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,548
Warathaya Suksorn.

340
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:10,666
Congratulations.

341
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Don’t worry, you’ll definitely get it next year.

342
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:42,452
Mmm…

343
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:44,370
Thanks for waiting for me.

344
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,515
I saw Queen just now.

345
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:52,034
She was one of the committee members.

346
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:53,724
What?!

347
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:54,755
Really?!

348
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,350
Then why didn’t she help you?!

349
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:58,913
Why would she?

350
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,327
The decision should be fair.

351
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,005
The one who got it deserves it too.

352
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,690
And I don’t want any of that special treatment kind of thing.

353
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:10,170
I want to earn it on my own.

354
00:33:24,515 --> 00:33:25,637
If you want my help…

355
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:27,609
Just say it.

356
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,644
Even if I tell you…

357
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,342
You wouldn’t be able to help me anyway.

358
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:34,949
Bo?

359
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:37,869
Bo?

360
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:40,734
Are you heading back now?

361
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:44,628
I forgot to tell you.

362
00:33:44,993 --> 00:33:46,408
I have to go see Ging’s mom for a bit.

363
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:49,105
Is it okay if you head back first?

364
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,800
Of course!

365
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:52,491
Don’t worry about me.

366
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:54,133
Okay.

367
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,857
See you at the club then. I’m feeling better now.

368
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:59,134
Alright, see you there.

369
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:00,131
Bye.

370
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:00,869
Bye.

371
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:10,852
This way, please, Keeraphat.

372
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:35,799
We’re truly honored that you could join us today, Keeraphat.

373
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:36,709
Thank you.

374
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:41,156
We truly appreciate your continued support for our university’s scholarship program.

375
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:42,694
My pleasure.

376
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:44,315
Have a safe trip back, Keeraphat.

377
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:28,160
Jumping into someone else’s car like this…

378
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,702
Do you think it’s the right thing to do?

379
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:33,730
No.

380
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,910
So you do know…

381
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,490
Then why do it?

382
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,786
You’d better have a good reason, Babe.

383
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,624
Could you drop me off at the university gate, please?

384
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:52,510
Reason?

385
00:36:55,888 --> 00:36:56,988
Please, could you drop me off?

386
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,517
I want a reason why you jumped into my car.

387
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,687
And why I should drop you off.

388
00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:13,409
Last night you told me I couldn’t help you.

389
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,893
But now you’re asking for my help.

390
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,528
If your reason isn’t good enough…

391
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:22,234
Then you can get out of my car.

392
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:27,701
I’m sorry.

393
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,728
For the way I spoke to you last night.

394
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:36,053
And for jumping into your car like this.

395
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,761
It’s just there’s someone outside I don’t want to face.

396
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,657
So, what do I get out of helping you this time?

397
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,599
I’m not that kind.

398
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:53,180
But you’re not mean to me.

399
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:02,692
If you won’t help…

400
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:04,397
I’ll get out.

401
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:07,733
Sorry for the trouble.

402
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,657
If you want me to help…

403
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:14,322
Then sit here.

404
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,275
I’ve told you before that I don’t take that kind of job.

405
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:24,657
I only told you to sit on my lap.

406
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:45,463
On Queen’s lap?!

407
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,899
You can just drop me off up ahead.

408
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:56,177
I’ll take you home.

409
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:57,425
I’m not going home!

410
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,375
Then we're going to my place.

411
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,272
Why did you bring me here?

412
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,236
I’m not going to do anything to you.

413
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:26,343
But I’ve got work to do tonight.

414
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:28,886
I’ll take you there.

415
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,365
Then why did you bring me here?

416
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,479
It’s about work.

417
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,167
What work?

418
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,429
I’m looking for someone to summarize and read the news to me.

419
00:40:45,398 --> 00:40:46,101
But…

420
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:48,348
I just started working at the club.

421
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:51,288
I don’t want to quit yet.

422
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:53,914
I don’t offer this chance to just anyone, Babe.

423
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:36,566
Do you live here alone, Queen?

424
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:39,212
Mm.

425
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:46,670
Living alone in such a big house…

426
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:48,417
Don’t you ever feel lonely?

427
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:51,775
I’m used to it.

428
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:56,676
And…

429
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,415
I brought you here to talk about work.

430
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:00,673
Not to interview me.

431
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:06,576
Alright.

432
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:25,365
Are you going to sleep?

433
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:28,560
No.

434
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:31,207
Just resting my eyes.

435
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:50,800
Are you feeling sore?

436
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,956
I can give you a massage.

437
00:42:57,556 --> 00:42:58,531
You know how to give a massage?

438
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:00,989
A little bit.

439
00:43:19,852 --> 00:43:21,162
How much is it for a massage?

440
00:43:23,043 --> 00:43:23,725
I won’t charge.

441
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:26,246
Think of it as payment for your help today.

442
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:37,397
What if I like it?

443
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:42,806
You mean me?

444
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:48,223
What is there to like about you?

445
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:52,194
I don’t know.

446
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,448
I just feel like we’ve been seeing each other a lot lately.

447
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,446
So it got me thinking that way.

448
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,442
Then stop thinking that way.

449
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:08,177
Because I'm not interested in you.

450
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:13,729
Alright.

451
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,302
Let me ask you something.

452
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:35,706
Why don’t you want to go home?

453
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:41,862
It’s not that I don’t want to.

454
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:48,925
But I just can’t.

455
00:44:57,911 --> 00:44:58,677
Get up.

456
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:00,758
I’ll take you to the club.

457
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,639
Is this really Queen’s weak spot?

458
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:37,862
Yes, dad.

459
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,282
Didn’t expect it’d be a girl from the club.

460
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:44,304
This just makes things even more exciting.

461
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:47,117
So, what’s your next move?

462
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:56,436
I already have a plan.

463
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:01,338
You know Queen just as well as she knows you.

464
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,884
So, you still have to be careful.

465
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:06,362
Of course, Dad.

466
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:07,755
You can trust me.

467
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:11,918
You’ve always had my trust, Kongtup.

468
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:34,255
I’ve booked you for the whole night.

469
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,318
Why don’t you invite Linn here too?

470
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:39,696
I want to sit alone.

471
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,918
Then why would you have me here?

472
00:46:44,398 --> 00:46:45,400
I mean…

473
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,613
It’s only you and me.

474
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:53,837
But didn’t you just say you wanted to be alone?

475
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:02,835
Order whatever you like.

476
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:05,667
You’ll drink with me.

477
00:47:11,152 --> 00:47:11,750
Alright.

478
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:24,193
May I have a Shirley Temple, please, Ray?

479
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:25,410
Right away, Bie.

480
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,862
So, which one is it? Queen’s weak spot or whatever?

481
00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:37,078
There’s no one here named Bonita.

482
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:40,469
And seriously?! Being way up there…

483
00:47:40,845 --> 00:47:42,211
but falling for a girl like that.

484
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:43,476
How is that even possible?

485
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:45,759
How would I know?! Huh?!

486
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:48,323
Just go find the girl before Queen leaves.

487
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:49,697
Boss wants some good shots.

488
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:50,823
Move!

489
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:51,813
Alright.

490
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:19,154
Queen.

491
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:45,536
Queen!

492
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:46,625
Please, come with me!

493
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:49,348
Where?

494
00:48:49,348 --> 00:48:50,502
You need to get out of here.

495
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:56,338
Someone’s trying to blackmail you.

496
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:57,982
I just heard them talking.

497
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,400
You have to leave now.

498
00:49:01,162 --> 00:49:01,664
Queen!

499
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,366
Are you sure you heard it right?

500
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:06,821
I really heard them.

501
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:08,022
Please, believe me.

502
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:12,358
So, you’re worried about me?

503
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:13,319
Yes.

504
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,173
I don’t want you to get into trouble.

505
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:17,739
And why would I be in trouble?

506
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,918
They said I’m your weak spot.

507
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:22,713
I don’t know what that means.

508
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:24,874
But right now, we have to hurry.

509
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:36,223
Come on!

510
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:39,882
This way, Queen.

511
00:49:49,648 --> 00:49:50,573
Why are you smiling?!

512
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:51,628
Come here!

513
00:49:57,544 --> 00:49:58,565
Come in here first.

514
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:01,328
Come in.

515
00:50:10,197 --> 00:50:10,697
Hey.

516
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:21,765
No one’s here.

517
00:50:21,765 --> 00:50:22,323
Let’s go, then.

518
00:50:26,397 --> 00:50:27,859
Hang in here for a bit, Queen.

519
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,056
Just wait until they leave.

520
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:34,322
We’re lucky I overheard them talking.

521
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,923
As soon as I heard, I ran straight back to you.

522
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:39,664
I was so scared, I couldn’t think of anything.

523
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:41,760
All I knew was, I had to get you out.

524
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:44,918
Do you think they’ll find us, Queen?

525
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,455
Stay quiet.

526
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:03,029
They’re gone.

527
00:51:04,618 --> 00:51:05,504
Are you sure?

528
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:07,473
I’d better go out and check first.

529
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:17,470
Babe.

530
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,149
If I were to kiss you…

531
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:22,987
How much would it cost me?

532
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:26,202
Are you drunk?

533
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:29,918
I’m completely conscious.

534
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,918
And I want what I asked for.

535
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:37,199
You don’t need to pay.

536
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:38,765
Because I’m not giving you that.

537
00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:40,638
We should get out of here.

538
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,465
Queen.

539
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:51,799
I’m not joking.

540
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:53,918
I won’t allow that.

541
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,393
I’m serious.

542
00:51:59,413 --> 00:52:00,587
So am I.

543
00:52:04,946 --> 00:52:06,005
You’re defying me.

544
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:11,918
I could defy you even more.

545
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:20,304
(Where are they?!)

546
00:52:20,772 --> 00:52:22,138
Just keep looking!

547
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,745
Do you really like that girl?

548
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:48,626
Why would you think that?

549
00:52:48,626 --> 00:52:51,496
Because I’ve never seen my little sister act this way with anyone before.

550
00:52:51,587 --> 00:52:52,877
Stop it, Kem!

551
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:53,599
I won’t!

552
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,240
Do you even know what I’ve done for you?!

553
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:56,374
Get in my car.

554
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,839
I’m not getting in your car.

555
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,280
Not until you apologize to me.

556
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:01,954
I've found her weakness.

557
00:53:01,954 --> 00:53:05,038
And I know exactly how to make use of it.
