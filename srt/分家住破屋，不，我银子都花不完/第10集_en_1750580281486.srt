1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Why are you robbing me?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,200
Goddess, I only need five copper coins when I go to the door.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,400
Besides, you have the medicine for recovery.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,000
You need to recuperate for two days.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm fine now.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,600
What medicine can I take when I'm fine?

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,200
Goddess, you can take the medicine if you don't want to.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Just slow down.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Give me 12 coins and I'll be fine.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
12 coins?

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I only have 10 coins.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't want the medicine.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,200
If I didn't have a relationship with your three sons,

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I wouldn't come even if you ask me to.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,400
Rice and eggs?

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,400
I feel so bad.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,200
I gave them to my grandson.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,400
It's not easy for him to go to school.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Old man, do you think the four rooms

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,200
are on the wrong side of the road?

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
You're so fierce.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
Enough.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,000
That's all for today.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
What's the matter tomorrow?

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,400
We'll talk tomorrow.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
It's okay if you can't.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,600
I'll let the four rooms die first.

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,680
I'll make sure he's

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
in the wrong side of the road tomorrow.
