1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
If you really want to split up, you're a woman with two children.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,040
Zi Xuan is not well. How are you going to live?

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,880
Uncle Li Zheng, even if I die of starvation, I won't blame anyone.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,840
Here, I did the most and got beaten by my mother-in-law.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,880
Even the children can't eat, wear or sleep.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,440
Then we really don't have any hope here.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,760
If we split up, there's still a chance.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,160
You really want to split up?

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,960
Yes, we must split up.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,520
You can't split up.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,280
You can't decide whether to split up or not.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,920
I'm Li Zheng, but this is also your family matter.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,080
And the court has a clear rule.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,880
If the parents and the elders are the victims, the children will be protected by the other party.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,680
The one who splits up the property will be sentenced to death.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,920
You have to think about this clearly.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,400
I not only want to split up, but also let them take the initiative to propose.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,320
Didn't you disagree?

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,040
Then let you destroy the original.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,200
Uncle Li Zheng, I don't want to make things difficult for you.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,720
If this family really can't split up, then let's just live together.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
That's right.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,080
Not dividing up is a good thing for you.
