1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
It hasn't been that long.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,100
Do you want to get married at the office today?

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,820
Why are you going to send this necessary letter to us?

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,080
I think the way you are now can't really be taken back.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,460
I need to take a look at your calendar and

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,660
make sure I receive a through email.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,700
And to bring back the blame.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,920
I just heard from your son that you've shown up on medley.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,000
ç´š

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,920
I will be paying you just be helpful and careful.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,420
who could be making you cry?

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,780
what kind of situation is this place?

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,420
I am not afraid of death.

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,660
That's right.

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,260
Why bother with them?

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,780
But I found that your appearance

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,180
is not like an ordinary person.

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,180
Instead, you have a bit of a noble aura.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,180
Here.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,380
I have to hurry up and find something new

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,380
to get the system to work.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,380
Where is my chicken?

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,380
How come there is no chicken?

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,380
My chicken.

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,380
You little bitch.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,780
There are only two eggs in the house.

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,780
How can I have more eggs?

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,780
I have been hoping to have more eggs.

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,380
Give me the big grandson who came back from school.

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,680
You...

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,180
You just killed him like this?

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,380
Give it to me. Give it to me.

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,980
What chicken?

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,380
Didn't I already tell you?

35
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,780
I have to eat all the chicken and duck porridge in this yard before I can stop.

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,980
What did you say?

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,780
I have always been a good person.

38
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,780
Now, you are willing to share the house and I am not.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,380
Do you know why?

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Why?

41
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,980
Because I haven't finished eating all the chicken and duck porridge in this yard.
