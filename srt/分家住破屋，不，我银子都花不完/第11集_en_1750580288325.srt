Episode 2

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
Here's your sweet porridge.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,640
Hurry and eat.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,040
It smells so good. Is it really white porridge?

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,040
Eat more.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,080
Er Yan, why aren't you eating?

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Mom, I don't dare to eat.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid that Anna will hit me.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If she steps on me, I'll be able to spit out my saliva.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,280
Don't worry.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
From now on, when I'm here, no one will bully you anymore.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,200
I can't believe it.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm now a mother.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,520
When I was in the tomb, my parents grew up in the welfare home.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,320
Although I got used to it later, I never experienced the feeling of being close.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Now, I've become the one of this family.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,120
Children, tomorrow morning, I'll make you a chicken stew and nourish your body.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Okay.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
Eat more.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm hungry. You guys eat first.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
Don't worry.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
I'm not going to eat too much. I'll be here in the future.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Thank you.

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I can't protect you even in this situation.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm a useless person.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Don't!

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Don't.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Be strong.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,920
The doctor said that there's a chance that you won't recover.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
I know.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,760
But I'm also working hard.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,360
But he doesn't have any reaction.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
He'll get better.
