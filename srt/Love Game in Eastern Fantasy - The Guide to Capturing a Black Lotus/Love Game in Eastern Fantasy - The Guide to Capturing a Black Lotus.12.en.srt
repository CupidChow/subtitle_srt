=Episode 12=

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,000
Hurry!

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
Go!

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Run!

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
That was close.

7
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,200
Are you okay?

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,390
What…what is that?

9
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,550
Xin.

10
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,320
Xin!

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,480
Xin!

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,760
Xin, you are hurt.

13
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,430
Who hurt you?

14
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,910
Zhen,

15
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,280
I'm seriously hurt this time.

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,040
I won't recover.

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
No,

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,950
you'll be fine.

19
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm going to capture more people for you

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
to sustain your life

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
and help you cultivate.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,430
You should leave now.

23
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,350
Why?

24
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,240
I've hurt a lot of people

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,520
for the sake of cultivation.

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,080
I can't turn back.

27
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,240
But you are different.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,240
You have a kind heart.

29
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,150
If it weren't for saving me,

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,120
you wouldn't have hurt anyone.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Until now,

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,630
you haven't been listening to me

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,120
to use human obsession for cultivation.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
So you have only reached the Tier 5.

41

This is a tier-7 demon core.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,680
I've concentrated
my lifetime of demonic power into it.

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
Now I'm offering this demon core to you

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
to help you reverse the landslide.

45
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,960
The only condition is

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,360
that you spare my beloved.

47
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,550
Do you accept this transaction

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,910
or not?

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,590

every moment of confinement,

61
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,080
at least we can be together.

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,710
My biggest mistake was

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,800
to leave you alone for so long.

64
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,750
Now

65
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,430
no one can separate us.

66
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,030
Yao, don't.

67
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,750
His lover has lost the will to live.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,360
Our transaction

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,520
can't be completed.

70
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,600
You can't take her demon core.

71
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
But you're about to reach your limit.

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,000
I can hold on.

73
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,100
If I use my lifetime cultivation
to enter the tower,

74
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
I can also reverse the landslide.

75
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
After that…

76
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
After that,

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,480
it will depend on you and Sheng.

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,150
Use your lifetime cultivation
to enter the tower?

79
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,430
Liu Fuyi, you've gone mad.

80
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,680
You'll die if you do that.

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,480
We have other ways.

82
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,900
Yao,

83
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,300
your behavior and actions have always been

84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,510
upright and respectable.

85
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,920
Even when facing demons today,

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
you should not go against
your conscience and principles.

87
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,800
It doesn't matter
if the transaction can't be completed.

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,310
You must not allow yourself

89
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,360
to become an unscrupulous Demon Catcher

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,120
like the Water Demon mentioned.

91
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,830
Fine.

92
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,870
You maintain your integrity,

93
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,310
I am not as good as you.

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
You don't want to be the bad guy,

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,840
I'll be.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
I can save her.

97
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,200
I can save her.

98
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,070
I… We can continue the transaction.

99
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,000
The transaction can go on.

100
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,830
This transaction can still be completed.

101
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,480
What did you say?

102
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,240
In the Tianji Pavilion
of the Astronomical Bureau,

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,560
there is a secret manual

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,950
that says all Water Demons come
from the Ruoshui River.

105
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,700
They may die, but they will never perish.

106
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,350
They will survive
if returning to the source.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
You just need to take her back

108
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,070
to the source of the Ruoshui River

109
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,430
and immerse her in the water,

110
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,600
and she can be resurrected.

111
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,750
At this point,

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,750
you are still trying to deceive me.

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,240
There is a Demon Catcher
like Young Master Fuyi.

114
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,110
You should

115
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,190
at least

116
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,680
have a little trust in us,

117
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
right?

118
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,480
What's the point of saying this now?

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,310
Can we even get out of here?

120
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,150
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

121
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,910
Master,

122
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,470
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,650
In the past,
you and my fellow disciples gathered

124
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,680
all your life's power

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,430
to forge the great formation.

126
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,240
Today,

127
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,480
I have to destroy it.

128
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,480
Formation Breaking Skill.

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,870
Alright, stop looking.

130
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
It's your turn.

131
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Fuyi,

132
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,510
are you alright?

133
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,350
I'm fine.

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
I'll go find them.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
Okay.

136
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,950
Are you okay?

137
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Miaomiao!

138
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
Let's go now.

139
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,420
(Qilin Mountain Twin Waterfalls)

140
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,150
These two waterfalls are so clean.

141
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,870
They flow down from the mountain,

142
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,480
intertwining like a pair of lovers.

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,040
Yes,

144
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,600
just like us.

145
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,270
Right, just like us.

146
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,360
What is the name of this waterfall?

147
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,030
No one has come to Qilin Mountain.

148
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,480
Everything here has no name.

149
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,040
Why don't we

150
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,080
give them names?

151
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,670
The water is clear.

152
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,260
It's as if

153
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,200
it can reflect sincerity.

154
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,750
So,

155
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,100
let's call this one Yingzhen.

156
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,450
And the other one is

157
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,120
Zhaoxin.

158
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,910
If you cheat me,

159
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,930
I will take revenge

160
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
for the rest of my life.

161
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,510
Sister,

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
the lives of the few people
in the small town

163
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,120
may not have been taken by him,

164
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,550
but they are probably connected to him.

165
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,840
Can we really let him go?

166
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,840
The Ruoshui River in the legend is

167
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,600
far away at the top of Kunlun Mountain,

168
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,320
inaccessible to a sinful body.

169
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,300
If he wants to find
the source of the Ruoshui River,

170
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,840
he must atone for his sins

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
and pay off all his karmic debts.

172
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,720
This process

173
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,210
may take decades

174
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,480
or even centuries,

175
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,600
but as long as he turns to goodness,

176
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,840
he will eventually succeed.

177
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,510
In this world,

178
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,500
it is not only by repaying one life
for another

179
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,270
that one can completely atone
for one's sins.

180
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,550
What if he commits evil again
during this period?

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,510
The Demon Trap Tower
has already recorded his aura.

182
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,910
If he hurts people again,

183
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,080
the Demon Trap Tower will ring an alarm.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,840
At that time,

185
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,910
even if he is thousands of miles away,

186
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,960
I will not let him escape.

187
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,320
You speak so sweetly

188
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,720
because you had a backup plan all along.

189
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,500
The Empyrean Demon Trap Tower captures
all demons and evils,

190
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
but it's not designed
to exterminate them completely.

191
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,630
Even if it is a demon,

192
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,960
even if

193
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,030
it bears serious sins
as heavy as mountains,

194
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,630
it should have a chance to become good.

195
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,430
Sister,

196
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,480
are you alright?

197
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,230
I'm fine.

198
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,670
You had a fight with the Water Demon.

199
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
Were you injured?

200
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,080
The Water Demon was badly injured.

201
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,960
However,

202
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,750
she is a Tier 7 Great Demon.

203
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,080
Even if the four of us teamed up,

204
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,960
we could barely fight her.

205
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,670
How did you hurt her?

206
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,390
It wasn't just Ziqi who fought her.

207
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,510
I also helped.

208
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,480
I used several Sparks.

209
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,520
As soon as I made a move,

210
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,840
with a ping and a pong,

211
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,840
the Water Demon Queen became…

212
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
In short,

213
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,200
I happened to save Ziqi,

214
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,800
and then…

215
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,360
It was you who saved Sheng?

216
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,390
I…

217
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,870
He…

218
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
The Water Demon was
inside the great formation.

219
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,350
Although she has a high demon tier,

220
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,600
she was affected by the formation,

221
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,240
so it's not difficult to deal with her.

222
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Isn't that right, Miaomiao?

223
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,630
Yes, that's right.

224
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,270
Brother Liu is absolutely right.

225
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
That's fine.

226
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,800
It's good that you didn't get hurt.

227
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,550
If you lie, make draft first.

228
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,030
Listen to yourself.

229
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,320
Can it be true?

230
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,790
Your sister suddenly asked,

231
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,400
where was the time to draft an answer?

232
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,310
Isn't it ping and pong?

233
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,790
You're so powerful,

234
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,550
why don't you speak up?

235
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,960
I've been covering for you,

236
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,680
and you're still picky here.

237
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,100
(Fish)

238
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,340
(Tofu Workshop)

239
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,260
(Tailai Inn)

240
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm leaving now.

241
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,160
There are some
protective talismans left.

242
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,000
Please help me give them
to the villagers here.

243
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,920
Protective talismans?

244
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,790
Aren't they just
mosquito-repelling spells?

245
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
Yes, they are.

246
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,310
But protective talismans sound better.

247
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
If you want to leave something,

248
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,200
shouldn't you leave something useful?

249
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,740
Something useful?

250
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,000
I have.

251
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,150
Yes, I have.

252
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,030
Wait a minute.

253
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,510
This will be useful.

254
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,750
Gongshu silk bag?

255
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,310
A Gongshu silk bag that
holds countless buildings.

256
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
It is an important talisman.

257
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,240
When the talisman is created,

258
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,480
it contains all the magical power needed

259
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,550
to construct buildings.

260
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,960
A single talisman can build pavilions
out of the ground.

261
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,160
It is good for building houses.

262
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
A bag contains ten talismans,

263
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,310
worth a fortune.

264
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,310
(This small bag)

265
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,200
(contains a hundred luxurious buildings.)

266
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,680
(Oh my goodness.)

267
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,920
I didn't expect you to
recognize its value so well.

268
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,270
Marvelous.

269
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,030
This is what I brought from

270
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,640
the Ziwei Pavilion
of the Astronomical Bureau

271
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
with the money I made

272
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,830
selling protective talismans.

273
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
As you said,

274
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,160
it's worth a fortune on the market,

275
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,200
but no one has it.

276
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,720
(This guy may not be great
at catching demons,)

277
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,000
(but he's a good unscrupulous merchant.)

278
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,000
I had prepared early

279
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,640
for any unforeseen needs.

280
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,270
So you had already thought about

281
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,550
using this silk bag to help the villagers

282
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,110
repair their homes after the landslide.

283
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,590
Yes.

284
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,790
I had hoped

285
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,310
it would never be needed.

286
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,160
But unexpectedly,

287
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,640
it is still being used.

288
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,030
Please help me give it
to the villagers.

289
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,110
It is my last contribution

290
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,400
to them.

291
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Wait, Sister Mu,

292
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,160
we won't help him.

293
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,200
If you want to make up for them,

294
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,410
go and give it to them yourself.

295
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,550
I…

296
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,650
I…

297
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,060
Although

298
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,130
keeping it from them is

299
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,000
for their good,

300
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm still afraid they might…

301
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,410
She's right.

302
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,160
Even if they beat you or scold you,

303
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,300
you must endure it.

304
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,580
If you really want to atone,

305
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,360
face it yourself.

306
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,410
Don't rely on others.

307
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,280
Yes.

308
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,980
People have feelings.

309
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,410
How will you know if you don't try?

310
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,540
(Liu's Pharmacy)

311
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,980
Mr. Guo,

312
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,680
take this.

313
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,780
The capital is far away,
so you'll need it.

314
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,550
Take these fresh fruits as well.

315
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,390
Eat them on the way.

316
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,280
I…

317
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,370
I hid it from you

318
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,020
for so long.

319
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,020
Don't you blame me?

320
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,610
Yes, we do.

321
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,440
But we also understand
that you are not doing this for yourself.

322
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,690
Over the years, you have been
the backbone of our town.

323
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,360
- But I am a false backbone.
- Yes.

324
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,790
But you…

325
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,880
you have protected the town
and all of us.

326
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
This intention is

327
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,750
genuine.

328
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,070
- Yes.
- Yes.

329
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,150
We all know in our hearts

330
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,400
how you have treated us all these years.

331
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,440
Please accept it.

332
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,170
- Accept it. Yes.
- Accept it, Mr. Guo.

333
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,070
I…

334
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,740
am ashamed.

335
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,980
(Liu's Pharmacy)

336
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,940
(Tailai Inn)

337
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,890
Just by thinking it, it will become real.

338
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,350
All you have to do is concentrate

339
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,200
and imagine every structure of your inn.

340
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,110
Every chair,

341
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,690
every table

342
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,200
and every corner needs be considered.

343
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,240
The more detailed your thoughts,

344
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,400
the more effective the magic will be.

345
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,550
Do you understand?

346
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,830
Take a look.

347
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,340
It really is.

348
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,850
The walls and beams have been repaired,

349
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,980
exactly the same as before.

350
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,610
Exactly the same.

351
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,020
Master, you are back?

352
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,690
Why are you standing there?

353
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,350
Invite the guests to sit down.

354
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,880
Let them try our inn's osmanthus fish.

355
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,260
Did you see that?

356
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,930
What's going on here?

357
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,240
I've never used it before.

358
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,780
I didn't know it would
cause hallucinations.

359
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,690
It turns out
that in the memory of the boss,

360
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,540
this inn is

361
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,820
full of traces of his wife.

362
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,190
It's been five years.

363
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,540
I should learn how to
make osmanthus fish now.

364
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,830
(I'm growing more and more fond of)

365
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,500
(the world in this story.)

366
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,480
(Everyone in the story)

367
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,690
(is not just a non-player character.)

368
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,740
(Everyone is vibrant,)

369
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,020
(full of life and character.)

370
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,340
(There are so many lovely,)

371
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,100
(warm-hearted and kind people.)

372
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,310
(This is the world
created by author Fu Zhou,)

373
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,100
(that I'm familiar with.)

374
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,350
What's wrong?

375
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,450
It's a fever.

376
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,300
You didn't even know you had a cold.

377
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,300
We don't have the herbs you want

378
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,170
in our town.

379
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,160
But aren't they the most common herbs?

380
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,170
How can they not be available?

381
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,990
The herbs grow in the mountains.

382
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,450
We haven't gone into the mountains
for years.

383
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,690
Where could we collect them?

384
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,170
When we fell ill,

385
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,030
we used
the protective talisman of Mr. Guo

386
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,440
to treat it.

387
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,820
It is called a pharmacy,

388
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,980
but it only sells some dried fruits.

389
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,830
At most,
there are some dried tangerine peel.

390
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,740
Do you want some?

391
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,480
Yes.

392
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,540
Okay, I'll get it for you.

393
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,100
What exactly are you trying to do?

394
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,260
It's upside down.

395
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,020
I told you to hide well.

396
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,060
Aren't you afraid
that my sister and Liu Fuyi will find out?

397
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,450
Yes, I am.

398
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,310
Then why are you coming out?

399
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,150
What exactly do you want?

400
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,260
I smelled the scent of my kind again.

401
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,890
I want to take a look.

402
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,130
The same kind?

403
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,020
There's a demon?

404
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,820
Lord Demon Catcher,

405
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,100
please be perspicacious.

406
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,230
(Little Radix Isatidis Demon)
We have never done anything

407
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,280
(Old Radix Isatidis Demon)
to harm others or against conscience.

408
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,020
We've been trapped in the mountain
for over a decade,

409
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,500
and it's not easy for us to gain freedom.

410
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,820
This can be considered a joyful event.

411
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,610
So we came out to find something

412
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,260
to hold a banquet to celebrate.

413
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,130
So you're just stealing?

414
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,450
Yes.

415
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Do you know

416
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,540
that a demon like you
falling into my hands

417
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,020
is a dead end?

418
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,540
It's all your fault.

419
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,340
Why did you have to steal those things?

420
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,880
You little brat,

421
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,890
who am I doing this for?

422
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,880
I'm getting them because you're greedy.

423
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,350
- I don't want them.
- You're the greedy one.

424
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,400
Isn't it because you want to
host a banquet?

425
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,780
Isn't that what you love to eat?

426
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,210
- Enough, stop arguing.
- Nonsense.

427
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,690
Let me ask you,

428
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,060
in the mountains,

429
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,690
are there many herbs like you

430
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,150
that can treat anemopyretic cold?

431
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,260
Yes, there are plenty.

432
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,000
Miaomiao, Miaomiao.

433
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,470
Wake up.

434
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
Miaomiao, wake up.

435
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,060
Wake up.

436
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,980
Cuicui, what's going on?

437
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,200
I know you're sick.

438
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
I shouldn't disturb you.

439
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,780
I don't have any connection
with them either.

440
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,100
But I really can't stand it anymore.

441
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,370
What exactly has happened?

442
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,740
Go and take a look.

443
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,820
Mu Sheng, Mu Sheng goes really too far,

444
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,500
too cruel.

445
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,100
Lord Demon Catcher,

446
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,580
you can't go back on your word.

447
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,370
My grandson and I have guided you.

448
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,850
Don't move.

449
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,410
Ziqi, Ziqi!

450
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,680
Stop!

451
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,880
Ziqi, what are you doing?

452
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
- Why did you get up?
- I…

453
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,170
Hurry back and lie down.

454
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
He said he wants to cure you

455
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,640
by boiling these herbs in a pot.

456
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,930
So scary.

457
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,520
Look at this.

458
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,880
He has already boiled the water.

459
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,720
No.

460
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,170
I just want some of their hair and beards,

461
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,690
not the demon core.

462
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,750
That's not acceptable either.

463
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,320
You… release them all now.

464
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,960
Why are you

465
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,550
(Honeysuckle Demon, Polygonum Multiflorum Demon)
cutting off our hair for no reason?

466
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,250
Little fairy,

467
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,270
please stop him.

468
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,110
Yes.

469
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,820
Hair and beard are our dignity.

470
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,880
Why do you want to

471
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,100
cut off my hair for no reason?

472
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,270
Don't you humans say

473
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,020
that the body and hair
come from the parents?

474
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,510
You old thing,
do you know how to save face?

475
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,680
To treat an anemopyretic cold,

476
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,580
why did you bring him to catch me?

477
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,370
I am polygonum multiflorum.

478
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,740
I... I am not the right remedy.

479
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Lord, shave this Old Radix Isatidis Demon

480
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,850
completely bald.

481
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,210
Beard, eyebrows, hair,

482
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,790
not a single hair should be left.

483
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,260
Shave them all.

484
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,160
Stop!

485
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,480
Come on, stop it!

486
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,510
Let them all go.

487
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,370
How can I cure you without these things?

488
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,240
But you need their consent first.

489
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,550
Isn't this just robbery in the room?

490
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,590
- He's just grass.
- Be quick, put it down.

491
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,210
Come on. Put it down.

492
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,980
How long do I have to keep stirring?

493
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,690
It should be done in about an hour.

494
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,580
An hour?

495
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,300
Irrational.

496
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,400
That's the traditional way
of cooking sugar.

497
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,340
I, a patient,
didn't complain about being tired.

498
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,610
You still remember
that you're a patient?

499
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,640
I've already fetched the herbs for you.

500
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,980
If you had listened to me,

501
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,540
you would have drunk it long ago.

502
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,310
What can we do?

503
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,880
We can't just take other people's things.

504
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,980
They are demons.

505
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,170
Demons and humans are the same,

506
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,410
not very different.

507
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,550
Just like this,

508
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,270
crush these dried fruits and peanuts,

509
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,030
and then throw them into

510
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,590
the syrup you boiled.

511
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,000
When they have cooled,

512
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
cut them into small strips.

513
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,740
The traditional sugar is done.

514
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,120
The sugar is ready.

515
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,110
Everyone, come and have a taste.

516
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,640
If you like it,

517
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,680
we can trade it for your hair and beard,

518
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,580
how about that?

519
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,300
What is this?

520
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,260
Really?

521
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,420
Could it be poisonous?

522
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,440
Delicious.

523
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,850
Delicious.

524
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,270
I trade.

525
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,000
I trade as well.

526
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,690
- I trade as well.
- I trade.

527
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,160
One at a time.

528
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,000
Don't push.

529
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,270
My roots are quite large.

530
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,300
I'll trade more.

531
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,900
Polygonum Multiflorum Demon,
you're not suitable for the symptoms.

532
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,670
I'll trade.

533
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,440
What do you know, young man?

534
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,400
At the moment your hair is thick.

535
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,680
Maybe in the future
you'll experience hair loss.

536
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,370
You may even become bald.

537
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,110
Although I am not suitable
for the symptoms now,

538
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,980
I will be useful in the future.

539
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,580
I'll trade more.

540
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Delicious.

541
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,660
So delicious.

542
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,210
- Delicious.
- Delicious.

543
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,340
- I've never tasted anything so delicious.
- So sweet.

544
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,720
Sweet.

545
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,630
Sweet.

546
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,610
I don't eat sugar.

547
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,310
It's really delicious.

548
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,340
Why don't you like sugar?

549
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,830
Because…

550
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,830
We made it together by hand.

551
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,340
Try it, is it tasty?

552
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,810
How is it? Is it sweet?

553
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,160
Is it sweet?

554
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,860
Is it sweet or not?

555
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,500
Why don't you say anything?

556
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,060
Sweet or not?

558
