23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,380
How could this happen?

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
This…

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,940
(Qingyi Marquis Mansion)

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,940
The Prophecy…

27
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,220
The Prophecy has come true.

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,780
The Blood Moon in the sky reappears.

29
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,690
The catastrophe of heaven

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,660
is coming.

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,500
Hasn't the Resentful Woman
already perished?

32
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,990
Why is the catastrophe of heaven
still coming?

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,620
I don't know.

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,290
According to the ancient book,

35
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,810
the Blood Moon in the sky

36
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,460
is the source of the Resentful Woman.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,120
But the Resentful Woman is already dead.

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,500
How can this still happen?

39
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,150
The Prophecy recorded
in the ancient book

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,410
should never be wrong.

41
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,460
Since it's coming,

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,250
let's save it one more time.

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,690
This time it's useless.

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,780
This is an ending
that was predetermined.

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,460
With our abilities,

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,620
we cannot change it.

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,120
What are you talking about, Miaomiao?

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,270
The ending,

49
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,530
we have already changed it
more than once.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Miaomiao,

51
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,940
did you know something?

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,940
The source of the catastrophe of heaven
is not the Resentful Woman,

53
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,100
but the person who created
this Demon Catching World,

54
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,100
the author of this novel,

55
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Fu Zhou.

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,100
I am not Lin Yu either.

57
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,060
My name is Ling Miaomiao.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,400
Actually,

59
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,820
I came from the world of Fu Zhou.

60
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,970
(Young Fu Zhou)
Fu Zhou is my favorite author.

61
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,370
I have read
all his journals and interviews.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,390
He once wrote that, in his childhood,

63
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,600
he was not happy at all.

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,490
Your child has

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,340
Moyamoya Disease.

66
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,290
It is a relatively rare

67
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,220
progressive cerebrovascular disease.

68
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,170
From now on,

69
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,610
make sure the child
avoids strenuous exercise

70
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,460
and tries to minimize
emotional fluctuations,

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,300
or he may have
an intracranial hemorrhage,

72
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,650
(Ibuprofen Sustained Release Capsules)
which could be life-threatening.

73
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,020
At that time,

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,600
he did not believe

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,530
(Young Fu Zhou)
that people could stand together,

76
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,490
love each other

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,490
and understand each other.

78
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,490
It was during his most furious moments,

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,820
in his deepest despair,

80
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,850
that he wrote his first novel.

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,780
In that story,

82
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,900
(Catching Demons)
everyone was afraid of each other,

83
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,530
concealing their true feelings
from one another

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,050
until they fell apart.

85
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,290
He even personally wrote the ending,

86
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,780
(The catastrophe of heaven)
a doomsday that destroyed everything.

87
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,900
I finally understood.

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,230
The book "Catching Demons"

89
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,610
is not his new work,

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,370
but his debut work from childhood.

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,460
Fu Zhou said,

92
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,260
he always wanted to give his novel

93
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,020
the most perfect ending.

94
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,110
I know,

95
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,290
what I said

96
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,220
is difficult to understand for you,

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,460
but you must understand.

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,700
You must trust me.

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,170
Only this child

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,340
can stop the catastrophe of heaven,

101
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,370
- because…
- Because we are all characters in his book,

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,580
and he is the creator of this world.

103
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,820
Where can we find him?

104
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,170
In all the novels of Fu Zhou,

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,900
the ballads at the beginning

106
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,370
indicate the ultimate answer.

107
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,160
I think

108
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,730
this book should be no exception.

Everyone,

128
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,700
we need all the power in this world

129

to build a ladder to the sky.

130
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,530
All demon spirits,

131
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,140
all Demon Catchers,

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,150
please help us

save the world
that belongs to all of us together.

134
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,590
Come, move these things
to the Tianji Pavilion.

135
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,920
It is protected by the formation.

136
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,200
That is also the safest place.

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,050
Quick!

138
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,880
- Quick!
- Chief Wang.

139
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,650
Chief Wang,

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,370
what are you doing now?

141
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,180
- Chief Guo!
- What are you doing?

142
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,350
You come just in time.

143
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm bringing these treasures
to Tianji Pavilion.

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,180
Come over and help move them.

145
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,990
Move…

146
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,200
The Guardian Master is building
a ladder to mend the sky,

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
fighting desperately for the world.

148
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,320
We need to use these to assist him.

149
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,200
What were you thinking
hiding them inside?

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,590
These are magical weapons
and national treasures.

151
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,350
No one can move them without approval.

152
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,940
I'm not wasting words with you,
give them to me.

153
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,180
No, no way.

154
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,820
- Chief Guo.
- Stop!

155
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,180
Supervisor Zhao, you come just in time.

156
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,340
He's abusing his power
for personal gain.

157
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,910
Stop speaking!

158
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,400
Let go. Give them to him. Just use.

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,210
If the world is gone,

160
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,600
what's the use of keeping
these treasures?

161
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,890
Demon Catchers
of the Astronomical Bureau, listen.

162
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes!

163
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,770
Assist the Guardian Master!

164
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
Yes!

165
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,550
Ziqi,

166
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,060
let's go to find him together.

167
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,340
Everyone, hold on.

168
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,180
Don't give up,

169
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,540
we can do it.

170
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,440
To save this world

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,850
requires everyone's strength.

172
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,420
Don't give up, we can do it!

173
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,080
To save this world

174
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,970
requires everyone's strength!

175
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,770
The ladder to the sky
is not long enough,

176
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,730
still a little short!

177
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,000
Ziqi!

178
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,700
Stand behind me.

179
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Miaomiao...

180
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,890
Who doesn't care?

181
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,800
- Did you care?
- How could I…

182
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,550
- It's not...
- Have you taken care of him for a day?

183
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,820
Is he only my child?

184
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,120
Don't I have to work?

185
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,160
Where did these genes come from?

186
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,380
Without money,
how can I afford treatment?

187
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,030
Look at your family!

188
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,500
- What do you mean by "your"?
- Your family…

189
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,050
Now you're shifting responsibility,
aren't you?

190
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,970
You still want to leave now?

191
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,130
- I…
- You've never cared for him since his birth.

192
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,200
Since he got sick,

193
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,750
you haven't taken care of him
for a single day.

194
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,560
I have to earn money.

195
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,450
- Now you're blaming me.
- I have to earn money,

196
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,600
or how can we afford the treatment?

197
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,700
What's the point?

198
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,820
Let everything be destroyed,

199
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,060
isn't it better?

200
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,820
After all, the ending is the same.

201
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,100
(CT Medical Imaging Diagnostic Report
of Jingjiang Medical University Hospital)

202
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,220
Your child has

203
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,610
Moyamoya Disease.

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,770
It is a relatively rare

205
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,890
progressive cerebrovascular disease.

206
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,650
It is caused by an arterial blockage

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,340
in the basal part of the brain.

208
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,850
From now on,

209
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,040
make sure the child
avoids strenuous exercise

210
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,520
and tries to minimize
emotional fluctuations,

211
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,680
or he may have
an intracranial hemorrhage,

212
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,940
which could be life-threatening.

213
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,610
It seems like from the moment
of a person's birth,

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,100
his ending is already written.

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,370
Some people are destined

216
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,370
to play a supporting role in this world,

217
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,590
to struggle in the corner,

218
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,970
but they can't change anything.

219
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,710
The ending

220
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,010
can be changed.

221
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,340
What's the use of saying these things?

222
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,540
You are just a character in my writing.

223
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,700
You are also a supporting role
in this world.

224
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes,

225
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,770
but when I believe

226
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,850
I can also love and be loved,

227
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,100
I am the protagonist of my own world.

228
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,190
I know,

229
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,340
for you right now,

230
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,700
the world seems like
an endless night without hope,

231
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,700
where not even a single star
can be seen.

232
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,820
(The catastrophe of heaven)

233
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,540
You will become a very good person,

234
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,650
bringing courage and hope

235
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,610
to more people.

236
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,970
Courage and hope,

237
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,300
I've never had them

238
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,020
and I won't have them
in the future either.

239
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,260
What are you talking about?

240
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,580
Didn't you have them before?

241
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,300
Show it to me.

242
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,690
Which color do you think looks best?

243
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,770
Try this one, it looks nice.

244
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,520
What are you doing?

245
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,410
This pen looks so nice, whose is it?

246
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,690
It got absorbed.

247
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,370
It comes in two colors.

248
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,990
It can really change colors gradually.

249
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,630
Really.

250
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Right at the school gate.

251
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,700
- It's so beautiful.
- Miaomiao, is this your pen?

252
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,370
- Yes, it is.
- It's so pretty.

253
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,480
Isn't it?

254
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,470
Yiming, Qiqi is calling us.

255
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,650
- Let's go.
- Okay.

256
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,410
I just went to ask the teacher.

257
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,450
The teacher explained,
but I didn't understand.

258
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,300
Why don't you ask the teacher
to explain it again tomorrow?

259
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,020
There are some parts
I didn't understand either.

260
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,410
Let's play soccer now.

261
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
Let's go.

262
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,820
(900 years ago, the catastrophe of heaven...
"Catching Demons")

263
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,850
At that time,

264
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,540
Miaomiao is like a sun,

265
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,780
illuminating your world.

266
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,650
She has saved you once
from the catastrophe of heaven,

267
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
hasn't she?

268
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,130
And her courage and hope

269
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,300
are also left by your side.

270
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,910
Was it you who reported to the teacher?

271
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,260
- I…
- Speak.

272
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,240
Speak up.

273
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,440
We have known it.

274
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,310
To be honest,

275
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,150
Pei Xiaocen,

276
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,510
what are you pretending for?

277
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,320
I tell you,

278
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,020
if you dare to report
to the teacher again,

279
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,850
you'll know the consequences.

280
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,960
Wu Nian!

281
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,440
You are bullying people again!

282
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,170
Do you think others don't exist?

283
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,520
Ling Miaomiao,

284
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
apologize.

285
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,940
I did nothing wrong.
Why should I apologize?

286
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,820
You all go out first.

287
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,700
- Goodbye, teacher.
- Goodbye, teacher.

288
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,340
Go to the infirmary
and apply some medicine.

289
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,310
Okay.

290
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,450
I can't teach you anymore, right?

291
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,690
Look at your exam paper.

292
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,370
It's all wrong!

293
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,370
You bully classmates
but refuse to apologize.

294
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,500
Do you know how bad this behavior is?

295
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,980
I'll call your dad.

296
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,100
Why are you covered in blood?

297
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,650
Are you alright?

298
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,370
Speak!

299
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
Miaomiao's dad!

300
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,580
I heard Miaomiao transferred schools.

301
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,390
Is it true?

302
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,610
I heard something happened
to her family.

303
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,410
It seems her dad was hit by a car.

304
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,690
Really?

305
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,980
Is it because of
Wu Nian's school bullying?

306
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,440
It's possible.

307
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,690
I… I'll help you.

308
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,450
She's leaving?

309
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,640
(With multiple students
telling the truth)

310
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,780
(and testifying,)

311
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,660
(after a serious investigation
by the school,)

312
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,010
(regarding the recent)

313
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,120
(school bullying incident,)

314
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,910
(Ling Miaomiao's right. I saw Wu Nian bully.)
(the Academic Affairs Office decides)

315
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,550
(all students involved in the bullying)

316
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,410
(publicly apologize to the victim.)

317
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,700
(The main bully Wu Nian)

318
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,200
(will be given a disciplinary record.)

319
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,790
(Other accomplices)

320
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,070
(in the bullying behavior)

321
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,580
(will be given a severe warning.)

322
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,870
Come out.

323
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,080
You don't need to hide inside anymore.

324
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,130
Who are you?

325
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,020
I am you,

326
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,020
but not entirely you.

327
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,410
You look so brave and powerful,

328
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,890
as if you're not afraid of anything.

329
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,740
How could you be me?

330
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,130
It's true.

331
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,930
The future you

332
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,650
will be brave

333
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,280
and powerful,

334
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,930
but not fearless.

335
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
But

336
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,340
no matter what you fear,

337
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,690
you can face it.

338
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,800
Really?

339
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,550
Yes.

340
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,910
Come on.

341
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,390
Come.

342
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,340
Save us.

343
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,020
I want to go to the future
you mentioned.

344
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,480
You will.

345
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Ziqi.

346
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,910
Ziqi,

347
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,820
have you found him?

348
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,320
Can the catastrophe of heaven
be stopped?

349
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,910
This time,

350
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,300
I'm not sure either.

351
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,060
Fu Zhou is a gentle

352
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,410
and powerful person.

353
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,150
I have been his reader for ten years,

354
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,960
so I know him best,

355
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,400
- and he definitely...
- Miaomiao,

356
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,830
listen to me.

357
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,210
When I wrote this book,

358
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,370
I was not such a person.

359
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,110
You…

360
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,930
Are you saying

361
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,020
you are Fu Zhou?

362
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,580
Do you know

363
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,400
why someone like me,

364
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,650
sensitive, fragile

365
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,850
and desperate,

366
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,890
later wrote stories that were different?

367
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,170
Because I met you.

368
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,130
Every novel of mine

369
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,170
was written for you.

370
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,500
(Working Miao:)

371
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,470
(The only one who can surpass Fu Zhou
is himself.)

(Make exercise a habit,

382
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,110
Hello, Zhang,

383
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm planning to have an operation.

384
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,740
When you're facing life and death,

385
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,220
no matter how much preparation is done,

386
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,200
it's inevitable to have

387
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,260
lingering fears and wild thoughts,

388
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,500
wanting to escape,

389
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,260
wanting to end it,

390
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,300
wondering why it is me,

391
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,540
and thinking about

392
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,060
whether there is
a completely different life

393
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,070
in some world

394
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,340
unknown to me.

395
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,980
At that moment

396
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,980
I made three wishes.

397
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,960
First,

398
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,720
the original story

399
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,650
could be rewritten
into a beautiful ending.

400
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,040
Second,

401
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,820
the girl I like

402
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,930
could see my hidden true feelings.

403
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,390
Miaomiao,

404
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,340
I hope that you and I

405
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,500
can have a good ending.

406
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,450
I also hope

407
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,260
that you can see my true feelings.

408
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,640
I hope you can see

409
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,980
my hidden true feelings.

410
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,410
I hope you know

411
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,930
