=Episode 1=

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,510
(After starting to work,)

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,830
(my favorite day is Saturday.)

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,800
(I'll let myself sleep in.)

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,670
(Then I'll just stay home all day.)

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
(I can do whatever I want.)

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,960
(Watching the goldfish swim,)

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,420
(I can zone out for an entire day.)

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,980
(Fu Zhou, written in 2017)
(But today,)

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,520
(I've read it 15 times.)
(I have something else I want to do.)

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,820
(By Fu Zhou)
(Fu Zhou)

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,350
(is my favorite author.)

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,750
(He finally released a new book.)

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,110
(His world is full of wonders)

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,640
(with innovative and clever plots.)

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,030
(The style is warm and healing.)

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,200
(Audio book, comments)
(As a ten-year fan,)

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,390
(Catching Demons)
(I've read)

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,860
(every one of his novels many times.)

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,120
(They are an indispensable part
of my life.)

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,840
(Working girl, Ling Miaomiao)
In this world,

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,640
demons run rampant, waiting for heroes
to write their legends.

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,240
Fu Zhou, a famous fantasy
and supernatural writer,

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,340
after three years,

25
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,840
has finally released his new work,
Catching Demons.

26
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,320
Stay tuned.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,200
(Nine hundred years ago,)

28
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,500
(the catastrophe of heaven
descended upon the world.)

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,200
(At that time, the heavens cracked.)

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,530
(Mountains and seas were split.)

31
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,500
(The giant Resentful Woman
devoured the earth.)

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
(The cultivator Mu Qingshi
was enlightened in crisis,)

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,510
(achieving the heavenly realm.)

34
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,180
(He used his body to mend the sky.)

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,840
(After the catastrophe,
people feared demons.)

36
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,240
(Demon catching became the profession
of cultivators.)

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,480
(Mu Qingshi's descendants carried on.)

38
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,300
(The Mus became famous demon catchers.)

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,740
(Mu Family)
(Seven years ago,)

40
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,040
(The Resentful Woman,
the Queen of Demons, appeared.)

41
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,430
(After killing the Mus, she vanished.)

42
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,940
(Mr. Tao)

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,710
Hello, Mr. Tao.

44
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
Ling.

45
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,910
We'll have a meeting soon.

46
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,430
You need to notify everyone.

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,750
They must all be

48
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,400
at the company before noon.

49
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,350
A meeting?

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
But Mr. Tao,

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,960
today is

52
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,840
Saturday.

53
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,260
(Catching Demons)

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,190
(Now, Taicang County in Jiangnan
is also facing demon troubles.)

55
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,710
(It's said that on wedding nights,)

56
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,960
(new grooms are often harmed by demons.)

57
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,630
(County Magistrate's Mansion)
(The whole city is in panic.)

58
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,190
(To ensure peace,
County Magistrate Lin Lushan)

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,700
(asks the descendants of the Mu family
to take command.)

60
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,710
Sorry.

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,550
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,310
It's fine.

63
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,670
What's wrong with the leading actor?

64
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,960
Ignoring the leading actress?

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
He's kind to every girl; not good.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,380
The yandere supporting actor
is more appealing.

67
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,280
The supporting actress

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,710
is so catty every time she shows up.

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,030
Why are they still friends?

70
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,190
If you can't write romance,

71
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,930
don't force it.

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,080
I paid 20 for a membership.

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,130
How can you show me this?

74
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,430
I only made you revise
the proposal over 20 times,

75
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,270
yet you're tired.

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,540
How many times have I said it?

77
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,010
The proposal is very important.

78
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,270
The slides represent

79
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,070
- the attitude.
- (This is when)

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,960
- Are you counting on the company?
- (Lin Yu started to love Liu Fuyi.)

81
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,740
- It won't last.
- (She's always with him.)

82
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
(This way,)

83
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
(Yao would be safe.)

84
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
(Sister Mu.)

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,150
(You can only blame yourself
for being clueless.)

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,520
(If you disappear,)

87
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,140
(Brother Liu will be mine.)

88
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Yours.

89
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,030
Mine?

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Yours.

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Mine.

92
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,560
You can submit it Monday morning, right?

93
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,680
No problem, boss.

94
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,710
Okay.

95
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,190
No matter how much is said,

96
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,960
attitude determines everything.

97
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,480
Dad,

98
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,230
I had a really unlucky day today.

99
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,840
How am I supposed
to finish this by Monday?

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,680
(I can still stall for a while.)

101
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
Liu Fuyi,

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,470
have you ever loved me?

103
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,710
No.

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
Never.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
I approached you to get

106
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,240
the Hundred Demons Mountain
and Sea Map.

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,920
(How can this novel be so absurd?)

108
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,240
(Is there going to be)

109
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,830
(a major twist later?)

110
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,720
(The writer is Fu Zhou, after all.)

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
(I'll wait until the ending.)

112
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,300
(Spirit Tablet of Lin Yu)

113
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,270
Lin Yu,

114
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,800
why did you poison my drink?

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,950
Why do you want me dead?

116
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,120
Because the one she wants
to marry isn't me.

117
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,480
It's Liu Fuyi.

118
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,480
So you really are a demon.

119
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,240
You all lied to me.

120
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,000
(Fu Zhou,)

121
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,010
(you're my favorite author.)

122
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,320
(Are you trying to fool your fans
for money too?)

123
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,160
(I'm so disappointed in you.)

124
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,440
(Working Miao, Quick Post)
Such a cheesy romantic novel.

125
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,390
It's a romance novel dressed
in a fantasy guise,

126
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,900
but the romance part is also lousy.

127
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,090
The official couple is so stupid.

128
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,500
The plot relies entirely
on the vicious supporting actress.

129
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,710
This book might as well be called
The Legend of Lin Yu.

130
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,720
The main storyline is thin
with flat characters.

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
The novel is so absurd.

132
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,800
And the author just gives

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,830
everyone a tragic ending.

134
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,120
What's the difference
between this ending and a scam?

135
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,140
(Quick Post)

136
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,220
(Such a cheesy romantic novel.)

137
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,140
(The game is progress)

138
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,340
(Boss; Player)

139
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,220
(Cruel and ruthless)

140
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,300
(The game is progress)

141
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,620
(Ancient romance, supporting actress,
storyline-expanding, absurd, cheesy)

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,600
(Where is this?)

143
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,670
(Am I dreaming?)

144
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,760
(Did I have Yunnan mushrooms?)

145
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,670
Miss.

146
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Miss.

147
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,120
The auspicious time is near.

148
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,930
You should change
into your wedding attire.

149
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,790
Who are you?

150
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,470
Why are you dressed in ancient costumes?

151
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,420
(Wan, County Magistrate's maid)
I am...

152
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,430
I'm Wan, Miss.

153
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,310
You don't recognize me?

154
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,010
Wan?

155
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,920
(The supporting actress's personal maid
from Catching Demons.)

156
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,800
(Am I in the novel?)

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,600
So, who am I?

158
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,150
Miss,

159
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
did you get possessed

160
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
by a demon again?

161
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,310
What's going on?

162
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
Why am I also in ancient costumes?

163
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,750
Hello, Host.

164
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,120
- Who's speaking?
- You have entered a parallel world

165
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,040
based on the novel Catching Demons.

166
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,870
From now on, you'll be

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,070
the County Magistrate's daughter,
Lin Yu.

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
Lin Yu?

169
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,390
The vicious supporting actress?

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
You have to clear the game

171
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,630
to return to the real world.

172
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,000
You must meet the following
two conditions to clear the game:

173
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,470
First,

174
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,750
complete the main quest
and survive until the end

175
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
by helping kill the Resentful Woman.

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,790
Second, complete the hidden quest.

177
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,960
Both conditions are essential.

178
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,270
(This is ridiculous.)

179
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,800
(I can't believe
I've been traveled into a book.)

180
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,150
(Forget it.)

181
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,440
(I'm here anyway. I must ask)

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
(what I need to do to go back.)

183
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,030
Tell me; what's the hidden quest?

184
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,200
The hidden quest will be revealed

185
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,790
after you complete
all the tasks for beginners.

186
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,120
Task one for a beginner:

187
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,770
Marry Liu Fuyi, consummate the marriage,

188
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,500
and pretend to love him.

189
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,540
Consummate the marriage?

190
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,940
- I don't want to.
- It's loading

191
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,490
the beginner tutorial mode.

192
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,360
- No way.
- Three.

193
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,010
- Two, one.
- No way, why?

194
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,070
I don't want to do this.

195
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,300
I want to go out.

196
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,070
Why should I?

197
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
I'm not playing this. I want to go out.

198
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,460
=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

199
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,740
(The end)

200
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,500
(Produced by Sun Zhonghuai,
Wang Yixu, Zhang Yucheng)

201
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,120
Ouch!

202
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,110
Miss.

203
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,410
The auspicious time is near.

204
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,500
You should change
into your wedding attire.

205
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,320
Miss, where are you going?

206
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,150
Young Master Liu will be here soon.

207
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,670
This time, it should be fine, right?

208
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,280
(Okay.)

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,840
(It's just a common bug
in novel traveling.)

210
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,220
(I just have to follow the plot.)

211
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,510
(If I don't marry him,)

212
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,170
(I can never leave this courtyard,
right?)

213
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,550
Miss.

214
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,900
Miss.

215
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,200
The auspicious time is near.

216
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,420
You should change
into your wedding attire.

217
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,540
(Young girl, Ling Miaomiao)
Fine, I'll get married for now.

218
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,140
(County Magistrate's daughter, Lin Yu)

219
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,820
(Happy)

220
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,460
(Famous demon catcher, Liu Fuyi)
Miss Lin, are you ready?

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
(So this is
what the leading actor looks like.)

222
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,800
(He's better looking
than described in the book.)

223
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,900
We need to act a bit more intimate,

224
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,330
like,

225
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,020
toasting

226
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,350
under the wedding candle.

227
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,720
Toasting?

228
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,860
I know you're a noble lady.

229
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,840
I must be too forward.

230
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,760
But if we don't,

231
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,940
the demon

232
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,800
might get suspicious.

233
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,600
Let's do the whole act properly.

234
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,620
No problem.

235
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,940
Come on.

236
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
Hurry up.

237
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,220
Let's get through the plot

238
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,500
so I can go back soon.

239
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,780
Come on. Cheers.

240
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,100
(Isn't this just water?)

241
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,260
She seems to be here.

242
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,900
Don't look back.

243
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,260
She's right behind you.

244
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,420
Young Master,

245
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,540
come here.

246
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,980
Come.

247
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,620
Young Master,

248
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,620
come here.

249
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,620
Who's prettier,

250
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,420
me or your bride?

251
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,140
How could she compare to you?

252
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,340
Congratulations, Host.

253
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,580
You have completed
the first tutorial task.

254
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,060
Miss Lin,

255
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,500
are you alright?

256
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
I'm fine.

257
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,980
(Wait.)

258
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,900
(In the original novel,
Lin Yu tore Liu Fuyi's talisman.)

259
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,260
(That means I tore Liu Fuyi's talisman.)

260
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,980
(Original plot)

261
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,260
(Sister Mu.)

262
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,420
(You can only blame yourself
for being clueless.)

263
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,780
(If you disappear,)

264
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,100
(Brother Liu will be mine.)

265
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,900
Oh, no.

266
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,540
The leading actress is in danger;
you need to save her.

267
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,460
Who?

268
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,300
Mu Yao.

269
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,060
Don't worry.

270
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,460
I set up a talisman at Yao's door.

271
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,120
- The demon can't escape far.
- There's no time; she's in danger.

272
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,160
You need to go now.

273
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,340
Hurry.

274
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,020
(Mirror Demon)

275
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,380
Excuse me. Mu Yao...

276
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,660
Where is Mu Yao's room?

277
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,780
Miss,

278
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
it's over there.

279
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,700
Over there.

280
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,580
Alright, alright.

281
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
This ancient young lady

282
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,420
has such poor physical condition.

283
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,620
(Mu family's master, Mu Yao)

284
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,260
Sister Mu Yao, are you alright?

285
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
She's still here.

286
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,100
Yao!

287
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,940
Sister Mu Yao, Brother Liu.

288
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,460
Miss Lin.

289
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,380
Miss Lin.

290
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,460
Where are you?

291
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,380
Listen to me.

292
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,560
This is a Mirror Demon.

293
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,580
We are trapped
in the Mirror Demon's space.

294
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,540
We can't see each other

295
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,620
because everything
in front of us isn't real.

296
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,800
It's all a reflection.

297
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,500
To get out, we must find the true mirror

298
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,860
where the demon hides

299
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,740
and break it.

300
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,500
Miss Lin.

301
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,680
She's not a demon catcher.

302
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,000
She's just an ordinary person.

303
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,700
Your opponent is us.

304
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,820
Let her go.

305
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,940
Let her go?

306
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,740
It seems you have integrity

307
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,700
and worry about the innocent.

308
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,620
Don't harm her.

309
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,780
Mirror Demon,

310
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,860
why did you kill grooms
on wedding nights?

311
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,260
They were tempted by me.

312
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,500
They were all heartless men

313
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,460
who deserved to die.

314
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,860
But their brides

315
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,540
were always so deluded,

316
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,420
just like my master.

317
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,020
Your master?

318
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,980
Exactly.

319
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,540
My master was infatuated and misled.

320
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,060
For that heartless man
who married another woman,

321
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,500
she was willing to give up everything.

322
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,140
Any woman

323
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,500
who falls in love

324
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,380
will end up like her.

325
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,460
Step back.

326
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,780
Put down your weapon,

327
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,420
or she'll die right away.

328
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,420
Without weapons,

329
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,980
demon catchers

330
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,260

Thought the Mirror Demon does evil,

367
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,100
she's also loyal to its old master,

for women in the world.

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,780
Those who harm my sister

371
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,740
must die.

372
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,460
Sister Mu Yao.

373
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,340
Sister.

374
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,460
Sister Mu Yao.

375
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,380
Are you alright?

376
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,380
Sister.

377
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
The immortal appear with bright stars.

378
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,900
Where light meets darkness,
greatness is achieved.

379
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,820
Demon Trap Tower,

380
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,850
go.

381
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,660
(Wow.)

382
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,860
(These special effects.)

383
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,580
(If this were adapted into a film,
how much would it cost?)

384
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,620
Sister, I'm late.

385
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,020
(Is this)

386
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,740
(my lover in the novel?)

387
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,860
(My future husband?)

388
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,580
(Mu Sheng doesn't love Lin Yu.)

389
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,900
(Marrying her is just for revenge.)

390
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
(After marriage,)

391
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,900
(Mu Sheng humiliates and torments her.)

392
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,660
(He uses all means necessary.)

393
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,620
(He even places a love curse on her)

394
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,980
(so she cannot speak of it
to outsiders.)

395
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,500
(Lin Yu is soon tortured to the point
of wishing she were dead,)

396
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,460
(falling into self-inflicted suffering,)

397
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,740
(what she deserves.)

398
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,580
Get lost!

399
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,540
Sister, let's go back inside.

400
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,340
(Forget about it.)

401
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,080
(This character set is too terrifying.)

402
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,540
(I can't mess with him.)

403
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,380
Sister.

404
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,220
(Qingyue Pavilion)
Miss Lin,

405
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,420
how did you know the way out

406
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,500
so quickly?

407
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,220
I...

408
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Well...

409
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,220
(It's because I know the plots.)

410
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,020
Of course,
it's because of my keen insight

411
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,820
and calm judgment.

412
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,620
Miss Lin,

413
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,900
you're far braver than I imagined.

414
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,900
You're flattering me.

415
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,140
If you hadn't

416
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,620
reminded me that Yao
was in danger today,

417
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,860
I probably wouldn't have
arrived in time.

418
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,860
No need to be polite.

419
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,700
It was nothing.

420
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,740
It was I should do.

421
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,060
Sister,

422
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,820
does it hurt?

423
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,180
I'm fine.

424
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,940
But I got hurt.

425
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
If it hurts, go apply some medicine.

426
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,100
You still have the energy to shout here.

427
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,580
If I hadn't come back today,

428
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,220
you would have been in trouble.

429
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,340
I've told him not to leave you alone.

430
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,660
Enough.

431
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,100
It was me who sent Fuyi.

432
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,180
Fuyi just wanted

433
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,580
to catch the big demon quickly.

434
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,700
Is catching demons
more important than your life?

435
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,780
Where was he when you were in trouble?

436
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,740
He even found a woman to marry.

437
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,900
It's my fault.

438
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,420
Sheng is right.

439
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,100
About today,

440
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,420
I didn't think it through.

441
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,520
You were just thinking
of the big picture.

442
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
Sheng is being inconsiderate.

443
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,100
(Soap opera drama aside,)

444
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,420
(I'd love to see
more fighting scenes of men)

445
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,980
(like this.)

446
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,660
About today,

447
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,540
it's all thanks to Miss Lin.

448
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,860
If she hadn't reminded me
that you'd be in danger,

449
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,040
I wouldn't have known.

450
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,700
(They're developing feelings
as the official couple.)

451
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,720
(Why are you crying,
supporting leading actress?)

452
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Why am I still crying?

453
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,780
Miss Lin, what's wrong?

454
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,700
I...

455
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,740
I...

456
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,560
The demon problem here
has been resolved.

457
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,460
That's a good thing.

458
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,780
Why are you crying?

459
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,460
I just...

460
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,380
I feel very touched.

461
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,820
Touched?

462
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,570
Yeah.

463
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,460
I saw Sister Mu and Brother Liu
protecting each other.

464
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,440
They're a perfect match.

465
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,700
They're so happy.

466
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,340
I just feel so envious and touched.

467
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,820
Who told you they are a perfect match?

468
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,100
Liu Fuyi is just

469
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,580
a hypocrite seeking fame.

470
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,940
He's not worthy of my sister.

471
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,980
(Oh, no.)

472
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,100
(I forgot that in the novel,)

473
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,500
(the leads aren't together yet.)

474
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,740
(And Mu Sheng is very protective
of his sister.)

475
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,580
(He hates it when his sister has
romantic ties with the leading actor.)

476
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,740
(I misspoke.)

477
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,100
Besides,

478
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,020
are you envious

479
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,500
or resentful?

480
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,660
How could that be?

481
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,300
Young Master Mu must be just joking.

482
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,300
It's getting late.

483
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,820
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

484
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,500
Miss Lin, why do you want to leave?

485
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,020
I haven't properly thanked you yet.

486
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,820
Thank me for what?

487
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,900
For reminding Liu Fuyi

488
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,780
to protect my sister, of course.

489
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,100
But

490
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
how did you know
my sister would be in danger?

491
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,180
I don't know.

492
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,040
I just thought...

493
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,780
Why are you shivering, Miss Lin?

494
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
Well.

495
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,300
It seems

496
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,300
like we can't be too close, right?

497
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,420
You got your lipstick smudged.

498
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,860
Looks like you just ate a child.

499
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,060
(What's going on?)

500
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,100
(Why am I still)

501
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,860
(in this place after I woke up?)

502
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,100
(Do I have to complete
the system's required tasks)

503
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,460
(to return to reality?)

504
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,980
(What's the worldview)

505
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,060
(of this stupid novel, anyway?)

506
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,840
(Nine hundred years ago,)

507
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,720
(Heavenly Demon Catcher Mu Qingshi)
(the catastrophe of heaven came.)

508
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,160
(The cultivator Mu Qingshi
was enlightened in crisis,)

509
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,900
(achieving the heavenly realm.)

510
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,380
(He used his body to mend the sky.)

511
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,100
(After the catastrophe,)

512
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,860
(people feared demons.)

513
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,500
(Demon catching became the profession
of cultivators.)

514
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,260
(The Mus' Ancestral Home)
(Mu Qingshi's descendants carried on.)

515
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,060
(Mu Mansion)
(The Mus became famous demon catchers.)

516
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
(Seven years ago,)

517
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,340
(The Resentful Woman,
the Queen of Demons, appeared.)

518
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,540
(After killing the Mus, she vanished.)

519
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
(After the massacre,)

520
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,840
(the surviving leading actress, Mu Yao,)

521
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,440
(and the supporting actor, Mu Sheng,
started to roam the world,)

522
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,540
(Young Mu Sheng; Young Mu Yao)
(walking all around,)

523
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,260
(and living off demon catching rewards.)

524
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
(Mu)
(Along the way, they met Liu Fuyi.)

525
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,360
(Later, in Taicang County,)

526
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,260
(they took in
the supporting actress, Lin Yu.)

527
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,880
(That'd be me.)

528
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,640
(So, I joined the main character group.)

529
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,820
Please forgive me
for being clumsy, Miss.

530
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,740
Please forgive me
for being clumsy, Miss.

531
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,660
- Sorry, Miss.
- Why are you so scared of me?

532
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,500
Get up.

533
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,940
It's just a hair.

534
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,900
It's not a big deal.

535
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,420
It's my hair quality that's poor.

536
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,060
It's dry,
so its split ends break easily.

537
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
It's not your fault.

538
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,220
Get up, get up.

539
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,740
Yes.

540
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,460
Miss, which one do you
want to wear today?

541
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,740
Is this one made of copper?

542
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,740
It's pure gold.

543
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,060
What?

544
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,980
Such a big pearl.

545
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,300
This is the best South Sea Pearl.

546
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,620
Miss, it's time
for your bird's nest soup.

547
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,940
Come on, eat up.

548
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,540
After you finish,
we need to go pick up the master.

549
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,540
Goodness.

550
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,780
(Extravagance and luxury.)

551
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,240
(In the novel,
Lin Yu's father is a corrupt official.)

552
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,100
(All of this is
from the people's hard work.)

553
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,980
(No wonder Lin Yu is
so selfish and cunning.)

554
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,060
(Like father, like daughter.)

555
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:25,460

(Wine)
Buns!

557
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,260
Come and try the hot buns.

558
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,700
- Take a look.
- Buns!

559
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,540
Miss.

560
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,660
Over there.

561
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
I want this.

562
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,060
Alright, alright.

563
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,220
(Taicang Wharf)

564
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,100
Alright.

565
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,940
Take care.

566
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,620
Just ahead.

567
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
Miss.

568
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,080
Come try candied hawthorns.

569
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,760
They're sweet and big.

570
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,660
Slow down.

571
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,380
Wan,

572
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,540
I can't see clearly.

573
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,420
Which one is my father?

574
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,330
They're sweet and big.

575
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,060
Selling fruits!

576
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,980
- The one in the gray robe.
- Slow down.

577
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,460
That's our master.

578
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,800
- Come on.
- Selling fruits.

579
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,940
Dear.

580
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,220
Move!

581
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,300
Move!

582
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,940
Move!

583
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,380
Move! Move!

584
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,020
Dear.

585
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,260
Did it scare you?

586
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,220
Don't be afraid.

587
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,340
