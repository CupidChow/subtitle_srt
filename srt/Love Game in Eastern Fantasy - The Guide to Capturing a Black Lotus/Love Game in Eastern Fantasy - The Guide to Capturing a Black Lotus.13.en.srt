00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,320
Fuyi,

4
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,340
there's something I want to ask you.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,760
Go ahead.

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,250
In the Water Demon Illusion,

7
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,610
what exactly is your inner demon?

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,500
Your cultivation is the best among us,

9
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,050
but you have been trapped the longest.

10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,860
This means that your inner demon
is the deepest and heaviest.

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,300
In these five years,

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,410
you have never told me
anything about your past.

13
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,780
What exactly did you experience before

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,260
to have such a heavy inner demon?

15
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,620
Fuyi.

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,260
It's all in the past.

17
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,860
If you hadn't mentioned it,

18
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,020
I would have forgotten.

19
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
You and I have shared each other's fate
for a long time.

20
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,900
You know everything about my past.

21
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,620
But about your past,

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,100
I know nothing.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I don't even know who your master is.

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,260
Fuyi,

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,100
am I still someone you can trust

26
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,980
and rely on?

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,940
Of course.

28
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
Why don't you let me understand you?

29
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,140
No matter what kind of
inner demon you have,

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,740
I'm willing to face it with you,

31
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,660
just like you've always been with me.

32
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,780
My illness is almost cured.

33
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,890
But I'm feeling very irritable
these days.

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
I can't even stop the nosebleeds.

35
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,530
It's probably because

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,020
the medicine is too strong.

37
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,260
Isn't it just some radix isatidis and
honeysuckle?

38
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,540
They are herbal demons with
hundreds of years of cultivation.

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,500
Did you think they were ordinary herbs?

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,220
It's said that a single beard

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,500
from a thousand-year-old Ginseng Demon

42
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,340
can save a life.

43
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,700
That's incredible.

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,660
The medical conditions here

45
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,980
are really good.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,900
You're oversimplifying.

47
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,820
The plant and tree demons
fear humans the most,

48
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,140
and they are also the best at hiding.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,620
The higher the cultivation level,
the less likely you are to see them.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,100
The herbs you saw
the day before yesterday

51
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,780
were caught by Mu Sheng

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,340
for an entire night.

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,900
An entire night?

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,460
Mu Sheng seems fierce

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,500
and has a sharp tongue,

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,860
but when it comes to
doing things for you,

57
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,180
he doesn't hesitate at all.

58
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,500
Miaomiao, are you two good friends?

59
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,460
Not before,

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,500
but after we went through
life and death together,

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,580
we should be considered good friends now.

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,500
Why not before?

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,060
Because before...

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,740
(Because)

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,020
(I used to see him as just)

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,500
(a non-player character to be conquered.)

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,780
(Now…)

68
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,300
(Strangely enough,)

69
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,780
(I haven't thought about conquering him)

70
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,060
(for a long time.)

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
Miaomiao.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
Shh.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,340
Miaomiao.

74
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,780
I'm coming.

75
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Hide yourself.

76
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,340
We should set off.

77
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,140
What's wrong?

78
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,060
I've all packed up.

79
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,420
What are you doing?

80
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,540
I just…

81
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,260
I've just felt

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,820
really itchy all over my body,

83
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,980
so I've been scratching myself.

84
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,700
Hurry up and pack up.

85
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,820
Why would you transform into

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,220
a back scratcher?

87
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,810
Isn't that absurd?

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,740
Miaomiao,

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,700
your sister Mu Yao

90
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,180
may still not allow you

91
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,460
to take me on the journey.

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,660
If I turn into a hairpin and
put it in your hair,

93
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,500
your sister Mu Yao can see me every day.

94
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,380
Sooner or later I will be exposed.

95
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,060
So we have to be smart

96
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,220
and act according to the situation.

97
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,260
Don't get discovered.

98
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,260
Hide here.

99
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,820
Here I come. Sorry for the wait.

100
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,740
Why are you bringing so many things?

101
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,100
Not much.

102
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,180
These are just the basic bedding

103
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,820
and some clothes for changing.

104
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,780
No need to bring a pillow.

105
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,180
No, the boss gave it to me.
It's not heavy.

106
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,340
Miaomiao,

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,140
the mountain road is difficult to traverse.

108
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,540
There's no way to ride a horse

109
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,260
or take a carriage.

110
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,500
It's better to bring fewer things.

111
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
Additionally,

112
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
this is

113
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,380
too cumbersome.

114
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,060
It's better to change back to the hairpin,

115
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,060
and it's more convenient.

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,300
Thank you, Sister Mu.

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,700
What's going on?

118
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,860
Your sister has agreed
to take Cuicui on the journey.

119
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,140
Why are you still like this?

120
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,260
My sister has agreed
to take you on the journey.

121
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,220
Why not change back?

122
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,180
That's great!

123
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,580
I can go with you to find my grandfather.

124
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,100
Take these.

125
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,620
(Tailai Inn)
I really didn't expect you

126
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,780
to agree to
travel with a little demon.

127
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,740
His magical power is weak.

128
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,660
With us, he can't do anything bad.

129
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,020
Miaomiao already considers him a friend.

130
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,560
If I don't allow it,

131
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,220
she will be sad.

132
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,060
Aren't you tired from walking for so long?

133
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,420
You're the slowest.

134
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,100
Don't always lag behind.

135
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,940
Come on.

136
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,860
Where are we going?

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,820
The area beyond the mountains.

138
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,460
The area beyond the mountains?

139
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,940
It is the edge of the
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

140
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,900
There lies an endless range of
nameless mountains.

141
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,860
The mountains are high
and difficult to climb.

142
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,700
No one knows what lies
beyond the mountains.

143
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,500
The Mitu Valley we encountered

144
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,620
is a rare entrance.

145
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,020
If we pass through it,

146
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,380
we could very likely reach
the area beyond the mountains.

147
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Why do we need to go there?

148
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,500
My sister is going to search for
clues about the Resentful Woman.

149
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,900
How much longer do we have to walk?

150
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,020
I don't know.

151
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,180
It might take three to five days.

152
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
That long?

153
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,660
Or maybe three to five years.

154
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,220
Three to five years?

155
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,580
He's just trying to scare you.

156
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,400
But this path is
indeed difficult to walk.

157
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,540
Let's hold on a bit longer.

158
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,060
We'll find a place to settle down
before nightfall.

159
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,580
There doesn't seem to be any signs
of habitation ahead.

160
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,230
We may have to spend the night
on the mountain.

161
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,620
Look,

162
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,500
there's a statue here.

163
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,140
Who would put such a statue

164
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,340
in the deep mountains?

165
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,700
What's it for?

166
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,860
I don't know.

167
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,100
I've never seen
a statue like this before.

168
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,100
(This panda)

169
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,340
(looks like it has broken through
the dimensional wall.)

170
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,580
This might be
a directional boundary marker.

171
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,380
There might be a village up ahead.

172
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,100
Let's hurry and see.

173
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,540
There's another one.

174
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,850
Who would put such a statue

175
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,100
in the deep mountains?

176
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
What's it for?

177
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,740
I don't know.

178
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,140
I've never seen
a statue like this before.

179
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,700
Isn't this…

180
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,860
This might be
a directional boundary marker.

181
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,060
There might be a village up ahead.

182
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,580
Let's hurry and see.

183
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,140
Miaomiao, let's go.

184
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,940
(It appears again.)

185
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,020
Look,

186
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
there's a statue here.

187
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,700
Who would put such a statue

188
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,900
in the deep mountains?

189
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,380
What's it for?

190
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,590
I don't know.

191
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,900
I've never seen
a statue like this before.

192
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,180
What are you talking about?

193
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,980
Haven't we seen
this panda statue twice before?

194
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Don't you remember?

195
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,420
Miss Lin,

196
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,020
are you too tired from the journey?

197
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,700
Let's walk along this path

198
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,300
and find a place to rest.

199
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,260
- I…
- This might be a directional boundary marker.

200
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,020
There might be a village up ahead.

201
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Let's hurry and see.

202
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,500
Wait a moment.

203
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,340
I… I'll make a mark.

204
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,700
- You're really strange.
- Let's go.

205
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,900
(It really is like this.)

206
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,060
Look,

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,420
there's a statue here.

208
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,540
Who would put such a statue

209
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,580
in the deep mountains?

210
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,650
Don't go any further.

211
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,720
There's something wrong with this place.

212
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,060
We've been going in circles.

213
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,500
Miss Lin,

214
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,820
are you too tired from the journey?

215
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,420
Let's walk along this path

216
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,820
and find a place to rest.

217
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,340
I… I'm not tired, you…

218
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,820
Don't you remember?

219
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,700
It's the fourth time

220
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,420
we've seen this panda statue.

221
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,930
Look at the flower,

222
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,100
that mark.

223
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,980
This flower is the marker I just placed.

224
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,660
Mu Sheng!

225
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,900
Sister Mu!

226
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,140
Brother Liu!

227
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,340
Where did you go?

228
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,460
Cuicui!

229
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,380
Cuicui!

230
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,060
Sister Mu!

231
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,060
Ziqi!

232
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,780
Liu Fuyi,

233
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,420
have you ever loved me?

234
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,900
No.

235
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,700
Never.

236
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,250
From the beginning,
the only reason I came to you was

237
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,420
to get the
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

238
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,420
Sister,

239
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,140
I have long said

240
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,680
that he is a hypocrite

241
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,700
and absolutely untrustworthy,

242
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,780
yet you chose to believe him over me.

243
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,980
Lin Yu,

244
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,860
I have always considered
you my best friend.

245
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,740
(Lin Yu's Tablet)
Why did you poison my drink?

246
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,300
Why did you want me dead?

247
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,540
Because the person she wants to marry
is not me,

248
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,060
but Liu Fuyi.

249
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,020
So you really are a demon.

250
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,420
You are all deceiving me!

251
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,500
Sister.

252
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,300
Mu Yao,

253
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,340
have you seen this?

254
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,860
Why are you still holding on?

255
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,700
No one in this world truly cares for you,

256
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,780
except me.

257
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,260
Sister, calm down.

258
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,500
The Resentful Woman is using you.

259
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,900
She wants to take your body.

260
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,500
Don't be bewitched by her.

261
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,180
It's you who are using me.

262
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
Sister.

263
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,180
(System Space)
Hello, host.

264
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,740
We apologize for the disorder error
you have just experienced.

265
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,060
You were transported
to the ending segment by mistake.

266
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,700
The error has been corrected.

267
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,020
Please continue with your task

268
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,180
of advancing the storyline
and completing the conquest.

269
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,140
System?

270
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,220
You are the System?

271
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,380
So the System is actually a panda.

272
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,780
Correction:
The System has no specific form.

273
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,980
It is omnipresent.

274
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,780
The panda boundary marker is
a carrier of the System,

275
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,620
not the System itself.

276
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,460
Stop.

277
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,020
That's not what I wanted to ask.

278
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,900
You just mentioned
that an error had occurred.

279
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,020
What I just saw was

280
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,340
the end of the novel "Catching Demons"?

281
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,180
Yes.

282
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,700
Because you deviated
from the main storyline

283
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,340
and advanced to the world boundary,

284
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,780
it caused a disorder error.

285
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,300
World boundary?

286
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,660
The Host and non-player characters

287
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,260
can only move

288
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
with the Demon Catching World.

289
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,860
Once the boundary is touched,

290
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,780
the System will automatically
correct the error

291
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,860
and adjust the route.

292
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,060
At the same time,
it will erase the boundary memory

293
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,140
of all non-player characters
except the Host.

294
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,220
I see.

295
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,860
No wonder Ziqi and Sister Mu Yao
don't remember

296
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,900
passing the panda boundary marker
again and again.

297
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,820
Well,

298
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,980
the plot has already gone off track.

299
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,300
How can we get back to the main storyline?

300
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,940
System!

301
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,380
System!

302
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,380
System!

303
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
System!

304
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,540
System, answer me!

305
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,380
System!

306
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,140
Miaomiao,

307
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,140
what did you say?

308
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,100
Sister Mu.

309
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,340
Sister Mu,

310
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,980
I'm glad you're fine.

311
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm fine. What's wrong?

312
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,820
Sister Mu,

313
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,300
Ziqi,

314
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,700
Brother Liu,

315
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,340
you must believe what I'm going to say.

316
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,180
Sister Mu,

317
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,460
Ziqi definitely didn't mean to deceive you.

318
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,700
You must believe him.

319
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,560
I…

320
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,220
And I,

321
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,660
I am truly your good sister.

322
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,100
I won't hurt you.

323
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,260
And Brother Liu.

324
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,980
He likes you.

325
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,300
It has always been you.

326
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,340
What are you talking about?

327
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,300
Miss Lin, you…

328
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,060
I… I am not talking nonsense.

329
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,580
I see it very clearly.

330
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,940
All of us are

331
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,460
treating each other sincerely.

332
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,620
So no matter what happens in the future,

333
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,460
we must not doubt each other

334
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,540
or fall apart,

335
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,500
okay?

336
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,700
Alright.

337
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,860
What's wrong? What exactly has happened?

338
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,180
Could it be a nightmare during the day?

339
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

340
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,380
Miss Lin must be too tired.

341
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,100
It's getting late.

342
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,260
Let's find a place

343
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
to camp and rest.

344
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,920
This is

345
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,780
the Messenger Golden Crow
from the Astronomical Bureau.

346
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,300
Sister.

347
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,900
(Mu)

348
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,690
I need to make a trip to
the Imperial Capital.

349
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,820
Imperial Capital?

350
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,220
A person with the surname Zhao
at the Astronomical Bureau

351
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,780
summons me with the Mu's Jade Token.

352
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,420
(Imperial Capital?)

353
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,100
(The plot returns to the main storyline.)

354
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,740
(This is what the System means
when it corrects errors)

355
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,220
(and adjusts the route?)

356
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,100
(The so-called area beyond the mountains)

357
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,820
(has no records left,)

358
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,820
(because)

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,860
(that was outside the world in the book.)

360
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,220
(No one can surpass
the boundaries of the world.)

361
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,820
(Now it's fine.)

362
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,740
(The plot is back on track.)

363
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,500
(But)

364
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,700
(does it also mean)

365
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,940
(that everyone has to head towards)

366
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,500
(their respective endings?)

367
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,700
The capital can be reached
by both water and land.

368
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,580
Travelling by carriage along
the official road is

369
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,300
a detour, but relatively safe.

370
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,740
And travelling by boat

371
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,980
can be two to three months
faster than by carriage.

372
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Let's take the carriage.

373
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,470
Didn't you complain
that the carriage was bumpy?

374
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,180
I've been feeling dizzy lately.

375
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,220
It would be worse on a boat.

376
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,100
How troublesome!

377
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,460
Let's go with Miaomiao's suggestion.

378
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,300
We'll go to the capital by land.

379
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,980
Haven't you always wanted to

380
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,300
visit the Imperial Capital?

381
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,220
Now, by a stroke of luck,
we can go together.

382
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,100
I thought you'd be eager to
fly there in a day.

383
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,740
Why did you choose a slower route?

384
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,780
Didn't Brother Liu say
that this route is safer?

385
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,660
It's better to be safer.

386
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,460
(I want to go to the Imperial Capital
a bit slower,)

387
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,180
(and advance the plot a bit slower.)

388
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,540
That way, we can

389
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,500
have more happy time together.

390
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,180
Ziqi,

391
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,100
are you asleep?

392
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,020
Yes.

393
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,060
Then who is talking to me?

394
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,100
What do you want?

395
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,380
I wanted to ask you during the day.

396
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,580
Do you really have no memories

397
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,660
of your parents?

398
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
Do you like it?

399
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,860
Yes.

400
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm not sure if that's my memory

401
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
or if that person is my mother.

402
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,780
I can't even remember

403
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,020
what she looks like.

404
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,100
As for my father,

405
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,780
I have no impression at all.

406
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,780
Aren't you curious?

407
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,580
Curious about what?

408
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,780
If it were me,

409
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,460
I would definitely

410
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,620
want to know what they look like,

411
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,060
where they are,

412
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,740
if they are still alive

413
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,220
and if

414
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,220
they are looking for me.

415
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,580
I'm not curious.

416
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Why not?

417
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,900
They abandoned me first.

418
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,180
Why should I care about them?

419
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,180
Even without them,

420
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,460
I have grown up.

421
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,900
I don't need them.

422
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,020
I still think it's a bit strange.

423
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,420
How could you

424
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,860
have no memories before the age of seven?

425
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,140
A seven-year-old person

426
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,340
should have started to remember things.

427
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,860
What exactly did you experience
before you were seven?

428
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,180
Stop asking all these questions.

429
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,460
Stop bothering me.

430
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
Hurry up and go to sleep.

431
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,020
(If)

432
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,260
(I can uncover the story Fu Zhou)

433
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
(didn't write,)

434
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,580
(learn about the past
Ziqi has forgotten,)

435
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,740
(and figure out why he is a half-demon,)

436
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,340
(can I help him?)

437
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
Yao,

438
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,300
Yao,

439
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,100
I just saw Miss Lin

440
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,580
look so down.

441
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,660
Miaomiao?

442
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,940
Sheng,

443
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,740
did you upset Miaomiao again?

444
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,860
No.

445
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,500
I only teased her twice on the way here,

446
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,980
telling her the falling stone was a mouse.

447
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,900
Is she really that petty?

448
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,660
If it was your fault,

449
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,460
you need to cheer her up.

450
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,060
How do I cheer her up?

451
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,340
Well,

452
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,060
figure it out yourself.

453
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,300
I want it, too.

454
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,420
Give me one.

455
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,330
- Give me.
- No.

456
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,620
I want it, too.

457
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,780
- Fun.
- I'm not giving it.

458
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,260
Miaomiao, what's wrong with you?

459
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,820
Nothing.

460
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,260
I just feel my heart is heavy,

461
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,140
like a stone pressing down.

462
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,500
What? It's serious.

463
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,100
When did you swallow a stone?

464
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,140
Take it out quickly.

465
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,340
This is just a metaphor.

466
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,380
Cuicui,

467
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,220
you should keep something in your heart.

468
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,500
Bamboo is hollow.

469
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,780
I can't grow a heart.

470
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,260
Come with me.

471
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
Why?

472
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,460
What beautiful flowers!

473
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,340
Take it.

474
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,340
Bamboo dragonfly?

475
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,500
Where did it come from?

476
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,500
Did you trade it with candy
from the kids,

477
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,780
just like Miaomiao did before?

478
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,180
Of course not.

479
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,100
Did you make this?

480
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,900
- Did you play with it?
- Of course.

481
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,620
When I was little, I even broke some.

482
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,940
Why did you give it to me
all of a sudden?

483
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,700
My sister noticed
that you were feeling down.

484
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,820
She asked me to come and cheer you up.

485
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,780
It was my sister's idea.

486
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,140
I wouldn't have bothered.

487
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
Miaomiao,

488
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,580
in my opinion,

489
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,060
it's him who wants to make you happy.

490
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,380
It has nothing to do with his sister.

491
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,620
If you keep talking,

492
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,940
I'll turn you into
bamboo shoots and old duck soup.

493
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,180
Enough.

494
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,140
Ziqi, I'm going to play it now.

495
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,740
If I throw it very far,

496
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,060
would you help me retrieve it?

497
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,500
Sure.

498
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,580
Let's test your skills.

499
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,620
Three, two, one.

500
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,980
It's you who can't fly it.

501
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,380
So clumsy.

502
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,100
It's going up!

503
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,700
It flies so high!

The wings of the bamboo dragonfly
should be slanting.

522
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,180
The left and right sides should be inclined

523
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,700
so that it can go with the wind.

524
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,770
But yours,

525
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,380
why is it flat?

526
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,980
Hand it over.

527
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,620
I knew you were cheating.

528
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,940
So what?

529
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,340
Wherever I want it to fly,

530
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,620
it can go there.

531
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,380
But what's the point?

532
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,700
Isn't the bamboo dragonfly supposed to
go against the wind?

533
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,100
It should fly free and unrestrained.

534
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,780
Wherever the wind goes, it follows.

535
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,060
Follow the wind.

536
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,580
Isn't that just leaving it to fate?

537
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,750
I hate the things that can
get out of control the most.

538
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,200
In this world,

539
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,420
there are many things

540
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,980
that we cannot control.

541
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,380
Do your best and leave the rest to fate.

542
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,540
Strive hard
when it's time to fight for something.

543
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,260
As for the outcome,

544
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,540
we can only make a wish to the wind.

545
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,140
Make a wish?

546
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,620
If we make a wish to the wind,

547
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,740
the bamboo dragonfly might fly back to us.

548
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,220
Although many things are
beyond our control,

549
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,100
if we leave a bit to heaven,

550
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,420
it might

551
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,980
bring us a little surprise.

552
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,020
It's time to go back.

553
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,500
Return it to me.

554
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,300
I'll help you revise it.

555
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,500
I'll give it back to you
once it's ready.

556
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,180
How about it?

557
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,380
Yao,

558
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,330
who exactly is summoning you
with this Jade Token?

559
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,150
The Jade Token is inscribed
with the Astronomical Bureau.

560
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,820
The person with the surname Zhao

561
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,900
must be the Emperor's birth mother,

562
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
Dowager Consort

563
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,580
Zhao Qinru.

564
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,300
She is from the royal family

565
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,580
and a person of the imperial palace.

566
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,540
I think there's more to it than that.

567
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,300
Previously, in Taicang County,
this Dowager Consort Zhao

568
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,100
drove the Golden Toad Demon
to devour the vault silver

569
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,180
and even tried to frame her father.

570
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,490
She had the Astronomical Bureau
move mountains and shift seas

571
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,730
in the name of quelling demon troubles,

572
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,820
and committed numerous misdeeds.

573
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,500
Who would believe

574
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,140
that there's nothing behind it?

575
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,740
For a Demon Catching Family,

576
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,980
the Jade Token is
an oath never taken lightly.

577
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,780
Once given,

578
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,020
it is equivalent to
pledging the family's promise to others,

579
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,620
even their lives.

580
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,260
Since it's such an important item,

581
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,820
the major Demon Catching Families
would never give it easily.

582
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,500
Why is the Mu's Jade Token

583
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,540
ended up in the hands of
Dowager Consort Zhao?

584
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,820
Could it be that the Mu's ancestors

585
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,660
had dealings with
Dowager Consort Zhao?

586
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,500
I don't know.

587
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,060
My father never mentioned it.

588
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,460
But as you said,

589
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,380
once the Jade Token appears,
we must fulfill our duty from afar.

590
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,140
Even if
the Mu Family only has Sheng and me,

591
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,660
we must keep our promise.

592
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,340
Yao,

593
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,580
rest assured,

594
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm here with you.

595
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,580
You are upright and honest,

596
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,100
but you dislike
complex social interactions

597
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,380
and scheming against others.

598
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,270
You are even more unwilling to
aid the wicked.

599
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,260
Although this Jade Token is
in the hands of Dowager Consort Zhao,

600
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,940
if her request is absurd

601
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,380
and contradicts your sense of integrity,

602
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,700
don't trouble yourself.

603
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,940
I'll handle it for you.

604
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,020
No need for that.

605
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,700
My sister has me. It is enough.

606
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,180
And me.

607
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,820
Count me in, I'll help too.

608
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,380
Alright, as long as the four of us work
together with one heart and mind,

609
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,300
there's no obstacle we can't overcome.

610
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,460
(Imperial Capital?)

611
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,300
(How exactly was this plot)

612
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,860
(written in the book?)

613
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,020
(It seems there was a third party)

614
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,300
- (who comes to Sister Mu and Brother Liu.)
- Let me do it.

615
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,780
(When Brother Liu left the team,)

616
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,200
(Ziqi stood up for his sister
and confronted him.)

617
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,780
(His demonic power began
to go out of control.)

618
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,060
(Eventually, he became completely evil.)

619
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,420
- (With the falling apart,)
- Okay.

620
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,260
(the plot turned into a tragedy.)

621
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,020
(This started
from the Imperial Capital.)

622
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,540
(But how exactly did all this happen?)

623
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,420
- (Why can't I remember it?)
- Come.

624
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,390
(Why is the impression so vague?)

625
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,900
Brother Liu,

626
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,780
come here.

627
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,540
Brother Liu,

628
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,220
you must be careful in the capital.

629
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,740
You have a love calamity.

630
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,020
Be careful of what?

631
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,180
It's just a calamity involving
beautiful women.

632
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,920
You don't want to be a Demon Catcher,

633
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,900
but a fortune teller?

634
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,020
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

635
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,620
After you go to the capital,

636
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,660
you must be cautious of all beautiful women

637
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,940
except Sister Mu.

638
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,780
Do you understand?

639
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,380
Alright, it's not difficult.

640
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,900
Miaomiao, Fuyi, it's time to set off.

641
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,100
- Okay.
- Miaomiao, hurry up.

642
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,460
You're always the slowest.

643
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,500
(Don't worry.)

644
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,300
(I will definitely protect you all,)

645
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,410
- (and Ziqi,)
- I'll sit here.

646
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,180
(I won't let you turn evil.)

647
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,740
(No matter what happens,)

648
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,020
