00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,260
(Tai'an Gate)

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Your Highness,

5
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,670
have those cultivators

6
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,070
found anything wrong?

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,950
Stand there.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Your Highness,

9
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,280
what demon is hurting the Princess?

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,100
There has been no progress yet.

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,460
In my opinion,

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,740
those seasoned experts
at the Astronomical Bureau

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,670
are unable to find a solution,

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,780
let alone those unorthodox cultivators.

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,500
Your Highness,

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,660
why don't you let me think of a solution?

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,220
Ruoshi,

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,220
in recent days,

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,740
you have been concerned about
Min's matters,

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,780
and I have noticed.

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,260
You've grown up.

22
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,500
You understand how to be considerate.

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,620
Marrying Min to you

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,460
will make me feel better.

25
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,500
It's such a shabby place,

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,980
how can you distinguished guests
live here?

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,020
It's that rich man again.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,520
My master has already arranged
accommodations for you,

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,140
(Tuanyuan Inn)
which is more comfortable than here.

30
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,340
Distinguished guests, please follow me.

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,340
No need, it is comfortable staying here.

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,580
Your master has refused
to meet us several times.

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,700
Even if he has good intentions,
we dare not accept.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,100
(Tuanyuan Inn)

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,280
I come here this time

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,780
to deliver an invitation for my master,

37
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,140
inviting you to meet him

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,500
at Yiyun Tower at 5:00 p.m.

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,340
(Invitation)

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
What secret are you keeping?

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,100
Tonight, my master will personally
host a banquet.

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,460
Distinguished guests,
you will know once you arrive.

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,420
(Tuanyuan Inn)

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,260
See you.

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,100
(Yiyun Tower)

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,460
(Yiyun Tower of the Imperial Capital)

47
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,380
Guests, please come inside.

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,140
Tianxing Pavilion

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
is the largest

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,780
and most luxurious private room here.

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,100
It has been reserved all year round
by this distinguished guest,

52
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,100
and even the name Tianxing Pavilion

53
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,180
was chosen by him personally.

54
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,700
So that's the meaning of
the owner of Tianxing Pavilion.

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,700
He seems very wealthy.

56
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,060
So what if he's wealthy?

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,940
He's creating an air of mystery.

58
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,140
It's quite annoying.

59
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,860
- Why is it annoying?
- Please.

60
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,380
- He invited us to dinner,
- Please.

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,540
and helped us out.

62
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,460
He's generous.

63
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,940
And look at this
elegant and tasteful decoration,

64
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,340
he must be an extraordinary person.

65
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,740
Please come in.

66
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,260
This is what you call

67
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,140
the most luxurious private room?

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,380
(Priceless Artworks. Rare Treasure.)

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,580
(Knowledge. Abundance of Wealth.)

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,290
(Joy. Rich Resources. Appreciation.
Classic Artworks. Grace.)

71
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,540
(Tianxing Pavilion)

72
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,220
(Classic Artworks)

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,780
Didn't I mention this before?

74
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,620
This private room

75
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,780
has been reserved by
that distinguished guest for years.

76
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,310
The decoration and furnishings

77
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,900
are also arranged
according to his preferences.

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,740
It has nothing to do with us.

79
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,140
He's truly an extraordinary person.

80
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,740
His taste is

81
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,960
really impressive.

82
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,660
Has this person put
all the most vulgar and expensive items

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,020
from the Imperial Capital

84
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,180
in this room?

85
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,180
Not at all.

86
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,700
Compared to that
distinguished guest's mansion,

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,660
this is just a drop in the bucket.

88
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,940
Please wait a moment, everyone.

89
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,740
(Who on earth is this peculiar person?)

90
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,900
(Is there such a character in the book?)

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,140
My Lord, in my opinion,

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,500
these people are young,

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,860
but they are not ordinary individuals.

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,500
It's best to stop at the right point.

95
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,740
Too much talking leads to mistakes.

96
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,100
Got it.

97
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,620
Moreover, my Lord,

98
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,500
you must maintain
your composure and your posture.

99
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,940
Keep your balance.

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,420
I said I heard you.

101
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,860
If you nag again,
I'll dock your monthly pay.

102
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,540
It's 5:00 p.m. now,
but the person hasn't come.

103
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,780
Let's go.

104
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Yes.

105
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,380
We are so busy and have official duties.

106
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,020
Let's not meet such a strange person.

107
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,140
- My Lord,
- Are you alright?

108
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,140
(Zhao Ruoshi, Marquis)

109
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
It's you.

110
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,080
(Lu Jiu, Marquis Mansion Guard)
It's a coincidence to meet you here.

111
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,380
May I ask your name?

112
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,840
My Lord, your distinguished guests
are all watching.

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,700
Stand up and speak.

114
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,540
Hello, distinguished guests.

115
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,660
This is my master.

116
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,100
Sorry.

117
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,740
I had something to deal with just now.

118
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,940
So I arrived a bit late.

119
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,460
Sorry for making you all waiting.

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,420
It was the Lord of Qingyi Marquis Mansion
who invited us here.

121
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,870
My apologies for the oversight.

122
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,340
I didn't mention it.

123
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,420
May I ask,

124
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,580
how did you know my identity?

125
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,500
In the Imperial Capital,
the one who knows news quickly,

126
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,660
spends money generously,

127
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,380
and allows subordinates
to easily enter and leave the palace

128
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,620
to send us the invitation

129
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,780
can only be

130
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,380
the Marquis

131
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,020
and supervisor of the Astronomical Bureau.

132
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,780
Moreover, your identity is

133
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,780
not a secret.

134
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,260
On this folding fan of yours,

135
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,020
isn't your identity subtly hidden?

136
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,380
(The heart is as empty as
the yard by moonlight.)

137
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,820
No wonder Her Highness invited you

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,300
from a great distance to help.

139
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,660
You're right.

140
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,700
I am Zhao Ruoshi.

141
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,020
Come on, let's eat.

142
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,220
Make yourself at home.

143
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,820
(Marquis Zhao Ruoshi)

144
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,700
(seems like a non-player character.)

145
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,030
(He hardly appeared throughout
the chapter about the Imperial Capital,)

146
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,100
(and I remember the book said,)

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,100
(the Marquis inherited)

148
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,860
(his father's elegance and charm.)

149
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,140
(He should be a graceful gentleman,)

150
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,180
(but the one in front of me…)

151
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,740
Goodness,

152
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,940
are the characters on the fan
written by himself?

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,060
Young lady, do you also like calligraphy?

154
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,580
As you can see, this is my masterpiece.

155
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,620
A masterpiece?

156
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,060
It seems that today
I have met a kindred spirit.

157
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,900
How about this?

158
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
I will give this folding fan
to you for amusement.

159
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,140
Jiu, send it to her.

160
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,260
No need.

161
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,420
- No.
- Young lady,

162
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,820
do not refuse.

163
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,140
There's no need.

164
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,540
What's the matter?

165
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,220
Won't you thank your kindred spirit?

166
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,740
Young lady,

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,780
have we met before?

168
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,660
I always feel that

169
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,940
you are familiar.

170
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,620
(Help!)

171
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,640
(What kind of outdated pickup line
is this?)

172
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,940
(In Fu Zhou's novel,)

173
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,860
(how could there be such a fool?)

174
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,740
Why are you laughing so happily?

175
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,420
He appreciates you.

176
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,020
He does have good taste.

177
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,660
Your Excellency, are you inviting us here

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,820
to discuss your fiancée,

179
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,340
Princess Duanyang's condition?

180
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,180
Yes.

181
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,580
I suppose you

182
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,940
have already visited her chamber.

183
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,940
How is she

184
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
doing?

185
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,100
As the supervisor
of the Astronomical Bureau,

186
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,580
you are aware of her condition.

187
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,860
What do you think about it?

188
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,460
What can I think?

189
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Even Her Highness has said,

190
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,740
there must be a demon causing trouble.

191
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,660
There must be a demon.

192
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,500
Otherwise,

193
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,460
could someone have poisoned her?

194
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,500
You mean

195
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,020
it's possible someone else poisoned her?

196
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,940
I didn't say that.

197
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,100
Think what kind of place
the Princess's chamber is.

198
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,400
The guards at the door

199
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,830
and the female officials
taking care of her

200
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,700
could be dozens of people,

201
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,620
three shifts a day without fail.

202
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,420
If anyone tries to put the poison
by her pillow,

203
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,420
how difficult would that be?

204
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
By the pillow?

205
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,940
What pillow?

206
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,540
No, what I mean is

207
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,340
the Princess, you see,

208
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,180
is naturally cautious,

209
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,020
so it's absolutely impossible
to try to do anything

210
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
to the incense by her pillow.

211
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,460
So it must be a demon causing trouble.

212
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,100
It must be, right?

213
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,100
Jiu,

214
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,740
if your throat hurts,
take medicine immediately.

215
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,740
Please excuse me, everyone.

216
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,100
Let's hurry and eat.

217
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,260
Come on, it's getting cold.

218
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,420
Try it.

219
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,220
Why are you all being so polite?

220
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,060
Come on, let's have a toast together.

221
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
I'll drink first.

222
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,740
Thank you for your hard work today.

223
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,500
If you need my help in the future,

224
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,620
feel free to tell me.

225
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,860
The Astronomical Bureau
will provide strong support for you.

226
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,100
Of course,

227
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,920
if you can't catch
the mischievous little demon,

228
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,940
so be it.

229
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,780
As for Her Highness,
I will go and persuade her.

230
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,180
I assure you,

231
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,300
I will tell Her Highness

232
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,060
that you have fulfilled your duties

233
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,260
and done your utmost.

234
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,100
Rest assured.

235
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,220
Thank you, Marquis.

236
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,580
What if we catch the mischievous demon?

237
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,580
Impossible.

238
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,100
Let me tell you, this…

239
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,460
My Lord, distinguished guests,

240
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,020
it's getting late, we should leave now.

241
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,140
- It's alright.
- My Lord, we have…

242
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,170
- No, young lady...
- many things to do.

243
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,410
We have important matters to deal with.

244
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,340
Young lady,

245
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,750
come to my mansion when you have time.

246
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,370
There are many paintings
and calligraphy at home,

247
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,100
I can give them to you.

248
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,980
Did you hear that? You...

249
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,980
Young lady, remember to visit my mansion.

250
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,580
No, what are you trying to do?

251
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,820
Stop talking, my Lord.

252
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,260
You're pulling me, speak!

253
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,420
Let's go, come with me.

254
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,260
No.

255
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,620
You…

256
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,220
Why do you keep pulling me?

257
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,300
Keep your voice down, my Lord.

258
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,300
My Lord,

259
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,660
since my grandfather, we three generations

260
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,620
have served the Zhao Family.

261
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,300
Naturally, we are loyal to you.

262
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,860
- As the saying goes…
- Get to the point.

263
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,060
You said too much just now.

264
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,700
What did I say too much about?

265
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,420
You talked too much, my Lord.

266
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,100
Today we are just here
to gather information.

267
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,140
We should speak less and listen more.

268
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
We should see if these Demon Catchers

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,130
invited by the Dowager Consort

270
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,700
find any evidence.

271
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,180
Didn't you assure me?

272
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,170
You said the evidence of
drugging the incense burner

273
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,220
had been disposed of cleanly.

274
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,060
I…

275
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,460
Why are you so disrespectful now?

276
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,660
How dare you lay a hand on me?

277
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,380
My Lord, please lower your voice.

278
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,020
Are you afraid others won't know

279
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,580
that the strange behaviors
of the Princess

280
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,940
were caused by the two of us?

281
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,380
What do you mean by the two of us?

282
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,260
It was you, wasn't it?

283
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,660
Without your instruction,

284
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,660
would I dare?

285
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,540
Do you still have the nerve
to tell me this?

286
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,060
What did I originally tell you?

287
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,780
I said I just didn't want

288
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,180
to marry that arrogant Princess.

289
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,340
I asked you to find a way
to deal with her.

290
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,740
As long as the wedding day passed,

291
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,540
the Dowager Consort wouldn't
force her to marry me.

292
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,500
And then?

293
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,900
You used such aggressive methods

294
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,180
and drove her to madness.

295
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,380
Now that something has happened,

296
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,200
you come to blame me, right?

297
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,180
I don't know why

298
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,780
the Princess's condition is so severe.

299
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,000
What I used was

300
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,180
the mildest dreaming incense.

301
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't care.

302
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,300
Anyway, if this matter gets blown up,

303
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
I'll go and tell Her Highness

304
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,250
that it was you who instigated me.

305
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,790
Whatever the punishment,
it will be on your head.

306
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,420
You…

307
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,380
My Lord,

308
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,420
things have come to this point,

309
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,550
there's no use saying anything else.

310
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,580
In my opinion,

311
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,980
those Demon Catchers
have already noticed something.

312
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,300
From now on,

313
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,020
my Lord, you must be even more cautious.

314
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,700
Anyway, they can't find any evidence,

315
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,860
so they can't do anything to us.

316
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
I am the Fiancé of the Princess.

317
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,660
She has no reason to suspect me.

318
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm telling you,
there's no need to be paranoid.

319
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,740
I think it's fine.

320
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,660
You are so carefree.

321
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,660
Show your respect.

322
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,620
It's him.

323
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,820
An inside job.

324
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,290
No wonder the Astronomical Bureau
couldn't find out.

325
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,020
Princess Duanyang is
the only sister of the current Emperor.

326
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,460
Her status is beyond words.

327
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,500
The Marquis
is to marry her next month.

328
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,020
Why would he hurt her now?

329
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,180
Brother Liu,

330
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,380
this is something you might not know.

331
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,180
The closer the acquaintance,
the stronger the motive.

332
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,460
(If the victim is female,)

333
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,060
(the first suspect should be her husband,)

334
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,940
(boyfriend or ex-boyfriend.)

335
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,300
(This is common sense.)

336
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,300
I mean, I'm not sure of the reason,

337
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,740
but based on my experience and judgment,

338
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,820
I think

339
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,060
the Marquis must be the one

340
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,420
who hurt the Princess.

341
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,980
That's right.

342
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,620
He must have done something

343
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,460
in the Princess's chamber.

344
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,700
He must have placed a mystical drug

345
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,300
that causes one to lose one's mind

346
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,380
in the incense by the pillow.

347
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,900
I didn't find any clues just now.

348
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,900
It seems the traces
have already been cleaned up.

349
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,400
There are no traces inside the chamber.

350
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,500
There might be some
in the Astronomical Bureau.

351
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,780
Regardless of what drug
was used to hurt the Princess,

352
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,580
there must be a source.

353
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
What about

354
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,420
we make a trip to
the Astronomical Bureau tonight?

355
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,380
If we find the drug
in the Princess's chamber,

356
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,500
the unsolved case can be closed.

357
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
I'll go too.

358
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
Miaomiao,

359
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,410
we need to sneak into the Astronomical Bureau
without the guards noticing.

360
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,300
If you go, it will be too dangerous.

361
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,500
You'd better stay and wait for our news.

362
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,020
Yes.

363
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,020
You're so clumsy.

364
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
You'll cause trouble.

365
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,500
Sister, I'll go with you.

366
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,660
You don't go either.

367
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,620
You accompany Miaomiao back to rest.

368
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,400
Sister.

369
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,980
I'm worried about Miaomiao alone.

370
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,940
You stay with her.

371
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,520
Fuyi and I

372
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,620
will go to the Astronomical Bureau.

373
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,620
Is this demon blood incense
really as good as you say?

374
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,780
(Treasure Boutique)
Yes. Even the Marquis, who never uses incense,

375
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,980
always places orders.

376
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,660
- The Marquis is using it too?
- Yes.

377
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,700
Show us then.

378
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,680
Take a look.

379
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,300
Whatever the Marquis uses must be good.

380
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,380
Smell it.

381
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,420
It smells so good.

382
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,700
Give me a set.

383
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,700
- Okay.
- Give me a set too.

384
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,260
Okay, please come in.

385
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,100
Okay.

386
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,820
(Treasure Boutique)

387
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,660
The weather is dry, be careful with fire.

388
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,490
The weather is dry, be careful with fire.

389
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,500
(Treasure Boutique)
The weather is dry, be careful of fire.

390
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,660
The weather is dry, be careful of fire.

391
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,040
Cuicui, Ziqi and I will go inside.

392
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
You stay at the door and
keep watch for us, understood?

393
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,340
What should I watch?

394
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,940
Keeping watch means guarding the door.

395
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,940
Make sure no bad people come in.

396
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,460
(Treasure Boutique)
You humans speak in such a roundabout way.

397
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,980
A word has several meanings.

398
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,980
It's too troublesome.

399
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,540
You must remember this.

400
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,860
Make sure no one comes in.

401
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,100
Let's go.

402
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,220
Got it.

403
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,900
(Astronomical Bureau

405
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,140
(Astronomical Bureau)

406
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,910
The fellow practitioners
at the Astronomical Bureau

407
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,780
receive a stable salary
and live in comfort all day long,

408
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,740
yet become increasingly incompetent.

409
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,740
Yes.

410
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,340
(Astronomical Bureau)

411
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,220
Wait.

412
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,020
Places filled with valuable items
like this

413
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,380
are sure to have defenses in place.

414
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,300
Look. I told you so.

415
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,180
It's too bright.

416
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,300
You're so conspicuous,
what if we get discovered?

417
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,420
This light can only be seen
by the two of us.

418
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,020
For others,
it still appears completely dark.

419
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,100
Fuyi,

420
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,740
this is the Crescent.

421
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,060
The ancient artifact left
by the Mu ancestors.

422
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,020
But why would it…

423
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,260
I see now.

424
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
My grandfather once said,

425
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,780
the Crescent has always been dormant.

426
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,900
If it encounters a new master,
it will awaken.

427
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,260
You might be that person.

428
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,060
But…

429
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,380
Try it now.

430
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,580
If you can pull it out,

431
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,460
you will be
the next Heavenly Demon Catcher.

432
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,340
You can help me take revenge
and kill the Resentful Woman.

433
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,380
Where are you going?

434
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Let's split up and search.

435
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,260
Stay close, don't leave my sight.

436
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,220
Didn't you dislike me?

437
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,740
Got it.

438
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,700
These are the goods Lu Jiu bought.

439
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
(Ethereal Dew, one box)

440
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,940
Strange.

441
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,820
Why did he buy ingredients instead of

442
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,020
finished incense?

443
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,700
I think he wants to conceal

444
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,460
the real incense he desires.

445
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,980
What he wants

446
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,060
must be hidden among these.

447
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,980
The strangest thing in these ingredients

448
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,820
is the deer antler
of the Nine-color Deer Demon

449
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,300
and

450
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,220
(Lu Jiu)
the East Sea Whale Blood.

451
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,020
Let's hurry and find it.

452
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,900
How can we carry so much back?

453
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,940
Why not take them all?

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,240
Bring them to Brother Liu to have a look.

455
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,620
Why bring them to him?

456
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,900
Because Brother Liu has
travelled extensively,

457
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,300
he is knowledgeable and experienced.

458
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,660
He should know more, right?

459
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,460
Why? Are you upset again?

460
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,780
No.

461
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Be careful.

462
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,420
You bumped into me.

463
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,380
I...

464
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,980
I'll go over there and handle it.

465
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,220
Come back.

466
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,100
What are you doing?

467
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,080
If you have something to say, just say it.

468
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,740
Miaomiao,

469
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
I'm sorry.

470
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,860
I was wrong before.

471
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,020
The dismissive words I said to you

472
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,060
were actually insincere.

473
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,820
I think you are the most beautiful

474
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,220
and smartest girl in the world.

475
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,660
You…

476
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,140
Why did you suddenly say that?

477
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,220
Since you've already apologized,

478
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,060
I forgive you.

479
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,860
It's really quite cheesy.

480
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Miaomiao,

481
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,540
actually, I…

482
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,380
have liked you for a long time.

483
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,260
What are you doing? You are so slow.

484
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,770
Why are you standing there in a daze?

485
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,920
Hurry up and finish tidying up.

486
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,980
Release.

487
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,540
Hurry up and get out.

488
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,460
Ziqi, wait a moment.

489
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,780
What are you doing?

490
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,180
You've been affected
by the demon incense again?

491
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,940
I haven't.

492
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,140
Ziqi,

493
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,860
actually, I wanted to tell you

494
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,860
that it was my fault before.

495
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,020
It was my bad attitude.

496
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,260
In my heart,

497
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,260
you are much more outstanding
than Brother Liu.

498
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,380
I don't deserve such praise.

499
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,660
I'm not as mature and steady as him,

500
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,820
nor am I as knowledgeable as him.

501
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,660
Please don't say that.

502
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,500
What I said before was just out of anger.

503
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,140
I said it to annoy you on purpose.

504
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,500
Ziqi,

505
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,940
do you know what I saw

506
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,900
in the demon incense illusion?

507
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,940
What?

508
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,220
Actually,

509
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,620
I…

510
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,540
I've liked you for a long time.

511
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,900
Miaomiao!

512
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,060
Are you two done?

513
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,700
What are you doing?

514
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,460
What are you doing?

515
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,380
Supreme Whale Demon Blood Incense.

516
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,020
It can purify people's souls

517
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,420
and see their true feelings.

518
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,180
Its function is to let people see

519
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,220
the things they most desire
in their hearts.

520
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,700
What did you two just see?

521
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,300
Nothing at all.

522
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,340
I didn't see anything.

523
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,580
Hurry up and tidy up.

524
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,260
If you ask again,
I'll sell you to this shady shop.

525
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,660
You…

526
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,340
You… Don't look at me.

528
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,060
what are you looking at?

529
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,220
Why are you so slow?

530
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,300
Hurry, let's go.

531
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,580

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,540
what are you tossing about?

558
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,780
What exactly did you see?

559
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,940
Go to sleep, don't disturb me.

560
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,440
Why don't you tell me?

561
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,520
I can't sleep if you don't tell me.

562
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,900
Ziqi, I can't fall asleep.

563
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,620
You…

564
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,620
Even if you can't fall asleep,

565
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,740
you can't come to me!

566
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,620
Go back.

567
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
Ziqi,

568
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,820
actually, I know

569
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,260
what you saw at Treasure Boutique.

570
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,140
You…

571
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,380
Nonsense.

572
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,580
Why don't you dare to turn around
and look at me?

573
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,940
Miaomiao, don't push me.

574
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,260
There's no space, Miaomiao.

575
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,180
You… Don't push me.

576
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,140
Don't. Don't push me.

577
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,460
Miaomiao!

578
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,540
Why, why are you here?

579
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,460
I'm so tired.

580
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,220
I can't take it anymore.

581
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,060
I can't sleep at Miaomiao's place.

582
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,780
Can I sleep here with you tonight?

583
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,380
(It's a dream.)

584
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,620
(It's all illusions)

585
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,940
(because of
the Whale Demon Blood Incense.)

586
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,500
What did you say about Miaomiao?

587
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,940
I wanted to ask you what happened to her.

588
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,020
Oh my goodness.

589
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,100
She was tossing and turning

590
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,700
all night.

591
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,220
She kicked the bed frame,

592
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,420
suddenly let out a strange laugh

593
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,540
and covered her face with the quilt.

594
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,740
Anyway, her behavior was very bizarre.

595
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,900
What exactly did you do to her tonight?

596
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,820
Don't ask so many questions.

597
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,300
Go to sleep.

598
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,420
Alright, I won't ask.

599
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,740
Later she finally fell asleep.

600
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,300
But she talked in her sleep.

601
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,500
By the way,
she called your name in her dream,

602
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,940
Ziqi, Ziqi.

603
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,620
She…

604
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,140
called me in her dream?

605
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Yes.

606
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,460
She mumbled

607
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,060
and called you so many times.

608
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,660
It's too noisy.

609
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,260
I'm still growing.

610
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,860
If I can't sleep well,

611
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,380
how can I grow into a bamboo forest?

612
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,180
It will affect the reputation of
the Four Bamboo Masters.

613
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,740
I'll sleep here with you.

614
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,660
Oh my,

615
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,220
how is it

616
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,500
I couldn't get a good sleep anywhere?

617
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,940
You're so sleepy.

618
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,980
Didn't you sleep well last night?

619
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,180
No, I didn't.

620
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,980
It was you who didn't sleep well.

621
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,140
Look, you have dark circles
under your eyes.

622
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,620
You've been yawning too.

623
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,140
What did you dream about last night?

624
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,860
Nothing.

625
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,540
I didn't dream of anything.

626
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,220
You didn't dream of anything?

627
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,980
We've made it clear.

628
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
What this bottle contains is

629
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,340
the Supreme Whale Demon Blood Incense.

630
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,860
The whale demon blood is extremely rare.

631
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,420
It can cause illusions,

632
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,020
and the type of illusions it induces

633
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,300
can be controlled by magic skills.

634
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,380
This small bottle is

635
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,220
the best of the best.

636
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,620
I know.

637
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,860
It is both expensive and mysterious.

638
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,140
The wealthy and powerful nobles

639
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,180
all treat it as powder taken cold.

640
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,900
It should be.

641
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,100
However, compared to powder taken cold,

642
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
it is non-toxic and harmless.

643
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,140
Within an hour,

644
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,380
the illusion effects will
completely dissipate,

645
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,780
but the physical fatigue

646
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,140
will last for one to two more days.

647
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,180
Don't worry.

648
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,860
Dissipate in an hour?

649
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,700
Why didn't I… last night?

650
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,580
What happened to you last night?

651
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,100
Nothing.

652
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,100
I slept very well last night.

653
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,380
I slept soundly until dawn.

654
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,500
But when Sheng and Yao
investigated in the palace,

655
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,700
the incense had no issues.

656
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,620
Why does Princess Duanyang

657
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,980
still suffer from nightmares frequently?

658
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,820
I see.

659
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,500
Since there are no issues found…

660
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,860
There is only one possibility.

661
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,300
Esteemed experts,

662
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,750
the chief of the Astronomical Bureau's
Tianxuan Pavilion wants to meet you.

663
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,340
The chief of the Astronomical Bureau is

664
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,500
a leading figure
among the Imperial Demon Catchers.

665
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,260
I remember Brother Liu mentioned

666
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,820
that Tianxuan Pavilion is the most esteemed
of the twelve pavilions.

667
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,060
So the chief of the Tianxuan Pavilion

668
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,460
must hold a significant position.

669
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,660
This chief is the top expert
of the Astronomical Bureau.

670
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,780
Not long ago,

671
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,180
he subdued a great demon by himself.

672
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,580
So he was exceptionally promoted
to chief by the supervisor.

673
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,850
The Astronomical Bureau
has such a remarkable figure.

674
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,420
Please.

675
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,860
He looks so familiar.

676
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,650
Your Excellency,
what do you want to meet us for?

677
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,170
Old friends,

678
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,940
I hope you have been well.

679
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,340
Guo Xiu?

680
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,100
How are you? Surprised?

681
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,300
Since we parted in Zhijing Town,

682
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,500
have you all missed me?

683
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,500
You subdued a great demon by yourself.

684
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,180
Back when we were in Zhijing Town,

685
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,180
how did we not realize
you were such a capable person?

686
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,640
My apologies for the oversight.

687
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,780
Please excuse me.

688
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,440
Speaking of this,

689
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,660
when reporting the matter of Zhijing Town
to the court,

690
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,820
I have to explain it, right?

691
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,780
The Dowager Consort Zhao is

692
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,260
most concerned about
those escaped demons.

693
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,700
If they found out

694
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,940
that it was you who subdued the demons,

695
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,980
they would get to the bottom of it.

696
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,940
But I knew

697
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,820
you were all indifferent
to fame and fortune,

698
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,340
and would be most annoyed
by such mundane matters.

699
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,500
Therefore, I decided to step forward

700
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,780
and take on this bothersome
reputation for you.

701
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,700
So should we thank you then?

702
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,860
No need for thanks.

703
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,620
Go ahead,

704
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,660
what is the matter?

705
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,540
If it's nothing, can't old friends

706
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,820
meet and talk about the old days?

707
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,380
Chief, let's not beat around the bush.

708
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,060
The matter of the Princess's nightmares,

709
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,260
logically speaking,

710
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,740
should be investigated
by the Astronomical Bureau.

711
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,020
But the Dowager Consort chose
to bypass them

712
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,140
and used the Jade Token
to invite Sister Mu.

713
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,100
You came to us

714
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,300
probably for this matter, right?

715
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,060
It can't be hidden.

716
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,500
I heard this news,

717
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,340
so I came specifically to help you.

718
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,610
What kind of help?

719
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,460
I have an important clue

720
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,340
to share with you.

721
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,340
The Princess's nightmare is

722
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,820
just an act.

723
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,020
Why aren't you surprised?

724
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,540
We already guessed it.

725
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,140
You knew it long ago too?

726
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,220
Not only me,

727
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,740
everyone at the Astronomical Bureau
knew it.

728
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,180
Your Highness, it's time for your meal.

729
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,500
I've asked everyone to leave.

730
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,180
Sister Peiyun,

731
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,660
you finally come.

732
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,860
I am almost starving.

733
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,380
There are many people in the palace,

734
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,860
especially from
the Dowager Consort's side.

735
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,900
They're not easy to fool.

736
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,340
Pretending to be mad every day

737
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,300
is really difficult.

738
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,940
Even having a meal has to be done secretly.

739
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,350
If this continues,

740
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,370
before the wedding day,

741
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,460
