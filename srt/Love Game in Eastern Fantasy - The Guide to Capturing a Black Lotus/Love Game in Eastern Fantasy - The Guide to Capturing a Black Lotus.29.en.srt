3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,850
I am truly honored.

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,450
Since we've met,

5
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,450
it must be your fate to end here.

6
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,210
Stop, Shiniang!

7
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,950
Shiniang.

8
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,550
Zhun,

9
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,100
what are you doing here?

10
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,170
I sent that Message Charm

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,980
for Cultivator Mu

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,810
to the Astronomical Bureau.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,580
You've known everything.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,170
Ten years ago,

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,250
when you first saved me and Chuchu,

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,140
I knew you were a demon.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,170
After we came to the Jingyang Slope

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,890
and found the Cold Silkworm,

19
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,250
I thought everything would be fine.

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,000
We'd be together forever

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
as a family.

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,660
But unexpectedly...

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,150
Unexpectedly,

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,020
I'm a killer,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,050
a liar,

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,220
and one of the evilest demons.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,780
When your daughter died,

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,150
I had the Phantom Demon create an illusion

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,250
to fool you.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,020
What you saw

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,300
wasn't Chuchu.

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,500
Can you revive Chuchu so that she can

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,940
still be with her father?

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,140
Why?

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,270
If parents

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,190
lose their children,

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,290
they'll be devastated.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,460
I don't want him to suffer

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,940
"Parents"?

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,290
What's that?

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,620
Parents

42
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,220
give birth to new lives.

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,460
In this world, they love

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,180
their children the most

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,220
unconditionally.

46
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,500
I see.

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,620
I want parents, too.

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,710
How about this?

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,970
I'll be Chuchu.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,660
It's easy to fool

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,530
a human like him.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll create an illusion,

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,660
making him think I'm her.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,850
Then I'll have parents, too.

55
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,150
Zhun,

56
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,970
the truth

57
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,250
has finally come out after ten years.

58
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,530
You'll still have to suffer great pain.

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,500
Whether you're a human or a demon,

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,130
you are my wife.

61
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,290
Whatever you've done, good or bad,

62
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,380
that's all for me.

63
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,550
Shiniang,

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,970
please listen to me

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
and stop.

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Too late.

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,590
Zhun,

68
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,570
it's too late.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
No,

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
it's not.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Cultivators,

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,190
I'm the cause of everything.

73
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,100
I should take full responsibility.

74
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,430
My wife is kind by nature.

75
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,410
Hadn't it been for me,

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,730
she wouldn't have done evil.

77
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,870
Zhun,

78
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,100
say no more.

79
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,570
What's done is done.

80
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,850
There's no coming back.

81
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,590
Get up.

82
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,270
Shiniang,

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,900
if you feel guilty,

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,940
no matter who you are,

85
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,290
it's not too late to redeem yourself.

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
You went astray

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,810
to save your love.

88
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,810
Now, he's right here

89
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,490
with you.

90
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,780
He's willing to die

91
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,340
to protect you.

92
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,460
He can save you.

93
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,030
Fuyi.

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,590
Brother,

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,930
when I come out, I'll be starving.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,830
Can you gouge her heart out

97
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,580
for me to eat?

98
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,590
Sure.

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Good worm.

100
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,900
You've had enough blood to produce silk.

101
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,600
Wrap me up

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,580
just like before.

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,730
I'm so sad...

104
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,170
So sad...

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,050
What's happening to me?

106
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,410
I'm so sad...

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,610
So sad...

108
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,530
What's going on?

109
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,050
I'm so sad...

110
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,590
Brother,

111
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,140
why... why am I feeling so sad?

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,100
You know Pure Fox own

113
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,370
medical skills.

114
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,100
What you don't know is

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,850
we're best at poison.

116
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,230
What?

117
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,020
Let her be cocooned?

118
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110
You...

119
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,260
She's the weakest before cocooning,

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,530
and she won't guard
against the Cold Silkworm.

121
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,530
It's best to use that worm to kill her.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,410
Shiniang made this poison for you.

123
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,410
Your fourth metamorphosis

124
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,370
won't be complete.

125
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,430
Don't you want your love

126
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,610
to live on?

127
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,710
I do,

128
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,240
but I can't let the innocent die

129
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,140
or act against my nature.

130
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,260
Zhun and I won't do that to save ourselves.

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,460
Fine. I will

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,410
kill all of you!

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
Fall!

134
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,840
Stop looking. Do something!

135
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,180
I can't hold it anymore!

136
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,960
Your Immobilization isn't working!

137
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,910
I know!

138
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,130
Fuyi is way too powerful!

139
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,220
You're the light

140
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,180
of my life.

141
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,820
I do.

142
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,750
I'll marry you.

143
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,230
Yao...

144
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,770
Brother,

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,540
why?

146
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,460
If you listen to me,

147
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,490
we'll be together forever.

148
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,610
Isn't that great?

149
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,580
Isn't that what you've ever wanted?

150
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,970
I wanted it so badly

151
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,250
that I blindly believed all this.

152
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,040
Yao,

153
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,300
It's time to wake up.

155
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,340
No, Brother!

156
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,540
If you cut it, you'll die!

157
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,940
And so will they!

158
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,610

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,150
Aren't you a Demon Catcher?

196
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,650
I... You...

197
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,130
What a savior.

198
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,990
Zhun.

199
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,280
Shiniang,

200
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,440
it's fine.

201
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,420
Don't worry. It's all over now.

202
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,750
Liuniang,

203
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,560
we need to go.

204
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,300
You haven't fully recovered yet.

205
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,910
Why not stay a bit longer?

206
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,970
We can't, Liuniang.

207
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,460
We have more important things to do.

208
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,110
Fine.

209
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,180
I just learned something

210
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,940
that you should know.

211
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,100
This pearl still stores

212
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,460
part of Rong'er's memory.

213
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,130
I was too obsessed with revenge

214
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,370
to make anything out of it.

215
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,250
Hadn't I known the result,

216
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,060
things would've been different.

217
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,300
You should read it.

218
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,650
Take care, you two.

219
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,680
I have

220
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,170
the fluorite you gave me.

221
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,340
It'll shield Demon Catchers' spells.

222
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,340
They can't take me away.

223
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,410
You should go with them.

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,260
You were born noble.

225
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,300
You have close ties with humans.

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,100
If you stay here for too long,

227
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,610
disasters will befall the Qilin Mountain.

228
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,320
Qinghuan,

229
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,450
the world is unfair to us.

230
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,390
You and I

231
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,370
will have to part here.

232
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,780
But you're my wife.

233
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,500
What about our son, Ziqi?

234
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,370
What about our promise
to be together forever?

235
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,610
I can't leave.

236
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,060
I don't want you to leave either.

237
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,560
But

238
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,930
I've had our fortune told.

239
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,690
I've seen

240
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,610
all the results.

241
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,780
If we stayed together,

242
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,850
we'd have no chance

243
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,450
to survive.

244
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,020
No chance at all?

245
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,950
Love is

246
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,930
to be owned

247
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,780
or let go.

248
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,650
If one day,

249
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,580
things change

250
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,300
that humans and demons

251
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,210
can coexist

252
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,580
in broad daylight,

253
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,170
the three of us

254
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,210
will reunite.

255
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,850
My parents...

256
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,580
loved each other so much.

257
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,260
And

258
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,850
they loved you dearly.

259
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,800
What's happening?

260
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,000
I think

261
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,850
Crescent is mine now.

262
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,260
After all that's happened,

263
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,780
you've finally regained your memory.

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,610
Still, one thing is

265
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,020
bothering me.

266
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,750
Liuniang said the Worry-Free Curse
would be lifted

267
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,540
when the one who loved us the most
from our memories showed up.

268
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,540
But...

269
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,060
But my mother left a long time ago.

270
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,520
Ziqi,

271
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,170
I remember

272
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,680
your memory has started coming back

273
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,100
since a long time ago.

274
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,850
It happened first

275
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,370
in Taicang County

276
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,210
where I recalled spending time with her.

277
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,800
Never mind.

278
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,170
Let it go.

279
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,240
Dealing with the catastrophe of heaven

280
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,450
is the top priority now.

281
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,610
I can save him.

282
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,060
A dead heart can't be revived,

283
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,340
but the Cold Silkworm's silk

284
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,020
can heal everything in the world.

285
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,850
With my demon core in his heart

286
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,500
and the Cold Silkworm's silk

287
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,170
to heal his injuries,

288
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,690
he'll come back to life.

289
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,060
But what about you?

290
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,890
Only death can atone

291
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,450
for my sins.

292
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
I've lost

293
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,440
all my cultivation

294
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,340
and turned back.

295
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,780
That's too lenient with me.

296
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,020
I'd rather

297
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,610
save one more person

298
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,740
with my power in the end.

299
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,500
After all, I'm Lady Divine Doctor.

300
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,390
Little fox,

301
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,540
gaining a Tier 6 demon core isn't easy.

302
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,930
I, Lu Huai'an,

303
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,610
thank you

304
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,650
for saving my disciple.

305
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,170
I committed crimes

306
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,170
regardless of the reason.

307
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,690
I should be punished.

308
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,300
Thank you for giving me

309
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,890
a chance to redeem myself.

310
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,370
Are you still thinking about your wife?

311
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,130
Take a look at this.

312
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,340
The Divine Classic.

313
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,540
It's unique to the Lu Family.

314
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,980
Your asthma can't be cured,

315
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,930
but there are ways

316
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,480
to strengthen your body

317
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,650
and nourish your lungs.

318
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,000
Normally,

319
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,580
others can't see this,

320
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,130
but I'll make an exception

321
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,980
as you and your wife saved my disciple.

322
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,540
I should pay you back.

323
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,240
I'm

324
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,210
giving this

325
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,820
to you as a secret gift.

326
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,800
Here you go.

327
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,410
Thanks, but I can't take it.

328
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,510
Be optimistic, you hear?

329
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,370
Young man,

330
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,260
as long as you're alive,

331
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,060
you'll find

332
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,740
a reason to live on.

333
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,060
Keep that in mind.

334
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,170
I'll leave it here.

335
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,940
(The Divine Classic)

336
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,240
It can help you.

337
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,420
(The Divine Classic)

338
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,580
All finished?

339
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,450
I've had them

340
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,000
buried properly.

341
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,410
Now, I understand what you said.

342
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,840
What's done

343
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,500
can't be undone no matter what.

344
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,260
Forget about forgiveness.

345
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,780
Try to make up for it.

346
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,720
Right.

347
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,690
The past is the past.

348
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,300
The future lies ahead.

349
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,630
Alright.

350
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,930
This trip to Cainan is fruitful.

351
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
I think

352
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,930
I'll come back someday.

353
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,340
It's a shame that the map

354
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,500
can't be fixed because of me.

355
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,300
In the end,

356
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
we took

357
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,820
great pains for nothing.

358
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,370
You're wrong.

359
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,950
Master,

360
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,170
the Cold Silkworm is dead.

361
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,340
What I need is the silk.

362
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,060
With all those cocoons,

363
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,820
there's enough silk, right?

364
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,610
Are you saying...?

365
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,210
I'm working on the map,

366
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,540
but it takes time

367
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,890
to fully restore it.

368
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,500
It'll be finished

369
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,410
by the New Year, I think.

370
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,950
New Year?

371
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,100
I almost forgot about it.

372
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,920
At that time,

373
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,300
Miaomiao and Sheng should be back, too.

374
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,980
We can celebrate it together.

375
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,760
Good.

376
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,370
Brother Liu, Sister Mu Yao!

377
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,580
Brother Liu and Sister Mu Yao are back!

378
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,450
Sister Mu, Brother Liu!

379
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,350
Miaomiao, Sheng.

380
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,190
Sister.

381
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,920
I miss you so much!

382
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,500
What took you so long?

383
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,890
We got caught up in something

384
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,340
and met old acquaintances.

385
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,130
Also...

386
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,930
Yao and I got married.

387
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,000
What?

388
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,210
Liu Fuyi,

389
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,410
you... you married my sister?

390
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,060
Sheng, he's your brother-in-law now.

391
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,480
You...!

392
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,550
If you break my sister's heart,

393
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,580
I'll make you pay!

394
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,950
I know.

395
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,540
But if you upset her again,

396
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,500
I'll teach you a lesson as her husband.

397
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,000
What about you two?

398
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,840
What happened?

399
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,340
We also met some old acquaintances

400
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,820
and dealt with certain things.

401
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,150
Sheng,

402
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,890
have you recovered your background?

403
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,820
It's nothing special.

404
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,980
Now, I know who I am,

405
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,130
where I'm from,

406
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,280
and

407
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,780
how I should live on.

408
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,340
When you're ready to tell me,

409
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,450
I'll be all ears.

410
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,430
I will.

411
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:28,060
Congratulations!

412
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,210
Congratulations!

413
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,040
Huaijiang,

414
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,370
did you and those

415
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,340
from the court

416
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,100
flatten the Qilin Mountain?

417
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,540
That was a Tier 9 demon!

418
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,980
Instead of seeing her

419
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,540
posing a huge threat to humans,

420
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,160
we'd better eliminate her for good!

421
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,850
Were you worried she'd harm humans

422
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,720
or if she escaped,

423
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,580
you'd never reach the Heavenly Level?

424
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,130
Since when did you become so selfish?

425
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,080
It was my fault.

426
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,930
I shouldn't have given you that map,

427
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,100
making you so greedy.

428
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,540
Give it back!

429
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,890
Huai'an, what are you doing?

430
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,110
Huai'an,

431
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,850
the map is too powerful.

432
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,540
You'll get hurt!

433
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,260
From now on,

434
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,060
I'll cut all ties...

435
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,850
with you.

436
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,340
(Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map)

437
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,150
Look at you.

438
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,060
You've gained a lot from this trip.

439
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,690
Now, you're

440
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,960
qualified to be

441
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,370
Crescent's master.

442
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,540
You sent me to look for answers on purpose.

443
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,250
The tragedy of the Qilin Mountain,

444
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,450
my mother's identity,

445
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,290
and the massacre of the Mus.

446
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,130
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

447
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,250
Do you believe what you see

448
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,580
or a stranger's words?

449
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,460
Who was the person imprisoned

450
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,220
in the dungeon in the Mu Mansion?

451
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,770
♪Red Moon♪

452
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,020
There was a dark dungeon there.

453
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,020
Mu Huaijiang never allowed others
to go near it

454
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,250
or talk about it.

455
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,690
I wasn't curious about it at all

456
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,580
until that day,

457
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,610
I heard a song.

458
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,290
I sneaked into the dungeon

459
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,250
and saw a woman.

460
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,940
Now, I remember

461
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,650
my mother used to sing that song to me.

462
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,730
That woman's looks and voice

463
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,170
matched my mother's,

464
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,580
but she couldn't be her

465
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,440
because she was...

466
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,130
She was the Resentful Woman.

467
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,940
Mu Huaijiang meant to kill your mother

468
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,900
because

469
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,460
he read in one of his family's books,

470
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,460
"With Mei's heart,

471
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,330
one will reach the Heavenly Level."

472
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,650
That was half of the sentence.

473
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,070
He didn't read

474
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,650
the rest in the book.

475
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,940
What did it say?

476
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,690
"Without her heart,

477
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,610
Mei'll be the Resentful Woman."

478
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,580
Finally, Huaijiang

479
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,100
caught Mei.

480
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,330
When he killed her

481
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,880
(Mei'll be the Resentful Woman.)
and gouged her Crystal Heart out,

482
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,150
(Without her heart...)
he created

483
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,170
the worst demon in the world,

484
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,860
the Queen of Demons, Tier 9 Resentful Woman.

485
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,380
(Mei'll be the Resentful Woman.)

486
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,800
So

487
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,100
Mei did die.

488
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,610
The one in the dungeon

489
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,650
was not your mother

490
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,250
but the heartless demon queen,

491
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,290
Tier 9 Resentful Woman.

492
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,320
Did

493
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,940
Mu Huaijiang tell you all that?

494
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,420
He meant to tell me.

495
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,460
I should've known all that

496
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,460
to help the Mus,

497
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,460
but back then,

498
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,770
(Huai'an)
I was too disappointed in him.

499
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,690
I didn't read

500
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,500
any of his letters.

501
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,420
(Your guilty sworn brother, Huaijiang)
I missed

502
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,730
the chance to change everything.

503
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:20,660
(Please help me despite our past.)

504
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,980
When I rushed to the Mus

505
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,210
after hearing the news,

506
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,650
in the ruins of the dungeon,

507
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,810
I found traces of a powerful demon
being sealed there

508
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,810
and hundreds of Huaijiang's drafts

509
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,330
of various formations.

510
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,670
He tried everything

511
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,220
but couldn't kill her.

512
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,060
That's why he had her imprisoned

513
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,940
while trying to create a formation

514
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,100
to generate enough power to kill her

515
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,650
once and for all.

516
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,770
But that formation was too grand.

517
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,730
He couldn't complete it

518
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,610
on his own.

519
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,150
(It's urgent.)
So he asked me for help.

520
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,200
(Only you can save the Mus
and everyone else.)

521
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,510
(Please help me)
In the past, with our power combined,

522
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,940
(despite our past.)
we could take any risk however big it was.

523
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,250
But this time,

524
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,730
I didn't show up

525
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,940
in the end.

526
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,220
(Huai'an)

527
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,950
I've been thinking

528
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,770
had I read his first letter

529
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,460
and gone to his place,

530
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,250
everything might've been different now.

531
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,870
Hey,

532
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,690
don't you always

533
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,770
want to know my nature?

534
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,680
See?

535
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,250
My nature says

536
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,070
regrets!

537
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,460
I regret

538
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,210
that I didn't stop all that.

539
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,160
Thank you

540
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,460
for not telling my sister

541
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,250
her father's true colors.

542
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,610
Sometimes,

543
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,060
one doesn't need to know the truth.

544
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,420
But I still

545
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,650
have one question.

546
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,810
Back in that dungeon,

547
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,690
I saw the remaining Extermination Formation.

548
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,170
Huaijiang installed it
to cage the demon queen.

549
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,460
It couldn't kill her,

550
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,250
but it could immobilize her.

551
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,460
So why could she get out

552
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,130
to massacre the Mus?

553
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,290
Because of...

554
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,030
me!

555
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,650
Sheng,

556
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,170
there you are.

557
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,840
Come in.

558
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,070
Come closer.

559
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,130
Let me take a good look at you.

560
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,770
That explains it.

561
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,110
Sheng.

562
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,170
Mei's purest and kindest Tier 9 body is...

563
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,510
You're here to see me again.

564
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,690
the last chain
to hold the Resentful Woman back.

565
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,460
She tricked me

566
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,940
into bringing her poisonous wine

567
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,770
because she could

568
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,550
only be killed by someone she loved.

569
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,170
Sheng, help me, please.

570
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,500
I'm thirsty.

571
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,380
Could you bring me some water?

572
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,170
Sheng,

573
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,250
you're such a sweet boy.

574
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm sorry.

575
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,690
I really am.

576
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,250
Had I found you earlier,

577
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,250
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

578
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,730
You already know where she is,

579
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,470
don't you?

580
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,360
And you've completed that formation

581
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,770
Mu Huaijiang left,

582
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,320
right?

583
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,130
I stayed in the Liaoran Valley

584
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,380
for seven years to do one thing.

585
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,390
Now,

586
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,360
you know

587
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,940
the catastrophe of heaven

588
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,690
means the Resentful Woman.

589
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,540
That long-disappeared demon queen

590
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,330
will reappear soon.

591
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,900
Once the map is fixed,

592
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,540
please do me a favor.

593
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,470
Don't kill her?

594
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,290
Return her flesh and blood.

595
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,020
Back in the Wuyou Water Front,

596
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,110
Liuniang tried to use my mother's memory

597
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,070
and demon core

598
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,770
to build another her with no flesh or blood.

599
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,380
Now, it seems

600
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,610
that my mother can be revived!

601
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,650
"Without her heart,
Mei'll be the Resentful Woman."

602
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,330
So if we do the opposite

603
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,060
to return her Crystal Heart

604
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,020
and rebuild her body,

605
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,100
can Mei

606
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,860
come back?

607
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,640
By my calculation,

608
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,170
all the power in my demon core

609
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,420
is enough to restore

610
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,580
her Rainbow Crystal Heart!

611
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,330
Do you know what that means?

612
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,240
I know.

613
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,940
You've become the Guardian Master.

614
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,380
Without the demon core,

615
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,500
you'll lose all your power.

616
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,550
Do you know that?

617
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,760
I do!

618
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,680
No.

619
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,610
The stakes are too high.

620
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,210
Losing your demon core is one thing.

621
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,940
You might die, too.

622
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,860
If you fail,

623
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,510
you are doomed.

624
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,100
I know the consequences,

625
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,020
but I have to give it a try.

626
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,130
It's the best for everyone

627
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,690
and the fairest

628
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,770
for my sister and my mother.

629
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,380
You old fart.

630
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:16,870
Please

631
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,330
