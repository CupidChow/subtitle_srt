00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,990
Yao,

4
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,630
previously,

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,840
you asked me

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,350
what my inner demon is.

7
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,440
When I was little,

8
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,600
I lost both my parents.

9
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,920
It was my Master

10
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,790
who raised and nurtured me.

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,220
But before being taken in by my Master,

12
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,120
I lived in Liuru Village,

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,120
Cainan County.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,640
They probably never imagined

15
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,790
that my parents

16
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,840
were not good citizens,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
but ruthless bandits engaged in

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,010
robbery and looting.

19
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,540
When I was six or seven years old,

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,510
they were captured by the government

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,760
and beheaded in public.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,310
I then became

23
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,430
a notorious bandit remnant in Cainan.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
Wherever I went,

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,510
I was insulted and chased away.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,120
(Little Liu Fuyi)

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,070
Until one day

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,560
I wandered into Liuru Village.

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,990
This child is

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,430
truly pitiful.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
In the following months,

32
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,510
I'll treat him five days of meals.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,510
I'll treat him seven days.

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,500
The rest will be fully covered by me.

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,310
His clothes in the future

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
will be made by me.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
Good.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Liuru Village is deep

39
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,750
in the mountains,

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,790
not far away from the Jingyang Slope

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,910
we are looking for this time.

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,520
The village is not large,

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,200
with only about a dozen households.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
Everyone is very simple, honest

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,590
and very kind-hearted.

46
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,710
It's them who took me in.

47
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,190
When my parents were alive,

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,680
they had once raided their village.

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,280
They clearly knew my identity,

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,190
yet they still took me in.

51
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,710
They said,

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,800
the sins of the parents

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,590
should not be borne by a child.

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,680
Instead of leaving things
as they are now,

55
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,310
letting me become a villain
like my parents,

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,740
it's better to lend a helping hand
early on.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Perhaps,

58
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,310
in this world,

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,700
there would be one more good person.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,470
They are truly good people.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Yes,

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,680
they are all good people.

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,720
Since that day,

64
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,620
I wore clothes from many families

65
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,350
and ate food from many families.

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
The entire village

67
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,360
collectively raised me.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,910
Everyone is my family.

69
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,750
But

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,430
I destroyed it all.

71
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
That day,

72
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,990
I went into the mountains
to gather firewood as usual.

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,710
I heard the sound of a baby

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,150
and curiously followed the sound.

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,430
Are you a demon?

76
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,860
(Little Phantom Demon)

77
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,710
I don't know why,

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
I wasn't that afraid of her.

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Later,

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
I brought her food,

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,700
- Here, take these.
- sent her some clothes

82
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,400
and tried to find out
what she liked to eat

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,340
and her favorite things.

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,200
I treated her

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,820
like a little human girl
to take care of.

86
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,910
Later on,

87
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,190
I started seeing her

88
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,430
as a speechless companion.

89
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,800
Even from her,

90
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,990
I learned the first magic skill

91
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,230
of my life.

92
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,870
This is my secret.

93
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,750
Even my friend Chuizi

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,590
was not told.

95
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,000
Everyone hates demons,

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
fearing them.

97
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,930
I was afraid they would hire
a Demon Catcher to drive her away

98
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,660
or even kill her.

99
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,240
In the future, we will be
lifelong good friends.

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,820
I said so much,

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,220
could you understand it?

102
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,190
It's okay if you don't understand.

103
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,430
Although they said you are a demon,

104
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,830
I always feel that

105
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,390
you are no different from humans.

106
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,270
I am just like you.

107
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,510
To me at that time,

108
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,480
she was just a child,

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,070
someone just like me,

110
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,270
with no parents,

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,750
no one to care for,

112
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,120
and was looked down upon by others.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,000
But

114
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,790
I was wrong.

115
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Chuizi!

116
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,030
Chuizi!

117
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,230
Chuizi!

118
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,310
Chuizi, wake up!

119
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,430
Wake up!

120
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,750
Chuizi, wake up, Chuizi.

121
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Chuizi!

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Brother.

123
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,750
It was you who killed them?

124
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,070
You demon.

125
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,920
You demon!

126
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,630
I killed that demon

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
and took revenge.

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
Now

129
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,370
I must atone for my sins.

130
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,750
Later, I ran out of the village.

131
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,720
I didn't know
how long I had been running.

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,370
Finally,
I fell into the mountain stream.

133
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,470
However,

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I didn't end up dying.

135
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,950
My Master saved me while passing by.

136
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,240
Since then,

137
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,560
I have been following my Master,
studying

138
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,700
and practicing magic skills.

139
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,780
My Master seems to know
the source of my inner demon,

140
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,950
because when he gave me

141
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,350
the Empyrean Demon Trap Tower,

142
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,040
he said that life and death are easy,

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,350
but forgiving oneself is very difficult.

144
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,900
Since that's the case,

145
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,320
let's not talk about forgiveness,

146
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,680
but only about atonement.

147
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,380
You carried
the Empyrean Demon Trap Tower

148
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,550
and promised to traverse the vast lands

149
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,580
to capture all the demons and evils
in the world,

150
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,690
just because…

151
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,990
Atone for the sins back then.

152
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
Fuyi,

153
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
this is not entirely your fault.

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Moreover,

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,990
at that time, you were just a child.

156
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,360
The guilt you impose on yourself

157
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,190
is too heavy.

158
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Yao,

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
it's okay.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,750
Capturing one more evil demon
into the tower

161
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,160
might save one more life.

162
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,240
No matter what else I do,

163
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,190
they cannot come back to life.

164
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,150
Fuyi.

165
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,960
It's okay, Yao.

166
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,960
It's all in the past.

167
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,630
I'm fine.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,780
(Wufang Town, Xilai County)
- Let me tell you. - Ziqi,

169
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,200
- did you remember anything?
- Each of them

170
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,790
is a righteous hero.

171
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,460
- We've been wandering for half a day.
- They governed this piece of land

172
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,880
- Does any place look familiar to you?
- in an orderly manner.

173
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,500
I have no impression at all.

174
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,630
The tyrants in this village

175
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,670
What should we do now?

176
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,050
- The catastrophe of heaven
- are hiding at home, afraid to go out,

177
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,670
- is approaching.
- fearing to meet those heroes.

178
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,750
If there's no progress…

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,580
There's no use in worrying.

180
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,680
How about tomorrow

181
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,000
we check the nearby rural village?

182
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
Today we're tired from walking.

183
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,140
Come on,

184
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,650
let's go listen to a story
and have some tea.

185
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm not in the mood.

186
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,440
Let's go.

187
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,150
The whole city is ablaze with fireworks.

188
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,910
It's a blaze of lights.

189
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,060
The star bridge and iron lock are open.

190
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,240
Young Master Zhao finally got his wish

191
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,600
- Good.
- Good.

192
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,840
and saw the fireworks he had dreamed of.

193
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
However,

194
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,390
his heart was no longer
on the fireworks.

195
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,510
Why?

196
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,120
Just look at the girl
standing beside him,

197
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,960
curiously looking up

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,870
and gazing at the brilliant lights
filling the sky.

199
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,150
The vibrant colors bloomed everywhere,

200
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,910
yet not a single one

201
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,480
could compare to her

202
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,070
- Two people meet at the Lantern Festival
- stunning beauty.

203
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,600
and fall in love at first sight.

204
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
The plot is too cliché, isn't it?

205
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,240
I think it's quite realistic.

206
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,870
The first time

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,630
I found you a bit cute

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,750
was at the Lantern Festival
in Taicang County.

209
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,990
At that time, the sky was
also filled with lights.

210
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,030
The Murong married Young Master Zhao.

211
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,480
Young Master Zhao felt
his life was complete.

212
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,920
Thus, he decided

213
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,320
not to return to the Imperial Capital
to inherit the noble title.

214
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,420
He wanted to stay with the Murong

215
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,390
to live a carefree life together.

216
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
As the saying goes,

217
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,320
A great number of fortune
can be abandoned.

218
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,750
Fame and fortune

219
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
can all be cast aside.

220
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,200
- The nobleman gave up a promising future,
- By the following May

221
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,170
- to pursue the fair lady.
- when pomegranate flowers bloom,

222
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,100
These characters are too flat.

223
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,300
- In this world,
- Young Master Zhao

224
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,050
- is love the most important thing?
- felt satisfied.

225
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
Do you think

226
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,660
- what is more important?
- A beautiful wife

227
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,540
- Pursue a career.
- looks like a fairy.

228
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,450
- What does it mean?
- Young Master Zhao held his wife's hand,

229
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,750
- What does it mean?
- frequently acting coy at the table.

230
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,110
He smiled at her and said,

231
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,400
- Are you asking me?
- this is what both of us expected,

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,480
let's call him Ziqi,

233
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,150
Okay?

234
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,670
- Good, well done.
- Good.

235
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,270
- Ziqi?
- Ziqi?

236
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,440
Thank you, everyone.

237
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,240
Thank you.

238
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,360
Good.

239
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,150
Good, well done.

240
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,790
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

241
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Thank you, everyone.

242
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,790
Many thanks for your support.
Thank you all.

243
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,000
I have inquired.

244
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,230
The story of Young Master Zhao
regretting marrying the fairy wife

245
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,200
is widely circulated in Wufang Town.

246
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,000
Every storyteller can narrate it.

247
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,870
The author of the script is
Lord Jiyue.

248
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,870
He lives here.

249
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,730
Look at the umbrella.

250
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,770
Hold your umbrella properly.

251
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,510
Excuse me,
is this the residence of Lord Jiyue?

252
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,080
Yes, it is.

253
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,270
Are you booksellers too?

254
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,150
Get in line at the back.

255
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,990
Book…?

256
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,290
We are not booksellers.

257
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,600
Are all of you booksellers?

258
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,790
Some in this line are booksellers.

259
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,360
I am a theater owner.

260
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm here

261
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
to negotiate business.

262
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
I want to bring the story to life.

263
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,680
What kind of person is this?

264
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,320
So in demand!

265
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,440
Don't you know the name of Lord Jiyue?

266
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,750
He is the most popular scripts master.

267
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,720
He has no creative bottlenecks.

268
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,460
He's been writing scripts
for seven years

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
and produced numerous works.

270
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,910
Many bookstores and opera troupes

271
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,570
offered a fortune to seek one,

272
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
but it's difficult to get one.

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,870
So impressive?

274
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
You didn't know that?

275
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,790
What are you here for?

276
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,600
We have some personal matters

277
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,360
to find him.

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,510
You need to find the butler.

279
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,070
The butler is over there.

280
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
Thank you.

281
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,110
Butler,

282
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,720
we would like to meet Lord Jiyue.

283
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,150
Please kindly inform him.

284
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,040
Queue up.

285
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,800
Register.

286
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,120
How many hours do we have to wait?

287
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,390
How many hours?

288
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,920
At least

289
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,870
two months.

290
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
Two…

291
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,600
That's quite a long time.

292
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,350
Butler,

293
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,660
we two come from afar.

294
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,510
Could you please make an exception?

295
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
Look at these people.

296
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,140
Who among them hasn't come from afar?

297
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,030
Some book fans and theater fans,

298
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,870
just to catch a glimpse of my Lord,

299
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,030
have settled in this town.

300
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,670
Such a big ego!

301
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,000
Ziqi, Ziqi, wait a moment.

302
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,670
Perhaps we have some other way.

303
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,990
Young Master,

304
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
are you Ziqi?

305
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,080
Yes.

306
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,080
Is it Z-I Zi,

307
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,790
- Q-I Qi?
- Yes. What's wrong?

308
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,790
Go and tell the Master,

309
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,370
the person he is waiting for
has arrived.

310
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
Please come in.

311
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Please wait a moment.

312
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,360
I will go and call my Master.

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Thank you.

314
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm so nervous.

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,320
We are about to meet the famous author.

316
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,390
So what?

317
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,540
We are here to inquire about something,

318
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,080
not to pay homage.

319
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,390
Actually,

320
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,750
I have a favorite author too.

321
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,200
He is also a prolific author.

322
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
The works he wrote

323
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,630
are warm,

324
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,710
touching

325
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,720
and full of twists.

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,960
Among them, my favorite book is

327
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,870
- is…
- Is…?

328
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,320
It seems it wasn't written very well.

329
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,280
No, it's not.

330
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,270
I remember his pen name is Fu Zhou.

331
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Did you hear of it?

332
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,390
No.

333
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm his number one reader.

334
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,870
It would be great if I could
meet him once in this lifetime.

335
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

336
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,480
This is my Master, Lord Jiyue.

337
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,700
(Lord Jiyue)

338
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
If he is also an ugly person…

339
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,150
Hello, Lord Jiyue.

340
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
We have come abruptly

341
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,910
to ask you an important matter.

342
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,360
Sorry to disturb you.

343
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
Young Master,

344
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,910
you are Ziqi, right?

345
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,630
Yes.

346
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,200
Where is your home?

347
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,000
Are your parents

348
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,360
still in good health?

349
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,210
I have no home, no parents.

350
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,120
Age is right.

351
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,200
Young Master,

352
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,390
have you ever felt

353
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,320
when you were young,

354
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,510
there were some things…

355
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
well,

356
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,440
right?

357
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,720
What I mean to say is

358
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,990
that

359
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,030
did you feel a bit different

360
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,120
from ordinary people?

361
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,150
Are you asking if I am a half-demon?

362
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,740
You compiled the story
of the Qingyi Marquis and the female demon

363
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,360
into a script and spread it widely,

364
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,790
wasn't it to lure me here?

365
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,800
That's right.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,360
I am a half-demon.

367
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,040
So what?

368
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,240
Oh dear!

369
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,030
I finally found you.

370
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,630
- Let go of me.
- I won't.

371
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,750
Let go.

372
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,950
Lin Miaomiao.

373
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,670
Lin Miaomiao, help me pull him away.

374
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,160
Help me.

375
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,480
Lin Miaomiao!

376
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
You just stand by? You…

377
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,750
Let go.

378
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,240
Come, come quickly.

379
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,560
Hurry.

380
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,030
I was just too excited.

381
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,030
Please don't mind.

382
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,900
I haven't done anything else these years

383
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,030
except for looking for Ziqi.

384
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,080
Those people either had the wrong age

385
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,390
or their experiences didn't match.

386
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,510
Today I finally found you.

387
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,870
This is almost certain.

388
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
My life has been saved.

389
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,750
Who exactly are you?

390
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,160
I am a failed scholar
from a nearby village,

391
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,250
born in an impoverished family.

392
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,990
I can't do either manual labor
or farm work.

393
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,960
I had no choice but to
write scripts for a living.

394
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,880
In the past seven years,
all my bestselling scripts,

395
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,070
without exception,

396
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,070
were not originally written by me.

397
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,070
Isn't that plagiarism?

398
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,310
Girl, your words are really harsh.

399
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,000
What is that?

400
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,910
Come.

401
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,760
Come here.

402
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,320
Girl, let me tell you.

403
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,110
What I did is not plagiarism.

404
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,030
It is borrowing.

405
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
Borrowing.

406
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,470
Forget it, I won't talk to you anymore.

407
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,510
Forget it, I'll chat with you.

408
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,750
Ten years ago,

409
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,750
in this Wufang Town,

410
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,350
there was a famous music house

411
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,350
called

412
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,720
Huazhe.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,880
The Huazhe was filled

414
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,920
with beauties

415
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,440
and endless music back then.

416
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,680
(Huazhe)

417
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,070
The owner was called Liuniang.

418
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,790
(Liuniang)
She was an absolutely charming

419
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,030
and remarkable lady
with grace and intelligence.

420
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,920
But one day, for some unknown reason,

421
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,480
Liuniang dismissed

422
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,510
all the female musicians,

423
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,350
and that very night

424
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,110
she set a great fire

425
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,750
to the music house

426
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,830
she had painstakingly managed.

427
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,060
At that time I was a poor scholar.

428
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,380
I originally thought of going there

429
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,400
(Huazhe)
to find some valuable remnants.

430
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,760
Unexpectedly,

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,790
I really found something.

432
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,640
I was overjoyed when I saw the pearls.

433
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,160
I thought it was a windfall.

434
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,310
But after I took them,

435
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,720
I realized these pearls

436
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,480
were so mysterious.

437
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,480
These pearls are so beautiful.

438
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,110
Where is the mystery?

439
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
These pearls

440
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,750
hide stories.

441
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,320
Girl,

442
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,960
whether you want to or not,
you have to marry today.

443
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,230
What's wrong?

444
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,080
I saw it.

445
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,590
Come.

446
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,320
Stop!

447
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,630
Lady.

448
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,690
- Where are you running to?
- Help!

449
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,950
- Help!
- Leave now.

450
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,590
These are not pearls.

451
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,390
They are tears.

452
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,870
Tears?

453
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,550
I saw it in an ancient book
of the Mu Family

454
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,160
that a unique beast
known as the Fei Beast.

455
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,030
Its blood could be used in medicine,
incense and charms.

456
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,750
It made people joyful
and forget their worries.

457
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,550
As its demon tier rises,

458
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,790
it transforms into human form
and grows stronger.

459
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,100
It could make those who were heartbroken

460
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,400
shed tears and turn them into pearls.

461
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,510
By discarding this pearl,

462
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,550
one could discard
the sorrowful memories.

463
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,030
So these pearls contain

464
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,310
the memories of the women

465
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,160
within Huazhe.

466
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,480
That seems to be true.

467
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
Back then,

468
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,510
after reading these tragic stories,

469
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,070
I was deeply moved.

470
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,280
I couldn't help

471
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,110
but record them all one by one.

472
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,720
Then I compiled them into
scripts with slight modifications

473
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
and sold them.

474
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,320
Unexpectedly,

475
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,980
they became very popular.

476
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
Isn't this still plagiarism?

477
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
How can you use
others' tragic life stories

478
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
to make money?

479
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,590
Well, this is just borrowing ideas.

480
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,030
Besides,

481
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,030
who would have thought

482
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,160
that the story contained here

483
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,400
could actually be true?

484
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,590
Moreover,

485
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,400
I faced retribution.

486
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Just when my scripts were selling well,

487
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,640
I never expected

488
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,830
the owner of Huazhe,

489
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,670
Liuniang,

490
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,790
would come back to find me.

491
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,960
It was then that I realized

492
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,200
she was not human,

493
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,160
but a demon.

494
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,390
That day,

495
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,240
when I was dreaming of making a fortune,

496
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
she appeared.

497
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,410
Oh my gosh.

498
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,960
Was she here to seek revenge on you?

499
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,350
No,

500
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,160
quite the opposite.

501
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,350
She came specifically to find me

502
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,370
and gave me something.

503
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,850
It was

504
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,310
this half red pearl.

505
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,550
I want to see them fly

506
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,880
the largest Unity Lantern.

507
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,920
Take care, come again.

508
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,630
Girl,

509
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,480
buy a lantern?

510
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,660
See which one you like.

511
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
(Where is my bracelet?)

512
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,680
Lady, are you looking for this?

513
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,740
(Zhao Qinghuan)

514
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,340
(Mu Rong'er)

515
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,140
(Mu Rong'er)

516
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
What name should we give him?

517
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,680
(I miss you in autumn under the galaxy.)
This child

518
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,940
(I dressed up to tell the pear blossom.)
is what both of us expected,

519
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,240
what about calling him Ziqi?

520
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
(Wind rises, the beauty might leave.)

521
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,440
Ziqi.

522
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,900
(The insects frequently laugh
at my doubts.)

523
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,520
Zhao,

524
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,560
who exactly are you?

525
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,890
The imperial family has already sent
a Demon Catcher

526
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,000
to come and find you.

527
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,720
If they dare to act recklessly,

528
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,720
I will kill you.

529
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,270
If one day,

530
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,830
the world changes,

531
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,830
humans and demons can coexist

532
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,830
and live under the daylight.

533
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,110
Our family of three

534
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,240
will surely reunite again.

535
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,590
And then?

536
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,640
Why did it stop?

537
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,350
The memories in this half pearl
are just that much.

538
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
Later,

539
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,760
Liuniang came to me and said

540
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,880
she could overlook

541
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,480
the fact that I exchanged the memories
in those pearls for money.

542
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,960
But there is one condition.

543
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,290
She asked me
to continue writing these stories,

544
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,350
especially about the love story

545
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,030
in this half red pearl,

546
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,720
spreading it widely so that
as many people as possible

547
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,200
know about it.

548
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,310
She said that this way

549
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,350
there was a possibility
for the child inside,

550
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,880
Ziqi,

551
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,510
to come back and find her.

552
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,750
She specifically told me,

553
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,400
if one day you really come,

554
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,160
I must tell you

555
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,590
to find her.

556
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,790
So the one who wants Ziqi to appear

557
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,550
is this Liuniang.

558
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
That's right.

559
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,200
She now comes every year

560
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,350
to ask me

561
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,160
when I can find the child in this story.

562
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,200
She said if I can't find him this year,

563
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
she will strangle me.

564
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,200
Ziqi, Zi…

565
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,640
Girl, wait a moment.

566
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,040
Take this.

567
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,590
This was left by Liuniang.

568
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
Inside is a map.

569
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
She lives

570
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,830
in the mountains outside the town,

571
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,270
a place called Wuyou Water Fort.

572
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,070
Without this map, you can't find her.

573
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,620
- Okay, thank you.
- Go ahead.

574
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,800
Girl,

575
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,400
you're helping him find his memories.

576
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,630
Have you forgotten

577
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,920
something yourself?

578
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
Girl,

579
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,670
you must remember,

580
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,790
life is but a fleeting dream.

581
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,000
You and him,

582
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,880
only one can wake up.

583
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,310
This is a map
that Lord Jiyue just gave me.

584
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,270
Following this path
to climb two mountains,

585
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,720
we will reach the Wuyou Water Fort,
where Liuniang is.

586
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,520
Ziqi,

587
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,920
are you starting to remember something?

588
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,240
I finally understand

589
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,440
why I have no memory of anything

590
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,550
before I was seven years old.

591
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,790
It's her who tampered with my memory.

592
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,310
She cast a Worry-Free Curse on me.

593
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
Then I began to wander aimlessly

594
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,310
until I stumbled into the Mu Mansion

595
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,110
and met my sister.

596
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,400
I could never figure out

597
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,000
who exactly wanted to
tamper with my memory.

598
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,000
I never expected

599
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,960
it was my own mother.

600
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,160
It's not really surprising.

601
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
I should have realized earlier.

602
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,350
She insisted on abandoning me.

603
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,080
The details are not important.

604
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
The main thing is,

605
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,440
I have regained my memory now.

606
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,720
This is a good thing.

607
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,430
Let's go.

608
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,340
We should get down to business.

609
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,430
Ziqi,

610
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,100
don't push yourself too hard.

611
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,070
I know you're very sad.

612
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,480
Does she really hate me that much?

613
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,390
Yes.

614
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,400
The Qingyi Marquis abandoned
his wife and child.

615
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,720
But…

616
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,630
But…

617
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
But

618
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,680
it's not your fault.

619
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,130
But she didn't think so.

620
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
She's like

621
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,720
shedding a burden.

622
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,440
She left in a great hurry.

623
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,880
She didn't even glance back at me.

624
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Actually, in the past,

625
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
she was just a

626
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,110
vague shadow.

627
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,000
She had no impact on me.

628
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,350
But in recent days,

629
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,240
my memory has gradually returned.

630
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,030
Many questions
I hadn't considered before

631
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,160
kept appearing in my mind.

632
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,000
Miaomiao,

633
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,630
do you think

634
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,240
she is still alive?

635
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,210
Has she ever regretted it?

636
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,950
Did she

637
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,040
ever love me?

638
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,220
All these years,

639
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,350
Liuniang has been looking for you.

640
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,350
I think

641
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,480
could it be your mother

642
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,400
entrusted her to find you.

643
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,590
She also wants to see you.

644
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,520
Ziqi,

645
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,640
do you want to see her?

646
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,110
I don't know.

647
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,840
But as things stand now,

648
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,550
I must go to see her.

649
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,540
(Cainan County)

650
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,480
Someone is over there.

651
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,560
Let's go and inquire.

652
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,060
Fellow villagers, please stop.

653
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,530
We are here to find
the Mysterious Cold Silkworm.

654
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,400
I wonder if any of you have seen it.

655
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,070
We don't have the silkworm

656
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,400
you are talking about.

657
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,510
You'd better look for it elsewhere.

658
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,150
Mr. Dong.

659
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,700
(Liuru Village, Cainan County)

660
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,880
You're out for a stroll?

661
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,360
Yes.

662
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,500
Come, I'll give you a hand.

663
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,400
I'm carrying something.

664
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
- You're tidying up?
- I'm heading back first.

665
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,500
Do you need my help?

666
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,240
Mrs. Zhang,

667
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,350
the weather is really nice today.

668
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,840
Yes, it is.

669
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,480
So I air out the blankets.

670
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,450
Okay.

671
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,400
Look, it's here.

672
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,590
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

673
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,270
See who's back!

674
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,670
Who is it?

675
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,900
Everyone, come and see!

676
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
See who's back!

677
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,150
My husband,

678
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,350
why are you making such a fuss?

679
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,480
Come and see!

680
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,200
Come over!

681
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,620
My wife,

682
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,990
- Let's go, take a look.
- look, do you still recognize him?

683
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,520
Who is it?

684
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,430
Mrs. Zhang.

685
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,870
Hurry.

686
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,470
Come and see who this is.

687
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,910
Come over quickly.

688
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,790
Come on, hurry.

689
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,320
Everyone, come and look.

690
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,270
- Isn't this…?
- Who is this?

691
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,480
I don't remember.

692
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,520
Mrs. Zhang,

693
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,200
can't recognize him, right?

694
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,110
When he was a child,

695
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,290
he loved the yellow rice cake
you made the most.

696
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,040
Maodan?

697
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,830
It's really Maodan!

698
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,750
Maodan is back!

699
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,310
- Maodan!
- Maodan is back!

700
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,590
Maodan is back!

701
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,950
Maodan!

702
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Come, let me see.

703
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,800
Mrs. Zhang.

704
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,480
Mrs. Niu.

705
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,470
- You are back.
- Come and see!

706
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,920
He brings back such a beautiful wife.

707
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,240
Mrs. Zhang,

708
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,240
Mrs. Niu,

709
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,870
you…

710
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,840
you all are still alive.

711
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,710
You haven't come back for ten years.

712
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,880
You probably don't know
the savior of our village.

713
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,590
It's the Lady Divine Doctor.

714
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,030
Lady Divine Doctor?

715
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,510
Yes.

716
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,760
She's also known as Shiniang.

717
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,990
It was she

718
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,400
who saved the lives of
everyone in our village.

719
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
Ten years ago,

720
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,030
she and her husband
passed through our village.

721
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,860
Our villagers were injured by a demon

722
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,390
and fell to the ground.

723
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,360
Shiniang, with her kind heart

724
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,490
and excellent medical skills,

725
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,000
saved the lives of everyone
in our village.

726
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,030
Thank heavens.

727
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,760
If it weren't for her,

728
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,070
everyone in our village would have died.

729
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,030
She lives
at the west end of the village.

730
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,710
Just follow this road to the end,

731
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,690
there's a yard with a fence.

732
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,960
That's her home.

733
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
This should be the place.

734
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,400
What Divine Doctor

735
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,450
can bring the dead back to life?

736
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,600
Hello,

737
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,710
is the Divine Doctor here?

738
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,390
Who is looking for Shiniang?

739
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,800
I am Li Zhun,

740
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,180
(Li Zhun, Merchant)
Shiniang's husband.

741
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,590
Are you two here for treatment?

742
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,630
Where does your demonic aura

743
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
come from?

744
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
What?

745
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,350
Fuyi!

746
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,320
Stop!

747
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,790
(Divine Doctor Shiniang)
Who is bullying people at my doorstep?

748
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,660
So you two are Demon Catchers.

749
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,220
I apologize for the disrespect.

750
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,760
We were too abrupt.

751
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,900
We didn't make it clear

752
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,030
before we acted rashly.

753
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,360
I didn't expect

754
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,400
the Mysterious Cold Silkworm

755
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,360
to be the medicinal guide
for treating asthma.

756
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,430
That's right.

757
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,890
Thanks to this thing.

758
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,970
Its silk is used in medicine,

759
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,110
so that the condition of
both Chuchu and I has stabilized.

760
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,280
Chuchu,

761
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,450
(Chuchu, Li Zhun's daughter)
come and greet the guests.

762
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,920
My daughter Chuchu is spoiled.

763
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,230
Does your daughter
also suffer from asthma?

764
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,270
Yes. It is a misfortune.

765
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,520
Fortunately,

766
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,840
I met Shiniang.

767
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,910
However, later on,

768
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,230
Chuchu's condition worsened.

769
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,070
Shiniang and I took her

770
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,670
to seek medicine everywhere.

771
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,160
Shiniang said,

772
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,750
if we could find

773
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,650
a demon spirit called
Mysterious Cold Silkworm,

774
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,470
using the silk it produces as medicine

775
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,140
with her medical skills,

776
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,290
there would be no life in this world
that couldn't be saved.

777
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,510
However,

778
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,230
the silkworm is truly hard to find.

779
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,750
I travelled through
the deep mountains with Shiniang,

780
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,400
but in the end I couldn't hold on

781
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,370
and fell ill on the road.

782
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,240
Zhun,

783
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,520
you've talked too much today.

784
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Your body can't bear it.

785
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Go take your medicine and rest.

786
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
These two guests,

787
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,240
I will entertain them.

788
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,640
Alright.

789
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,120
Let's go.

790
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,050
Be careful.

791
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
My lady,

792
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,360
why are you so worried today?

793
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Are those two people here

794
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,190
to cause trouble?

795
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,740
Don't worry.

796
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
It's fine.

797
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,470
There won't be any trouble.

798
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,990
Let's go.

799
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,430
Move.

800
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,500
(Wuyou Water Fort)
Come, let me help you.

801
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,400
This is the place.

802
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,600
Be careful.

803
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,920
It doesn't look like a demon lair.

804
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,840
- Let me help you.
- Come.

805
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,350
Who are you?

806
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,480
How did you find this place?

807
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,550
Hold on tight.

808
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,510
Hello, is Liuniang here?

809
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,620
We came here with the map

810
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,630
she provided.

811
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,970
(Taozi, Water Fort Woman)
So you're guests of Liuniang.

812
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,440
Is this okay?

813
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,070
Help me out.

814
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,350
Coming.

815
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,990
It's so beautiful here.

816
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,550
So peaceful.

817
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,260
- There are demons.
- Let's go.

818
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,720
Among them,

819
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,400
there are many demons.

820
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,990
Yes, you don't need to be afraid.

821
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,000
We are all women, all sisters.

822
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,960
No one will be hurt.

823
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,360
Is Liuniang the one in charge here?

824
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,440
Yes, Liuniang is a very good

825
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,710
and very kind female demon.

826
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,550
She built this fort by herself

827
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,550
to take us in.

828
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,800
She said

829
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,150
women who were not accepted by the world

830
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,800
could find refuge here.

831
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,360
There is no distinction of race

832
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,800
or social status here.

833
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,550
Everyone loves each other.

834
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,590
Every day is very happy.

835
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,950
Liuniang.

836
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,000
- Protect Liuniang!
- Protect Liuniang!

837
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,030
Outsiders, how dare you!

838
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,590
You are not welcome here.

839
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,360
Sorry, we didn't mean to.

840
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,920
You misunderstood us.
We have no ill intentions.

841
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,240
What's going on?

842
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,280
Ziqi?

843
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,760
You've finally returned.

844
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,640
Mother,

845
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,510
look,
I'm riding the thousand-mile horse.

846
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,440
Be careful, don't fall.

847
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,150
I won't, I'm very skilled.

848
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,340
Okay.

849
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,680
This is

850
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,120
home.

851
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,150
This is the place
where you and your mother lived.

852
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,880
I come here every day to clean

853
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,920
and keep it as it was.

854
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,440
Nothing in this room,

855
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,510
not even a candlestick, has changed.

856
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,470
Sister,

857
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,070
the candied flowers are dried.

858
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,080
I bring them here for you.

859
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,300
Come on, say thank you.

860
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,320
Thank you, Liuniang.

861
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,360
Good boy.

862
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,510
Liuniang.

863
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,670
This water fort

864
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,150
was originally built by me for her.

865
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:56,870
Liuniang,

866
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,120
where is she?

867
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,280
Where is

868
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,120
