1
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,180
=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,540
(Tianshu Pavilion
of the Astronomical Bureau)

4
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
Chief!

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,360
Chief!

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,420
Chief!

7
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,450
Why are you shouting?

8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,030
Someone wants to meet you.

9
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,980
I'm absent.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,020
Cultivator Mu,

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,580
I am here.

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,530
The formation is so formidable?

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,870
Yes.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,240
The setting up of this formation
is complicated

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,380
and extremely difficult.

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,510
If Dowager Consort Zhao had not intervened,

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,610
ordinary demons would not be able
to accomplish it.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,380
Moreover, the most important point is

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,500
that the person within the formation
must be sincere.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,780
I see.

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,330
No wonder that great demon

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,970
had to support

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,330
a wizard like Tao Ying
with a million followers.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,610
It's just to

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,830
make these followers
sacrifice themselves willingly,

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,670
right?

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,580
Fortunately, the disaster was
stopped by your father

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,780
and the great demon
was executed on the spot.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,020
The demon was not executed,

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,740
but sealed in place by my father.

31
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,810
She broke free from the seal
and found my father,

32
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,690
exterminating the entire Mu Family.

33
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,410
You mean…

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,760
The great demon in the formation

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,710
is the Resentful Woman.

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,180
The Queen of Demons who is at Tier 9?

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,500
That's right.

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,530
You mean...

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,250
The...

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,180
Resentful Woman is now...

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,900
She is now

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,250
inside the Xingshan Hall.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,340
She wants to complete
the Life Suction Formation

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,480
once again.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,570
It's over.

46
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,040
I must immediately gather the leaders
and report to the supervisor.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,970
I need to find someone
to deal with this crisis now.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Yao,

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,460
your hand!

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,480
How long have you been practicing?

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,130
Not long.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Yao,

53
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,570
don't go.

54
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,130
I must tell you something
as soon as possible.

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,850
I approached you intentionally
under my master's orders

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,340
to travel with you.

57
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,800
But I can swear,

58
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,810
he has no ill intentions.

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,810
At the very beginning,

60
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,250
my master instructed me to approach you

61
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,690
to gain your trust

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,250
and steal the Hundred Demons
Mountain and Sea Map.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,530
But when the time came,

64
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,100
I found I fell in love with you.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,520
I have always been obedient
to my master,

66
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,780
but I'm afraid of hurting you.

67
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,730
To be honest,
when the map was destroyed,

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,730
I actually felt relieved.

69
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,570
You stay with us after that

70
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,370
because your master instructed you
to continue monitoring me,

71
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,660
right?

72
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Yes.

73
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,170
Since then, I have feared
that you would discover the truth.

74
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,850
But the longer I spent time with you,

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,690
the more I understood what I wanted.

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,820
You are

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,140
my only light in this life.

78
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,100
Others only see my fame
and beautiful clothes,

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,730
yet no one knows

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,020
that I have always lived in the dark.

Yao,

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,340
I know you have feelings for me too.

85
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,220
You're overthinking it.

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,930
I have no

87
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,730
feelings for you at all.

88
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,990
But,

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,220
if there were no feelings between us,

90
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,660
why did you…

91
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,530
That kiss, right?

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,970
You are a handsome young man

93
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,220
with good appearance,

94
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,290
and you've won
the favor of the Princess.

95
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,610
So I just did it

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,780

I will kill her by myself.

The Astronomical Bureau will
assist you with all its might.

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,340
But I have a condition.

105
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,630
Go ahead.

106
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,020

Sorry, sir.

111
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,970
A guest arrived a bit earlier.

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,140
He said he bought out all of our wine.

113
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,070
Sheng.

114
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
Get lost.

115
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,410
I'm in a bad mood today.

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,660
I don't want to speak with you.

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,580
I just want a jar of wine.

118
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,020
I said,

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
get lost. Don't you understand?

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Mu Sheng,

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,850
I always let you have your way.

122
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,850
Today I won't bear it anymore.

123
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,680
If you continue
speaking disrespectfully,

124
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,050
I won't hesitate to teach you a lesson.

125
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,960
Fine!

126
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,260
I would like to see

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,140
what the renowned Young Master Fuyi

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,790
can do!

129
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,730
Show me!

130
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,460
You're awake?

131
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,340
Yu,

132
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,850
what's wrong with me?

133
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,780
I just remember that,

134
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
yesterday,

135
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,610
I seemed to have been kidnapped.

136
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,970
It's your friend, the Demon Catcher.

137
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,170
Why did he kidnap me?

138
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,930
He's a bit short-tempered.

139
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,580
Please don't take it to heart.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,140
About yesterday's incident,

141
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,290
could you please
stop pursuing this matter?

142
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,340
Alright.

143
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,170
After all, he is your friend.

144
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,190
However,

145
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,610
yesterday,

146
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,300
I think I saw a terrifying demon.

147
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,300
It should be a great demon.

148
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,420
There's no great demon.

149
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,180
You must have been drunk
and remembered it wrong,

150
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,610
or you had a nightmare.

151
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,710
Nightmare?

152
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,820
It shouldn't be.

153
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,360
I clearly remember yesterday I…

154
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,420
It was a nightmare.

155
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,350
You were just scared by him.

156
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,850
That's why you dreamed of these things.

157
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,970
Yes.

158
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,220
I was indeed frightened.

159
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,340
I must have drunk myself into confusion.

160
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,610
Does your head still hurt?

161
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,420
Have some plum juice.

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,180
Yu, you are really good to me.

163
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,750
When we get married,

164
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,180
we will be the happiest couple
in the world.

165
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,580
Let me drink it.

166
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,580
Since you're fine now,

167
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,610
I want to go back to the inn to check.

168
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,010
Check on whom?

169
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,770
Oh, my mind is slipping.

170
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,910
Those cultivators who travelled with you

171
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,350
should all be your family members.

172
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,940
You should visit them more often.

173
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,820
In that case, I'll accompany you.

174
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,470
You should rest.

175
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,700
I'll be back soon.

176
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,460
(Wine)

177
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,300
If it weren't for the fact
that running this tavern is not easy,

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
if it weren't for the fear
of hurting the innocent,

179
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,560
I…

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,640
I would…

181
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,170
I would teach you a lesson.

182
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,880
Today, I also

183
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,220
don't want to have a fight with anyone.

184
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,370
Otherwise,

185
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,350
I'll definitely take your life.

186
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,330
If it's not that
I'm afraid of hurting the innocent,

187
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,730
I would have taught you a lesson.

188
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,480
Come here.

189
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,000
What's the matter?

190
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,300
Hurry up.

191
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,370
Before they lose consciousness,

192
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,280
find out where they live.

193
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
Okay.

194
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,730
Ziqi didn't come back all night?

195
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,070
No, he didn't.

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,770
Didn't he go out with you?

197
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
What happened?

198
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,720
He...

199
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,250
Is this Miss Mu?

200
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
Yes.

201
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,160
Sorry to disturb you.

202
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,390
I heard Young Masters Mu and Liu,

203
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,400
who stayed at this inn,

204
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,280
came with you.

205
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,890
Are they your family?

206
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,610
They are my younger brother
and a friend.

207
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,310
They two have already drunk

208
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,790
over ten jars of wine at our tavern.

209
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,680
Now they are both completely drunk.

210
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,610
Drinking

211
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,230
more than ten jars?

212
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,070
Both

213
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,220
completely drunk?

214
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,830
My Lord,

215
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,490
are you not going to pursue the ruffian

216
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,060
who dared to kidnap you last night?

217
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
It's about to rain heavily.

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,280
Why hasn't Yu returned yet?

219
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,910
My Lord, the ruffian is
extremely vicious.

220
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,850
If not severely punished…

221
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,000
No.

222
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,840
Prepare the carriage.
I will go to pick her up.

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,340
My Lord, we just leave it at that?

224
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,520
My Lord.

225
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,540
Listen to me finish speaking, My Lord.

226
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,770
Ziqi, Brother Liu.

227
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,830
Sheng.

228
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,470
Fuyi.

229
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,750
Ziqi, how did you
end up drinking like this?

230
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,590
Fuyi.

231
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,470
Sister Mu.

232
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,470
I'll go find someone.

233
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,540
Let me go instead.

234
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,850
You take care of them.

235
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,470
Excuse me.

236
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,520
Yu.

237
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,970
Yu, you are here.

238
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,150
After inquiry,
I knew you came to this tavern.

239
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,160
It's raining so heavily outside.

240
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,220
What if you get wet?

241
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,300
I'll take you back.

242
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,440
Sister Mu alone

243
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,970
can't take care of both of them.

244
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,220
I want to stay.

245
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,200
I will send someone
to take care of them.

246
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,090
The wedding is approaching.

247
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,180
You and the Marquis
have many things to prepare.

248
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,220
Don't get distracted by other people.

249
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,850
But what's the point of that?

250
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,440
Isn't the bamboo dragonfly
supposed to go against the wind?

251
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,830
It should fly free and unrestrained.

252
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,350
Wherever the wind goes, it follows.

253
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,680
I like whatever

254
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,610
my love likes.

255
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,640
Miaomiao,

256
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,700
you go back now.

257
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,650
It's enough with me here.

258
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,130
I'm fine.

259
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm fine now.

260
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Lin Yu,

261
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,130
you go now.

262
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,820
You are now a bride-to-be.

263
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,490
There are many things to prepare.

264
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,190
Be careful.

265
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,000
Yu,

266
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,890
do you have something on your mind?

267
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,370
I like this.

268
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,890
Look, this color is beautiful.

269
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,940
My feather is good, too.

270
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,550
Let me show you this.

271
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,910
Look at mine.

272
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,550
Stop!

273
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,180
What's wrong, Yu?

274
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,590
Yu!

275
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,880
Yu!

276
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,010
Young Master Liu!

277
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,240
Princess Duanyang is here.

278
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,460
All of you, step aside.

279
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,770
Someone, help!

280
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,540
(Wangji)

281
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,800
Ziqi!

282
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,780
Where is the young man
who was drunk just now?

283
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,590
Miss,

284
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,300
those two people have already left.

285
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
Left?

286
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,870
Yu,

287
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,650
Yu, why did you suddenly come back?

288
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,340
I want to return this to Ziqi.

289
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,800
What's this?

290
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,450
This is the bamboo dragonfly
made by Ziqi.

291
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,590
For a child's toy,

292
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,890
you ran back in such heavy rain.

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,510
Is there something else

294
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,980
that's weighing on you?

295
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,370
I don't know.

296
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,920
I just remember

297
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,740
Ziqi made this bamboo dragonfly,

298
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,430
but it wasn't made well.

299
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,530
It couldn't fly high.

300
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,780
I said I would help him fix it,

301
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,500
but I haven't returned it to him.

302
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,390
Yu,

303
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,170
do you like

304
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,820
that person called Mu Ziqi?

305
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,680
No.

306
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,820
The one I like is you.

307
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,210
The one I've always liked

308
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,170
is you.

309
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,040
Sister,

310
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,690
how about we set off tomorrow?

311
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,170
Okay, tomorrow.

312
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,730
Take a look. Want some buns?

313
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,380
Yes, give me a steamer.

314
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,710
Okay, I'll wrap it up for you.

315
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,550
Alright.

316
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,050
(Tuanyuan Inn)

317
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,900
Sister,

318
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,940
why did you give up on Liu Fuyi?

319
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,900
Although I dislike him,

320
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
I know

321
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,620
you like him.

322
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,420
Let's not talk about this.

323
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,940
Don't you like Miaomiao?

324
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,700
What if I do?

325
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,580
Yes.

326
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,420
What if I do?

327
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,540
You are different from me.

328
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,940
Miaomiao...

329
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,220
Liu Fuyi has feelings for you.

330
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,380
Even I can see it.

331
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,030
It doesn't matter.

332
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,380
I have a deep-seated vendetta.

333
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,940
I should bear the mission alone.

334
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,940
I don't want to
involve any innocent outsiders.

335
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,460
Yes.

336
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,340
They are all innocent outsiders.

337
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,020
But with me here,

338
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,940
you will not be alone.

339
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,300
I am your brother,

340
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,860
not by blood,

341
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,860
but we're siblings.

342
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,140
In the past, the world was vast,

343
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,100
and only you and I depended on
each other for survival.

344
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,620
Now,

345
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,940
people come and go,

346
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,460
but still just you and I

347
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,860
relying on each other for survival.

348
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,780
Sister,

349
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,700
no matter what vendetta
or mission you have,

350
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,420
I am willing to accompany you

351
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,580
and bear it for you.

352
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,180
Okay.

353
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,780
Sheng,

354
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,700
there is something

355
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,700
I need you to help me
deal with immediately.

356
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,180
Sister, just give the order.

357
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,820
In Lucheng City seven hundred miles
away from here,

358
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,260
there is an aunt married
from the Mu Family.

359
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,580
Do you remember?

360
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,860
Yes.

361
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,700
When she got married back then,

362
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,740
she took a Qingshi Skill Manual
with her.

363
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,380
It was compiled by
the first master of the Mu Family.

364
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,620
After the Mu Family was exterminated,

365
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,690
her copy became the only one left.

366
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,940
Go and help me borrow it.

367
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,150
Haven't you already memorized

368
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,540
its magic skills and spells thoroughly?

369
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,340
I might have some omissions.

370
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,180
Are you sure you want it?

371
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,990
It takes four to five days
to reach Lucheng City.

372
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,300
Not even one day can be delayed.

373
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,300
Alright.

374
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,500
Don't return here after you get it.

375
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,380
Let's meet at the post station ahead.

376
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,380
Alright.

377
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,980
Sheng,

378
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,580
take good care of yourself
when travelling alone.

379
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,900
Wear more clothes when it's cold.

380
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,780
Use an umbrella when it rains.

381
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,900
Sister, why are you suddenly nagging me?

382
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm not a child anymore.

383
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,700
Go now.

384
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,480
- Mother.
- Take a look.

385
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,580
- Shall we buy one?
- Take a look.

386
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,510
I'll take one.

387
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,660
Alright.

388
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,140
Small pendants.

389
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,500
- Sachets.
- See you.

390
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,460
I'm leaving now.

391
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,500
Take a look.

392
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,820
Flowers.

393
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,060
Come and see.

394
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,780
You're back.

395
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,540
Sister Mu,

396
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,680
why did you come back alone?

397
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,220
Where is Miaomiao?

398
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,780
Where is Ziqi?

399
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,060
Where is Young Master Liu?

400
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,660
Little Bamboo Demon,

401
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
you should go too.

402
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,940
Where to go?

403
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,180
Go find your grandfather.

404
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,900
Go to the place you want to go.

405
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,940
I want to go with you all.

406
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,220
Aren't we the Four Bamboo Masters?

407
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,020
We are dismissed.

408
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,940
They won't come back again.

409
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,940
What

410
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,580
do you mean?

411
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,420
Didn't Miaomiao say

412
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,340
we Four Bamboo Masters are a team?

413
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,140
We will work together,

414
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,660
put in effort collectively,

415
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,260
and be loyal to each other,

416
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,100
so we will never part ways, right?

417
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,940
Badge.

418
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,050
The badge is still here.

419
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,300
Are we…

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,180
really dismissed?

421
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,500
Yes.

422
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,500
(Tuanyuan Inn)

423
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
My lady, look,

424
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,900
this is the Phoenix crown
for your wedding tomorrow.

425
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,780
These are the gold and jade items
for blessings.

426
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,480
These are the gold-thread
embroidered shoes for you

427
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,970
to wear tomorrow
to step over the saddle.

428
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,590
The wedding garments
chose by you and the Marquis

429
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,130
will be delivered here
early tomorrow morning.

430
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,570
(Double Happiness)

431
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,460
Got it.

432
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,900
Take them away.

433
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,020
Yes.

434
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,860
Yu,

435
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,940
I'd like to
take this folding fan tomorrow.

436
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,300
What do you think of it?

437
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,940
(Graceful and Elegant)

438
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,180
Isn't it graceful and elegant?

439
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,380
It's quite good.

440
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,420
What's wrong with you?

441
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,340
Why do you seem so preoccupied?

442
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,460
Ruoshi,

443
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,820
I feel something strange in my heart.

444
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,900
I feel very melancholic.

445
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,060
It's like I've lost something.

446
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
Lost something?

447
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
When my father was alive,

448
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,700
he always said so.

449
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,820
Perhaps

450
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,580
it's because the marriage
was arranged too hastily.

451
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,180
I have heard

452
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,580
that before getting married,

453
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,740
people are usually nervous and anxious.

454
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,460
Look how foolish I am.

455
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,540
Regarding the marriage,

456
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,460
I just thought
we could decide it ourselves

457
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
without informing your father.

458
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,660
So, it's understandable for you
to feel restless.

459
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,620
Your father is far away
in Taicang County,

460
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,620
and he doesn't even know
that his dear daughter

461
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,660
is about to get married.

462
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,260
If we go to visit him in the future,

463
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,460
won't he beat me to death?

464
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,860
Yu, let's go.

465
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,580
Where to go?

466
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,340
Write a letter to your father

467
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,860
and inform him before the wedding.

468
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,700
Slow down.

469
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,460
But I don't know what to write.

470
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,540
Then let's write a little less.

471
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,740
Let's write this.

472
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,420
Father,

473
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,740
Ruoshi is good to me.

474
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,220
I'm so happy.

475
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,500
Is that okay?

476
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,500
My Lord, please review tomorrow's
betrothal gifts

477
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,620
and list of presents.

478
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,500
Got it.

479
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,620
Take it, Yu.

480
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,980
I'll be right back.

481
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,420
Cuicui.

482
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,140
Miaomiao,

483
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,780
what's wrong with you?

484
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,940
Are you really going to marry him

485
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,540
and then stay in the capital?

486
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,980
Yes.

487
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,480
Didn't you promise to help me
find my grandfather?

488
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,220
Have you forgotten?

489
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,660
No, I haven't.

490
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,600
Don't worry.

491
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,100
I've already arranged everything.

492
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,100
My future husband is the supervisor
of the Astronomical Bureau.

493
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,580
He can issue proclamations widely

494
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,780
and ask many people to help you
find your grandfather.

495
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,340
And they won't hurt him.

496
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,380
But…

497
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,230
- But…
- By the way,

498
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,100
help me deliver this letter
to the post station

499
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,620
and send it to Taicang County.

500
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,220
Give this to Ziqi.

501
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,260
But aren't we supposed
to travel together

502
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,940
and go on adventures?

503
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,460
What does this mean now?

504
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,460
I'm sorry, Cuicui.

505
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,620
I can't go with you now.

506
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,380
I'm counting on you for these things.

507
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,620
Miaomiao,

508
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,100
you are a liar.

509
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,220
You humans are all big liars!

510
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,620
Yao.

511
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
You are awake.

512
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,140
Your Highness.

513
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,780
It's me.

514
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,100
I was drunk and behaved improperly.

515
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,420
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

516
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,300
Young Master Liu,

517
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,340
you might feel dizzy
due to the influence of alcohol.

518
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,180
Please sit down.

519
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,500
I'm grateful for your care.

520
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,180
I'm leaving now.

521
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,740
Young Master Liu, where are you going?

522
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,660
If you are returning to the Tuanyuan Inn

523
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,540
to find Miss Mu,

524
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,780
there's no need to go back.

525
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,700
Miss Mu has entrusted you to me.

526
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,100
She says that from now on,
she will have no connection with you

527
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,340
and will no longer travel with you.

528
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,500
I know in your heart,

529
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,260
Miss Mu holds a position
of immense importance.

530
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,020
But it's okay, I don't mind.

531
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I will wait,

532
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,100
wait for you to see my worth,

533
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,260
and wait for you to forget her.

534
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,620
I will leave the capital

535
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,980
and return to my master to report back.

536
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,260
There is nothing left for me

537
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,480
to hold on to outside.

538
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,340
Your Highness,

539
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,060
please take care.

540
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,300
Young Master Liu,

541
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,580
tomorrow was supposed
to be my wedding day.

542
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,750
I pretended to have a nightmare
not just to escape the wedding.

543
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,860
The main reason was to force my mother

544
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,100
to widely recruit cultivators,

545
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,220
hoping to get lucky and find you.

546
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,740
But I never expected
you would really come.

547
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,060
You don't need to rush to refuse me.

548
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,420
Think it over for another day.

549
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,660
Just one day will do.

550
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,350
Tomorrow,
when I put on the wedding gown

551
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,020
and walk to the gate of Xingshan Hall,

552
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,940
if you haven't come

553
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,260
by then,

554
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,540
I will forget you forever.

555
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,860
Is that okay?

556
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,100
I won't go.

557
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,740
But I will wait.

558
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,340
Your Highness,

559
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,540
didn't you say

560
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,340
I was the carefully chosen Saintess?

561
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,620
Your Highness,

562
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,460
didn't you say

563
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,700
being a Saintess is
a very fortunate thing?

564
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,540
Why didn't you tell me

565
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,980
that being a Saintess

566
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,580
meant being burned alive?

567
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,740
(Dowager Consort's Chamber)

568
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,940
Your Highness,

569
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
what happened to you?

570
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,900
I dreamed of that witch again.

571
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,780
She came to claim my life.

572
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,060
Really, she came again.

573
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,860
So many years have passed.

574
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,800
Why can't Your Highness
forget these things?

575
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
That wizard was too vicious.

576
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,380
I was so deceived

577
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,660
and caused such a tragedy.

578
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,820
How can you expect me to forget it?

579
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,020
That was all the sin
of the wizard.

580
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,900
It has nothing to do with Your Highness.

581
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,100
Cultivator Mu said back then,

582
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,220
this wizard had already
perished in the great fire.

583
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,140
Your Highness, please rest assured.

584
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,580
Rest assured.

585
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,100
Your Highness has engaged in
vegetarian and done good deeds.

586
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,740
All common people are
speaking well of you.

587
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,340
Haven't you heard

588
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,700
that the virtuous are protected by gods?

589
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,180
Even if there are evil people or demons,

590
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,700
they cannot get close.

591
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
I hope so.

592
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,060
I hope so.

593
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,060
But this time,

594
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,300
Min was said to be possessed.

595
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,220
Don't you think

596
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,820
it eerily resembles the situation
years ago?

597
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,380
In my heart,

598
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,140
I always feel uneasy.

599
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,140
I originally wanted
to hold a grand wedding

600
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,460
for Ruoshi and Min,

601
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,620
and use their joyous event

602
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,860
to dispel the bad luck of Xingshan Hall.

603
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,180
But these two children,

604
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,060
neither of them is worry-free.

605
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,540
They truly have worn me out.

606
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,340
I heard that the interior decoration
of Xingshan Hall has not been removed.

607
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,820
The wedding ceremony of Marquis

608
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,540
is going to be held as scheduled.

609
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,230
What is Ruoshi up to again?

610
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,840
Who is he going to marry?

611
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,250
Yu,

612
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,540
the custom-made wedding garments
has arrived.

613
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,370
Let me take you to see it.

614
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,580
Didn't we choose it
in the shop that day?

615
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,700
This one has been tailored to fit you.

616
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,820
Let's go, be careful.

617
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,500
Go ahead.

618
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,780
Alright.

619
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,740
Why is it this one,

620
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,980
not Nimbus?

621
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,620
Although this outfit is quite plain
in style,

622
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,700
and its design is outdated,

623
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,540
it does fall short of Nimbus.

624
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,860
However, it is what you like.

625
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,380
Tomorrow is our wedding day,

626
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,500
and also your most important day.

627
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,380
You should wear your favorite clothes.

628
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,260
How about it?

629
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,300
Surprised? Happy?

630
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,660
Ruoshi,

631
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,020
thank you.

632
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,860
When someone likes something,

633
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,580
their eyes can't lie.

634
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,220
That day, when you looked at this gown,

635
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,020
your eyes were shining.

636
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:56,940
Ziqi,

637
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,220
can you help me pick?

638
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,740
Which one do you like?

639
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,540
I like the one in the center, too!

640
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,340
I…

641
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,700
Yu,

642
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,580
I will give you

643
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,380
whatever you like.

644
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
I won't force you

645
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,620
to take what you don't like.

646
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,380
You are the woman I love the most.

647
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
I won't allow you

648
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,860
to pressure yourself.

649
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Come, help Your Lady try on the gown.

650
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,340
Come on.

651
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,160
My Lady, let me help you

652
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,780
change into this pair of
fortune bracelets first.

653
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,890
My Lord,

654
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,740
someone from the Palace has arrived.

655
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,780
Her Highness comes?

656
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,100
My Lord,

657
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,500
it's Madam Ruyi.

658
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,540
That's good.

659
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,620
It must be Her Highness who knows it,

660
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,820
sending her to ask questions.

661
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,140
Is the Dowager Consort
going to oppose our marriage?

662
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,340
Yu, don't worry.

663
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,740
If she is determined
to oppose our marriage,

664
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,380
she wouldn't have sent Madam Ruyi here.

665
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,580
You stay calm for now.

666
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,900
I'll go handle it.

667
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,860
Who is Madam Ruyi?

668
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,220
My Lady,

669
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,180
Madam Ruyi was an elder
brought into the palace

670
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,220
by the Dowager Consort.

671
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,420
Back in the Marquis Mansion,

672
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,540
the Dowager Consort
and the former Master

673
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,100
were both attended to by her.

674
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,140
Former Master?

675
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,460
Is that Ruoshi's father,
the late Qingyi Marquis?

676
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,300
Yes.

677
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,780
Our Marquis was also raised
under the watchful eye of Madam Ruyi.

678
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,700
He is the closest to her.

679
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,620
Wait a moment.

680
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,500
Madam,

681
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,540
don't listen to the nonsense outside.

682
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,940
I'm not being reckless,

683
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,500
nor is this a whim.

684
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,220
Yu is the one I've decided

685
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,540
to marry.

686
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,300
Please help me
speak well to Her Highness.

687
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Marquis,

688
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,780
earlier, you opposed the marriage.

689
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,260
Her Highness hasn't calmed down about it.

690
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,900
Now you've privately decided on
a lifelong commitment,

691
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,140
acting first and reporting later.

692
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,340
You say you're not being reckless?

693
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,060
Isn't that because of you?

694
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,020
You spoil me so much

695
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,340
and have the trust of Her Highness.

696
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,650
With such a strong backing like you,

697
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,620
I believe my marriage affairs

698
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,780
will be handled smoothly.

699
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,860
So I have nothing to fear.

700
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,860
Ask her out and let me see.

701
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,860
What do you intend to do?

702
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,380
You are a Marquis,

703
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,820
and now the master of the Zhao Family.

704
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
When you take a wife,

705
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,780
Her Highness should
send someone to meet, right?

706
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,020
I don't think it's necessary.

707
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,380
My judgment is certainly not poor.

708
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,580
You are protective.

709
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,580
You fear that
she comes from a humble family

710
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,740
and I might be picky to her.

711
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
Madam,

712
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,580
Yu is the best woman in the world.

713
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,380
I don't…

714
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,860
I do not want others to judge her
by her appearance

715
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,020
or family background.

716
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,860
Madam.

717
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,380
Hello, Madam Ruyi.

718
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,140
Yu, why are you here?

719
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,020
I come to serve tea to Madam Ruyi.

720
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,180
That won't do.

721
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,380
No matter how old I am,
I'm still just a servant.

722
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,660
There is a distinction
between master and servant.

723
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,820
In my eyes,
these distinctions have never existed.

724
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,020
You treat Ruoshi like a family member.

725
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,450
How could I avoid seeing you?

726
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,690
Sorry for the inadequate hospitality.

727
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,260
Miss Lin is indeed of good temperament,

728
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,660
amiable and decent.

729
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,940
Enough.

730
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,020
I can't drink your tea for nothing.

731
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,860
I will speak well of you
to Her Highness.

732
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,380
Let her be at ease.

733
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,500
That's Great, Yu.

734
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
Thank you, Madam.
