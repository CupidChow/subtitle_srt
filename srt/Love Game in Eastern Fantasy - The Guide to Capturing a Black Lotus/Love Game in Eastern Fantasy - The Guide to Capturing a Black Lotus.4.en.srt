=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,280
I, Mu Sheng, swear to the heavens

4
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,400
that I've never stolen the
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,240
If I tell lies, I will be struck
by the lightning!

6
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,030
Miss Lin,

7
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,670
Liu Fuyi,

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,200
dare you take this curse?

9
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,270
Enough.

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,040
I suddenly remember that

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,330
Last night, I stayed up with a candle,

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,200
reading the Mountain and Sea Map,

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,150
I accidentally fell asleep

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,120
and burned the map.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,590
I threw the remaining into the pond.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,230
I forgot.

17
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,910
Sister Mu.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,760
Sister,

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,710
this is impossible.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,200
I burned the Mountain and Sea Map.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
I am feeling exhausted.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,920
Everyone, please go back now.

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,680
But Lin Yu is really nice.

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,830
I think

25
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,000
she should be my first bosom friend.

26
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,870
Even unreasonable troublemaking
should have its limits.

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,150
Unreasonable troublemaking?

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,790
All I seek is the truth.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
Sister,

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,680
about today's matter,

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,840
why did you take it upon yourself?

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
We forget it

33
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,950
and don't pursue it any further?

34
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,870
Don't you know

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,120
why I don't pursue it?

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,750
Sister, what are you talking about?

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,190
Weren't you the one who stole the map?

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,950
Sister, you're suspecting me?

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,870
Fuyi has been in seclusion these days.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,630
Moreover, he doesn't even know

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,190
that the map is with me

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,470
The persons who have the opportunity
to steal the map

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,960
only include you and Miss Lin.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,870
Miss Lin is an outsider.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,150
But you are different.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
You know all my secrets.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,590
Moreover, you oppose my pursuit
of the Resentful Woman,

48
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,280
fearing that I kick against the pricks.

49
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,120
You wish I would never find the map,

50
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,150
never find the Resentful Woman, right?

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,270
Yes.

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm afraid you'd be hurt by
the Resentful Woman, but…

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,090
The Resentful Woman kills living beings
and commits numerous evil deeds.

54
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,630
I have sworn to kill her,

55
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,680
even at the cost of my life.

56
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,270
For the public good,

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,590
it is to fulfill the duties
of Demon Catchers.

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
In private,

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,590
it is to seek family annihilation revenge.

60
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,400
None of these is important,

61
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
and you don't care, do you?

62
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,750
That's right.

63
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,520
Other living beings or duties

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
have nothing to do with me.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,360
But your enemies are mine, too.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,870
You can make baseless accusations to

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,310
partners who shared life and death with us.

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
My parents

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,630
are not your biological parents.

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,470
How could you care about their death?

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,600
So, in your heart,

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,240
this is what you have always thought.

73
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,240
You are so mischievous.

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,310
What's your difference from a demon?

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
You've always been wise,

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,430
and I…

77
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,630
only follow your lead.

78
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,360
I don't like to argue with you.

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,270
Since you think I am the real thief,

80
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,430
I am the real thief.

81
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,750
(Should I confess?)

82
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,240
(Mu Sheng will definitely kill me.)

83
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,680
(If he kills me, so be it.)

84
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,520
(It's a small matter.)

85
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,230
It's like this…

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
Friendly reminder:

87
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,070
The ten-day protection period has ended.

88
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,680
From now on,

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
the plot cannot be reverted or restarted.

90
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,020
The host's death in the plot of this book

91
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,570
will be true death.

92
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,830
Please cherish life.

93
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,830
Be cautious all the time.

94
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,030
Young Master Mu,

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
Sister Mu,

96
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,160
in the middle of the night,

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
you must be parched
from all that arguing.

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,720
How about I get you something to drink?

99
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,230
I see.

100
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,920
Originally, I thought

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
I should stand in front of you
to protect you.

102
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,180
Now it seems…

103
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,190
you don't need me anymore.

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,190
It's me who is blocking your path.

105
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,780
(Mu Sheng's Heart Lake)

106
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,160
Young Master Mu,

107
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Young Master Mu,

108
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,950
I accidentally overheard

109
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,480
what you said to your sister.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,270
Young Master Mu, wait for me.

111
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,680
I know you were speaking out of anger.

112
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,560
The person who burned the map wasn't you.

113
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
What about…

114
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,680
I go and explain it to Sister Mu for you?

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,270
Why should you explain it to my sister?

116
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,360
Don't say she merely suspects me.

117
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,680
Even if she wants to kill me,

118
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,160
it's none of your business.

119
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,470
I…

120
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,230
Young Master Mu,

121
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,160
am I trying to help you?

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,560
I believe you.

123
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
and I know

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,270
you would never do anything

125
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,690
that would hurt your sister.

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,750
Don't pretend to know me.

127
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,070
I don't really know you,

128
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,360
but I think we have a connection.

129
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,240
Maybe we can have a good chat.

130
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,190
I said so much, at least respond to me.

131
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,750
I don't talk to dead people.

132
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,160
Miss Lin, eat more what you like recently.

133
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
(I can't afford to anger him.)

134
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,270
System task has been updated.

135
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,190
Now is announcing the hidden task.

136
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,800
Please conquer character Mu Sheng

137
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,720
before killing the Resentful Woman,

138
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,720
making him treat you his true love,

139
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,360
otherwise, the host will
never return to the real world.

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,390
Conquer him?

141
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,510
True love!

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,870
Are you playing with me?

143
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,510
The successful conquering is

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,870
character Mu Sheng's favorability towards you

145
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,150
reach one hundred percent.

146
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,350
So,

147
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,270
how much does he feel about me now?

148
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,830
Friendly reminder:

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,050
character Mu Sheng's favorability
towards you is

150
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,360
negative two hundred percent.

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,990
According to the current situation,

152
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,000
it will trigger the plot that

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
Mu Sheng kills your entire family.

154
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,630
Damn it.

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,270
He hates me that much?

156
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,460
System,

157
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,190
is it that you have made a mistake?

158
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,770
What did I do?

159
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,360
He is just that narrow-minded.

160
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,270
Is it necessary?

161
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,080
I just asked him to peel grapes,

162
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,430
and give me a shoulder massage,

163
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,370
complained about him
in front of his sister,

164
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,550
intended to

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,750
hurt his sister,

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,000
tore the talisman,

167
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,020
changed the medicine,

168
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,220
and burned his sister's map.

169
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,420
Alright, I admit it.

170
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,420
I did some despicable things.

171
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,660
But I was forced to do them.

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,540
I had no choice.

173
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,660
Besides,

174
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,500
he can't just wipe out
an entire family easily.

175
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,700
What should I do?

176
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,780
Alright, I got it.

177
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,140
Stop appearing!

178
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,100
However, the extermination
of the County Magistrate's family

179
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,300
is truly tragic when thinking about it.

180
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,180
(Maintain Integrity)

181
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,420
Young Master Liu,

182
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,940
my daughter is innocent.

183
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,460
Please take her away.

184
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,380
No, no, Dad!

185
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,900
- Go!
- No!

186
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,180
Hurry up!

187
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
- No!
- Go!

188
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,100
Hurry up!

189
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,180
Dad!

190
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,460
- Dad! Dad!
- Daughter, go now!

191
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,890
Dad! Dad!

192
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,740
Go!

193
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,620
Dad!

194
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,050
Dad!

195
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,140
Go!

196
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,260
Go!

197
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,000
(The County Magistrate embezzled
from the National Treasury)

198
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,500
(and was exposed.)

199
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,100
(Imperial Capital's Secret Envoy Ji De
slaughtered his entire family.)

200
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,180
(Lin Yu was the only one survived.)

201
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,580
(Imperial Capital's Secret Envoy Ji De)

202
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,580
Miss,

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,420
we finally found you.

204
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,300
You are so young.

205
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,060
Why don't you leave quickly?

206
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,980
Leave?

207
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,780
Where are we going?

208
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,540
Anywhere is fine.

209
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,460
What about…

210
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,980
you take out your indentures.

211
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,940
We burned them.

212
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,020
Miss, you want to drive us away?

213
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,540
I didn't mean that.

214
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,940
What I mean is,

215
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,460
if one day my family faces a disaster,

216
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,780
you won't be innocently implicated.

217
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,570
Miss, what are you thinking about?

218
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,100
We won't leave.

219
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,220
Yes.

220
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,180
I am serious.

221
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,140
We are serious, too.

222
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,820
Miss,

223
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,980
you asked us not to refer to
ourselves as maids,

224
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,700
not to kneel before you,

225
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,380
and you even asked us to sit down
and eat together with you,

226
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,420
we've never encountered such a master.

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,700
Even if the Lin Mansion is in trouble,

228
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,780
we will not leave.

229
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,780
Yes.

230
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
Me, too.

231
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,180
Why are you all so stubborn?

232
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,860
Forget it.

233
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,340
I'll go back to sleep first.

234
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,500
My head hurts.

235
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,300
Miss.

236
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,340
(Serenity and Far-reaching)

237
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,580
Be slowly.

238
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,180
Watch your step.

239
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,740
What's all the noise outside?

240
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,060
Let's go and check it out.

241
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
Slow down.

242
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,540
Watch your hands.

243
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,380
Alright.

244
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,180
Dad.

245
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,420
Dad, this is…

246
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,940
Dear,

247
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,060
sit.

248
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,140
Dear,

249
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,940
I heard

250
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,180
you've always been hanging out

251
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,500
with the Demon Catchers these days

252
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,500
and show great interest in magic arts.

253
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,660
So,

254
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,980
I took action

255
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,180
and bought a few good things

256
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,980
to make you happy.

257
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,700
How about that?

258
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,340
Impressive, right?

259
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,340
Yes.

260
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,940
There is talisman magic in here.

261
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,220
The wick lights up following a sound.

262
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,300
It lights up when there is sound

263
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,700
(Voice-controlled Lamp?)

264
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,740
You haven't seen it before, right?

265
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,020
Yes. I never see it.

266
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,900
Look at this.

267
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,980
This is cold-jade cabinet.

268
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,660
There is ice magic cast
by a Demon Catcher.

269
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
No matter how scorching it is outside,

270
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,260
the inside remains as cold
as an ice cellar.

271
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,660
(Refrigerator.)

272
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,260
Fruits, vegetables,
and flower wine will be more refreshing

273
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,860
if placed inside.

274
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,140
It's rare, isn't it?

275
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,460
Yes, very rare.

276
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,860
Let me show you another magical item.

277
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,980
(This must be the electric fan.)

278
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,020
This is cloud-blowing treasure plate.

279
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,700
It is indeed a good item.

280
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,020
Look, it doesn't need human power.

281
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,300
It can bring gentle breeze.

282
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,660
Dad, how much does this cost?

283
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,620
Not expensive,

284
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
only eight hundred taels.

285
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,100
Eight hundred taels?

286
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
That refrigerator,

287
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,340
no,

288
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,020
how much is this cold-jade cabinet?

289
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,740
Only three thousand taels.

290
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,620
But,

291
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,300
every two or three months,

292
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,940
a Demon Catcher needs to come to
infuse spiritual power.

293
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,340
The remuneration for each visit

294
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,460
is fifteen taels.

295
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
Wan,

296
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,340
how much is your salary each month?

297
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,940
Miss,

298
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,860
Two taels.

299
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,580
Yes.

300
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,500
Two taels.

301
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,500
Dad,

302
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,220
you're a bit too wasteful.

303
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,780
(Considering he embezzled so much money,)

304
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,020
(he's exposed by Mu Sheng.)

305
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,940
(He deserves to be beheaded.)

306
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,220
What waste?

307
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,300
No waste.

308
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,020
As long as you are happy.

309
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,460
Even if you want the moon in the sky,

310
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,580
I will buy it back for you.

311
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,140
I don't like these things anymore.

312
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,340
Refund them. I don't want them anymore.

313
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,020
This…

314
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,340
Dear,

315
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,900
didn't you love most

316
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
the extremely expensive things?

317
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,540
But I don't like them anymore.

318
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,500
What's so great about being expensive?

319
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,980
Dad,

320
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,900
I just hope you can live well

321
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,020
and always stay by my side safely.

322
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,700
This…

323
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,300
You…

324
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,380
Well, am I

325
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,940
staying well by your side?

326
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,620
(Don't worry, Dad,)

327
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,780
(this time, I won't lose you again.)

328
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,100
Who?

329
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,980
It's me.

330
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,060
Young Master Mu,

331
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,980
I heard from the servants

332
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,140
that you had nightmares these days.

333
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,100
so I specifically asked the chef to

334
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,220
make some calming herbal soup for you.

335
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,940
I bring it over to you.

336
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,700
It's okay.

337
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,460
You can let it cool down before drinking.

338
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,860
You still dare to come.

339
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,540
This is my home.

340
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,820
I came to see you with good intentions.

341
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,460
Why should I be afraid?

342
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,940
Putting more fresh flowers in the room

343
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
helps to relax the mind.

344
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,240
Young Master Mu,

345
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,420
I beg you, please spare my Dad.

346
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,820
I know

347
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,900
you suspected that I stole the map,

348
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,980
which caused Sister Mu to suspect you.

349
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,340
So you feel sad

350
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,780
and want to vent your anger.

351
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Killing me alone is not enough.

352
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,780
You also want to kill
my entire family, right?

353
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,620
You're overthinking.

354
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,500
I also know that

355
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,900
you want to manipulate the accountant

356
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,060
to report my Dad.

357
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,740
If the County Magistrate's ledger
is sent back to the Capital City,

358
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,820
I am merely upholding justice,

359
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,100
eliminating a pest.

360
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,620
What does this have to do
with my sister?

361
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Moreover,

362
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,260
what if my sister doesn't believe me?

363
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
I don't care at all.

364
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,700
According to your temperament,

365
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,180
if you truly want to uphold justice,

366
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,940
you can rely on yourself

367
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,620
to kill the entire Lin family in an instant.

368
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,780
There is no need to rely on the imperial court.

369
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,900
What you are doing means

370
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,060
you care about Sister Mu's
opinion of you.

371
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,300
You don't want her to think
you are cruel,

372
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,540
and be disappointed in you.

373
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,580
So you went through
such a big roundabout way.

374
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,220
Noisy!

375
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,540
Young Master Mu,

376
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
don't go.

377
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,980
I... I know you…

378
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
I know you feel wronged.

379
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,100
But if more people

380
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,220
die because of you,

381
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,220
your sister… will be even more
disappointed in you.

382
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,140
Do you see it?

383
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,500
He threatens to kill my whole family,

384
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,020
but I haven't argued much with him.

385
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,380
He was about to kill me.

386
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,220
If I hadn't run quickly,

387
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,900
I would have lost my life.

388
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,860
Lin Yu,

389
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,060
I am so sorry.

390
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,700
I will discipline him properly.

391
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,420
Sister Mu,

392
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
why are you apologizing?

393
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,940
It's not your fault.

394
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,220
This is all Mu Sheng's fault.

395
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,540
Sheng has been like this since childhood.

396
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,340
When my father punished him before,

397
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,620
As long as he yielded,

398
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,220
he could avoid much suffering.

399
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,380
But he was beaten all over his body,

400
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,500
even being beaten unconscious,
he didn't surrender.

401
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Others said he was strange, weird,

402
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,060
unruly and irritable.

403
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,580
He was ungrateful.

404
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,940
But actually he…

405
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,100
He is just an ungrateful wretch.

406
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,260
Sister Mu,

407
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,220
no wonder everyone hates him.

408
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,580
He only brings you trouble.

409
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,700
Anyway, he was just adopted,

410
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,340
not your biological brother.

411
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,900
Why don't you ditch him?

412
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,500
So as not to cause you any trouble.

413
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
Lin Yu,

414
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,860
Sheng is my only relative.

415
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,420
What does mere blood relation matter?

416
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,220
As long as he is there,

417
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,060
even if there is only a roof,

418
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,180
that is my home.

419
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,260
Even if he hurt you,

420
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,420
harmed you,

421
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,180
burned your Mountain and Sea Map,

422
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,580
you still wouldn't give up on him?

423
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,340
Sheng and I depended on each other
since childhood,

424
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,820
he is my younger brother.

425
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,340
Lin Yu,

426
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,260
you don't understand
because you don't have siblings.

427
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,180
No matter what Sheng has done,

428
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,220
no matter what others say about him,

429
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,740
I will never give up on him.

430
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,650
Sister Mu, you are so generous!

431
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
You are amazing.

432
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,820
I'll be leaving first.

433
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,740
Isn't my idea great?

434
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,220
After hearing your sister's
heartfelt words,

435
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,380
do you feel a bit happier?

436
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,620
You siblings are the same,

437
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,720
loving to talk tough,

438
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,100
but you don't mean it.

439
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,660
It's no different from being real siblings.

440
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,300
How about it?

441
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,260
Has his favorability towards me

442
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,620
been greatly improved?

443
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,580
(Isn't he a siscon?)

444
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,300
(I did so much for him,)

445
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,980
(why didn't he change his attitude?)

446
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,300
(If this continues,
my entire family will be exterminated.)

447
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,060
Miss, is there something troubling you?

448
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,100
I urgently need a

449
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,060
strategy guide to deal with him.

450
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,380
How can I improve his favorability

451
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,980
towards me quickly?

452
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,580
Wan, Huayi, come here.

453
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,660
Have you ever been in love?

454
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,580
What I mean is,

455
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,820
have you ever

456
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,900
had a mutual affection with someone else?

457
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,540
There are rules:

458
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,180
Servants cannot overstep our bounds.

459
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,220
Have a seat.

460
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,140
Sit.

461
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,700
Relax.

462
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,260
I just want you two to

463
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,380
give me some ideas.

464
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,340
What do you think is the best way to

465
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,940
make someone quickly fall for you?

466
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,860
Miss, do you have a beloved?

467
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
Of course not.

468
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,180
I work not because I like working.

469
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,980
I am forced.

470
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Let's put it this way.

471
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,300
I have a friend.

472
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,500
She, due to some reason,

473
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,500
has to make someone
who doesn't like her at all

474
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,940
and even hates her

475
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,860
change his attitude towards her,

476
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,540
improve his impression
and even start to like her.

477
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,180
Do you have any efficient
and quick methods?

478
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,020
Tricks are okay, too.

479
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,140
The more effective

480
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,140
and the sooner, the better.

481
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,540
Although I don't understand,

482
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,340
we can think about it.

483
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,620
It seems Miss has already
fallen deeply in love,

484
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,660
unable to extricate herself.

485
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,940
With whom?

486
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,260
Who else could it be?

487
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,860
Of course Young Master Liu.

488
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,060
That's it, Miss.

489
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,380
Isn't the Moon Appreciation Festival
Approaching?

490
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,220
(Moon Appreciation Festival)

491
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,180
(is a fictional festival in the book,)

492
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,500
(similar to the Lantern Festival.)

493
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,940
Then what?

494
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,420
You can pray to Goddess Mei
at the Lantern Festival.

495
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,380
Yes.

496
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,180
If you win the top prize
at the Lantern Festival,

497
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,380
you can fly the first Unity Lantern

498
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,380
of the year with the person you admire.

499
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,440
That was the most auspicious.

500
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,940
Goddess Mei?

501
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,860
(I know the Goddess Mei.)

502
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,260
(She's the goddess of love in the novel.)

503
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
(She governs marriage and relationships,)

504
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,100
(equivalent to the matchmaker.)

505
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,580
(As for this Lantern Festival…)

506
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,420
Let's invite this year's Lantern King
to light the lantern!

507
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,420
- Good!
- Good!

508
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,780
What a perfect couple!

509
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,700
Yes.

510
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,020
So beautiful!

511
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,100
- Such a perfect match!
- So good-looking.

512
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,580
They truly are a perfect match.

513
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,580
Indeed.

514
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,100
So beautiful.

515
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,740
Are you two from another province?

516
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,980
You might not be familiar with
the customs in Taicang County.

517
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,220
On this night, you light lanterns together,

518
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,700
and pray for the blessing
of Goddess Mei,

519
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,220
you will be able to stay together

520
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,380
and never separate.

521
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,180
The first lantern of the year
is the most effective.

522
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,940
(This segment)

523
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,300
(seems to be a romantic scene
between them,)

524
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,300
(but next…)

525
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,740
Good!

526
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,660
Good!

527
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,820
It's flying!

528
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,570
- So beautiful.
- Yes, indeed.

529
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,020
So beautiful.

530
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,780
- They match so well.
- Yes, indeed.

531
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,940
(Taicang County Granary)

532
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,880
- Fire!
- Fire!

533
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,740
Firefighting!

534
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,620
Firefighting!

535
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,700
Why is the Rice Granary empty?

536
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,740
Go check quickly.

537
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,610
- Yes.
- Yes.

538
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,300
How did this catch fire?

539
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,620
Look, it's empty!

540
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,260
- The granary is empty.
- How could it be?

541
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,260
Where did our silver go?

542
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,140
- It's gone!
- What should we do now?

543
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,420
Yeah, why is everything gone?

544
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,820
How did everything disappear?

545
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,180
I'm in a bad mood tonight.

546
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,420
I'll kill a pest

547
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,420
to sacrifice to Heaven.

548
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,860
No, I must prevent such things

549
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,300
from happening.

550
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,540
Miss.

551
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,740
Dad, the Lantern Festival

552
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,580
must not be held,

553
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,460
okay?

554
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,620
So let's go to the
Lantern Festival together.

555
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,300
Dear,

556
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
what did you say just now?

557
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,180
I said,

558
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,660
let's talk privately.

559
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,980
I said, this Lantern Festival
is held every year.

560
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,300
It lacks creativity.

561
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,660
How about we don't hold it this year?

562
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
The weather is dry.

563
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,860
It's prone to catching fire.

564
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,220
This is an annual grand event

565
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,900
of Taicang County.

566
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,660
We've been preparing
one or two months ago.

567
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,340
The people are all waiting.

568
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,740
How can we cancel it now?

569
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,220
And it needs to be held grandly.

570
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,540
But…

571
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,780
Huayi already told me.

572
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,780
Don't worry,

573
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,460
I have arranged everything for you.

574
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,660
I promise

575
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,420
I will let you, my dear daughter,

576
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,220
completely satisfied.

577
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,620
What arrangements are you making, Dad?

578
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,020
Did you have a misunderstanding?

579
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,540
Don't be shy.

580
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm not shy.

581
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,580
With me around,

582
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,100
it's certain.

583
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,700
Regarding the Lantern Festival,

584
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,580
please do honor us with your presence.

585
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,420
(Go back and tell the master:)

586
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,420
(Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map
has been destroyed.)

587
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,700
(I have no reason to)

588
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,140
(approach the Mu siblings.)

589
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,900
(I'll return to Liaoran Valley soon)

590
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,420
(to report to master.)

591
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,060
(Liu Fuyi in the book)

592
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,460
(can't be considered
a complete scoundrel.)

593
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,380
(But he is indecisive and hesitant,)

594
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,060
(constantly wavering between love
and his master's orders,)

595
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,700
(in the end,
he still chooses to hurt Mu Yao.)

596
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,420
(This kind of leading actor)

597
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,980
(and this romantic subplot)

598
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,700
(are hated by everyone.)

599
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,140
(From emotional, reasonable,)

600
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,540
(public and private aspects,)

601
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,100
(Today's plot)

602
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,300
(must be modified.)

603
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,660
Find the most beautiful clothes

604
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,140
and the most impressive jewelry for me.

605
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,400
At tomorrow night's Lantern Festival,

606
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,260
I will amaze everyone.

607
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,100
Miss, what do you want to do?

608
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,900
(I'll compete with Mu Yao
for the leading actor.)

609
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,380
Sister.

610
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
Sheng,

611
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,020
come to help me.

612
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,940
Which one looks better on me?

613
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,220
This one?

614
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,580
Looks good.

615
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
How about this one?

616
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,020
Also looks good.

617
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,980
This one?

618
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,330
You look good in anything.

619
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,140
Why don't you give me some advice?

620
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,540
You've always preferred
quiet over noise,

621
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,090
and you are not keen on makeup
and dressing up.

622
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,340
Tomorrow's Lantern Festival

623
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,260
seems to be very important for you.

624
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Of course.

625
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,260
I don't like crowded places,

626
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,500
but if there is someone important,

627
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,260
I will surely keep accompanying.

628
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,460
(Sister still remembers)

629
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,780
(her promise to me when I was seven.)

630
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,100
(She'll accompany me
to the Lantern Festival.)

631
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,740
It's the first time accompanying
my close friend on an outing,

632
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,580
I don't know what to wear.

633
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,700
So,

634
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,060
I'll go check out the clothing store.

635
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,500
It's her again.

636
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,100
Lin Yu.

637
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,900
- Great!
- Great!

638
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,220
(Lantern Festival)

639
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,650
Great!

640
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,940
It's so lively.

641
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,020
Sister Mu,

642
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,460
your outfit today looks really nice.

643
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,580
Really?

644
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,490
Yes.

645
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,740
Oh my, this outfit and its colors,

646
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,820
and this shawl,

647
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,140
match your headpiece perfectly!

648
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,180
I specifically bought this dress

649
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,380
to match this.

650
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,460
You did that?

651
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,020
Did you do your makeup yourself today?

652
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,540
You are so talented!

653
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,980
I only taught you once,

654
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,100
and you did such a great job.

655
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,100
This eyeshadow looks
sophisticated and natural.

656
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,140
I knew you would praise me.

657
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,820
I practiced for a long time yesterday.

658
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,780
Really?

659
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,300
What about me?

660
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,140
You look very nice, too.

661
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,740
This outfit is dazzling

662
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,180
and eye-catching.

663
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,940
Thank you, Sister Mu.

664
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,460
Look over there.

665
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,140
What are they talking about?

666
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,100
I can't understand.

667
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,020
But I'm angry.

668
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,940
Another fire is coming.

669
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,940
You two

670
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,620
look festive and auspicious today.

671
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Auspicious?

672
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
Festive?

673
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
What season is it now?

674
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
You carry a fan.

675
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,020
So pretentious.

676
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,700
Are you thirsty?

677
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,900
(I can't forget my main task.)

678
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,820
(As long as I ruin the romantic scene
between them tonight,)

679
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,780
(the people who fly
the Unity Lantern together)

680
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,420
(are not Liu Fuyi and Mu Yao,)

681
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,260
(Mu Sheng's mood wouldn't be bad.)

682
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,900
(The warehouse wouldn't catch fire.)

683
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,420
(If the warehouse doesn't catch fire,)

684
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,140
(my Dad wouldn't be dead.)

685
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,620
Brother Liu,

686
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,180
Brother Liu,

687
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,140
I heard that the person who won the most

688
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,340
can become the Lantern King,

689
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,140
and win a big prize.

690
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,340
Why don't we…

691
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,180
Lin Yu,

692
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,340
do you want to be the Lantern King?

693
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,140
If we play together,
we can definitely win.

694
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,660
But I want to go with Liu…

695
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,580
There is a pitch-pot.

696
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,820
Let's go and take a look.

697
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,700
Ten coins for a pot of arrows!

698
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,340
- The one who hits the most wins.
- Excuse me, please make way.

699
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,020
Come and try your luck!

700
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,710
It's very cheap. Cost-effective.

701
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
Boss, the County Magistrate's
daughter is coming.

702
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,500
Almost.

703
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,500
The County Magistrate has instructed us

704
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,380
- not to let Miss Lin be disappointed.
- Look at that.

705
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,900
I think tonight's Lantern King

706
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,860
is definitely Miss Lin.

707
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,100
If we make Miss Lin happy,

708
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,800
the County Magistrate will
reward us generously.

709
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
- Come on, hurry up.
- Boss.

710
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,940
Boss.

711
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,260
Two Misses,

712
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,380
come try your luck.

713
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,660
- Okay.
- One pot, please.

714
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,260
Sister.

715
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,780
So accurate.

716
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,020
Sister.

717
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,980
Impressive!

718
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
Hit again!

719
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,380
Sister,

720
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,820
I will definitely catch up with you.

721
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,860
Look.

722
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,460
Sister.

723
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,900
Lin Yu,

724
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,900
do you want to try it too?

725
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,220
- It's very easy.
- Great.

726
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
No.

727
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm too clumsy.

728
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,700
Brother Liu, can you teach me?

729
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,740
- Come on.
- Okay.

730
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,060
I'll teach you.

731
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,140
Okay.

732
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,340
Listen, stand firmly.

733
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,100
Hold it steady.

734
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,900
Look at the edge of that pot.

735
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,580
Do you see it?

736
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,820
- Got it.
- Come on, you try it.

737
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,660
Okay.

738
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,940
Boss, are you alright?

739
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,780
No, Sister Mu, I'm too clumsy.

740
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,140
I'm really not good at this.

741
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,100
You play with Young Master Mu.

742
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,940
I'll ask Brother Liu to teach me.

743
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,580
Congratulations, Miss.

744
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,820
Congratulations.

745
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
You have won this round.

746
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,020
This is the colored note you have won.

747
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,100
Why?

748
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,260
She didn't hit a single target.

749
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,700
- Well…
- Yes.

750
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,260
Because she hit the hidden bullseye,

751
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,260
her score is ten times
