00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,180
=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,220
She's a Pure Fox.

4
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,580
I know.

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,630
Those demons possess great power

6
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,900
and excel in medicine and poison.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,620
Given her form I just saw,

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,860
she should be Tier 6.

9
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,060
Perhaps she did

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,060
save the villagers.

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,460
But

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,060
the deceased can't be revived.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,700
Even a Tier 6 Pure Fox

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,700
can't do that

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,420
with her divine healing skills.

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,060
They did die

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,500
that day.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm unable to

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,700
bring the dead back to life,

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,460
but

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,460
with the silk from the Cold Silkworm,

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,980
my skills can produce much more power.

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,260
Zhun was saved

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,820
in that way, too.

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,860
Did you come to find the Cold Silkworm

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,260
and run into the injured villagers?

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,380
Yes.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,140
Pure Fox is said

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,820
to be the most intelligent,

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,900
cunning and selfish demon.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,980
They never interfere
in others' business.

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,300
Why

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,620
did you save their lives?

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,980
That was for Zhun.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,740
Your husband, Li Zhun?

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,100
Yes.

37
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,340
Before I saved him,

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
Zhun had

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,540
saved my life.

40
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,340
(Ten Years Ago, Li Mansion)

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,220
Cainan is surrounded by mountains.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,430
The Li Family did incense business.

43
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,670
They made it with demon blood
for generations

44
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,420
and gained a great fortune.

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,020
Back then, when I was caught

46
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,500
by a bounty hunter,

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,900
Li Zhun let me out.

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,020
(Propitious and Auspicious)

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,060
Run!

50
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,540
Don't get caught again.

51
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,500
I remember his looks.

52
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,340
He had gentle eyes,

53
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,620
different from those hunters'.

54
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,780
Young Master,

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,740
the blood

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
from that fox alone could've

57
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,140
made incense worth
more than 100 taels of gold.

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,980
You shouldn't have let it go!

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,100
I did.

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,300
It was me.

61
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,080
The demon blood incense

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,820
has brought us generations of wealth,

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,300
while countless demons have been

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,220
tortured and killed.

65
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,380
It's time

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,860
to end it for good.

67
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,020
Before running away,

68
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,940
I stole a glance at him.

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,860
Actually, I didn't believe what he said.

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,100
But later, I heard

71
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,580
when he took over his family business,

72
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,060
despite others' objections,

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,620
he stopped using demon blood

74
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,340
to only make ordinary incense.

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,900
Soon the business took a nose dive.

76
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,500
Years later,

77
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,540
when he suffered a relapse,

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
he was too poor

79
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,720
- and sick.
- There's no hope.

80
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
I was waiting

81
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,350
- to see him regret everything
- It's too late.

82
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,580
- and make incense with demon blood again.
- I've done my best.

83
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,560
There's nothing else I can do.

84
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,740
I was waiting to see
him harm demons like others.

85
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
But he didn't.

86
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,540
I couldn't let him die.

87
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,900
I don't

88
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,180
regret saving his life.

89
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,500
Does he not know

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,660
you're a fox to this day?

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,660
Thank you

92
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,300
for not exposing my identity just now.

93
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,540
So

94
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,700
ten years ago,

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,340
those in the village...

96
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,340
Yes.

97
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,660
Zhun asked me

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,340
to save their lives.

99
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,980
It was beyond my power,

100
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,380
but

101
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,820
thanks to the Cold Silkworm,

102
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,940
I gave it my all.

103
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,740
It wasn't easy.

104
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,380
Luckily, they weren't dead for long.

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
I could still revive them.

106
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,940
Perhaps

107
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,780
all that was fate.

108
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Did you see

109
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,140
that demon's body?

110
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,820
Demon?

111
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,420
No.

112
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,980
When I got to the village,

113
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,100
I saw a sickle and blood

114
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,500
all over the ground.

115
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,860
Maybe that demon

116
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,260
had been liquidized.

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,220
When Zhang and the others woke up,

118
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,940
they didn't mention any demon either.

119
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,740
The Cold Silkworm is fragile.

120
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,380
It lives on the petals
of Silk Soul Flowers.

121
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,420
The silkworm and the flowers

122
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,540
will soon die outside their habitat.

123
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,100
That's why I'm staying here.

124
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,220
As a fox demon,

125
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,180
you've saved so many lives.

126
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,380
That's selfless and meritorious.

127
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,420
Fuyi and I admire you deeply.

128
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm flattered.

129
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,020
As Demon Catchers,

130
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,580
you let me, a fox demon, go.

131
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,420
I can't thank you enough either.

132
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,860
Shiniang,

133
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,180
may I borrow your Cold Silkworm?

134
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,060
I know it's extremely rare,

135
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,100
but we really need it.

136
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,300
Once we finish,

137
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,580
I promise to return it to you.

138
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,460
If you want anything from us,

139
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,700
we'll get it for you.

140
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,980
Uh...

141
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,220
Fine.

142
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,540
I'll lend it to you

143
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,700
after it produces silk

144
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,500
when the full moon appears.

145
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,580
I need to make this month's medicine
for Zhun.

146
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,980
Sure. Thank you.

147
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,780
We'll come back

148
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,100
in four days then.

149
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
See you.

150
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,740
Liuniang, I'll help you.

151
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,900
No, thanks.

152
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,460
Liuniang,

153
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,940
why can't you tell me now

154
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,460
if my mother is alive,

155
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,580
where she is

156
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,180
and how she's doing?

157
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,180
Ziqi,

158
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,700
be patient.

159
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,580
All your questions

160
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,340
will be answered tonight.

161
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,580
Young lady,

162
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,380
you may wait in the fort.

163
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,340
Miaomiao is my fiancée.

164
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,580
I'd never leave her alone.

165
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,380
Like father, like son.

166
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,380
You too.

167
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,980
It's fine, Ziqi.

168
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,340
I can take care of myself.

169
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,180
Go ahead.

170
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,620
It's about midnight.

171
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,220
I'll be back soon.

172
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,380
I hope you won't mind

173
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,620
sharing a bed with me tonight.

174
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,820
Thanks.

175
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,940
You're welcome.

176
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,340
Just call me Taozi.

177
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,940
Sure, Taozi.

178
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,140
You two look happy.

179
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,940
Why did you come to Xilai County?

180
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,860
To look for Ziqi's hometown,

181
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,260
the Qilin Mountain.

182
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,140
The Qilin Mountain?

183
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,580
That's easy.

184
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,180
Look.

185
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,060
The tallest and steepest mountain
is the one.

186
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,100
This one?

187
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,300
But wasn't it destroyed years ago?

188
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,220
How come it's still there?

189
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,260
Yes, it's gone.

190
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,420
But when it was there a long time ago,

191
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,940
no one actually saw it.

192
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,220
What do you mean?

193
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,860
Liuniang said

194
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,700
she had a powerful sister

195
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,260
who created mirages in the mountains

196
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,700
to protect the Qilin Mountain.

197
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,660
That means

198
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,580
not all mountains in Xilai County

199
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,140
are real.

200
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,180
Some of them are illusions.

201
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
Correct.

202
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,700
The Qilin Mountain was hidden
among them.

203
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,940
It was obvious from a distance,

204
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,260
but you couldn't

205
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,350
find it when you got closer.

206
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,900
Only cliffs and dead ends were left.

207
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
No one

208
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,980
ever saw its true face,

209
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,340
but illusions

210
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,540
for centuries.

211
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,260
And

212
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,500
they're all that's left

213
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,020
with the mountain gone.

214
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
I see.

215
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,140
What's this?

216
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,500
This parterre kept

217
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,900
Rong'er's favorite flowers
when she lived

218
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,140
in the mountain.

219
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,780
When the Qilin Mountain collapsed,

220
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,100
I climbed up

221
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,180
to the ruins over and over

222
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,940
and found the remaining seeds
bit by bit.

223
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,580
Then it took me over ten years

224
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,860
to grow them.

225
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,660
I have a question.

226
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Liuniang,

227
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,100
Crescent is loyal to its master,

228
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,260
and it can sense danger.

229
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,220
Why did it target you when it saw you?

230
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,780
Liuniang,

231
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,380
did it make a mistake?

232
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,020
That weapon is

233
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,180
too intelligent.

234
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,940
That wasn't a mistake.

235
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,700
I did mean to kill you.

236
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,740
When your mother was pregnant,

237
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,980
I told her to have an abortion.

238
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,780
Ziqi,

239
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,580
without you,

240
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,900
she'd still be

241
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,980
living in the Water Fort,

242
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,140
carefree

243
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,220
and secluded.

244
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,700
What's that to do with me?

245
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,740
Do you know

246
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,540
why other girls' tears

247
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,780
are like white pearls,

248
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,460
but hers were red?

249
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,340
Why?

250
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,940
Because they weren't tears

251
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,140
but her blood.

252
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,060
She was created by nature,

253
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,540
pure and tearless.

254
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,700
But if she shed tears,

255
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,700
they could only be her blood.

256
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,940
Do you want to know her story?

257
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,740
Why don't you go inside?

258
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,220
This parterre holds

259
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,460
so many memories.

260
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,180
Yes.

261
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,860
I'm a Fei Demon.

262
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,620
I can absorb others' memories

263
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,980
and create formations.

264
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,020
The roots under this parterre

265
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,740
consist of my memories

266
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,900
and those
of the remaining flower spirits.

267
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,300
Go and see for yourself.

268
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,620
Memories can't be faked.

269
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
Liuniang,

270
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,380
I remember you've never liked me.

271
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,460
You did so much to lure me back

272
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,860
not only to rake up the past, right?

273
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,620
Are you afraid this is a trap?

274
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,580
You're highly talented

275
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,460
with a divine weapon.

276
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
You have nothing to fear.

277
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Memories are intangible.

278
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,340
They're the weakest

279
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,980
and most useless.

280
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,140
They simply record people's past.

281
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,860
Ziqi,

282
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,220
you two have been apart for so long.

283
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,340
Does she miss you?

284
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,420
Does she love you?

285
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,820
Does she hate you?

286
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,060
Does she detest you?

287
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,940
Why did she abandon you?

288
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,460
Don't you want to know the answers?

289
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,780
Taozi,

290
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,780
where did you get this golden pearl?

291
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,460
This one?

292
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,780
It's my grandmother's tear.

293
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,060
Why is it golden?

294
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,860
It was the last teardrop she shed.

295
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,340
One sheds his or her last tear

296
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,620
for those he or she worries the most.

297
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,140
It's more precious than any pearl.

298
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,780
Also, it's an amulet.

299
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,940
An amulet?

300
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,020
Yes.

301
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,220
If the person for whom the tear was shed

302
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,340
wears the pearl,

303
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
it can protect them
from one fatal disaster

304
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,460
and save their life.

305
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,260
Does Liuniang

306
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,300
also have a similar golden pearl?

307
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,380
Where did hers come from?

308
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,540
That

309
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
I don't know either.

310
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,380
She's been wearing it
for as long as I can remember.

311
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,940
When I asked her, she didn't tell me.

312
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,060
Taozi, I'm still worried.

313
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,940
Can you take me to see Liuniang

314
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,780
and Ziqi?

315
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,820
Miaomiao,

316
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,660
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,980
You might feel a bit dizzy

318
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,300
when you wake up in the morning,

319
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,860
but you'll be fine soon.

320
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,100
It's made of Liuniang's blood.

321
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,580
It won't harm you.

322
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,820
Have a good cry

323
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,980
and everything will be fine.

324
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,260
Let it out.

325
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,140
As you know,

326
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,620
Fei Beast blood
can make incense, medicine,

327
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,140
pills, and charms

328
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,500
to erase painful memories.

329
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,580
That's why my clan, my family,
and my friends

330
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,620
- were all hunted by Demon Catchers.
- Let's go!

331
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,420
Those caught alive

332
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,180
would be kept to drain their blood.

333
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,700
When I was cornered,

334
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,420
I'd rather die

335
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,380
than be caught.

336
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,900
But I survived.

337
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,380
That day,

338
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,300
I met her.

339
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,700
She wasn't like any beings in the world,

340
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,700
but she seemed to be able to
connect with them.

341
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
The Qilin Mountain was

342
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,620
just like her,

343
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,300
peaceful, serene,

344
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,220
and able to heal everything.

345
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,420
I was healed too.

346
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
She gave me a home.

347
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,100
Then I stayed with her.

348
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,420
Later, I could turn into a human.

349
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,500
Sister.

350
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,860
We kept each other company

351
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,900
for hundreds of years.

352
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,340
Isn't she beautiful

353
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,340
and carefree?

354
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,100
She lived happily

355
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,420
in the Qilin Mountain
for over 1,000 years.

356
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,540
She had no troubles

357
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,300
or worries.

358
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,740
She was so pure

359
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,100
and divine.

360
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,420
Humans didn't deserve to see her,

361
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,220
but they were curious and admired her.

362
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,140
Then

363
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,460
they worshipped her as the Saintess.

364
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,500
They believed

365
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,900
with her blessing,

366
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,540
they could forever

367
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,660
be with their loved ones

368
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,980
and live happily ever after.

369
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,820
Goddess Mei?

370
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,340
Rong'er was

371
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,220
the one and only

372
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,180
purest and kindest Tier 9 demon.

373
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,060
She was Goddess Mei!

374
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,020
Take a look inside.

375
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,700
There's a lot

376
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,340
you don't know.

377
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,740
As the most enshrined Goddess of Love,

378
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,260
she was hurt by love.

379
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,180
Hadn't it been for me,

380
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,700
that would've never happened.

381
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,260
What I said intrigued her.

382
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,540
She left the mountain

383
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,700
for the bustling human realm,

384
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,500
where

385
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,420
she met

386
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,620
the wrong person

387
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,140
and had you.

388
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,500
That's impossible!

389
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,940
Humans and demons can't be together.

390
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,220
There's never been

391
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,580
a half-demon in all ages.

392
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,060
But

393
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
there is one now.

394
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,740
It's true.

395
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,260
I'm pregnant.

396
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,140
I like the name Qinghuan came up with.

397
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,100
"Ziqi".

398
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,780
"Ziqi".

399
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,860
From the day she was pregnant,

400
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,780
my worries kept growing.

401
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,580
I feared you and your father
would cause her harm.

402
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
In the end,

403
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,340
my fear came true.

404
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,940
That day,

405
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,500
two Demon Catchers

406
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,500
came to the foot of the mountain.

407
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,820
It's a dead end.

408
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,940
Just like that woodcutter said.

409
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,300
Save it.

410
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,820
Can't you tell

411
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,300
the "dead end" is a cover

412
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,340
made by the demons here

413
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,940
to conceal the entrance?

414
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,220
(Entrance to the Qilin Mountain)
Huaijiang,

415
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
what kind of work is this,

416
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,700
looking for a Noble Consort's brother

417
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,900
who ran away from home?

418
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,060
This is ridiculous!

419
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,610
It's him!

420
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,940
You know him?

421
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,100
Yes.

422
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,300
I do know him.

423
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,220
All that's happened

424
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,420
and the course in the past 20 years

425
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,940
can't be a coincidence!

426
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,020
Hey,

427
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,180
who exactly are you?

428
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,860
Liuniang,

429
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,700
calm down.

430
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,340
Qinghuan

431
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,740
told me everything just now.

432
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,260
I'll tell her.

433
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,660
My real name is

434
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,980
Zhao Qinghuan.

435
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,500
His Majesty appointed me Qingyi Marquis.

436
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,180
Noble Consort Zhao and I

437
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,140
grew up like siblings.

438
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,660
I hid

440
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,580
my real identity from you.

441
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,900
Honestly,

442
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,380
I don't like it either.

443
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,170
Over the past few months,

444
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,380
I've been living so happily

445
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,180
with you in the mountain

446
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,340
that I no longer

447
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,780
want to be

448
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,180
a marquis.

449
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,380
I just want to be your husband.

450
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,140
But the royals have sent Demon Catchers

451
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,500
to look for you.

452
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,060
They're at the foot of the mountain.

453
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,740
Qinghuan,

454
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,100
the Qilin Mountain

455
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,770
shouldn't be disturbed
by Demon Catchers.

456
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,100
Don't worry.

457
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,860
I'll explain everything to them.

458
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,060
You'll be fine.

459
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,780
What if they'll harm us

460
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,980
and other demons here?

461
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,620
I'll hold you hostage.

462
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,260
If they dare to make a move,

463
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I'll kill you!

464
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,620
Liuniang,

465
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,740
I've hidden the entrance.

466
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,500
They can't break in easily.

467
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,060
Let Qinghuan deal with them.

468
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,060
That day,

469
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,740
those Demon Catchers didn't barge in,

470
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,180
but Zhao Qinghuan didn't return either.

471
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,100
Everything seemed to return to normal.

472
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,060
It's fine to cry.

473
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,260
I want to,

474
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,900
but

475
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,380
I was born tearless.

476
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,740
I thought

477
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,340
she'd be sad for a while,

478
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,340
but everything would be fine,

479
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,540
as it had been over the past centuries.

480
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,590
(Mu Rong'er)
I felt relieved in secret.

481
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,220
But I was wrong.

482
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,260
After that man left,

483
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,100
Demon Catchers kept showing up.

484
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,380
It's fine. I'm here.

485
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,940
What's wrong?

486
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,500
This is strange.

487
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,380
Why can't I use my power?

488
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,740
Something is wrong.

489
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,180
Why is your power so unstable?

490
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,630
It's as if

491
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,020
being absorbed by that the baby in you.

492
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,500
Sister,

493
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,100
go!

494
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,080
A Demon Catcher of the Mu Family
is here.

495
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,100
But

496
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,860
what about other demons?

497
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,780
You're the target.

498
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,700
Save yourself first.

499
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,500
That was

500
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,620
the last time I saw the Qilin Mountain

501
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,140
and our home.

502
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,740
We made our way out

503
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,460
and thought the mountain would be fine,

504
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,100
but

505
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,340
more Demon Catchers

506
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,580
came later.

507
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,660
They...

508
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,340
- They...
- They used ten mountain talismans,

509
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,860
laying the mountain flat

510
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,420
and killing all the demons there.

511
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,380
Level this evil mountain.

512
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,820
Let no demons go.

513
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,420
Ziqi,

514
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,460
you know more than I thought.

515
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,220
You must've been through a lot
these years.

516
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,260
You're about

517
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,340
to see what's truly unbearable.

518
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,460
When the news of the destruction
of the mountain

519
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,540
and Qingyi Marquis's grand wedding
in the capital

520
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,780
came together,

521
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,700
she became heartbroken.

522
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,700
Sister...

523
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,780
Suddenly,

524
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,020
she shed a tear

525
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,460
which was her blood.

526
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,460
What's worse,

527
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,940
the bigger you grew in her womb,

528
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,940
the weaker she became.

529
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,580
Sister,

530
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,140
you can't keep this baby.

531
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,300
A half-demon

532
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,060
doesn't have a demon core,

533
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,820
so the baby is devouring yours.

534
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm Tier 9.

535
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,820
I can live

536
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,540
without the demon core.

537
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,700
But you're getting weaker.

538
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,220
You can't take the risk!

539
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,700
I have to.

540
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,220
If you can't do it,

541
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,580
I'll do it for you,

542
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,460
Sister,

543
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,300
untie me now.

544
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,660
No matter what happens,

545
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,540
I won't abandon Ziqi.

546
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,020
I have to protect him.

547
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,060
Please don't leave me!

548
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,140
When she gave birth to you,

549
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,580
she lost all her power.

550
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,700
She could only live like a human

551
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,340
and sang in Wufang Town to make money.

552
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,620
In order to bring you up,

553
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,460
she suffered a great deal.

554
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,180
Everyone could bully her.

555
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,700
I can't imagine

556
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,340
how she

557
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,780
went through all that.

558
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,340
When I

559
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,100
finally found her in that music house,

560
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,060
I killed that greedy owner.

561
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,140
I took over that place

562
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,300
and built the Wuyou Water Fort for her.

563
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,300
Ziqi,

564
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,060
I hate your father

565
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,500
and I hate you even more.

566
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,180
But she loved you so much.

567
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
She only cared about you.

568
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,620
Why did she abandon me?

569
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,260
I remember

570
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,780
she left me.

571
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,300
What exactly happened?

572
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,020
That's also what I want to know.

573
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,420
Ziqi,

574
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,780
only one more step to go.

575
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,020
If you enter the core

576

577
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,540
it'll help you regain

all your memories.

579
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,660
Then you'll

580
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,300
know everything.

588
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,780
I love it.

Mother never abandoned me.

She died because of me.

No.

598
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
I won't love others.

599
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,100
Hadn't you fallen in love with father,

600
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,780
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

601
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
What's so good about
being in love anyway?

602
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,140
I don't like it.

I hated that man who abandoned her.

I hated his guts.

606
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,740
I wanted him dead!

607
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,220
One day

608
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,460
I heard news of him.

609
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,860

she'll go to see him.

Alright.

619
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,500
I decided to kill

620
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,700

00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,140
but I failed.

623
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
The town was placed on lockdown

624
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,700

however good he is,

he cannot get out.

696
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,180
The demon core belonged to my mother.

697
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,420

Why go to such great lengths?

699
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,860
