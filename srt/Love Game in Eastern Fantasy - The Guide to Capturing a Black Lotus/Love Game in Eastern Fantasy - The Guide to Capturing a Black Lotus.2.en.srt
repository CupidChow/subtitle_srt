1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,500
(Taicang County Magistrate's Mansion)

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,420
(Simplicity and Ambition)

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,870
Recently, the magistrate of Taicang returned.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,350
Just in time for us to report back.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,000
The demon here has been eliminated.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,440
Now we can set off.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,120
No way.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,830
Sister, you're still injured.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,920
Let's leave after you're fully healed.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,430
In the past journey,

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,150
you were hurt more severely,

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,430
yet never heard you complain.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,390
My little injury is

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,000
nothing to fuss about.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,570
Besides,

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,510
this is an official residence.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,520
The rules are strict.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,750
Neither Fuyi nor I are used to staying.

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,640
If Liu Fuyi feels uncomfortable,

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,030
he can just leave.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,350
I still have things to do here.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,510
What things?

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,710
(Liu Fuyi is annoying,)

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,150
(but his cultivation is great.)

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,120
(Ordinary demons can't)

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,040
(approach the talismans he set at all,)

27
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,950
(let alone tear them apart.)

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,350
(Unless)

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,510
(someone is)

30
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,640
(harming my sister)

31
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,230
(by framing the demons.)

32
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,860
=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

33
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,380
=Episode 2=

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,590
(Whoever tore off the talisman,
their hair would be soft and yellow.)

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
(It'd be obvious.)

36
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,560
(I've checked most of the people
in this mansion.)

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,280
(There are)

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,190
(fewer targets left.)

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Master,

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,870
last night, Miss cooperated with Mr. Liu
to catch demons.

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,350
(Lin Lushan, Taicang County Magistrate)
Miss herself acted as bait.

42
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,870
They wiped out the demons.

43
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,870
Miss had a narrow escape.

44
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,120
Otherwise, how could I explain it to you?

45
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,990
(Dad.)

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
(Why is it you?)

47
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,080
(I miss you so much.)

48
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,520
Alright, alright.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
The demon that harmed the whole county
was eliminated.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,080
This is a great achievement.

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,710
We must thank these people very much.

52
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,400
And my dear daughter

53
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,680
deserves special credit.

54
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,430
My dear,

55
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,400
tell me what you want.

56
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,430
I will buy it for you.

57
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,310
Dad,

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,350
I don't want anything.

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,030
I just hope you can be in good health,

60
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,400
and live a long life.

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Also,

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,310
the carriage on the road
is very dangerous.

63
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,280
If there's an accident,

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,910
it would be serious.

65
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,630
My baby girl has grown up.

66
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,430
She knows to care for her dad now.

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,950
(What's this?)

68
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,190
(You can be so moved
by just a few words.)

69
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,160
(How did Lin Yu)

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
(treat her father?)

71
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,430
Give the orders.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,950
Prepare a banquet immediately.

73
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,310
I want to celebrate the success
of those demon catchers.

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,440
Master,

75
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,360
the doctor specifically said

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
that you have health issues.

77
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,000
Need to avoid greasy and meaty foods,

78
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,430
especially the alcohol.

79
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,270
(Three Highs?)

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,040
- I know my body well.
- (Fatty liver?)

81
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,630
But basic courtesy is needed.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Dad, please listen to the doctor.

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,390
Health first.

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,240
Unbelievable,

85
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,630
my daughter has become so caring.

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,950
Is that real?

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,070
Respected masters,

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,630
I don't know how to thank you all.

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,070
The reward has been paid as promised.

90
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,240
No need for thanks.

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,040
I didn't expect it to be a fifth-rank demon.

92
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,720
No wonder it killed so many
in the past three months.

93
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,800
The reward should be granted.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,600
You're too kind.

95
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,270
Protect the peace of the people

96
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,000
is our duty as demon catchers.

97
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,430
Well said.

98
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
Excellent.

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,040
As expected of the world-famous
Young Master Fuyi.

100
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,710
Cheer up.

101
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,190
I, on behalf of the people of Taicang County,

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,950
thank you all.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,830
I'll go first.

104
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,710
Miss Mu.

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,720
Yao is injured and can't drink.

106
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,630
I'll drink on her behalf.

107
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,030
Alright, alright.

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,120
Young Master Mu.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
Sheng,

110
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
don't be rude.

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,510
Young Master Mu might also be injured.

112
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,040
So I'll drink on his behalf.

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,120
Come on, cheers, Dad!

114
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,790
My dear,

115
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,560
when did you become such a heavy drinker??

116
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,600
You used to not drink!

117
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm not bragging. My drinking…

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
I…

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
- Miss.
- Miss Lin.

120
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,040
- Look, look.
- Miss.

121
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,960
Wake up, Miss.

122
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,670
Sheng,

123
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,190
what happened to you just now?

124
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
The host kindly hosted the banquet,

125
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,310
yet you were so rude.

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,780
I just can't stand

127
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,020
that hypocritical people in the world.

128
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,870
Are you suspicious of Fuyi again?

129
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,270
He counts as one.

130
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,830
And the magistrate counts as one too.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Magistrate

132
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,000
is the county's official.

133
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,270
He earns only
a few dozen taels of silver a year,

134
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,390
yet live in such a luxurious mansion.

135
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,630
His lifestyle

136
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,070
is extravagant and wasteful.

137
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,270
He must be a corrupt official.

138
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,360
As for his daughter,

139
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,510
she's also eccentric and annoying.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
Sheng,

141
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,310
I've told you many times.

142
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,800
Don't make baseless accusations.

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
The demon catcher only deals with demons,

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,310
not human affairs.

145
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,630
Have you forgotten?

146
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,120
I know, sister.

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
You always say you know.

148
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,710
But you never change.

149
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
Sometimes you're just like a kid,

150
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,300
not thinking about anything.

151
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,310
I really can't deal with you.

152
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
Sister.

153
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,430
(This body)

154
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,040
(gets tired easily.)

155
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,360
(Knocked out by one drink.)

156
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,720
(A lot of delicious food,
and I barely ate any.)

157
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,240
(And I still need more.)

158
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,720
This bowl is too small.

159
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,030
I can finish it in two bites.

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,480
Miss, you used to be
the most worried about eating too much.

161
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
At most half a tael of rice.

162
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,990
Half...

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,870
Why?

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,030
You said

165
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,160
that you were afraid of getting fat.

166
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,270
(I really can't believe this.)

167
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,320
(Losing weight isn't done this way)

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,360
(Cutting carbs
can really mess with the head.)

169
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,600
Do you have

170
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,840
a basin

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
in your kitchen?

172
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,550
Yes.

173
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,200
There is a basin.

174
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,750
That's great.

175
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,630
Next time we eat,

176
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,150
bring that basin for me.

177
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,320
So I can refill my food.

178
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,590
What's wrong?

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Ever since the fox demon possessed you,

180
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,240
your behavior has been strange,

181
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,390
totally different from before.

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,270
Is it that obvious?

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,320
The former Miss was always depressed.

184
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,720
Didn't eat enough or sleep well.

185
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,790
And had

186
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,720
a bad temper.

187
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,720
Now you eat much more,

188
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,510
sleeps as soon as lies down,

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,390
and is sincere to people.

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,700
You become talkative and loves to laugh,

191
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,030
like a completely different person.

192
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,320
(Am I going against my character here?)

193
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
You're overthinking it.

194
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,710
Come.

195
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,870
Sit.

196
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,720
Wan, let me tell you.

197
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,870
Once a person

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,080
goes through ups and downs,

199
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,240
sees things much clearer.

200
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,750
Surviving this ordeal

201
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,440
made me realize a lot.

202
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,510
In the past, I had a dark psychology.

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,360
and made things difficult
for others and herself.

204
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,840
That was wrong.

205
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,320
But in the future,

206
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll turn over a new leaf.

207
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
So tell me.

208
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,500
Which one do you prefer, the Miss before

209
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,690
or the current one?

210
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,120
Of course the current one.

211
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,790
But since demon catchers are here,

212
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,360
why don't you ask the Mu siblings
to check for you?

213
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,480
No!

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I say this again.

215
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm definitely not possessed.

216
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,360
You, you must not mess with

217
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,390
the Mu siblings,

218
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,630
especially that Mu Sheng.

219
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,120
Don't have anything to do with him.

220
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,910
Not at all.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,840
Got it?

222
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,270
(Fu Zhou's "Catching Demons")

223
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,670
(has over 300,000 words written.)

224
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,390
(There are still many plots to develop.)

225
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,200
(Lin Yu's physical condition is really bad.)

226
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,200
(If want to pass the level,
I have to practice.)

227
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
(Let's get this body in shape first.)

228
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,800
By the way, Wan,

229
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,510
help me prepare some more things.

230
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
Dad.

231
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,840
My daughter, you are here.

232
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,720
Dad, I asked the housekeeper.

233
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,080
He said that the doctor asked you
to eat less and exercise more.

234
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,430
Have a healthy diet and take more exercise.

235
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,230
Isn't it?

236
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,480
What the doctor said is

237
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,510
relax the body and avoid eating greasy.

238
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,120
Isn't that the same thing?

239
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,150
Let's be partners.

240
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
Exercise together, shall we?

241
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,270
My dear, you go play by yourself.

242
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
I'm going to take a break.

243
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,750
Let's go together.

244
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
For what?

245
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Working out.

246
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,510
This is...

247
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,710
Master,

248
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,960
this is what Miss told us to prepare.

249
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,790
Dad, jumping rope is
the most fat-burning aerobic exercise.

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,910
Look at your belly fat.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,390
You can't keep fit anymore.

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,790
Ah, at my age,

253
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,840
this is quite inappropriate!

254
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,910
Who cares about propriety
when it comes to health?

255
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,720
Dad, come and join me.

256
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,230
No.

257
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
231 times.

258
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,470
Come on!

259
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,270
232 times.

260
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,030
- Come on, come on, dad.
- My daughter.

261
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,870
Stop counting.

262
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,240
- I really can't do it anymore.
- Come on.

263
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,790
You got this.
It's almost 250 times. Come on.

264
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,360
If I jump any longer, I might die!

265
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,510
Almost at 250!

266
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,200
Go for it, dad, it's been half an hour.

267
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,030
Haven't even started burning fat yet, dad.

268
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,270
Let's go! One more time.

269
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,630
- One more, one more.
- I, I want...

270
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,270
Young Master Mu, you're just in time!

271
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,320
Come here,
you're highly skilled in martial arts.

272
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
You must be great at this.

273
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,030
Come, come,
have fun with my daughter for a while.

274
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,510
I have to go for some water.

275
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,550
Dad, don't go. Don't go.

276
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,510
- I need to drink water.
- Come back quickly.

277
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,790
- I really can't.
- Don't eat now.

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Master.

279
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,960
I can't. I can't.

280
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,750
Master.

281
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,650
Master.

282
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,590
Master!

283
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,630
Master!

284
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,150
I'm at my limit!

285
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,720
Mr. Mu, what a coincidence!

286
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,030
We meet here again.

287
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,840
Miss Lin, you're in such a good mood.

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
What are you doing?

289
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,910
I'm exercising.

290
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,080
The weather is so good today.

291
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm absorbing natural essence.

292
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,240
But you're not Lingzhi.
[*Lingzhi: Ganoderma lucidum.]

293
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,390
Can you really absorb the natural essence?

294
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,440
Of course I can.

295
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,840
In this way,
I can run fast if encounter a demon.

296
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,790
Speaking of demons,

297
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,360
I do have a question.

298
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,000
Miss Lin, I'd like to ask you…

299
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,080
You can ask,

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
but why do you raise your hand?

301
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,360
Your hair is messed up.

302
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
What are you doing?

303
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,600
Your hair is

304
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,000
well maintained.

305
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,110
Right?

306
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,950
As for me,

307
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,750
my favorite thing is to take care of my hair.

308
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,960
Is there a problem?

309
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,910
(It was a close call.)

310
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,630
(Thanks to my smart response.)

311
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,000
(Let me take the blame
for what Lin Yu committed.)

312
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,600
(I'm really the God's chosen victim.)

313
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,560
Miss.

314
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,580
Shh.

315
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,350
Miss,

316
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,200
is this rope long enough?

317
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,910
Can you try it
and see if you want to cut it shorter?

318
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,630
Good idea.

319
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,030
Miss, what are you doing?

320
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,320
Miss.

321
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
I want to wash my hair. Right now.

322
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,000
I need rice washing water,

323
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,390
and coconut oil, egg whites,

324
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,790
mature vinegar and distiller's grains.

325
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,360
Bring me whatever you can find.

326
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Hurry up. Hurry up.

327
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,200
Alright.

328
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,790
(It's not in vain that
I wear a homemade hair mask,)

329
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,790
(covered it for so long.)

330
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,480
(It seems that I've passed the test.)

331
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,600
Miss Lin, I remember you had two maids.

332
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,360
One of them is called Wan.

333
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,840
Where's the other one?

334
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,870
The other one?

335
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
(That's right.)

336
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,120
(There's also a maid
named Huayi in the book.)

337
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
(She…)

338
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,360
You has been worried and busy lately.

339
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,030
I've brought some incense for you
to soothe the nerves.

340
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,280
Huayi.

341
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,350
Miss.

342
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,600
Does this bracelet come from Cainan?

343
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,390
Young Master,

344
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,390
my mother is from there.

345
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,200
This is my mother's.

346
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,910
My hometown is also there.

347
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,390
This bracelet is so beautiful.

348
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,990
(Huayi, maid in the Magistrate's Mansion)
It matches your wrist perfectly.

349
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,920
Thank you, Miss Lin.

350
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,270
Miss.

351
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,920
I will never wear this bracelet again.

352
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Huayi.

353
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
You're at the age to find a match now.

354
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,640
I remember

355
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,640
that drunken lame man in the kitchen

356
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,720
just lost his wife.

357
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,150
Miss.

358
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,750
Please forgive me

359
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,510
for the sake of my years of service.

360
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,590
Miss, I was wrong, please.

361
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,880
Miss, Miss, I was wrong.

362
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,790
Miss Lin.

363
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,680
(She was married to someone by Lin Yu.)

364
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,900
(And the wedding date…)

365
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,200
It's today.

366
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,830
(It's none of my business, is it?)

367
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,270
(It's written in the book)

368
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,830
(to highlight Lin Yu's meanness.)

369
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,880
(It's not wrong to write that.)

370
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,790
(After all, it's all fiction.)

371
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
(There's no need to take it seriously.)

372
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,280
(Right?)

373
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,480
Miss.

374
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,480
Master said there are new fabrics
from the Western Regions

375
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,750
in the South Market.

376
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,200
Novel and luxurious.

377
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,350
He'll take you to see them.

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,110
Alright, let's go.

379
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,480
How old is Huayi?

380
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,800
Huayi?

381
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
She's 17 years old,

382
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,750
the same age as me.

383
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,960
(Only 17 years old.)

384
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,400
(She is still a child
who should be in high school.)

385
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,550
Does she have

386
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,000
a blind old mother at home?

387
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,670
Yes.

388
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,920
She told me

389
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,510
that she lives with her mother.

390
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,880
Because her mother was sick,

391
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,350
she was sold here as a slave.

392
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,070
She's very frugal.

393
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,270
She sent all her money back
to her mother for medical treatment.

394
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,110
So if she dies,

395
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,310
how sad would her mother be?

396
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
(Fake, fake.)

397
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,510
(It's just a book.)

398
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,440
(Why should I be so serious)

399
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,880
(about a non-player character?)

400
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,100
(I'm only responsible
for finishing the main plot.)

401
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,050
(Finish the game and go home.)

402
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,200
(No need to complicate things.)

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,750
(Wait, something's wrong.)

404
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,640
(Mu Sheng just asked me where Huayi went.)

405
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,790
(That means he's already suspected Huayi.)

406
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,790
(If he finds out
that Huayi jumped into the well,)

407
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,050
(he will definitely think)

408
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,510
(that I instigated my maid
to tear off the talisman,)

409
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,550
(and then killed her.)

410
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,390
(That's right.)

411
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,590
(I have a reason to save her.)

412
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,070
Too late, too late.

413
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,920
It's too late. It's too late.

414
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
Who blocked the way?

415
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,520
(Princess carry?)

416
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
(Is this in the book?)

417
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,310
You! You!

418
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,880
Why didn't you catch me?

419
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,830
Miss Lin, you said

420
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,100
that men and women shouldn't be too close.

421
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,720
I didn't want to offend you.

422
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,640
- You!
- Besides,

423
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,110
you didn't say you needed my help.

424
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,640
Sister Mu, Sister Mu! What brings you here?

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,680
(Why are you rushing to the backyard?)

426
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
(Let me see)

427
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,310
(what you're up to.)

428
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,280
(Instant Curse.)

429
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,560
(Huayi.)

430
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,560
Huayi.

431
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,670
Miss.

432
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,720
Are you okay?

433
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,310
Fortunately, I made it just in time.

434
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,310
Don't try to kill yourself.

435
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,590
If you die, your mother will be heartbroken.

436
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,030
I don't want her to be sad either.

437
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,960
But if you want me
to marry that brutal drunkard,

438
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,920
I'd rather…

439
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,400
I'd rather die.

440
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,030
Don't get married.

441
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,920
It was Lin…

442
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,830
It's my fault.

443
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,070
I mean

444
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,590
that I made a mistake before.

445
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,030
I take back what I said.

446
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,750
You can come back.

447
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,640
Work hard.

448
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,510
Make more money and take care of your mother.

449
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,830
Let's not talk about marriage anymore.

450
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,670
All right?

451
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,110
Thank you, Miss, for your mercy.

452
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,410
Thank you, thank you very much.

453
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
I won't dare to do that again.

454
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,750
I won't dare talk to Young Master Liu either.

455
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,070
I'll go back to do some work right now.

456
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
Miss Lin.

457
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,590
How did you know
Huayi was going to commit suicide here?

458
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,680
Because I know my maid's character.

459
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,920
Does that make sense?

460
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,510
Then why did she commit suicide?

461
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,200
Because…

462
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,880
It's just

463
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,350
emotional problems, right?

464
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,160
I heard her say

465
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,350
that the reason
was that Liu Fuyi said something to her.

466
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,590
So you can't stand it.

467
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,440
I'm right.

468
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,070
Miss Lin, you're really devoted

469
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,590
to Liu Fuyi.

470
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,310
No, no.

471
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,400
How can that be?

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,030
On the night the Mirror Demon harmed my sister,

473
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,310
what did you do?

474
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,070
I was busy dressing up in my room.

475
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,350
Pretending to be a bride.

476
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,640
What else could I have done?

477
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,000
So,

478
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,110
you didn't know anything

479
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
about the talisman being torn.

480
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,110
Young Master Mu, why do you still suspect me?

481
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,680
You don't even match my hair.

482
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,070
How do you know about the hair?

483
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,920
Was it you

484
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,140
who left it there that night?

485
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,270
Young Master, you checked the hair of everyone

486
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,400
in the mansion.

487
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,070
How could I not guess?

488
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,550
Young Master Mu,

489
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
you are the demon catcher hired by my father.

490
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,070
That means you're also my guest.

491
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,880
But you've questioned me so many times.

492
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,830
Is that fair?

493
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,640
If you're really worried about Sister Mu,

494
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,440
you'd better go back and look after her

495
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
instead of being paranoid here.

496
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,940
Don't let her get into trouble again.

497
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,220
That's serious business.

498
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,440
That's a good point.

499
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,270
I will.

500
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,830
(Finally, I've bluffed him away.)

501
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,550
(I successfully solve the trouble)

502
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,350
(caused by Lin Yu.)

503
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,880
(I have to be cautious)

504
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,350
(about the next plot,)

505
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,350
(and survive to the end.)

506
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,110
(Absolutely not get myself into trouble.)

507
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,960
Beginner's Instructional Task 2

508
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,750
According to the plot in the book,

509
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,720
replace Mu Yao's healing medicine

510
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,510
and delay Liu Fuyi's group's journey.

511
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,110
What kind of messed-up plot is this?

512
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,590
Tamper with the medicine.

513
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,400
Change the healing medicine with a laxative

514
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,240
and have to deliver it in person?

515
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,720
Can the villain be smarter?

516
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,350
(According to the book,)

517
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,830
(Mu Sheng was temporarily out of town.)

518
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,480
(When he heard that Mu Yao
was suffering from abdominal pain,)

519
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,880
(he rushed back immediately.)

520
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,440
(He suspected that
Lin Yu had tampered with the medicine.)

521
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,240
Sister Mu,

522
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,640
I really want to stay with Brother Liu
for a few more days.

523
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,940
So,

524
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,220
please don't recover

525
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,230
so quickly.

526
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,510
(Then for revenge,)

527
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,480
(he uncovered
the magistrate's embezzlement of the treasury,)

528
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,030
(which led to the deaths of all Lin family)

529
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,440
(but Lin Yu.)

530
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,830
The whole family was killed.

531
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,790
Calm down, calm down.

532
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,510
Now the plot is back on track.

533
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,680
This is a good thing.

534
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,880
I just need to
follow the system's requirements.

535
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,070
Finish the plot.

536
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
Then I'll be able to go home.

537
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,590
Anyway, I can't afford

538
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,270
the fate of these non-player characters.

539
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,000
There's nothing I can do.

540
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,440
(Stupid, stupid)

541
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,310
(The system asked me
to change Mu Yao's medicine.)

542
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,160
(It didn't say
you have to change it to a laxative.)

543
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,680
(If I switch it into the tonic medicine
that Lin Yu usually takes,)

544
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,030
(I'll be able
to accomplish the system's mission)

545
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,640
(without harming Mu Yao.)

546
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,070
(Isn't this the solution?)

547
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,720
(I am indeed a genius.)

548
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,870
Sister Mu.

549
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,720
I'm here to deliver medicine to you.

550
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
How come it's you?

551
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,590
(That's not right.)

552
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,070
(Where is Liu Fuyi as written?)

553
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,510
Didn't you say so, Miss Lin?

554
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,160
If really care about my sister,

555
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,830
I should keep an eye on her.

556
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,550
Don't let her get into trouble again.

557
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,270
That's really a good point.

558
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm impressed.

559
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,270
(Why did I say so?)

560
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,000
Thank you,

561
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
Miss Lin.

562
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,680
Thank you for delivering my medicine.

563
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,830
Don't mention it.

564
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,680
So,

565
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,440
do you want to take now?

566
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,950
Of course.

567
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,880
Wait until it cools down

568
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,270
and loses its potency?

569
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,430
Sister,

570
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,480
drink while it's hot.

571
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,200
(Wonderful, thanks to my wit.)

572
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,480
(Otherwise if this guy find)

573
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,830
(something wrong with it,)

574
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,720
(I would have died on the spot.)

575
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,240
Sister.

576
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,550
- Sister.
- It hurts.

577
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,000
Why does it still hurt?

578
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,040
Lin Yu!

579
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,270
What did you do
to my sister's medicine?

580
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,790
I, I didn't.

581
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,070
I just replaced her healing medicine

582
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,030
with a tonic.

583
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,000
I didn't mean any harm.

584
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,510
Why did you do that?

585
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,110
I, I didn't…

586
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,720
Not me, not me.

587
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,790
It was Lin Yu.

588
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,640
She wanted Sister Mu Yao
to recover slowly.

589
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,750
It really wasn't me.

590
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,880
You harmed my sister.

591
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,560
I…

592
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,240
Whoever hurt my sister

593
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,880
deserves to die.

594
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,640
What's going on?

595
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,070
Why did I get killed early?

596
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,270
This is different from
what's written in the book.

597
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,430
I get it.

598
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,880
I have changed the plot before.

599
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,030
That's why Mu Sheng came back early

600
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,160
and found the talisman torn off.

601
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,480
He also suspected me in advance.

602
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,550
So this time,

603
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,270
he didn't give me any chance.

604
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,270
I must find a way

605
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,070
not to reveal anything at all.

606
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,320
Drink while it's hot.

607
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,750
Thank you, Miss Lin.

608
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,480
Thank you for delivering my medicine.

609
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,160
You're welcome. Take a try.

610
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,670
Sister.

611
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,800
Here we go again?

612
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,960
What's wrong?

613
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,070
What did you do

614
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,070
to my sister's medicine?

615
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,530
No, I really didn't change
the medicine this time.

616
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,930
What do you mean
that you didn't change the medicine?

617
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,550
Hasn't anyone mentioned it?

618
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,480
Whoever hurt my sister

619
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,320
deserves to die.

620
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,350
What the hell?

621
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,350
Why can't it work
even if I change the prescription?

622
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,200
What are you looking for, Miss?

623
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,280
A book.

624
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,180
(The Medical Classic of the Yellow Emperor 3)
A medical book.

625
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,510
This time, I'll give her a pot of medicine.

626
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,790
How about something for a stomachache?

627
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,310
Thank you, Miss Lin.

628
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,400
Thank you for delivering the medicine.

629
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,920
But why are you running so far?

630
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,550
I'm timid.

631
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,790
I'm afraid to see people taking medicine.

632
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,480
Please go ahead.

633
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,040
Sister.

634
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,110
(Help! Why does this plot never end?)

635
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,240
Lin Yu, how dare you harm my sister?

636
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,350
Wait.

637
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,510
I'll do it myself.

638
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,630
You do it.

639
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
- You deserve to die.
- Be gentle.

640
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,470
Sister.

641
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,320
Deserve to die.

642
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,280
Deserve to die.

643
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,720
Deserve to die.

644
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,760
Deserve to die.

645
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,580

(Treatise on Febrile Diseases)

647
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,150
Mu Yao, what's wrong with your body?

648
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Why can't you adapt
to more than a dozen prescriptions?

649
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,190
This must be an acute allergic reaction.

650
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,710
But which herb are you allergic to?

651
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,800
I've already tried them all.

652
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
System.

653
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,550
System.

654
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,840
System.

655
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,200
System.

656
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,550
System, where are you?

657
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,030
System, come out quickly.

658
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,940
System, please help me.

659
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,500
I want to go home.

660
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,630
I want to go home.

661
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,300
I want to go home.

662

(Simplicity and Ambition)

663
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,270
Miss Lin, is this…

664
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,760
Water.

665
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,150
My sister should take medicine now.

666
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,630
But you've brought a bowl of water.

667
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,710
Every medicine has its side effect.

668
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,760
Water is the safest.

669
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,800
We won't take medicine today.

670
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,840
Let's drink water.

671
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Come on.

672
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,200
Lin Yu.

673
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,710
What do you mean?

674
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,800
Sheng.

675
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,880
Miss Lin shows kindness.

676
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,320
I happen to be thirsty.

677
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,880
It's suitable for me.

678
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,550
Sister, be careful.

679
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,360
(Finally passed.)

680
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,550
(Such a genius idea.)

681
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,840
(I'm the only one who can think of it.)

682
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,960
(Replace the medicine in the pot with water.)

683
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,630
(Sure enough, it's foolproof.)

684
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Sister!

685
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,910
Sister!

686
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,720
- It hurts.
- Sister.

687
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,510
It's impossible.

688
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,590
Lin Yu,

689
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,700
what did you do to the water?

690
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,720
I told you it was water.

691
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,000
What else could I have done?

692
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,640
Sister.

693
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,440
I get it.

694
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,630
I finally get it.

695
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,110
Mu Sheng, it's me again.

696
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,360
I'm the one who killed your sister.

697
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
I've figured out what's wrong.

698
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,110
Go on, kill me!

699
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,630
Kill me quickly.

700
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Hurry up and kill me.

701
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,280
What pot was used to make the medicine

702
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,400
that Miss Mu drank yesterday?

703
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,510
Miss,

704
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,710
it's a ceramic pot.

705
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,550
Where's the pot?

706
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,190
I accidentally broke it this morning.

707
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,630
So I replaced it with a new casserole.

708
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,030
That's right.

709
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,670
(The book just says)

710
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,840
(that Lin Yu changed the medicine.)

711
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,190
(I didn't expect it to be so effective.)

712
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,880
(I thought it was
because the medicines were incompatible.)

713
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,760
(She didn't know)

714
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,710
(that Mu Yao
wasn't allergic to the medicine at all.)

715
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,030
(She's allergic to the heavy metals
in the glaze of the casserole.)

716
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,760
Then get a new iron pot.

717
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,600
And boil it again.

718
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,550
Alright.

719
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,120
It's so bitter.

720
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,230
Just bitter?

721
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,630
What do you mean?

722
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,190
Sister Mu,

723
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,110
do you feel anything else?

724
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,710
For example, a slight discomfort

725
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,670
in your stomach.

726
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,230
Or do you feel dizzy

727
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,330
- because of the hot weather?
- Lin Yu.

728
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,030
Did you tamper with

729
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,000
my sister's medicine?

730
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Sheng, don't be ridiculous.

731
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,820
Miss Lin is concerned about me.

732
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,460
Please don't mind, Miss Lin.

733
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,100
Sheng sometimes talks like this.

734
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,580
It's a little offensive.

735
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,420
I apologize to you for him.

736
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,260
Congratulations, Host.

737
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,580
Task two for a beginner
has been completed.

738
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,060
Lin Yu,

739
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,020
what the hell are you doing?

740
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,300
You let my sister go.

741
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,540
Sister Mu,

742
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,620
I'm so glad you're okay.

743
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,900
I was so worried
that something might have happened to you.

744
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,140
Don't worry.

745
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,060
I'm really afraid.

746
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,420
I'm fine. Don't worry.

747
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,300
I'm fine.

748
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,380
Sheng,

749
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,100
why are you standing outside?

750
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,340
What are you doing here?

751
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,100
Yao can't go out while she's recovering.

752
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,460
I guess she's bored.

753
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,060
So I've brought her

754
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,020
something to cheer her up.

755
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,100
Cheer up?

756
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,610
I don't think it's necessary.

757
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,260
That's right.

758
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,500
