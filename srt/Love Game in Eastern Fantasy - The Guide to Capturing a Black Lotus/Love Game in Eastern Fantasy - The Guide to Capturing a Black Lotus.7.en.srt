1
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,180
=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,660
(Main Storyline)

4
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,610
I shouldn't have been rushed it.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,300
I skimmed through the original novel.

6
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,300
Especially
the supporting actor's storyline.

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,450
If I had known I needed
to win over Mu Sheng,

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,580
I should have

9
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,980
(Taicang County, the Imperial Capital)
studied it thoroughly.

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,380
(Xiangchang,
Wufang Town, Finale)

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,120
Fortunately, the next main storyline
is in the Imperial Capital.

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,610
I'm familiar with that.

13
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,450
Lin Yu, we're almost there.

14
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,590
Coming.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,500
Sister Mu.

16
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,000
Sister Mu, we arrived
in the Imperial Capital so quickly.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,610
I thought it was a long way.

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,350
The Imperial Capital is indeed far.

19
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,670
But we turned east

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,630
and took the dry route.

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,280
We're not going to the Imperial Capital.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,240
Not going to the Imperial Capital?

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,110
Why aren't we going
to the Imperial Capital?

24
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,450
Why go to the Imperial Capital?

25
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,860
(Nanke Inn)

26
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,850
Welcome, ladies.

27
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,990
Take it easy.

28
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,970
Slow down.

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,730
Come on, take your time.

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,270
Come on.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,900
Watch your step.

32
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,900
Though it's a bit rundown,

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,060
this is the only inn in town.

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,780
We can only stay here for now.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,110
(Oh, no.)

36
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,560
(The original plot of the family
being wiped out is gone.)

37
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,500
(Dowager Consort Zhao's
Invisible Golden Toad)

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,270
(has been dealt with in Taicang County.)

39
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,600
(The main characters don't need)

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,980
(to go to the Imperial Capital.)

41
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,390
(The main storyline is off-track.)

42
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,770
(What should I do?)

43
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,780
It's nothing.

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,100
Having a place to stay is much better

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,110
than last year

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,030
when we had nowhere to stay
in the snowy grounds

47
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,030
of Dongquan Valley,

48
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,500
hunting the Leopard Demon.

49
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,230
Yes.

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,530
This place is very nice,

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,620
simple and serene.

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,970
Please, come inside.

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,910
Please come in.

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Let's go.

55
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,550
Please.

56
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,100
Lin Yu,

57
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
what's wrong?

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,550
You've been listless

59
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,100
since we got off the boat.

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,990
I'm fine.

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,290
Is it the food not to your liking?

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,620
No, not at all.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,200
It's fine.

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,670
Guests.

65
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,950
Waiter,

66
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,760
do you have any fine rice
and white flour?

67
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,410
Can you bring some exquisite dishes?

68
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,850
I'm really sorry.

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,850
Our place is remote,

70
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,180
and we can't supply good stuff.

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,460
It's okay.

72
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,760
Eating coarse grains is good.

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,900
It's healthy.

74
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,690
Thank you for understanding.

75
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,430
Your dishes are all here.

76
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,410
Call me if you need me.

77
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,670
Enjoy your meal.

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Please enjoy.

79
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,710
Sister Mu Yao,

80
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,730
we rarely get to go out.

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,660
I want to see more of the world.

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,950
Look, it's so calm and peaceful here,

83
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,900
not even a shadow of a demon in sight.

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,910
How about we go to Imperial...

85
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,750
No demons?

86
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,140
Who said that?

87
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,820
During your stay here,

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,230
please don't wander

89
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,370
into the deep bamboo forest at the back.

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,260
Why? Is there a demon inside?

91
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,170
There's a big demon.

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,290
It skins and eats people.

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,350
Demons don't eat human flesh.

94
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,530
This one, though, eats people.

95
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,430
For demons,

96
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,790
human flesh is sour and smelly,

97
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,830
not fit for consumption.

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,220
Well, maybe

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,610
it has unique tastes.

100
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,700
Do you know someone

101
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,160
who was eaten by that demon?

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,910
Not that I know of.

103
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,900
I've only heard stories,

104
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,590
but I'm not making things up.

105
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,960
The villagers say so.

106
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,030
Two years ago, a guest got drunk

107
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,440
and accidentally wandered
into the bamboo forest.

108
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,190
Guess what he saw?

109
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,340
What did he see?

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,730
Skulls and bones everywhere,

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,020
and human skin.

112
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,170
Those were the people it had eaten.

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,490
Some even went mad from fear,

114
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,930
scrambling back to safety.

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,050
But don't be afraid.

116
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,100
Just don't go deep
into the bamboo forest.

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,340
That man-eating demon

118
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,900
never leaves the bamboo forest.

119
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,870
Of course,

120
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,990
I also know

121
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,290
some martial arts.

122
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,140
I can protect you.

123
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,790
You'd better can.

124
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,490
You have quite the nerve.

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
Don't be scared.

126
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,290
The folks in this peaceful area

127
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,140
love to spin these strange tales

128
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,930
for entertainment over meals.

129
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,490
Besides, if there really is a demon,

130
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,460
we'll just catch it.

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,420
(Nanke Inn)

132
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
Sister Mu Yao,

133
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,600
I heard the Imperial Capital has

134
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
super delicious gourd chicken
and golden silk cake,

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,850
and many other fun places.

136
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,700
How about we go
to the Imperial Capital together?

137
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,170
Lin Yu,

138
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,320
I know this place is a bit rundown,

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,560
and you've been suffering.

140
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,410
But the life of a Demon Catcher
is like this.

141
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,970
It might even be harder in the future.

142
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,970
I'm not afraid of hardship.

143
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,930
Even if we go to the Imperial Capital,
it's not for fun.

144
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,700
If there are demons,
they must be dealt with promptly.

145
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,100
Yes, yes, yes.

146
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,780
Sister Mu, please sit.

147
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,360
Isn't that just perfect?

148
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,120
We can work and have fun.

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,700
Besides, I heard the Imperial Capital
has the Astronomical Bureau

150
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,140
guarded by ancient divine weapons.

151
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,780
Ordinary demons don't dare
to cause trouble.

152
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,660
It's not that simple.

153
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,850
Ordinary demons don't dare
to act recklessly there,

154
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,530
but the more complicated
the human heart,

155
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,700
the more likely it is
to hide evil demons.

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,710
You don't have any magic skills.

157
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,490
We may not be able to protect you.

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,660
It's fine.

159
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,560
You all are so capable.

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,950
If there are demons nearby
that are a threat to me,

161
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,480
you'll definitely sense it.

162
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,360
You can tell me.

163
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,640
I'll just run away.

164
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
Demon Catchers are merely

165
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,780
mortals who have magic skills.

166
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,100
Without weapons and talismans,

167
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,100
our bodies and senses are
no different from ordinary people.

168
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,660
High-level demons above the fifth rank

169
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,170
can conceal their demonic aura,

170
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,170
making them hard to detect.

171
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,340
Sister Mu,

172
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,100
I really am not afraid of demons.

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,220
Just take me there.

174
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,310
No way.

175
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,140
Since you're with us,

176
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,460
I must ensure everyone's safety,

177
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,580
especially yours.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,250
You must listen to me on this.

179
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,630
How about this?

180
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,410
Let's stay at this inn for a while,

181
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,000
and I'll teach you some magic skills.

182
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,610
Once you can protect yourself,

183
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,710
I'll take you to the Imperial Capital.

184
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
Really?

185
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,270
That would be great! No problem!

186
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,450
I'll study hard.

187
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Fuyi.

188
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,610
It's nothing.

189
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,320
There's a courtyard between our rooms.

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,160
It's nothing?

191
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,590
You just made the beds for Miss Lin

192
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,890
and Sheng,

193
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,750
adding bedding for them,

194
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,180
but you didn't take care of yours.

195
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,880
Yao,

196
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,420
you're not alone anymore.

197
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,540
You can be a bit spoiled.

198
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,100
I'll go ask the innkeeper
for some hot water.

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Fuyi,

200
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,230
why do I feel like

201
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,540
you've been

202
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,970
a bit different lately?

203
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,890
Perhaps it's the peace lately.

204
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,970
I haven't relaxed like this
in a long time.

205
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,220
You must be tired, so rest early.

206
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,160
Sister,

207
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,020
are you really going to teach her
about magic skills?

208
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Of course.

209
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,940
From now on, Lin Yu will be
our companion on this journey.

210
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,050
She has to learn.

211
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,770
She?

212
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,730
Can she really learn?

213
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,770
You weren't born knowing this, were you?

214
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,060
I'll teach her.

215
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,890
No, no.

216
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,970
I'd rather learn from Sister Mu.

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,540
My sister doesn't have
that much free time.

218
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll do it.

219
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Alright.

220
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,850
Since you said it,

221
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,540
I'm leaving Lin Yu

222
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,700
in your hands.

223
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,560
You must teach her well

224
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,280
and not bully her, understand?

225
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,490
Don't worry, Sister.

226
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,770
How could I bully her?

227
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,060
Right?

228
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,060
Master, Master.

229
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,370
When are you planning
to teach me magic skills?

230
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Tomorrow.

231
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,010
Why tomorrow?

232
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,730
Because breakfast today wasn't tasty,

233
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,320
and it put me in a bad mood.

234
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,630
What if the weather is bad tomorrow?

235
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,540
Will that affect your mood too?

236
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,010
Maybe.

237
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,400
You never intended to teach me

238
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,550
magic skills at all, right?

239
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,850
Right.

240
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,890
I didn't plan to teach you magic skills

241
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,220
because I haven't figured
your background out

242
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,970
and don't want you
to stay with my sister.

243
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,580
How can you break your promise?

244
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,340
Young Master Mu,

245
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,040
you were the one who offered

246
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,650
to teach me in front of Sister Mu.

247
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,540
If Sister Mu asks,

248
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,850
and I still can't do anything,

249
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,180
let's see how you explain that.

250
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,540
Master, have you changed your mind?

251
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,970
Spark.

252
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,120
Explode!

253
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,000
Understand?

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,180
Yes...

255
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,850
I think.

256
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,610
Spark?

257
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,800
Practice it.

258
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,230
Wait, the Spark

259
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,500
is your family's secret skill.

260
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,460
Jumping into difficult
magic skills right away?

261
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,360
You think too highly of me.

262
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
Isn't there something simpler

263
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,990
and more basic

264
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,230
that I could learn right away?

265
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,460
Who's the teacher here, you or me?

266
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,430
You.

267
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,420
Then stop talking.

268
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,070
Master,

269
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,910
you just demonstrated it once.

270
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,580
I didn't have time to see it.

271
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,490
Can you do it again?

272
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,890
Watch closely.

273
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,920
Spark. Explode!

274
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,180
Spark.

275
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
Explode!

276
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,460
Spark. Explode!

277
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,750
Spark.

278
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,590
Explode!

279
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,230
What's wrong?

280
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,130
Why is there no fire at all?

281
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,880
You're so slow.

282
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,080
How am I slow?

283
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,700
You taught me this.

284
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,470
Right.

285
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,010
You need a magical weapon

286
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,730
to cast it.

287
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,870
Why didn't you say so...

288
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,400
I know.

289
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,940
You've thought about it.

290
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,420
You want me to practice the basics.

291
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,890
If I need a magical weapon,

292
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,340
can I borrow your Demon Staff?

293
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,710
No way.

294
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,100
Let me find you a weapon.

295
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,850
A weapon...

296
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,130
How about this?

297
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,830
I've infused it with spiritual power.

298
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
Take it.

299
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,560
I'm your first disciple.

300
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,440
As my master,

301
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,630
how can you give me this
as my first magical weapon?

302
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,110
You're so dismissive of me.

303
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,380
How about a water tank instead?

304
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,960
Can you even lift that?

305
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,250
(Don't get upset.)

306
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,610
(Life is like a play.)

307
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,850
(People gather because of fate.)

308
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,030
(If I get upset, who will be happy?)

309
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,580
(Looking back,
would it even be necessary?)

310
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,960
Spark.

311
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,800
Explode!

312
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,540
What are you doing shaking your head?

313
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,650
I'm reciting the spell quietly.

314
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,300
Don't get it wrong.

315
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,090
You're holding a magical weapon.

316
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,430
If you recite it wrong,
the spiritual power will backfire.

317
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,340
I won't waste my energy saving you.

318
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,830
Spark. Explode!

319
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,490
Always dismissive of everyone.

320
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,970
What are you saying?

321
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,130
Keep practicing.

322
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,770
I'm exhausted.

323
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,840
I've been at it all day

324
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,300
and haven't learned anything.

325
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,700
Mu Sheng is so annoying.

326
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,580
If it keeps going like this,

327
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,460
when will I ever get
to the Imperial Capital?

328
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,710
Mu Sheng hates me now.

329
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,490
He definitely won't teach me properly.

330
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,270
Looks like I need
to improve his favorability

331
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,890
towards me first.

332
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,130
Mu Sheng is my master now.

333
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,100
My master.

334
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,590
How wonderful!

335
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,310
In novels and dramas,

336
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,350
master and disciple always

337
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,130
develop feelings for each other.

338
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,210
Let me formulate a plan.

339
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:00,020
(Strategy Handbook)

340
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,420
(Strategy Handbook)

341
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,260
What are you doing in my room?

342
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,130
Master, you're back
from morning practice.

343
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,720
Look.

344
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,510
(No matter how aloof the master is,)

345
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,160
(they can't resist a sweet disciple.)

346
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,340
(I'm gonna nail it.)

347
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,150
What kind of formation
are you setting up?

348
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,480
I...

349
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,540
Master,

350
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,710
I just wanted to help you make the bed,

351
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,750
but you finished it yourself.

352
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,510
I didn't have any space
to show my skills,

353
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,600
so I specially made
these ornaments for you.

354
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,260
Aren't they cute?

355
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,450
I hate it when others touch my bed,

356
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,170
especially after I've made it.

357
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,890
But I meant well.

358
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,040
These ornaments

359
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,470
are only found in the highest-end inns,

360
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,690
especially this elephant.

361
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,130
It's super hard to fold.

362
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,020
Do you like it?

363
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,800
What did you do?

364
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,650
From now on, don't touch

365
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,520
anything

366
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,450
in my room.

367
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,780
Favorability change detected.

368
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,850
Character Mu Sheng's
current favorability

369
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,470
towards you is -26%.

370
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,950
It's been decreased by 1%.

371
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,310
- Forget it.
- Stop there.

372
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,100
Sweep up the ashes.

373
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,930
Why should I sweep up
the ashes you burned?

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,210
Favorability change detected.

375
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,480
Character Mu Sheng's

376
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,460
current favorability towards you

377
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,890
is -27%.

378
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,330
It's been decreased by 1%.

379
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,650
Alright, Master.

380
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,360
I admit my mistake.

381
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,340
I shouldn't have talked back to you.

382
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,000
Sweep it up.

383
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,980
(Nanke Inn)

384
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,690
Master, wait.

385
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,820
Master, please sit.

386
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,930
Master, have some tea.

387
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,830
Continue practicing.

388
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,020
Master, didn't you see
it's raining outside?

389
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,480
Why don't you teach me
some theoretical knowledge

390
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,100
about Demon Catchers today?

391
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,580
Otherwise,

392
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,740
for a novice like me,

393
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,580
it's just too difficult.

394
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,610
What do you want to know?

395
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,130
Anything is okay.

396
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,710
Demon Catchers in the world

397
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,140
are divided into seven levels

398
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,530
(Heavenly, Earthly, Black, Yellow)
based on their strength.

399
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,740
Heavenly, Earthly, Black, and Yellow.

400
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,500
Aren't these four characters?

401
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,440
Continue.

402
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,330
There are superior and inferior catchers
for Earthly, Black and Yellow levels.

403
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,240
The cultivation

404
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,920
of Yellow Inferior catchers
is the worst.

405
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,160
They can only deal with small
and unenlightened demons.

406
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,450
The Heavenly rank has no divisions.

407
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,130
Heavenly Demon Catchers can wield
top magical weapons,

408
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,510
and single-handedly
eliminate all demons.

409
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,920
They can even open illusion spaces,

410
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,990
reverse time,

411
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,270
construct void worlds,

412
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,810
and avoid the catastrophe of heaven.

413
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,210
Who are the Heavenly Demon Catchers now?

414
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,780
None.

415
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,540
None?

416
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,960
Nine hundred years ago,
as the ancestor of the Mu family,

417
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,610
Mu Qingshi was the first Demon Catcher

418
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,790
and so far

419
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,270
the only Heavenly Demon Catcher.

420
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,270
It is said that one must defeat
a ninth-rank demon

421
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,270
and obtain its inner core

422
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,500
to channel its spiritual power
through the meridians

423
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,900
and ascend to the Heavenly level.

424
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,130
That's so difficult.

425
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,020
No wonder there aren't many
Heavenly Demon Catchers.

426
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,480
However,

427
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,610
over twenty years ago,

428
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,480
the Astronomical Bureau had a prophecy

429
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,820
that the next Heavenly Demon Catcher
would soon appear.

430
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,640
All the cultivators
in the world were eager,

431
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,880
hoping it would be themselves.

432
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,580
Later,

433
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,060
the Resentful Woman, Queen of Demons,
indeed reappeared,

434
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,710
slaughtering the Mu family,
who's known for demon catching,

435
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,100
and all cultivators fell silent.

436
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,720
To this day,

437
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,990
no one knows

438
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,610
who the prophecy refers to.

439
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,440
So, if Sister Mu defeats
the Resentful Woman

440
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,030
and obtains her demon core,

441
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,160
would she become

442
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,410
a Heavenly Demon Catcher?

443
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,390
Yes.

444
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,110
Then I bet
the next Heavenly Demon Catcher

445
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,980
is either Sister Mu or Brother Liu.

446
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,260
Can't it be me?

447
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,260
You?

448
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,260
Master, what's your rank?

449
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,650
Black Superiority.

450
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,200
Black?

451
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,980
The fourth rank from the bottom?

452
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,930
What do you know?

453
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,300
Most Demon Catchers
spend their entire lives

454
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,100
only reaching Yellow Superiority.

455
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,450
Very few can reach the Black level.

456
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,440
Those at the Earthly level

457
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,840
are very rare.

458
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,500
Most have trained for half their lives
with gray hair.

459
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
So,

460
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,850
what's Brother Liu's rank?

461
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,100
Earthly Inferiority.

462
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,830
He's not that amazing.

463
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,370
He's a few years older than you.

464
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,410
Do you still want to practice?

465
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,160
Alright.

466
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,930
I'll just practice the hand gestures.

467
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,550
Spark.

468
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,550
Explode!

469
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Spark.

470
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,680
Explode!

471
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,720
Master,

472
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
can you demonstrate a few more times?

473
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,870
This is too difficult.

474
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,980
I've shown you several times.

475
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,710
You can't do it
because your basics aren't solid.

476
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,830
When casting, your mind is unsettled,

477
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,950
and your breath is unstable.

478
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,310
You're so slow.

479
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,200
You always call me slow.

480
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,210
But I really am slow.

481
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,640
Can you share some

482
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,370
basic knowledge or tips with me?

483
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,780
Progress prompt:

484
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,900
Favorability change detected.

485
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,790
Your target Mu Sheng's

486
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,790
favorability towards you

487
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,180
has decreased to -28%.

488
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,050
I got it, Master.

489
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,560
I'll practice; don't worry about me.

490
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,580
Spark. Explode!

491
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,920
Progress prompt:

492
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,680
Favorability change detected.

493
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,200
Your target Mu Sheng's

494
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
favorability towards you

495
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,580
has decreased to -29%.

496
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,310
Master, I'm already practicing.

497
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,830
Why are you still unhappy with me?

498
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,400
What did I do to annoy you?

499
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,820
Before you learn it,

500
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,300
don't call me Master.

501
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,060
It's embarrassing.

502
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,170
Okay, Mas...

503
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,830
Master.

504
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,170
Spark. Explode!

505
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,580
Spark. Explode!

506
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,060
Spark.

507
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,440
Explode!

508
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,540
I wish Mu Sheng were here to see this.

509
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,300
Spark.

510
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,440
Explode!

511
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,060
Spark.

512
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,650
It's raining?

513
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,020
A mere fifth-rank demon dares

514
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,370
to act wild in front of me.

515
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,550
Demon Catcher,

516
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,950
(Water Demon King)
I know I'm no match for you.

517
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,690
But all I want is
a little blood from you.

518
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,580
I don't need much,

519
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,450
just a bamboo tube's volume.

520
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,650
You know quite a lot.

521
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,410
Can I exchange her life for it?

522
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,850
With her?

523
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,690
She is your disciple.

524
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,060
Don't you care about her life?

525
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,120
If I really cared about her,

526
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,210
you wouldn't have any chance
to touch her.

527
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,940
(Nanke Inn)

528
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,640
Mu Sheng, I thought
you wouldn't come to save me.

529
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,850
If you die,
how will I explain it to Sister?

530
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,300
What a sweet smell of blood.

531
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,390
Wait.

532
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,500
This isn't just the pure yin blood.

533
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,580
It's also the scent of demon blood.

534
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,130
You're a demon.

535
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,500
(Mu Sheng is just a half-demon.)

536
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,490
(But isn't this secret)

537
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,640
(only going to be revealed
at the end of the novel?)

538
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,170
(Why is it being revealed now?)

539
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,820
How ridiculous.

540
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,510
As a Demon Catcher

541
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,370
adopted by the Mu family,
you're actually a demon.

542
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,890
Nonsense.

543
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,980
You're looking for death.

544
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,000
Sheng?

545
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,210
Lin Yu?

546
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,980
Heaven-Earth Reversal.

547
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,310
Reverse!

548
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,780
(Reflection Domain)

549
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,040
Sheng?

550
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,370
Lin Yu?

551
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,960
Sheng?

552
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,890
Lin Yu?

553
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,910
Where are they?

554
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,280
Sheng?

555
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,450
The inside and outside overlap
but do not connect.

556
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,210
This is the Reflection Domain.

557
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,410
You used a Reversal Talisman.

558
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,640
Isn't the Mu family known
as an upright faction?

559
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,740
How could you use a Reversal Talisman?

560
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,540
Sorry to disappoint you.

561
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,060
I'm not a member of the Mu family.

562
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,100
I'm just Mu Yao's brother.

563
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,750
Could it be that your sister,

564
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,450
the master of the Mu family,
still doesn't know?

565
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,310
You even used a Reversal Talisman

566
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,920
to pull me into the Reflection Domain,

567
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,600
fearing that your sister would discover

568
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,930
your true identity as a demon.

569
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,100
I said

570
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,930
I was not a demon!

571
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,400
You can deceive others, but not me.

572
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,410
I'm a Water Demon.

573
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,200
I know exactly how much demonic aura

574
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,340
is in your blood.

575
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,110
I am

576
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,100
not a demon!

577
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,630
You Demon Catchers need
the Four Phase Technique

578
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,170
to concentrate and hold your breath
to cast spells,

579
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,650
but demons don't need to.

580
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,110
Everything in the Reflection Domain

581
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,540
is the opposite of the outside world.

582
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,320
In here,

583
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,290
your heart and breath will be chaotic.

584
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,720
Even if you can cast spells,

585
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,540
your ability will only be
at ten percent.

586
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,380
Right now,

587
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,100
you're even weaker
than a Yellow Inferior Demon Catcher.

588
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,610
It only takes

589
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,730
ten percent to deal with you.

590
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,440
As a great Black Demon Catcher,

591
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,500
you're still using
such a low-level weapon.

592
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,210
As a demon,

593
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,290
you debase yourself
to please Demon Catchers.

594
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,190
You'd rather die
in the Reflection Domain

595
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,100
than let her know your secret.

596
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,210
It seems you know
that humans won't believe demons.

597
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,580
If so,

598
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,210
why live so humiliated,

599
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,730
hiding so much?

600
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,770
I advise you to face reality early.

601
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
If she finds out you're a demon,

602
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,380
she will only eliminate you.

603
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,770
Mu Sheng, don't listen to him!

604
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,330
Mu Sheng! Mu Sheng!

605
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,610
Mu Sheng!

606
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,510
Shut up!

607
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,290
Since you want to die,

608
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,210
then I'll grant your wish.

609
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,290
Give it back!

610
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,870
Mu Sheng!

611
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,580
Why are you bleeding so much?

612
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,110
The Water Demon King is dead.

613
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,020
Open the zone, and let's leave here.

614
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,330
I don't have the strength anymore.

615
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,720
No, no!

616
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,020
Hold on!

617
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,940
Here,

618
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,900
I couldn't cast much magic,

619
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,680
and now

620
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,900
my breath is chaotic.

621
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,430
Yao,

622
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,380
did you hear any noises?

623
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,330
Did you see Lin Yu and Sheng?

624
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,870
Don't worry.

625
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,100
Let's search separately.

626
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,420
Aren't you Demon Catchers supposed
to have many treasures?

627
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,240
Do you have any healing medicine?

628
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Any elixir?

629
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,130
Do you have any?

630
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,620
This bead...

631
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,330
Why is this bead sucking your blood?

632
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,380
Be quiet.

633
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,980
Listen to me.

634
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,580
Put this talisman on yourself.

635
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,170
At noon,
when the sunlight shines directly,

636
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,580
and you have no shadow under your feet,

637
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,650
it can help you leave here.

638
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,210
Once you get out,

639
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,900
give all the blood

640
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,850
to my sister.

641
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,240
All the blood?

642
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,380
What do you mean?

643
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,900
My blood.

644
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,330
Everyone wants it,

645
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,730
but I only want to give it to my sister.

646
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,940
Please tell my sister

647
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,730
that no matter if she recognizes me
as her brother,

648
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,130
I will always consider her my sister.

649
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,440
Mu Sheng,

650
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,540
are you saying your last words?

651
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,630
Don't say that.

652
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,100
We can definitely get out.

653
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,290
If you don't help me,

654
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,980
I'll tear this talisman.

655
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,150
Then you won't be able
to get out either.

656
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,990
Then we...

657
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,940
See? I can't get out either now.

658
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,730
No one will deliver blood for you,

659
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,470
and no one will pass
the message for you.

660
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,670
I'm telling you,
all this blood will be for nothing.

661
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,110
We have to leave together.

662
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,290
Living like this

663
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,650
is really boring.

664
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,500
This is the best outcome,

665
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,650
isn't it?

666
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,980
My sister can get my blood,

667
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,730
enhance her cultivation,

668
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,420
and fight against the Resentful Woman.

669
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,980
If she knows I'm a half-demon,

670
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,900
no one in this world

671
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,420
will be too heartbroken

672
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,130
over my death.

673
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,810
Mu Sheng, you fool.

674
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,940
In this world,

675
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,500
it's not just Sister Mu Yao
who cares about you.

676
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,860
I do too.

677
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,100
So what if you're a demon?

678
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,030
No matter who you are, I care about you.

679
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,130
You must live.

680
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,460
Even if I am

681
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,580
a demon?

682
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,990
It doesn't matter that you're a demon.

683
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,730
I still want you to live.

684
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,920
Just tell me.

685
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,900
