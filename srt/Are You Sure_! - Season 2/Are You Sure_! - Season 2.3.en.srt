00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,394
PREVIOUSLY ON...

3
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,897
Jimin, wait for me.

4
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:34,434
THEY START DAY 2 IN SWITZERLAND
WITH WATER SPORTS

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,069
Loads of shallots.

6
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,406
TODAY, I'M THE CHEF

7
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,308
ENJOYING JUNG KOOK'S COOKING

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,277
JIMIN'S HEARTY APPETITE

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,579
FEELING PROUD WATCHING HIM EAT SO WELL

10
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,881
A YUTNORI MATCH AGAINST THE STAFF

11
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,783
CALLING HIMSELF YUT GOD

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,653
MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,087
Do, we need a Do.

14
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,155
Oh!

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,824
YUT GOD JIMIN BLESSES THE GAME

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,693
EARNS ALLOWANCE WITH EASE

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,528
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION

ENDING THE DAY FEELING GREAT

19
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,568
ON DAY 3 IN SWITZERLAND,
THEY GO TO FURKA PASS

20
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,872
EXCHANGING GREETINGS WITH SOME COOL RIDERS

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,274
UNFORGETTABLE MEMORIES MADE

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,010
BUT THE JOY IS SHORT-LIVED...
TRAIN IS ABOUT TO LEAVE

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,078
Let's go.

24
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,714
BARELY MADE IT IN TIME

25
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,082
Where's our destination?

26
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,217
THE SECOND STOP OF THEIR TRIP

27
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,687
ZERMATT, THE MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS' PARADISE

28
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:32,259
ANOTHER EATING BINGE IN THE SECOND TOWN

29
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,362
[Jung Kook] Jimin really enjoyed that.

30
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,197
THEIR TRIP IN ZERMATT BEGINS NOW

31
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,133
WALKING TO THEIR LODGING
TO WALK THE MEAL OFF

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,268
I'm so full.

33
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,237
After eating...

34
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,207
Ugh.

35
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,347
The breeze feels so nice.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,217
THE NIGHT IS JUST PERFECT

37
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,552
-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,191
I don't know if it's because
of the buildings and all that,

39
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,895
but even though there aren't many people,
it feels kind of festive.

40
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,899
[Jimin sighs]

41
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,267
The night feels so good.

42
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,836
I love the night here.

43
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,939
I feel really good.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,476
Don't you think going over there
would be healing?

45
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,678
I'll pass by there.

46
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,381
I need to recharge my energy.

47
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,882
Me too.

48
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,684
-[in English] Heal.
-[in English] Heal.

49
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,619
Heal.

50
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,954
ENERGY FULLY RECHARGED

51
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,256
-[in Korean] Energy restored.
-[in Korean] Yeah.

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,426
-This is nice.
-Right?

53
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,161
Why is everything so colorful?

54
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,596
Right now...

55
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,338
But, seriously,
this place is so beautiful.

56
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,741
It just has a vibe
that makes you feel good.

57
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:59,546
If I ever come on a personal trip
next time,

58
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,281
I think I'd come here.

59
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,752
Yeah. I actually looked up places
a few days ago.

60
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,522
-Yeah.
-It kept showing up as a must-visit spot.

61
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,691
It's beautiful. Worth the trip.

62
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,994
The lighting at this hour is just perfect.

63
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,863
And not too crowded.

64
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,334
[both sniffing]

65
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,537
-Love it. Right.
-Smells like night air.

66
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,806
The scent of grass.

67
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,211
[Jung Kook] We're here?
Wish we'd walked 10 more minutes.

68
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,013
-Way closer than I thought.
-Yes.

69
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,983
[in English] Yes.

70
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,519
-By the way...
-Yes.

71
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,321
I feel hot now.

72
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,623
-Huh?
-I feel hot.

73
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,992
I'm heading to the balcony.

74
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,361
-[in Korean] The balcony? Let's go.
-Let's go.

75
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,463
Let's go!

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,368
Wow, this is...

77
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,438
-It's nice!
-Right?

78
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,174
Can the camera capture this?
I should rotate it a bit.

79
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:05,979
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK'S POV

80
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,049
Whoa.

81
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,350
[Jung Kook] This is insane.

82
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,119
Can pictures even capture this?

83
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,256
[Jimin] Honestly, I don't think
even this video captures it.

84
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,662
Yeah, that's similar to the view
we're seeing right now.

85
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,533
But it looks a bit darker on camera.

86
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,936
Man, this is truly incredible.

87
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,772
[camera shutter clicking]

88
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,879
It only captures my face.

89
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,814
HIS FEATURES STEAL THE SCENE

90
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,185
-Wow, this is absolutely breathtaking.
-Totally.

91
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,720
DIFFERENT FROM THE DAY

92
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,290
[Jung Kook] But it never looks quite
as good as it does in person.

93
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,026
-[Jimin] Yeah, this place especially.
-Right.

94
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,095
Actually, you know...

95
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,863
On camera,

96
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,900
it might look like
just grass and mountains.

97
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,736
-But seeing it feels totally different.
-Yeah.

98
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,204
-[Jung Kook] Stunning.
-Yeah.

99
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,672
[Jung Kook] Totally different.

100
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,408
But you know what I think?

101
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,145
To be honest,
things here are pretty pricey,

102
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,182
but I think you're definitely paying
for the view.

103
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,249
-For the view?
-Yeah.

104
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,120
-They've preserved nature so well.
-Right.

105
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,788
Take another look.

106
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,356
Keep looking, enjoy it.

107
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,791
[laughs]

108
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,661
[Jung Kook] Wow,
Switzerland is really beautiful.

109
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,629
[Jimin] Glad we came here.

110
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,068
THEY SPEND A LONG TIME
JUST ENJOYING THE VIEW

111
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,037
-[Jimin] Should we call him?
-Yeah.

112
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,739
[Jimin] Still working, huh?

113
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,509
-You're in Switzerland, right?
-[man on phone] Yeah.

114
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,977
I'm in Switzerland, too.

115
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,813
Think we'll get to see each other
before you leave?

116
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,648
I'm heading to Paris tomorrow.

117
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,483
Oh, so we won't be able to meet.

118
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,286
Would've been so much more fun
if you were here.

119
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,122
You kept telling me
about Switzerland, remember?

120
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,024
That it was beautiful and I had to come.

121
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,760
-Isn't it nice here?
-It's amazing.

122
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,196
But you came during winter, right?

123
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,966
Yeah, it was winter.

124
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,802
Now that I'm here,
I want to visit in winter, too.

125
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,405
Yeah, but if you come in winter,
you'll have to shovel snow.

126
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,841
WINTER MEANS SNOW SHOVELING

127
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,643
Okay, fair point.

128
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,678
I mean, summer's the right season.

129
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,313
[Jimin laughing]

130
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,551
Yeah, summer's perfect.

131
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,620
Listen. I'm sorry, but...

132
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,256
-Can you say a word to the viewers?
-Dear viewers...

133
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,224
Dear viewers...

134
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,626
TO. OUR VIEWERS

135
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,727
...are you sure?!

136
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,930
I'm sure.

137
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,033
Yeah, we were thinking the same.

138
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,036
All right. Have fun and get home safely.

139
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,338
Jung Kook says bye, too.

140
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,673
Take care.

141
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,911
AFTER A SHORT CALL WITH RM

142
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,713
[Jimin] What should we do now? Dance?

143
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,715
LEARNING THE "KILLIN' IT GIRL" CHALLENGE

144
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,218
Should we have another glass of wine?

145
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,186
Or should we practice?

146
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,588
Go ahead if you want.

147
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,024
-What?
-I'm already feeling just right.

148
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,592
NOT WHAT HE WANTED

149
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,660
Practice?

150
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,928
Do whatever you want.

151
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,696
I kind of want to do both.

152
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,964
Rock-paper-scissors?

153
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,499
If you win, we'll drink wine.

154
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,034
-Wine?
-Just one glass.

155
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,704
If I win, we'll practice a bit
and go to bed.

156
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,838
Okay.

157
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,241
Rock, paper, scissors.

158
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,477
Guess we're practicing.

159
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,347
CRASH COURSE
FOR THE "KILLIN' IT GIRL" CHALLENGE

160
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,150
Step right, left, right,

161
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,752
Right-left-right, left-right-left.

162
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,321
One, two, and...

163
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,592
[indistinct conversation]

164
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,361
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

165
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,330
Harder than I thought.

166
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,564

167
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:50,036

NAILING EVERY DETAIL PRECISELY

170
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,250
-Smoothly?
-Just like this.

171
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,752
Yes.

172
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,593

173
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,765
PRACTICE OVER

174
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,833
Good.

175
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,534
-Good work.
-You too.

176
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:30,143
PRACTICING EVEN WHILE BRUSHING TEETH

177

JUNG KOOK ALSO WATCHES J-HOPE'S VIDEO
WHILE BRUSHING TEETH

178
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,250
So cool.

JIMIN IS ON THE PHONE

and I speak English.

191
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,261
Well, bye.

192
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,163
Why bye?

193
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,334
[in Korean] What the heck?

194
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,837
Why bye?

195
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,540
SUMMONED RIGHT BACK

[AI] I like tea, too.

200
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,483
Do you like pizza?

201
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,819
I like pizza.

202
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,921

204
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,625
I don't wanna... go.

205
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,794

[in Korean] I don't want to sleep yet.

208
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,169
Why are you ending it?

209
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,839
How rude.

210
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,408
[continues practicing English]

211
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:15,115
JUNG KOOK SPENT QUITE A WHILE
STUDYING ENGLISH

212
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,020
GETTING SLEEPY...
THE REST CAN WAIT TILL TOMORROW

213
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,993
AFTER A DAY FILLED WITH PURE JOY

214
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,598

232
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,420
EXCUSE ME?

233

00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,504
Let's go!

237
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,377
STROLLING ABOUT

238
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,014
SCANNING THE MENU QUICKLY FIRST

239
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:59,352
WHILE JUNG KOOK SETS UP BREAKFAST

240
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,921
JIMIN, OF COURSE, IS STILL FAST ASLEEP

241
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:07,460
SUDDENLY JUMPS UP

242
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,330
APPEARS IN A BOLD OOTD

243
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,300
Why do I feel so tired?

244
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,835
Huh?

245
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,070
Your heart's racing?

246
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,473
STARTING THE DAY WITH A GLASS OF MILK
INSTEAD OF COFFEE

247
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,143

00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,137
Where is it? Over here?

257
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,205
TAKES A BITE

258
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,640
Gotta have another one.

259
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,908
Shall we get ready?

260
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,711
Why is that on your head?

261
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,513
My hair's too puffy.

262
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,581
FLUFFY HAIR

263
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,516
So you do care about your looks, huh?

264
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,251
No?

265
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,288
Guess I haven't completely given up yet.

266
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,024
I lost my faith now.

267
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,493
-What?
-There's more food.

268
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,962

Mmm!

272
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
Good?

273
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,208
EATING SO WELL

274
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,977
Could you spread some for me?

275
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,314
KEEPS SLIPPING AWAY

276
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,549
Why does it keep slipping
when it's for you?

277
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,817
[both laugh]

278
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,721
I was actually being serious this time.

279
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,223
-Isn't that how you really feel?
-No.

280
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,291
No?

281
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,793
No.

282
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,028
CROISSANT ASMR

283
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,096
It's crunchy, right?

284
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,366
Tastes good, huh?

285
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,337
We really need to get ready. Oh boy.

286
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,373
DOING THE OPPOSITE

287
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,609
This one's blueberry jam.

288
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,979
DOWNING THE LAST GLASS OF MILK

289
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:11,284
WRAPPING UP WITH A BLUEBERRY JAM CROISSANT

290
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,487
We don't have much time. Hurry!

291
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:19,225
AFTER A SOLID BREAKFAST,
IT'S TIME TO GET READY

292
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,595

293
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,598

PARAGLIDING, DINNER,
VISITING A PUB

295
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,136
HEADING OUT TO RIDE THE KICKBIKES

296
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,204
It's automatic.

297
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,739
Let's get in.

298
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,144
A mini bus.

299
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,980
THIS ELECTRIC TAXI THEY'RE RIDING NOW

300
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,550
IS PART OF THE ECO-FRIENDLY
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN ZERMATT

301
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,786
A CLEAN VILLAGE SURROUNDED BY MATTERHORN

302
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,722
WHERE INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES
ARE BANNED TO PROTECT NATURE

303
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,759
How long?

304
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,761
How long does it take?

305
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:58,931
Wow.

306
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,535
-About six minutes from here.
-Six minutes?

307
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,636
That's so close.

308
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,238
Really strong today.

309
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,440
Well?

310
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,742
The sun's really strong.

311
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,414
Looks like we're here.

312
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,184
SUNNEGGA EXPRESS STATION

313
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,585
FROM ZERMATT TO THE VIEWPOINT

314
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,087
1,545 METERS, 32.5-DEGREE SLOPE

315
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,488
REACHES THE TOP IN THREE MINS

316
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,157
BOARDING THE FUNICULAR

317
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,058
It'll be so much fun if it goes up fast.

318
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,828
Then I'm just gonna lie down.

319
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,066
Feels like riding a subway
that's on a steep diagonal.

320
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,869
If I go like this...

321
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,106
TRYING TO BALANCE HIS OWN HORIZON

322
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,407
Now it looks straight.

323
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,611
JUNG KOOK WANTS TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT

324
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,814
It's really fast.

325
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,982
It feels strange.

326
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,486
As we go up, it's like being sucked
into another dimension.

327
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:54,987
The train just...

328
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,255
[imitates whooshing]

329
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,858
Like we're traveling to another world.

330
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,426
[Jung Kook] Almost there.

331
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,595
ARRIVED AT THE VIEWPOINT

332
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,564
[Jung Kook] Hey, we saw
it yesterday, but...

333
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,934
[crew] They say it's actually rare
to get such a clear view.

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,001
[Jung Kook] Really?

335
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,471
-[Jimin] Gotta come when nice out.
-Gotta take a pic.

336
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,972
THE MATTERHORN: 4,478 METERS

337
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,373
GRAND PYRAMID-SHAPED PEAK

338
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,908
MOST ICONIC MOUNTAIN

339
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,244
People visit to see
how sharply it's carved.

340
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,312
Like that?

341
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,080
All made by nature.

342
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,783
And I saw in some photos, at sunset,

343
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,520
one side, not the whole thing,
just this section here...

344
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,355
-Like this?
-Yeah, just that part.

345
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,558
-[Jimin] Only that area turns orange.
-It must look beautiful.

346
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,261
[Jimin] A lot of people come here
to take pictures of it.

347
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,329
[Jung Kook] Really?

348
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,431
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

349
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,499
Come here.

350
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,868
TAKING A PHOTO WITH THE MATTERHORN

351
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,935
Best shot...

352
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,872
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Looks great.

353
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,139
Should I take one for you?

354
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,809
-Want me to take one for you?
-Yes.

355
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,312
Is this right?

356
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,547
[Jung Kook] One second.

357
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,482
-Let me frame it.
-[Jimin laughing]

358
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,150
-Over here?
-No.

359
00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,785
Here?

360
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,987
Hold on, hold on.

361
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,989
HIDDEN EFFORTS BEHIND THE PERFECT SHOT

362
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,925
PHOTO CHECK TIME

363
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,561
[camera shutter clicking]

364
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,330
OFF TO RIDE KICKBIKES

365
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,999
[Jimin] There are no seats, right?

366
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,200
It's a kickbike.

367
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,768
So it's not an electric one.

368
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,837
[Jung Kook] Yeah. Just a downhill ride.

369
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,540
PUTTING ON SAFETY GEAR

370
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,774
Fully secured.

371
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,009
IRONCLAD PROTECTION

372
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,312
JIMIN PUTS ON A HELMET TOO

373
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,581
With this helmet and all,

374
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,550
I can block the sunlight better.

375
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,485
SUNNEGGA TO ZERMATT

376
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,153
Jung Kook, do you want to go first?

377
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,155
-Me?
-I can't go fast.

378
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,290
Okay.

379
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,661
SWITCHING ORDER FOR HIM

380
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,029
If you fall here, that's it.

381
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,230
Let's be careful.

382
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:51,337
JUNG KOOK SLOWLY PICKING UP SPEED

383
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,775
RIDING DOWN WITH THE MATTERHORN IN SIGHT

384
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,979
MEANWHILE, SOMEONE'S STILL
GETTING USED TO IT

385
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,047
[exclaiming]

386
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,982
WOBBLES AT EVERY LITTLE ROCK

387
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,917
Why is there a rock?

388
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,820
GRUNTING

389
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,356
Going down too fast.

390
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,525
[chuckles]

391
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:18,064
MEANWHILE, SOMEONE'S FULLY ENJOYING
THE OFF-ROAD RIDE

392
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,835
SPEED RACER GONE WILD

393
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,005
PURE HAPPINESS

394
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,841
END OF DOWNHILL SECTION

395
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,077
ENTERING THE FLAT COURSE

396
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,578
Gotta use my left leg, too.

397
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,618
KICKING WITH BOTH LEGS
HE'S TRYING HARD, BUT...

398
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,886
This is tiring.

399
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,589
JIMIN ENTERS THE FLAT COURSE TOO

400
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,825
[Jimin grunting]

401
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,760
Riding it like an actual scooter.

402
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,430
Scooter, scooter.

403
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:56,102
NOT A KICKBIKE
A SCOOTER

404
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,005
You have to kick way more than I thought.

405
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,072
Exactly.

406
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,275
[Jimin] Oh, doing it
like this feels faster.

407
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,343
Maybe not?

408
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,313
It'd be nice if there were
more downhill slopes.

409
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,914
Where are the downhills?

410
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,317
Give me a downhill slope, please.

411
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,521
FINALLY...

412
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:19,291
DOWNHILL COURSE BEGINS AGAIN

413
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:24,263
FEELING THE SPEED WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

414
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,666
HAPPINESS RESUMES

415
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,969
AND SO DOES THE STRUGGLE

416
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,305
JUNG KOOK SUDDENLY STOPS

417
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,174
Why?

418
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,776
So I can go even faster.

419
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,278
A STEP BACK FOR A FASTER LEAP FORWARD

420
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,519
CHARGING UP HIS SPEED ENERGY
AND GO!

421
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,321
Whoa!

422
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,057
This is too fast.

423
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,958
Ahh!

424
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,064
MAKES STRANGE NOISES AS HE ZOOMS PAST

425
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,632
SHOUTING

426
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,603
HEHE, THIS IS FUN

427
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,942
STOPS TO CHECK WHERE JIMIN IS

428
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,915
It shakes too much.
It keeps flipping backwards.

429
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,119
FIXING IT UP TO SECURE HIS SOLO SHOT

430
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,187
Shall we go?

431
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,591
BACK TO SQUARE ONE IN FIVE SECONDS

432
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,727
MERCILESS OFF-ROAD TERRAIN

433
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,564
GRUNTING

434
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,169
AFTER LETTING JIMIN GO FIRST,
HE STARTS HIS 2ND PURSUIT

435
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,637
[whooping]

436
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,109
Too fast.

437
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:52,051
OVERTAKES AGAIN AT INSANE SPEED

438
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,787
SAME KICKBIKE, TOTALLY DIFFERENT PACE

439
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,856
[Jung Kook] I should wait
until he's farther.

440
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,159
CALCULATING TIMING FOR MAXIMUM DOPAMINE

441
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,660
This is so fun. So fun.

442
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,898
UNAWARE OF WHAT'S COMING NEXT

443
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,601
THE CHEERFUL LITTLE LAMB

444
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,472
CLOSING IN ON HIM

445
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,541
THE CHASER

446
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,544
AND THE ONE BEING CHASED

447
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,484
ENDING JUST AS EXPECTED

448
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,554
A KICKBIKE TURNS INTO A QUICKBIKE

449
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,856
He's crazy.

450
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:32,858
That was fun.

451
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,961
Yeah, drift.

452
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,196
Like this...

453
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,632
-That's how you do it.
-Wow, you're even drifting?

454
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,669
INSTANTLY TRIES TO COPY

455
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,038
HIS MOVES GETTING FLASHIER

456
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,206
Like this...

457
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,475
Drifting is really fun.

458
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:57,983
KICKBIKE SKILL MASTER

459
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,221
-Drifting is so fun.
-Right?

460
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,056
It actually feels kind of nice.

461
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,724
It's fun.

462
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,161
-[Jung Kook] Let's slow down a bit.
-[in English] Okay.

463
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,134
I was going down like "Eh?"
And you were like...

464
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,669
GRUNTING

465
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,639
IT'S STILL SO FUNNY

466
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,042
[Jung Kook] Why were you
screaming on the way down?

467
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,346
-There were so many rocks earlier.
-Yes.

468
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,815
That's why.

469
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,951
Then why were you doing that?

470
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,421
Sounds like a grandpa.

471
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,291
TOGETHER

472
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,359
Me too.

473
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,561
ENCORE

474
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,496
[Jung Kook] Going down slowly
is fun, too.

475
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,598
[Jimin] Yeah, not bad.

476
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,400
-[Jung Kook] While talking.
-You know, it could be dangerous,

477
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,703
-but also really safe.
-Right.

478
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,839
[Jung Kook] The buildings are beautiful.
I never get tired of them.

479
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,007
HAPPINESS FILLS UP

480
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,843
We're almost there.

481
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,412
Do people usually grab a coffee here?

482
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,219
I know this is the center spot.

483
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,754
My eyes are probably the center.

484
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,189
The center of the frame.

485
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,624
SCRATCHES HEAD

486
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,058
Or maybe not.

487
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,594
-You're right.
-It's kind of iffy.

488
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,198
We can see it better from here.
Why does it look even bigger?

489
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,368
See that? The waterfall.

490
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,503
-That small one over there.
-Yeah.

491
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,406
-It looks slow, but it's super-fast.
-I know.

492
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,775
-You know it's no joke.
-I know.

493
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,978
-You know it's huge, right?
-I know.

494
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,515
If you stand under that...
It's like martial arts training.

495
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,385
It splits into two streams.
One for each of us?

496
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,087
-Around there? Down below?
-Yeah.

497
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,656
-Like martial arts.
-Yeah.

498
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,424
-Like martial arts training?
-Yeah.

499
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,660
[Jimin] If that's
how I can get stronger, sure.

500
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,362
You know, the Matterhorn,

501
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,065
I wonder how big it would look up close.

502
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,433
That? Not that big.

503
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,570
But you said that stream would be massive.

504
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,372
That mountain's way farther away.

505
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,409
-If you stood right between those spots...
-Yeah.

506
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,144
I bet you wouldn't even be visible.

507
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,913
-Even if you jumped.
-Of course not.

508
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,015
[Jung Kook] Totally invisible.

509
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,889
-I took a very special photo.
-What?

510
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,358
Nothing special?

511
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,662
THE MATTERHORN'S NOTHING SPECIAL

512
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,197
-Jimin.
-Thank you.

513
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,700
-Jimin, I hurt my shin.
-Just now?

514
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,834
[groans]

515
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,102
It's bleeding.

516
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,170
-Not much.
-[man] How?

517
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,771
That shin bump...

518
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,573
-[man] From earlier?
-Yeah, yeah.

519
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,141
It's nothing.

520
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,409
It's kind of cute.

521
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,711
Just dust.

522
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,079
SHAKES OFF LIKE DUST

523
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,815
-[Jung Kook] Jimin, shall we head back?
-Sure, sounds good.

524
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,049
[Jung Kook] That was fun.

525
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,884
HEADING BACK TO THE HOTEL

526
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,619
[sighs in relief]

527
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,522
BACK TO THEIR SWEET LODGING

528
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,590
Two, three.

529
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,926
I'll get some rest now.

530
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:54,994
Lie down.

531
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,465
AS TOLD, JUNG KOOK LIES DOWN

532
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,335
Jung Kook disappeared.

533
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,009
WHILE JIMIN SITS AND RESTS ON THE COUCH

534
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,178
JUNG KOOK SLIPS BACK INTO THE ROOM

535
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,781
JIMIN GOES TO FIND HIM

536
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,853
BUT HE'S NOT IN THE ROOM

537
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,990
MAYBE HERE?

538
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,330
JUNG KOOK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

539
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:35,801
LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR HIS YOUNGER MEMBER

540
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:40,172
JUNG KOOK HAS DISAPPEARED

541
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,242
A VOICE HEARD FROM SOMEWHERE

542
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,812
[whispering] Jimin is looking for me
right now.

543
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,082
But...

544
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,284
I'm in another room.

545
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,153
[chuckles]

546
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,856
Will Jimin be able to find me?

547
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,058
Or not?

548
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,326
Where could I be?

549
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,802
2X SPEED

550
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,670
[Jimin] Jung Kook disappeared.

551
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,873
[Jung Kook] I disappeared, apparently.

552
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,375
[man] Where did he go?

553
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,110
[Jimin] Here? No?

554
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,978
[man] Probably not here.
In my room?

555
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,280
[Jimin] He's not here?

556
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,182
-Why would he be in my room?
-He's not?

557
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,883
[man] What? He's here.

558
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,518
-He really was here.
-[laughing]

559
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,820
JUNG KOOK HAS BEEN FOUND

560
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,589
CAUGHT HIDING IN THE STAFF'S ROOM

561
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,325
Could've lasted a bit longer.

562
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:38,430
Maybe I'll take a nap here.

563
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,366
AFTER A CUTE PRANK

564
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,236
JUNG KOOK SLOWLY DRIFTS OFF TO SLEEP

565
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,905
[man] We'll leave in about 40 minutes.

566
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:47,973
[Jimin] Okay.

567
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,643
JIMIN TAKES A REST TOO

568
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,745
RECHARGING ENERGY

569
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,482
FOR THEIR NEXT ACTIVITY

570
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,618
SHAKING OFF THE KICKBIKE FATIGUE
WITH A NAP

571
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,688
TIME TO GO PARAGLIDING

572
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,556
-Wait, we have to run?
-Yeah.

573
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,757
We got to run.

574
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,627
CAMERA IN A RUSH

575
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,095
Big step. One.

576
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,431
One, two.

577
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,932
[Jung Kook] Walk, walk.

578
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,634
QUICKLY HOPPING INTO A TAXI

579
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,437
We're always running late
when we have a train to catch.

580
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,105
It's been quite the spectacle.

581
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,040
Is it just me?

582
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,511
Until the train leaves?

583
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,013
THREE MINUTES LEFT UNTIL TRAIN LEAVES

584
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,915
GORNERGRAT RAILWAY STATION

585
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,083
Are we going to make it?

586
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,187
EYES FILLED WITH ANXIETY

587
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,555
[man in English] Here, here.

588
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,223
[in Korean] Grab the camera.

589
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,625
[Jimin in English] Thank you.

590
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,127
RUSHING FOOTSTEPS

591
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,597
THANKFULLY, THE TRAIN'S STILL WAITING

592
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,668
RUN "ARE YOU SURE?!" PART 2

593
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,271
IN THE MIDST OF TOTAL CHAOS

594
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,940
THEY SAFELY BOARDED THE TRAIN

595
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,643
GORNERGRAT STATION

596
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,710
GORNERGRAT RAILWAY

597
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,346
EUROPE'S HIGHEST OPEN-AIR TRAIN,
BOUND FOR THE GORNERGRAT OBSERVATORY

598
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,715
[in Korean] It takes about 30 minutes.

599
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,950
[Jung Kook] 30 minutes?

600
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,452
What a view.

601
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,688
A VIEW WORTH SAVING

602
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,790
Wow.

603
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,694
This is nice.

604
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,862
[exclaims]

605
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,297
The best!

606
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,601
MEANWHILE...

607
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:25,437
THIS MAN SEEMS LOST IN THE SCENERY

608
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,041
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY LOST IN DREAMLAND

609
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,245
FROM HIS MIRACLE MORNING

610
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,380
[grunting]

611
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,851
TO THE KICKBIKE RIDING

612
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,188
IT'S BEEN QUITE A TOUGH DAY

613
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,323
Too fast.

614
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,759
ENDS UP DOZING OFF

615
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,498
JUNG KOOK NOTICES HIM SLEEPING

616
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,735
ALONE TIME #1
SHOWING OFF THE ARMY LOGO

617
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:00,906
ALONE TIME #2
FILMING THE SCENERY

618
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:05,210
ALONE TIME #3
LOOKING FOR COWS

619
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,580
ALONE TIME #4
FILMING JIMIN SLEEPING

620
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:12,351
I CAN HAVE FUN ALL BY MYSELF

621
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,153
FLUSTERED

622
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,656
I didn't hit the record button.

623
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,292
HE'S BEEN FILMING

624
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,828
EVERYTHING FROM THE HOTEL

625
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,896
TO THE HECTIC TAXI RIDE

626
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,599
WITH THIS CAMERA

627
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,434
Goodness.

628
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,170
FILLED WITH BITTERSWEET EMOTIONS

629
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,240
WHILE HE'S CLUELESSLY ASLEEP

630
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,310
HE'S GETTING BORED

631
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,680
CAPTURING HIM SLEEPING AGAIN

632
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,881
[camera shutter clicks]

633
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:47,185
LAUGHING SILENTLY TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT

634
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,388
-You took a photo of me again?
-Yeah.

635
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,023
But it's cute, isn't it?

636
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,394
Gosh, this is fun.

637
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,129
This is the most fun.

638
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,997
He's kind of smiling right now.

639
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:03,101
ALONE TIME #5
MAKING A HEART WITH JIMIN'S HAND

640
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,304
IT'S SO FUN

641
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,639
SCENERY TOO BEAUTIFUL TO MISS

642
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,908
Whoa.

643
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,044
It's all open?

644
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:20,152
AN OPEN-AIR MOUNTAIN RAILWAY

645
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:23,488
THAT OFFERS A FULL VIEW OF THE MATTERHORN

646
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,957
By the way,
it might be cold up there, right?

647
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,592
-Up there?
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.

648
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,861
Probably super cool rather than cold.

649
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,396
-I think it'll be cool.
-Yeah?

650
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,400
THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK

651
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,071
HAS ALREADY CLIMBED 9.3 KILOMETERS

652
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,574
HEADING TOWARD ITS FINAL DESTINATION

653
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,142
[Jung Kook] They're paragliding.

654
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,278
[Jimin] Remember the last time
we went for it?

655
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,815
But that place wasn't as high up, right?

656
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,084
Right?

657
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,553
This time,
we'll actually be flying for real.

658
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,722
ARRIVED AT ROTENBODEN STATION

659
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,358
It's cool out here.

660
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,093
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

661
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,495
I just saw someone boarding the train

662
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,897
who looked exactly
like my middle school friend.

663
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,332
-Really?
-Yeah.

664
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,903
ROTENBODEN STATION - RIFFELSEE LAKE

665
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,840
We can see snow, yet it's not cold.

666
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,210
By the way, it'd be so nice to come here
for a trip like them.

667
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,980
EVERY STEP, ANOTHER AWE

668
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,349
There's another lake. It's insane.

669
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,017
-[Jimin] Right?
-Unreal.

670
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,786
[Jimin] The whole view looks surreal.

671
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,988
[Jung Kook] It's just unbelievable.

672
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,457
RIFFELSEE LAKE

673
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,327
A HIGH-ALTITUDE LAKE
REFLECTING THE MATTERHORN

674
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,962
A MUST-SEE PHOTO SPOT

675
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,265
This is the mountain

676
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,502
leading up to the Matterhorn in Zermatt.

677
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,437
What do they sell in Zermatt?

678
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,440
-Zermatt is...
-A mart.

679
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,775
They sell beer.

680
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,777
And wine, too.

681
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,947
[sighs] Jung Kook, could you move
the cloud for me?

682
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,183
[Jung Kook] Me? Should I photoshop it?

683
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,718
[Jimin] One, two, three.

684
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,988
-It was there, but now it's gone.
-[Jung Kook] It's gone.

685
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,458
CAN'T HELP BUT BE AMAZED

686
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,526
That's incredible.

687
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,162
You go first.

688
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,229
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,464
THE PHOTO SPOT

690
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,000
I guess you take photos here.

691
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,502
Of the reflection?

692
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,404
-Yeah.
-Wow.

693
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,073
[Jimin] I think you take the photo here.

694
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,844
LET'S ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL VIEW TOGETHER

695
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,146
It's reflecting even clearer here.

696
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,182
This is amazing.

697
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,716
-Let me take one for you.
-Okay.

698
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,851
Jung Kook.

699
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:38,156
PASSIONATE

700
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:42,661
PERFECT SHOT WITH THE MATTERHORN

701
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,664
UNDER THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY

702
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,632
A PHOTO TOGETHER

703
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,969
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER

704
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,472
#SHOUTING FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE MATTERHORN

705
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,440
#GO MATTERHORN

706
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,810
[Jimin] The background
looks unreal, honestly.

707
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,881
[Jung Kook] Feels like we're inside
a Windows wallpaper.

708
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:06,284
THE MAGNIFICENCE ATTRACTS COUNTLESS PEOPLE

709
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,452
Shall we go?

710
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,753
[Jimin] Let's go.

711
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,756
Why not? There's nothing we can't do.

712
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,092
That's the Matterhorn.

713
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,594
It's getting bigger and bigger.

714
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,497
It's painfully beautiful.

715
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,833
The scenery surrounding us...

716
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,335
You know?

717
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,569
[chuckles]

718
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,238
That was kind of cute just now.

719
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,772
"You know?"

720
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,676
-The scenery surrounding us...
-Surrounding us...

721
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:32,744
-You know?
-You know?

722
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:34,779
[Jimin] You know?

723
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,481
That scared me.

724
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,287
Going downhill is kind of tough.

725
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,389
[panting]

726
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,060
GOING DOWNHILL BACKWARDS

727
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,062
ONCE TO THE LEFT

728
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,465
ONCE TO THE RIGHT

729
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:57,002
DOWNHILL CONQUERED

730
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:02,207
MARCHING IN SYNC TO THEIR USUAL RHYTHM

731
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,878
SUDDENLY, JIMIN SPRINTS ALONE

732
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,714
SEPARATED LIKE THEY WERE EPISODE 2

733
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,251
HE WANTED TO SEE THE MATTERHORN
FROM HIGHER UP

734
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:18,089
IS THIS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
IN JIMIN'S EYES?

735
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,691
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

736
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,428
GETTING HYPED UP
AFTER SEEING THE MATTERHORN

737
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,332
Oh yeah.

738
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,569
TAKE IN THE VIEW

739
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,904
FINDS HIM ADORABLE

740
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:39,477
ENJOY THE VIEW, EVERYONE

741
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:45,617
WALKING ALONG THE RIDGE
WITH THE MATTERHORN IN THE BACKGROUND

742
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,586
SPOTS SOMETHING

743
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,621
There's a yellow one here.

744
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,656
So cute.

745
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,759
It's an ant.

746
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,162
-Move.
-[Jimin] It's good now.

747
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,197
-Let me do this.
-Don't.

748
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,266
-[Jung Kook] Hey!
-[chuckles]

749
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,368
Forget it.

750
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,037
Geez, you keep getting in the way.

751
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,441
YELLOW FLOWER
(FEAT. JIMIN'S FINGER)

752
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,644
These blue and yellow flowers
are so beautiful. They're so cute.

753
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,315
These two are paired up together.

754
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,117
THE FLOWERS ARE A DUO JUST LIKE THEM

755
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,152
Huh?

756
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,687
You're pretty, too.

757
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,226
[Jimin sighs]

758
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,261
Huh?

759
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,563
[in English] Why, why, why?

760
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,198
Found one.

761
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,867
Such a cute one.

762
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,504
[in Korean] Jung Kook
really likes flowers.

763
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,073
Flowers are nice.

764
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,610
Rather than a big flower field,

765
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,280
these tiny flowers blooming
between places like this,

766
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,548
they're way cuter.

767
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,552
We're so high up right now,

768
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,721
and yet there's still water.

769
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,523
Wow, the water's so clear.

770
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,992
Can you see it?

771
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,060
Can you?

772
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,532
[screeching]

773
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,101
A MYSTERIOUS SOUND

774
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,302
What's that sound?

775
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,038
There.

776
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,506
Where?

777
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,574
-[Jung Kook] Is that a marmot?
-[man] Yeah.

778
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,642
It's a marmot.

779
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,310
ANOTHER PIECE OF NATURE FOUND

780
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,612
Marmot, marmot.

781
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,049
CAN YOU SEE IT?

782
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,485
MARMOT

783
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,622
I actually saw a marmot scream
for the first time.

784
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,991
So that's how they scream.

785
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,727
IMITATING THE MARMOT

786
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:36,895
They scream like this.

787
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,663
WAS THAT WHAT I SOUNDED LIKE...?

788
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,998
Jimin.

789
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,367
-Yes, I'm here.
-We're almost there.

790
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,671
We're not getting any closer.

791
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,139
We're almost there.

792
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,511
WITH EVERY STEP, EXCITEMENT FILLS THE AIR

793
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:58,817
AND WITH EACH BREATH,
SCENERY GETS MORE BEAUTIFUL

794
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,120
FINALLY ARRIVED HERE

795
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,490
HIKING - PARAGLIDING

796
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,125
[Jimin] Are they coming back down?

797
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,627
-Or just flying off?
-They're going.

798
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,429
[Jung Kook] It looks so fun.

799
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,834
FLYING 2,800 METERS ABOVE ZERMATT
WITH THE WHOLE VIEW SPREAD BENEATH THEM

800
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,838
FEELING THE BEAUTY OF SWITZERLAND
WITH THEIR WHOLE BODY

801
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:24,175
I thought I had to try paragliding
if I came here.

802
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,910
This is scary.

803
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,046
I really want to do it, but...

804
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,415
But I'll do it anyway.

805
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,517
[in English] Ready to fly?

806
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,918
[in English] Yeah, I'm ready.

807
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,887
-Um...
-Ready to go.

808
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,491
It's time to go. It's time to fly.

809
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,992
SUPER EXCITED

810
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,393
[in English] So nervous.

811
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,629
SUPER NERVOUS

812
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,297
Little bit scared.

813
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,133
-What's your name again?
-Jung Kook.

814
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,135
THE FEARLESS ONE, JUNG KOOK, GOES FIRST

815
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,137
I'll give you sexy outfit.

816
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,373
Sexy outfit!

817
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,444
SEXY OUTFIT SUITS HIM PERFECTLY

818
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:00,612
[in Korean] I'm excited.

819
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:06,251
ONE MAN EMBRACES SOLITUDE
INSTEAD OF THRILL

820
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:07,886
[in Korean] I'm scared.

821
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,555
I mean,

822
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:15,293
how often do you get a chance to paraglide
from 2,700 meters up?

823
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,897
[instructor] I will ask
if you want to try big turns?

824
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,167
-You can say yes or no, okay?
-[in English] No.

825
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,936
[in Korean] What's
"geobjaeng-i" in English?

826
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,337
[man in English] Scaredy-cat.

827
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,507
I AM A SCAREDY-CAT

828
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:32,443
LIKE A FRIGHTENED RED PANDA

829
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,145
I'm kind of trembling.

830
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,616
My voice might be gone when we land.

831
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,452
SCREAMING

832
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,321
100% SERIOUS, 0% JOKING

833
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,524
It does look like fun, though.
It's just that it's scary.

834
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:54,299
PUTTING ON SUNGLASSES FOR EYE PROTECTION

835
00:38:54,365 --> 00:39:01,306
GETTING BASIC SAFETY TRAINING
FOR SAFE FLIGHT

836
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,476
IT'S FINALLY STARTING TO FEEL REAL

837
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,648
Even I don't trust myself.

838
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,351
I don't trust you.

839
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,587
Me, me.

840
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,259
MEANWHILE, THE OTHER ONE'S
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE

841
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:25,296
ENERGY LEVEL: MAX

842
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,865
[instructor] Okay, are you ready?

843
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,132
READY TO DIVE INTO THE SKY

844
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,534
[Jimin in English] I'm ready.

845
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:33,605
SEE YOU BACK ON THE GROUND

846
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,143
JUNG KOOK'S PARACHUTE LIFTS OFF FIRST

847
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:48,186
STUMBLES A BIT
BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY PARACHUTE

848
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,924
[whooping]

849
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:57,562
SUCCESSFUL TAKEOFF

850
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:03,868
DIVING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE SKY

851
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:09,874
JUST WATCHING MAKES YOUR HEART RACE

852
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,310
[whooping]

853
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:21,119
THE ENDLESS PEAKS OF THE ALPS
STRETCHING BEFORE THEIR EYES

854
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,820
[Jung Kook exclaiming]

855
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,557
AND THE FAIRYTALE-LIKE VIEW OF ZERMATT
BENEATH THEM

856
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,859
Wow.

857
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,529
[in English] It's beautiful.

858
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,301
THE MATTERHORN APPEARS
BEHIND FLYING JUNG KOOK

859
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:38,870
[in Korean] This is crazy.

860
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,977
SCENERY CAPTURED IN JUNG KOOK'S CAMERA

861
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,378
This is crazy!

862
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,515
Wow!

863
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,853
Very strong wind. So we wait.

864
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,355
[in English] Okay.

865
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,990
[exclaiming]

866
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,260
TAKING A DEEP BREATH,
GETTING READY FOR HIS FIRST FLIGHT

867
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:06,364
EYES FILLED WITH ANXIETY

868
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,366
[in Korean] I'm shaking.

869
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,670
-Ready?
-[in English] I'm ready. I'm ready.

870
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,806
Three, two, one, walking.

871
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,976
TAKING SLOW, CAREFUL STEPS

872
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,046
[instructor] Okay.

873
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,482
THE MOST NERVE-RACKING MOMENT YET

874
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,284
[instructor] Let's go. Run, run, run.

875
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,821
CLIFFSIDE VIEW FROM JIMIN'S POV

876
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,756
-[Jimin] Wow.
-[instructor] Well done.

877
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:36,794
OVERCOMING FEAR,
HE LEAPS INTO THE WHITE SKY

878
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,463
Okay.

879
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:43,101
JIMIN TAKES FLIGHT

880
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,335
[Jimin exclaims]

881
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,238
[in Korean] How can everything
look so clear?

882
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,711
It's so beautiful. I'm so happy.

883
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,880
But it's also a little scary.

884
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,951
-All right, let's go!
-[Jimin in English] Let's go!

885
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:04,288
A 360-DEGREE VIEW OF BREATHTAKING SCENERY
IN EVERY DIRECTION

886
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,790
I'm so happy.

887
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,593
THE DAZZLING HARMONY
OF SWISS SNOW MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS

888
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:12,096
-[instructor] Flying in Zermatt. Yeah!
-Yeah!

889
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,664
[Jung Kook] Jimin!

890
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,500
[Jimin] Jung Kook!

891
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,404
EVEN HAPPIER TO SEE EACH OTHER IN THE SKY

892
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,973
HAPPY REUNION

893
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,676
BUT HE'S SO SCARED ACTUALLY

894
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,479
[Jimin in Korean] Wow.
It really is high up here.

895
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:34,352
THE RADIANT, MYSTICAL HARMONY OF NATURE

896
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:37,288
JUNG KOOK'S POV

897

A 360-DEGREE PANORAMIC MASTERPIECE

900
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:56,007
[Jung Kook in Korean] Is that a river?
Yeah, that's a river.

901
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,875
THE VISPA RIVER FLOWING THROUGH ZERMATT

902
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,250
[♪ exhilarating
instrumental music playing]

903
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:18,496
HIS COURAGE TO RUN OFF THE HILL,
OVERCOMING FEAR

904
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:23,167
LEADS TO A MOVING EXPERIENCE
OF SEEING THE WORLD FROM THE SKY

905
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,178
CREATING A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
MOMENT OF AWE

906
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,650
Very exciting.

907
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,985
[in English] Very exciting.

908
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:45,723
BEST EXAMPLE OF EXCITING

909
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,194
NOTHING BUT JOY

910
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:52,930
[in English] I want more dynamic...

911
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,967
-Ready? It'll be exciting.
-Let's go. I'm ready!

912
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,569
LET'S GO FEEL THE THRILL

913
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,239
TAPPING FEET DUE TO ANXIETY

914
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,409
EXTREME MODE ON

915
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,045
A PARACHUTE TURNING 90 DEGREES

916
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,015
EXPERIENCING GRAVITY PROPERLY

917
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,652
SPINNING

918
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,888
[whooping]

919
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:22,193
THRILL EXPLOSION, FUN EXPLOSION

920
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,863
JIMIN SCREAMING

921
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:30,468
JIMIN'S SO SCARED

922
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,436
SO THRILLED, SO SCARED

923
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,504
SCREAMING

924
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:34,939
SCREAMING

925
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,674
[in English] I don't like...

926
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,910
You don't like?

927
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,078
I don't like, but...

928
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,614
But it's good.

929
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,517
Very exciting, yeah? You want more?

930
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,819
-One more?
-One more? Okay.

931
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,523
A ROLLERCOASTER IN THE SKY

932
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,993
HIS POV SHOWING PURE CHAOS IN HIS MIND

933
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,295
SHUTTING EYES TIGHTLY

934
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,462
KICKING FEET

935
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,564
Last one.

936
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,068
FINALLY STARTING TO ENJOY THE EXTREME

937
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:07,872
PRACTICALLY PASSED OUT (?)

938
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:11,008
HAD A GREAT TIME

939
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,313
JIMIN FROM JUNG KOOK'S POV

940
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,617
JUNG KOOK FROM JIMIN'S POV

941
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,688
JUNG KOOK BIRD SPOTTED

942
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:27,692
JIMIN BIRD SPOTTED

943
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,360
[in Korean] I feel like I'm a bird.

944
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,363
A bird.

945
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,000
How are you feeling right now?

946
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,703
[in Korean] Ah! ARMY, I love you!

947
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:44,108
[in English] It means "I love my fans."

948
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,480
JUNG KOOK ALSO GREETS ARMY FROM THE SKY

949
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,250
[sighs contentedly]

950
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,722
This might be the best moment of my life.

951
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,023
[both cheering]

952
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,591
[instructor] Oh, thank you!

953
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:01,892
[Jimin] Thank you, Matthew.

954
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:08,266
THE VIEW FROM THE SKY
THEY'LL REMEMBER FOREVER

955
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,103
LANDING SPOT GETTING CLOSER

956
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,505
WOBBLING IN RELUCTANCE TO END IT

957
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,240
Be ready to stand up, huh?

958
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,308
Stand up?

959
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,909
-When we land.
-Okay, okay.

960
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,179
GETTING READY FOR LANDING

961
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,385
SOFT LANDING: SUCCESS

962
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,753
[in Korean] That was insane.

963
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,855
That was so fun.

964
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,423
I don't want it to end.

965
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,293
JIMIN LANDS RIGHT AFTER

966
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,162
SAFE LANDING COMPLETE

967
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,833
SHARING A THANKFUL HUG

968
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,404
JUST GRATEFUL TO BE BACK ON SOLID GROUND

969
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,538
[whoops]

970
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,006
He's okay.

971
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:52,710
TEARS OF JOY (?)

972
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,646
Really, best moment in my life.

973
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:57,915
EXPRESSING HIS HEARTFELT THANKS ONCE AGAIN

974
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,151
-I'm glad you enjoyed.
-Okay. Thank you.

975
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:05,790
ONE SUMMER DAY IN JUNE 2025,
THEY FINISH PARAGLIDING SUCCESSFULLY

976
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,392
Jimin, that was so fun, right?

977
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,061
-[in Korean] I was so happy.
-Right?

978
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,329
But it was really scary.

979
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,563
How scary?

980
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:14,965
I saw two mountains at first.

981
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,033
-Really?
-Yeah.

982
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,101
-So scared?
-Yeah.

983
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:21,005
For people like me,
this kind of thing is a huge challenge.

984
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,174
You can do it, too, everyone,
whatever it is.

985
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,577
But seeing everything from up there
was so beautiful.

986
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:30,448
The way the mountains framed both sides
was shockingly pretty.

987
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,550
And what's interesting is, from up there,

988
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:36,253
you know you're moving so fast
when you look down at your shadow.

989
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,323
But when you look up,
it's completely still, like a photo.

990
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,092
It was fascinating.

991
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,827
-[Jimin] Everything's so huge.
-Yeah.

992
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:45,262
All I could say was, "Wow."

993
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,564
Wow...

994
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,065
You said, "Wow"?

995
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,834
I was screaming... the whole time.

996
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,369
I screamed so much.

997
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,104
I want to do it again.

998
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,172
Me too. Maybe next year?
[laughing]

999
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,276
I really want to, though.

1000
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,579
I mean, if you get the chance,

1001
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:05,616
this is something you should experience
at least once in life. Paragliding.

1002
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,521
When would we ever paraglide
from this high again?

1003
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:11,589
Never.

1004
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,224
-Yeah, probably.
-Right.

1005
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,394
I was really happy.
I captured it all with my eyes.

1006
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,563
I want to get a paragliding license.

1007
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,698
You could do it.

1008
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,967
I want to get certified and fly on my own.

1009
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,704
JUNG KOOK'S DREAM FOR THE FUTURE

1010
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,342
If I had to do this again,
I'd need a lot of courage again.

1011
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,511
[man] Think you'd do it again?

1012
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,379
Yeah, I think I would.

1013
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,149
-You were so happy, right?
-I was, so...

1014
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:42,119
-But you wouldn't understand this feeling.
-Why not?

1015
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:45,823
That moment
when fear and happiness coexist...

1016
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,458
You wouldn't know.

1017
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,429
A HERD OF GOATS THEY RUN INTO

1018
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,866
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK ARE ALSO ON THEIR WAY
BACK TO THE LODGE

1019
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,270
[Jimin] I think I'm really happy here.

1020
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:03,107
-I was truly happy.
-[Jung Kook] The best, really the best.

1021
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,545
-[Jimin] Hey, give me the key card.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

1022
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,612
Rock-paper-scissors.

1023
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,215
JIMIN WINS IN ONE SHOT

1024
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,818
-I knew it. Jimin.
-What?

1025
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:15,586
-Jimin.
-Yeah?

1026
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,121
[both laughing]

1027
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,256
JIMIN HEADS STRAIGHT TO HIS ROOM

1028
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,391
[singing]

1029
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:25,396
NOW IT'S JUST JUNG KOOK ON THE SOFA
HE AND JIMIN SAT ON TOGETHER

1030
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,799
I'll...

1031
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,502
go wash up.

1032
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,872
[Jung Kook] What about the staff?

1033
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:37,942
-[woman] Went to eat in the restaurant.
-Really?

1034
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:41,212
DINNER'S READY AND WAITING

1035
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,513
You sit there.

1036
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,415
-So it is risotto.
-What's this?

1037
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,885
-It looks like tomato soup.
-[Jimin] Thank you for the meal.

1038
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,224
[both exclaiming]

1039
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,825
-This is...
-This is...

1040
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,362
-Real risotto.
-Real risotto.

1041
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:03,000
THEIR PLAYFUL DNA IS STILL STRONG

1042
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:05,803
CONDUCTING AN ORCHESTRA OF FLAVORS
WITH A SPOON

1043
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,338
ROLLING IT UP

1044
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,939
ROLLING FAILED

1045
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,743
SETTLED TO JUST EAT IN HIS USUAL WAY

1046
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,847
EATING PASTA LIKE KOREAN SOUP

1047
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,116
-With some bread...
-Put it on top of the bread.

1048
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,951
Tastes kind of like potato pancake.

1049
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,653
Really?

1050
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,789
ONE BITE OF RÖSTI ON TOP OF BREAD

1051
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,991
Is this potato?

1052
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,426
I hate bell peppers.

1053
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,628
BELL PEPPER HATER

1054
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:33,297
You're right.

1055
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,199
Potato. Steamed potato.

1056
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,735
It's a bit lacking, huh?

1057
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,771
STARTING TO CRAVE SPICY KOREAN FOOD

1058
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,172
A bowl of ramyeon?

1059
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,408
-Sure.
-I think I'm in good form today.

1060
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,111
THE SOUND OF THE WATER POURING

1061
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,712
[Jung Kook] Into hot water...

1062
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,248
-[Jimin] The water's different, right?
-Yeah.

1063
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,716
FROM THE VISPA RIVER

1064
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,251
Give me the soup powder.

1065
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,220
All the flakes.

1066
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:57,955
Add the noodles.

1067
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,623
-Right now?
-Add them in.

1068
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,126
YOU ADD NOODLES, I ADD THE POWDER

1069
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,827
I'LL ADD THE FLAKES

1070
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,429
YOU ADD THE SOUP BASE

1071
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:08,265
PERFECT TEAMWORK

1072
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,668
-[Jimin] Add the Buldak sauce?
-Lots of it.

1073
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,936
[Jimin] All right.

1074
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,772
SIP OF BROTH

1075
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,906
It's spicy.

1076
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,074
-Is it?
-I like it.

1077
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,043
It's perfect.

1078
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,244
It's ready.

1079
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,147
-It's ready!
-It's ready!

1080
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:24,915
[Jung Kook] Made it spicy.

1081
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,784
KOREAN-STYLE SPICY RAMYEON IS READY

1082
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,454
-Jung Kook, thanks.
-Sure.

1083
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:33,891
K-NOODLE NOSTALGIA

1084
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,928
ENJOYING THE RAMYEON I COOKED MYSELF

1085
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,098
SATISFIED

1086
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,201
I'm sweating
all over my nose bridge. Gosh.

1087
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,004
FLAVOR THAT MAKES YOUR TONGUE APPLAUD

1088
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,476
AN EATING SHOW BEGINS

1089
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,212
PERFECTLY SYNCED NOODLE SLURPING

1090
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:58,549
AT THE SAME TIME

1091
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,150
Every Korean needs

1092
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,787
to have something spicy once in a while.

1093
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,023
We haven't had spicy food here yet.

1094
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,726
It was about time.

1095
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,195
EATING MODE ON

1096
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,433
Remember the chili peppers we bought?

1097
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,902
SPICY PARTY

1098
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,204
[groans]

1099
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,438
Sweating a lot.

1100
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,142
YEAH, I'M TALKING ABOUT ME

1101
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:28,078
This ramyeon makes me so shy.

1102
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,047
How does ramyeon make you shy?

1103
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:34,752
BECAUSE THE RAMYEON MAKES MY CHEEKS RED

1104
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,788
[man] Do you usually add Buldak sauce
to ramyeon?

1105
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:41,592
I usually add about one swirl.

1106
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:45,062
MEANWHILE, JIMIN'S APPETITE
WAS FULLY UNLEASHED

1107
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,965
NONSTOP SLURPING

1108
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,534
SWEATING LIKE HE'S SHOWERING

1109
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,469
JUNG KOOK SWEATING JUST AS MUCH

1110
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,805
Jimin, is today your final day
or something?

1111
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,541
ARE YOU OKAY, TISSUE MAN?

1112
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,143
[Jimin] That was so good.

1113
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,377
I'm so full.

1114
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,313
[Jimin] Koreans and ramyeon
are inseparable.

1115
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,617
-Let's sit down.
-Okay.

1116
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,318
Let's sit and have a conversation.

1117
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:13,590
NEURON CONNECTION

1118
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:15,159
We really...

1119
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,028
have no self-control.

1120
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,030
Is this right?

1121
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:22,366
[sighs]

1122
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,601
Skipping breakfast is pointless.

1123
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,372
No, you can't do that.

1124
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:29,440
You can't.

1125
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:33,410
SETTLED WITH HIS LEGS INSTEAD OF HIS BELLY

1126
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,380
[singing]

1127
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:39,583
LEGS EQUIPPED WITH RECLINER FUNCTION

1128
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,351
Feels like you're washing my hair.

1129
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,422
Done?

1130
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,624
HAIR WASH COMPLETE IN THREE SECONDS

1131
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:53,664
STEALING HIS GLASSES

1132
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,798
I can see clearly.

1133
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:55,966
-Right?
-Yeah.

1134
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,703
-Expensive lenses.
-So expensive, you can go through them?

1135
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,871
INVISIBLE LENSES

1136
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,373
ALMOST X-RAY VISION (?)

1137
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:04,942
ARMY,

1138
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,512
I've broken my promise again today.

1139
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,247
Today...

1140
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,149
I really broke it big time.

1141
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,650
I'm sorry.

1142
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:17,087
But I don't just eat thoughtlessly.

1143
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,889
I always keep

1144
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,859
a little bit of guilt
in one corner of my heart.

1145
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,694
"I ate a lot again today."

1146
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,896
I go to bed feeling sorry for it.

1147
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,998
Let's eat less tomorrow.

1148
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:36,473
RE-ENTERING THE ROOM

1149
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,544
Feels like I'll need
another shower tonight.

1150
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,652
SUDDENLY STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR

1151
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:51,555
PROTECTING THE ARTIST

1152
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,689
What do I do with this?

1153
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,224
This is so...

1154
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,260
What do I do?

1155
00:54:57,561 --> 00:55:02,099
CHANGED INTO GOING-OUT CLOTHES

1156
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,367
Will it be cold?

1157
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,540
I can just go out like this, right?

1158
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:15,212
JUNG KOOK IS READY TO GO

1159
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,116
THE SUNSET COLORS
SPREADING ACROSS THE CLOUDS

1160
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,853
THE STREETS OF ZERMATT IS STILL GLOWING

1161
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,090
AND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE
ON THE STREET

1162
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,828
JUNG KOOK HEADS OUT
TO ENJOY ZERMATT AT NIGHT

1163
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,830
SCENERY BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS

1164
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:36,033
[man] The gelato shop over there
is super famous.

1165
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,968
This one? That's why there's a line, huh?

1166
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,572
CHECKING OUT THE FAMOUS GELATO SHOP

1167
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,274
I thought it was closer. Maybe not?

1168
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,111
Here it is.

1169
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,379
DESTINATION

1170
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,982
THIS PLACE IS...

1171
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:57,221
ON THE WAY BACK TO THEIR HOTEL LAST NIGHT

1172
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:02,392
I saw two people
sitting outside at a table,

1173
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:06,563
just playing cards
and having beer together.

1174
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,600
Looked so nice.

1175
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,968
Because, you know...

1176
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:16,740
In Korea, we can't really drink
in front of a shop like that.

1177
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:17,808
-Right?
-Yeah.

1178
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,278
JUST WANTED TO ENJOY
THAT KIND OF SIMPLE FREEDOM

1179
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,315
ENTERING THE GATE OF FREEDOM

1180
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,718
JIMIN IS ALREADY THERE, WAITING

1181
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:30,220
Now that I'm here,
I actually feel like drinking.

1182
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,455
Being outside.

1183
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:33,690
Something random?

1184
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:37,661
Since we're in Switzerland,
maybe we should try Swiss whisky?

1185
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,263
-[man in English] Okay.
-Okay.

1186
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,564
[in Korean] I've decided.

1187
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,633
-Jung Kook, draft beer?
-Yup.

1188
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,768
-[in English] Draft beer.
-[in English] Okay.

1189
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,336
TIME TO ORDER

1190
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,841
-Draft beer, three. Okay, and...
-Three.

1191
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:55,712
-Swiss whisky iced, two.
-Yes.

1192
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,615
-Two. Ice?
-Yes, ice, yes.

1193
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:00,851
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1194
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,020
ORDER PLACED SMOOTHLY

1195
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:12,496
MEANWHILE, THE COLD BEER IS READY

1196
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,132
[in Korean] Hey, Jimin.
What's that beer over there?

1197
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,769
It's coming. It's coming.

1198
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,937
WOW

1199
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:23,106
THE LONG-AWAITED BEER HAS ARRIVED

1200
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,642
GIVE ME THE COLD BEER QUICKLY

1201
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,244
GULPING

1202
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,312
JIMIN'S WHISKEY

1203
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,446
[in English] Thank you.

1204
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:31,114
JUNG KOOK'S DRAFT BEER

1205
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,318
CHEERS

1206
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,453
This beer is...

1207
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,521
huge.

1208
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,459
THROAT FULLY OPEN

1209
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,863
Beer really is the best.

1210
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:49,800
[in Korean] This one...

1211
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,371
Since it had Swiss in the name,
I think it's Swiss whiskey.

1212
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,706
Let me give it a try.

1213
00:57:58,709 --> 00:57:59,977
Smells really sweet.

1214
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,347
It does. You're right.

1215
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:05,716
CHEERS...

1216
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,051
What was it again? Santé?

1217
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:09,553
Santé.

1218
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:12,756
TASTING SWISS WHISKEY IN SWITZERLAND

1219
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:16,560
[sighs]

1220
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,363
It feels so nice
to be out drinking like this.

1221
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:23,467
-Right?
-Just sitting here, relaxing.

1222
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,739
It really is such a fun little town.

1223
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,475
Yeah.

1224
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,912
A PLACE THAT HOLDS

1225
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,715
BOTH LIVELINESS AND PEACE

1226
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,551
DISCOVERING THE CHARMS

1227
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,654
OF ZERMATT AT NIGHT

1228
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,659
[Jung Kook] These fries are so good.

1229
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,963
SWISS FRIES RIGHT UP HIS ALLEY

1230
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,006
PAUSE

1231
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:06,309
PLAY

1232
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,879
PAUSE AGAIN

1233
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,148
SWISS ARMY APPEARS

1234
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,116
WAVING HELLO TO ARMY

1235
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:16,787
AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER
WITH A SWISS ARMY GIRL

1236
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:17,854
How did she know?

1237
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:19,956
She's crying.

1238
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,828
AN ARMY GIRL TEARING UP
BY THE SUDDEN MEETING

1239
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,197
GOODBYE, ARMY GIRL

1240
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:28,432
She's adorable.

1241
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:31,134
A SHORT BUT HEARTWARMING ENCOUNTER

1242
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,471
A MOMENT THE ARMY GIRL WILL NEVER FORGET

1243
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:37,374
AND A MOMENT WE'LL NEVER FORGET EITHER

1244
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:41,711
A SIP OF REFRESHING BEER

1245
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:46,049
A SIP OF BITTERSWEET WHISKEY

1246
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,851
The sun's setting.

1247
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:50,954
Right, almost.

1248
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,825
-You know...
-It feels like nighttime now.

1249
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,962
DARKNESS SLOWLY FALLS

1250
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:05,068
SERENITY SPREADS THROUGH THE VILLAGE

1251
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,906
[Jung Kook] It really is nice at night.
You just want to sit still.

1252
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:14,511
Honestly, I wanted to have a drink
with you like this here.

1253
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:17,647
Because, in Korea,
we never really get this kind of chance.

1254
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,283
WANTED TO ENJOY A SLOW, OUTDOOR MOMENT

1255
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,386
AND TONIGHT

1256
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,822
THEY'RE ENJOYING THAT FREEDOM IN ZERMATT

1257
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,224
[Jung Kook humming]

1258
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,859
Are you only drinking that one?

1259
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,393
Yeah, it's my fourth glass.

1260
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,465
After this one, let's go back.

1261
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,501
-Yeah.
-We gotta wake up early tomorrow.

1262
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:44,107
Looks like most of the places
are open until midnight.

1263
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,977
I think this place has the most tourists.

1264
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,745
It's lively.

1265
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:52,516
[Jimin] God, I just love this.

1266
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,855
You said you wanted to live
in Switzerland, right? At least for a bit.

1267
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:01,358
Was it here or somewhere else?

1268
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,426
The place that fits my taste best.

1269
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,797
I like the flashiest, most lively spot.

1270
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,034
-Like this kind of town?
-Yeah, exactly.

1271
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:13,103
It's nice. Really nice.

1272
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,974
ZERMATT, A TOWN THAT STOLE THEIR HEARTS

1273
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,678
We did quite a lot of enjoyable things
here in Zermatt.

1274
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:24,214
If we go skiing tomorrow,
it'll be the perfect finale.

1275
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:25,282
Skiing.

1276
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,450
Hope I'm not sore when I wake up.

1277
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,386
Tell me if you are, okay?

1278
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:31,955
IT HURTS

1279
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,924
If you are, let's go sledding instead.

1280
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,059
Sledding sounds fun, too.

1281
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:39,262
We can just grab a plastic bag
and slide down.

1282
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,697
Let me know if it hurts.

1283
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:42,732
I put it on wrong.

1284
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,568
I'll peel this one off.

1285
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:50,006
You see, I almost never put on bandages
when I get hurt.

1286
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,108
-But...
-I take it off in a day.

1287
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,444
I don't really care if it leaves a scar.

1288
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,379
-I'm like that, too.
-Right.

1289
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,649
But it's not about me. It's about you.
You're like my little brother.

1290
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,251
So I'd rather you didn't.

1291
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,819
Still, it's a memory, you know?

1292
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,021
-Not really.
-Of when you got hurt.

1293
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,823
SCARS = MEMORIES

1294
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,859
Like this?
The three stitches I got in the army?

1295
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,661
I've got a few scars from there, too.

1296
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,296
Army life.

1297
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:16,299
You guys might not know this,
but Jung Kook has two scars here.

1298
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:19,970
And I've got three...
No, four little dots here.

1299
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,439
I didn't think much.

1300
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,942
Back when I got my first big one,

1301
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:29,379
I didn't even realize what I was doing.
It was just so tiring, so...

1302
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,615
-It was so heavy, I couldn't lift it.
-Yeah.

1303
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,184
I was so tired,
so while I was holding the shovel,

1304
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:35,785
I leaned on it.

1305
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:36,853
Oh!

1306
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,921
You just leaned on it.

1307
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:40,290
-On such a hot pot?
-Yes.

1308
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,760
Yeah, I leaned right on it.
That's how it happened.

1309
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:45,795
That's when I got the scar.

1310
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,466
THUS CONCLUDES JUNG KOOK'S LEGEND
OF HIS GLORIOUS SCAR

1311
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:58,241
The first time I ever liked someone

1312
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:02,879
who wasn't Korean
was when I went to the US

1313
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,748
for that month-long trainee program.

1314
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,683
OHO?

1315
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,185
-Weren't you in 9th grade then?
-8th grade.

1316
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,054
-8th grade?
-Yeah.

1317
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,692
It was a girl who was there
for dance lessons like me.

1318
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:18,995
She was also very young.
A student like me.

1319
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:21,598
At first, I thought she was really pretty.

1320
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,466
HA HA HA HA HA

1321
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,235
ADORABLE FIRST LOVE STORY

1322
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,937
But then I started
seeing her really often.

1323
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,373
Then the teacher told me,

1324
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,110
-"Go talk to her! Just once."
-Really?

1325
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,147
HAPPY WITH THE STORY

1326
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,315
CRACKING UP

1327
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,950
But I was like,
"How? I don't even speak English."

1328
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,452
We couldn't communicate.

1329
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,120
But if it were now?

1330
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,890
-Maybe I would go for it.
-Right?

1331
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,226
[in English] I like you.

1332
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,761
I like you.

1333
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,833
SHY BOY

1334
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,369
That's actually a cute story.

1335
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,371
-No need to edit it out.
-[in Korean] Yeah.

1336
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,006
-Only in 8th grade.
-I was young.

1337
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:07,077
-You still remember it fondly, huh?
-Of course.

1338
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,979
Like an unfulfilled love kind of thing.

1339
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,949
-"The Truth Untold."
-Yeah, "The Truth Untold."

1340
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,118
I couldn't even say a word.

1341
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,824
[singing]

1342
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,226
[both singing]

1343
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:38,675
IN BEAUTIFUL ZERMATT

1344
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:42,479
THEY REMINISCE ABOUT BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES

1345
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,751
You know how we sang "The Truth Untold"
back in the army karaoke?

1346
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:52,789
If we approach it the way we practiced
back then, it'll come out smoother.

1347
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:54,791
Honestly, that song...

1348
01:04:55,458 --> 01:05:01,030
During BTS concerts, it always felt like
a bit of trauma for me.

1349
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,666
Even though we practiced together
in the military,

1350
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,536
I also had lessons after I got out.

1351
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,805
-Right.
-But there's one problem.

1352
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:10,540
-What?
-It's...

1353
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,542
It doesn't sound cool.

1354
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:13,610
Cool?

1355
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:18,581
Well, you can add that flair
after you get comfortable with it.

1356
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,150
At first, I was taken aback.

1357
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,886
Because you can't just add coolness

1358
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:27,857
-unless you've sung like that before.
-Right.

1359
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,661
-I'd never sung like that in 10 years.
-Yes. Right.

1360
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,863
Only now, after all that new training,

1361
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,533
I can finally sing
without hurting my throat.

1362
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,334
And...

1363
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,906
I think singing clean and simple
might sound better.

1364
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,910
I still take lessons with my teacher,
but I also have you, you know?

1365
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,645
I listen to how you sing,

1366
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,614
then think back to what I've learned.

1367
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,950
And I think there's this connection.

1368
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,453
What you say and what my teacher says

1369
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,521
are totally different,

1370
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:01,357
-Right.
-but when I hear you sing,

1371
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,793
it actually sounds pretty similar.

1372
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,195
Listening nearby...

1373
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,997
Anyway, I've realized one thing for sure.

1374
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:13,736
You have great strengths,
and we're totally different.

1375
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,072
I've learned that.

1376
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:21,644
And despite that,
since we've practiced together,

1377
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,646
all the advice you've given me

1378
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:27,350
has always helped me a lot.

1379
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,786
That's the most important part.

1380
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:32,755
Shall we go?

1381
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:35,692
-Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go. I'll go pay.

1382
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:37,494
You're paying, right?

1383
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,396
Give us one chance a day.

1384
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,831
One card-swipe chance.

1385
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:44,634
For the director and all the staff, too.

1386
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,603
Whatever it is, just once.

1387
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,670
Jimin Chance?

1388
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,073
You want anything?

1389
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,140
JIMIN CHANCE DAY

1390
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,208
You already ordered?

1391
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,244
JIMIN MADE SURE THE STAFF GOT THEIR MEALS

1392
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,745
Okay.

1393
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:56,813
Sounds good.

1394
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,782
Honestly, I was so tired today.
I didn't want to come out.

1395
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:04,020
But I did because I wanted to grab
some beer with all the staff.

1396
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:06,890
We insisted on it, and I'm glad we did.

1397
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,625
SO NICE

1398
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,759
I'm happy right now.

1399
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,530
[man] Jimin's buying.

1400
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,466
THUMBS UP

1401
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,967
We made you come here.

1402
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:22,071
It wasn't even on today's schedule.
We were supposed to rest.

1403
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,575
We're supposed to play a game, right?

1404
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,010
A GAME WAS SCHEDULED TONIGHT

1405
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,344
Who cares about the game?

1406
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,713
We should. We need an allowance.

1407
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,849
-[man] You must do it tomorrow.
-Of course.

1408
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,852
AT THE COUNTER

1409
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,927
JUST ONE TAP, AND THE PAYMENT GOES THROUGH

1410
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,161
JUST TAP

1411
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,796
This is modern life.

1412
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,901
PARK JIMIN FLEX

1413
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:01,210
A HEALING EVENING FROM START TO FINISH

1414
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,781
APPLAUSE! COOL GUY PARK JIMIN

1415
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,251
Thank you, everyone!

1416
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:10,219
AN EVENING WHERE EVERYONE WAS HAPPY

1417
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,021
[both laughing]

1418
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:16,259
LIKE THE ENDING OF A YOUTH MOVIE

1419
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,534
-[Jimin] Good night.
-[Jung Kook] Good night!

1420
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:29,272
CHECKING HIS APPEARANCE ON CAMERA
EVEN BEFORE BED

1421
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,915
You'll see it on screen,

1422
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:42,685
but when I look at the camera here,

1423
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:46,189
it follows my eyes and face around.

1424

Let's go to bed.

1443
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,009
Today was a long, tiring day.

1444
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,412
Is this it?

1445
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:20,283
God, nothing's going my way.

1446
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,688
You go there.

1447
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,259

QUICK STEPS TO PUT ON SHOES

1504
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:50,546

1506
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:01,791
Should we bring water?

1507
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:04,026

1512
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:27,149
How can we snowboard
in this kind of weather?

1513
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:28,217
EXCITEMENT LEVEL: MAX

1514
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:29,618

1522
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,539
-[Jimin] Should I put mine, too?
-Yeah.

1523
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:56,946
FULL OF ANTICIPATION

1524
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,547
Feels like I'm on a ride.

1525
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:05,921
THE GONDOLA GLIDES ENDLESSLY
OVER THE GREEN SCENERY

1526
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,724
It goes all the way up there?

1527
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,361
It's climbing faster than I thought.

1528
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:15,431
In winter, this whole mountain
must be covered in snow.

1529
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,466
Right?

1530
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:18,534
Wow.

1531
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,570
EXCITEMENT RISING ALONG WITH THE GONDOLA

1532
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,771
It's going to be epic.

1533
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:28,010
Once we pass that point,
you'll see the Matterhorn.

1534
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,379
We'll show you.

1535
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,648
You'll see the Matterhorn, on the right.

1536
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,216
[Jung Kook] Wait, there.

1537
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:35,284
It really is.

1538
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:37,853
-That's it? My gosh.
-[Jimin] It is.

1539
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,823
-We're so close now.
-Yeah, right?

1540
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:45,060
AS THEY ASCEND TOWARD THE MATTERHORN

1541
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,496
THE SNOW-CAPPED PEAKS SLOWLY APPEAR

1542
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:50,332
It feels like we're floating.

1543
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,067
Like this.

1544
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:54,770
FLOATING IN MID-AIR(?)

1545
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:56,038
About to drop down.

1546
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,841
You see, gravity...

1547
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,243
is really something.

1548
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,545
[laughing]

1549
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,782
It must feel amazing
to actually fly up here.

1550
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,150
Totally.

1551
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:12,588
I fell asleep thinking about flying.

1552
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,624
So? Did you fly in your dream?

1553
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,260
No, I fought with my mom in my dream.

1554
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,797
I was back in the army.

1555
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,633
YIKES, THAT'S ROUGH...

1556
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:26,635
AFTER ROCKY TERRAIN

1557
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,337
THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN FINALLY APPEARS

1558
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,339
Wow, we're climbing so high.

1559
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,008
-I think it's that side, over there.
-Right.

1560
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:37,346
But that slope's definitely not my level.

1561
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,015
I wonder if there's an easier one for me.

1562
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:41,584
I'm so excited.

1563
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,752
We should get ready to get off.

1564
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,455
-[Jimin] Let's go.
-[Jung Kook] Let's go.

1565
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:47,723
[Jimin] Wait a sec.

1566
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,791
TIME TO HIT THE SLOPES

-[Jimin] The snow's blinding.
-Yup.

So tough.

1589
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,807
You just have to keep riding it.

1590
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:16,745
DOING IT FOR REAL IS THE BEST TRAINING

LOOKS LIKE HE'S GETTING
THE HANG OF IT NOW...?

1620
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,730
Why do I keep stopping mid-way?

1621
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:16,799
The right side works fine.

1622

THEN...

1623
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:23,472

Thank you.

1629
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:44,026
NOW THAT HE'S WARMED UP,
TIME TO REALLY ENJOY

1630
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,731
JIMIN GOES OFF FIRST

1631

1632

MASTERED HOW TO MOVE ON FLAT GROUND

1633
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,104
[in Korean] So this is how.

1634
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,142
Ah.

1635
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:01,510
[in English] Like skate.

1636
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,050
[in Korean] My balance was completely off.

1637
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:10,719
Whoa!

1639
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,225
Keep it like this? Balance?

1640
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,127
I can walk on flat ground now.

1641
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:21,930
EXCITED

1642
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:26,568

OUT OF ENERGY

1647
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:47,789
[in English] Here, here. Fire.

01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:49,324
[groans]

1649
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:53,929
Where is my friend?

1650
01:23:53,996 --> 01:23:55,030
[laughs]

1651
01:23:55,464 --> 01:24:00,602
NOW IT'S JUNG KOOK'S TURN

1652
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,706
STARTING OFF WITH A CAREFREE WAVE

Come on!

1656
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,288
[in Korean] I was waiting for you.

JUNG KOOK

1658
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:23,792

JUNG KOOK

1662
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:32,434
Show me.

1663
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:36,872
SHOWING OFF PRO-LEVEL(?) BOARDING SKILLS

1664
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:38,874
[Jimin] My thighs are going to explode.

1665
01:24:38,941 --> 01:24:40,609
-[Jung Kook] Tired?
-Yeah.

1666
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:43,445
[Jung Kook] It's been forever
since we did this.

1667
01:24:45,147 --> 01:24:46,715
Are your thighs okay?

1668
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:48,817
My calves hurt more.

1669
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:49,952
Calves for you.

1670
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,921
Tell me when you're ready.

1671
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:57,826
[Jimin in English] I love it.

1672
01:24:57,893 --> 01:24:58,927
Uh!

1673
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:00,896
What was that?

1674
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:05,467
Felt more like poop than a rock.

1675
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:10,872
HE LOVES TO PULL A PRANK ON JIMIN
AND JIMIN'S USED TO IT

1676
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,277
Let's go.

1677
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:18,880

1678
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,549
-Do you want to go?
-I want to go.

1679
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,654
I'm a strong man.

1680
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:29,658
JIMIN IS STRONG

1681
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,893
Up, down.

1682
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,697
Up, down.

1683
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:41,169
A LITTLE SHAKY,
BUT SURPRISINGLY DOING WELL

1687
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:54,883
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1688
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,685
[in Korean] The ice all melted.

1689
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:58,720
It's a water park now.

FOLLOWING BEHIND

1694
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,399
Jung Kook's not coming.

1695
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:16,038
Snow's melting, so the flat part
must be tougher for boards.

1696
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:18,440
DRAINING JUNG KOOK'S ENERGY

1697
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,508
I'm exhausted.

1698
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:22,310
I'll lose weight.

1699
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:24,813

The ice melted so much, it's tough.

1704
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,629
I DID IT

1705
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,532

Yeah.

1715
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:10,792
GOOD JOB, GUYS

1716
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:12,694
Snowboarding here is way too hard.

1717
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:15,731
[in Korean] Tiring, huh?

1718
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:17,365
I bet it was.

1719
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,267
It must've been way harder for you.

1720
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:21,636
[Jimin] Let's go.
