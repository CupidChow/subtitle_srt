Seven is a lot, though.

140
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,543
Even if only one of you answers,
it counts this time.

141
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,777
-Understood.
-Okay.

142

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,951
Here we go.

183
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,621
[director] Capital of Malta?
One, two, three.

184
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,222
-Malta.
-You really like it.

185
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,891
Capital of Malta? One, two, three.

186
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,025
Morta?

187
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,493
[both laughing]

188
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,161
Valletta.

189
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,630
-Valletta.
-We knew that.

190
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,764
We used to know it.

191
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,299
-[director] Wrong!
-You failed.

192
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,634
Yes, understood.

193
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,736
-Let's study capitals.
-Can't help it.

194
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,739
We gave away one win so easily.

195
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,741
-[director] The last game is...
-Yes.

196
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,110
...rock-paper-scissors minus one.

197
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,179
EXPLANATION
1. EACH MEMBER ONE HAND, STAFF TWO HANDS

198
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,949
2. TEAM THAT WINS MINUS ONE, WINS

199
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,784
What if we throw together?

200
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,185
Let's signal like this.

201
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,389
But if we signal,
they'll know who's throwing.

202
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,157
So subtly, you feel it?

203
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,225
BOUNCING

204
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,127
-You feel it?
-I feel it too.

205
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,728
-But this is...
-Really?

206
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,796
You feel it too?

207
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,698
The person who signals throws.

208
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,099
-Right.
-Right.

209
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,902
-Should we try a practice round?
-Just one round.

210
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,171
-The one who signals throws.
-Yeah.

211
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,840
Rock-paper-scissors, minus one.

212
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,575
Why aren't you signaling?

213
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,311
Why didn't you do it?

214
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,179
Why didn't you signal?

215
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,081
-Oh, right.
-Both threw scissors.

216
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,083
-[Jung Kook] Wait.
-Okay, best of three.

217
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,118
-This is hard.
-[director] Best of three.

218
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,188
-We'll accept all of that.
-Understood.

219
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,024
Rock-paper-scissors.

220
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,026
PAPER, PAPER
ROCK, SCISSORS

221
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,294
Minus one.

222
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,862
PAPER, SCISSORS

223
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,765
-We can play the same kind.
-Hey.

224
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,136
I'll play rock first, so you play paper.

225
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,204
Okay.

226
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,007
One does it in order,
the other does it in reverse order.

227
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,608
You decided to do it this way?

228
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,743
HOW DID HE KNOW?

229
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,578
Maybe he heard it through your mic?

230
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,482
-Here we go.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

231
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,150
Minus one.

232
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,953
ROCK RETRIEVED
ONLY SCISSORS LEFT

233
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,154
SECOND MATCH: STAFF WINS

234
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,789
No, maybe you were right.

235
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,991
You didn't signal.

236
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,092
Let's go.

237
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,629
-Did we lose twice?
-You thought we won?

238
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,798
Did we lose both rounds?

239
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,334
-Should we start the game now?
-Five rounds.

240
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,703
-It's best of five.
-Best of five.

241
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,605
-[director] Best of five.
-Best of five.

242
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,273
-For real now?
-From the start?

243
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,109
-From the start.
-For real?

244
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,844
You signal, I throw, okay?

245
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,779
-Okay.
-Fair and square.

246
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,015
Here we go. The first round.

247
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,083
Rock-paper-scissors.

248
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,184
Minus one.

249
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,186
ROCK
TIE

250
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,155
Rock-paper-scissors.

251
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,223
Minus one.

252
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,425
SECOND MATCH: JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK WIN

253
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,694
-That's it. Good.
-How was the signal?

254
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:48,962
But you were a bit slow.

255
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,032
-A bit slow.
-I needed to see and judge.

256
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,466
RIDING MOMENTUM TO NEXT ROUND

257
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,667
Minus one.

258
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,204
ROCK, ROCK, PAPER

259
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,739
[in English] Okay, okay.

260
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,674
-[in Korean] It's okay.
-I was being dumb.

261
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,510
[director] Okay, it's one to one.

262
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,944
[Jimin] I'll only play rock.

263
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,915
-Okay.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

264
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,350
Minus one.

265
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,451
How did they know?

266
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,087
Did they see it? I should be careful.

267
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,156
Paper, rock.

268
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,525
-Rock ties.
-[Jimin] Definitely wins.

269
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,493
We obviously wouldn't throw paper.

270
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,229
Wow. You're pretty smart.

271
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,664
You should've thrown then.

272
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,332
Right, exactly.

273
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,435
-I need to think of me.
-It's one to one.

274
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,669
[director] Two to one.

275
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,737
Who's two?

276
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,007
Rock-paper-scissors.

277
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,208
Minus one.

278
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,342
Nice.

279
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,477
Minus one.

280
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,678
PAPER
ROCK

281
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,146
Okay, it's two to two.

282
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,482
Whoever wins first wins, right?

283
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,583
Yes.

284
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,318
-[in English] Last game.
-Here we go.

285
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,320
Rock-paper-scissors.

286
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,222
Rock-paper-scissors.

287
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,126
JUNG KOOK, IT'S YOU

288
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,563
-Minus one.
-[in Korean] Okay, tied.

289
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,566
Play scissors this time.

290
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,669
Rock-paper-scissors.

291
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,904
-Minus one.
-What, did you let us win?

292
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,407
-It's no fun if they go easy on us.
-Why?

293
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,109
This is so much fun.

294
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,011
Should we do it for real? Final round.

295
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,346
That's how you end it.

296
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,315
Sure. They've been nice enough.

297
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,483
What will you play?

298
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,917
Tell me what you want to.

299
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,453
-Without signaling this time?
-Let's do it seriously.

300
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,655
-No signal? Okay.
-No signal? None.

301
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,390
Rock-paper-scissors.

302
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,993
IT'S OBVIOUS ALREADY

303
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,228
What should we throw?

304
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,064
Minus one.

305
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,966
[both exclaiming]

306
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,100
Let's just go!

307
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,069
I'm too shy to do this.

308
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,973
Let's go. It's just a ten-minute walk.

309
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,274
[Jung Kook] Okay, let's go.

310
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,610
-We accept defeat.
-It should be fair.

311
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,678
[Jung Kook] Good game. Get some rest.

312
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,248
-You worked hard today.
-[Jimin] Let's do that.

313
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,683
[Jung Kook] Let's see.
The mart is this way.

314
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,552
What do you want to eat?

315
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,554
[Jimin] Let's think about it
as we walk.

316
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:58,458
-What do you feel like eating?
-Probably just meat or noodles?

317
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,561
-[Jimin] I wonder how big the mart is.
-Right.

318
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,931
-It's nice to step out in the evening.
-It's pretty.

319
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,900
-It does feel free.
-Yeah.

320
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,268
[Jimin] It's pretty.

321
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,270
[Jimin] There sure are lots of tourists.

322
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,540
[Jung Kook] Where's the mart?

323
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,411
[Jimin] I think it's here. Seems like it.

324
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,079
[Jung Kook] That's right.

325
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,581
ARRIVED AT MART

326
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,949
[Jimin] Do you have a coin?

327
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,185
GETTING SHOPPING CART

328
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,819
[Jung Kook] I have a coin. Wait.

329
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,855
HEARING SOMEONE SPEAK KOREAN

330
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,490
TURNING

331
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,158
[Jimin] Nice to hear Korean.

332
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,362
ENTERING MART

333
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,399
WHICH SECTION ARE THEY GOING TO FIRST?

334
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,801
[Jung Kook] Isn't this like pork ribs?

335
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,902
We have an oven.

336
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,604
[Jimin] This looks more delicious.

337
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,907
MORE EXPENSIVE MIGHT BE TASTIER

338
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,209
Good, good.

339
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,578
OFF TO GET NEXT INGREDIENT

340
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,413
-[in English] Excuse me?
-[woman] Yeah.

341
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,714
Where is rice?

342
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,883
-Rice?
-Rice, yeah.

343
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,218
Rice.

344
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,187
Okay, thank you.

345
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,089
[Jimin in Korean] Let's try
making rice.

346
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,691
I should make something too.

347
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,126
But we don't have a rice cooker.

348
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,494
Pot rice.

349
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,264
LOOKING UP POT RICE

350
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,465
It's quite easy.

351
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,268
One kilo will be...
It should be enough, right?

352
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,104
I'm not confident,
but I should give it a try.

353
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,305
WHILE JIMIN PICKS RICE

354
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,107
JUNG COOK'S TASK:
BACON DONE

355
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,210
JUNG COOK'S TASK 2:
SALT AND PEPPER DONE

356
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:29,048
JUNG COOK'S TASK 3:
PASTA DONE

357
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,317
WAIT

358
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,721
PASTA PURCHASE COMPLETE FOR REAL

359
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,156
[in Korean] Where did Jimin go?

360
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,258
[Jimin] Jung Kook.

361
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,994
-I'll make rice today.
-Oh, really?

362
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,764
I got some extra meat, too,
in case we decide to make pasta.

363
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,201
[Jimin] I see. If you could make it,
that'd be great.

364
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,503
I learned how to make pot rice.

365
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,005
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.
-I'll try it.

366
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,742
-Okay, give it a try.
-I got a kilo since it's not just for us.

367
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,244
I want to buy just half
of these mushrooms.

368
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,047
-We have lots of money.
-[Jimin] We're rich.

369
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,115
MUSHROOM

370
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,316
Hey, hold on.

371
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,517
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah.

372
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,020
-There's triangle kimbap.
-What?

373
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,989
[Jimin] Shopping for food
is making me hungry.

374
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,925
This looks like a lot, though.

375
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,694
-Is it okay?
-Throw it in.

376
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,195
We can take it back later.

377
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,397
[Jimin] Isn't it 80?

378
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,299
-[Jung Kook] It's 81.
-Enough, enough.

379
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,804
-[Jimin] How much is it?
-It's 68.

380
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,938
-It's 68?
-Yeah.

381
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,775
GROCERIES: 68 FRANCS IN TOTAL

382
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,210
[Jung Kook in English] Thank you.

383
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,512
[in English] Receipt, yes.

384
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,180
[Jimin] Let's enjoy our meal today.

385
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,717
How about we sit down
and have kimbap first?

386
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,785
-Right here?
-Yeah.

387
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,320
[Jung Kook] But can we sit here?

388
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,654
-We just sit?
-[Jimin] Yes.

389
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,389
[Jung Kook] Let's have some kimbap.

390
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,759
-[Jimin] It's raining.
-I know.

391
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,495
[Jimin] We might get rained on.

392
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,931
HUNGER THAT RAIN CAN'T STOP

393
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,403
STREET KIMBAP TIME

394
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,407
EATING FIRST

395
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,775
[Jung Kook] What flavor?

396
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,581
What is it?

397
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,620
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

398
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,389
-Spicy tuna?
-Yeah.

399
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:19,726
It's good.

400
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:26,466
HUNGER IS THE BEST SEASONING

401
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:35,208
ADJUSTING CAMERA

402
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:42,949
DEVOURING TRIANGLE KIMBAP

403
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,055
Let's go.

404
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,292
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD

405
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,360
[Jimin] Let's go.

406
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,296
[Jimin] We spent a lot of time
at the mart.

407
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,799
Let's put the meat in the oven
as soon as we're home.

408
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,934
-[Jimin] How long will that take?
-Two hours.

409
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,002
[Jimin] Hmm.

410
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,071
-Should I make rice or not?
-Rice?

411
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,073
Let's just keep it for now.

412
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,109
-We'll decide what to have, rice or pasta.
-[Jimin] Okay.

413
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,911
[Jung Kook] I'll make the meat.

414
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,446
[Jimin] Should I make pasta?

415
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,514
What?

416
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,117
It's so peaceful.

417
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,519
[Jung Kook] It's a chicken.

418
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,953
[makes clucking sounds]

419
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,924
[Jung Kook] The Matterhorn.

420
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,226
That angle looks prettiest right now.

421
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,596
ANOTHER VIEW OF THE MATTERHORN
ON THEIR WAY HOME

422
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,399
[Jung Kook] It's still weird
being out of the military.

423
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,302
[Jimin] I'll really know how it feels
back in Korea.

424
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,670
-You think so?
-Yeah.

425
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,238
[Jimin] Has it been about a week?

426
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,474
[Jung Kook] More than a week
since discharge.

427
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,609
Right, about a week and a half.

428
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,711
ARRIVED AT THE LODGING

429
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,413
Let's go in. It's cool.

430
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,682
Let me scan the keycard.

431
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,350
[strains]

432
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,886
[Jung Kook] We're here!

433
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,590
[director] Just make what you plan to eat.

434
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,926
-We bought a lot to eat together.
-Really?

435
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,195
This is too much for us.

436
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,363
It was within the budget.

437
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,567
SOUND SIGNALS THAT COOKING HAS BEGUN

438
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,868
[humming]

439
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,971
JUNG COOK'S COOKING CLASS

440
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,476
MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE COOKING

441
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,644
SMELLING IT

442
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,745
Mmm.

443
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,683
JUNG COOK BBQ RECIPE:
1. SPREAD BUTCHER PAPER

444
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,619
CONFIDENT HANDS

445
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,488
2. WRAP MEAT IN BUTCHER PAPER

446
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,258
3. WRAP IT IN ALUMINUM FOIL

447
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,829
MEAT GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE OVEN

448
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:41,367
I'll cook it in the oven
at about 70 degrees

449
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,437
and then quickly sear it outside.

450
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,439
That's what I'm thinking!

451
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,775
THE MEAT TURNING DELICIOUS

452
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,211
The oven... I need to look it up.

453
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,946
"At a low temperature..."

454
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:00,119
I have no clue.
It says it takes around seven hours.

455
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:05,658
An hour and a half at 75 degrees.
Will it cook through?

456
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,393
It's just intuition, really.

457
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,629
Jimin, what are you doing?

458
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,097
Studying how to make rice.

459
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:16,969
SERIOUSLY WATCHING POT RICE VIDEO

460
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,107
I watched how to make pot rice,
but it was a failed one.

461
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,175
I watched a failure for 28 minutes.

462
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,011
Can I do it well?

463
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,814
Hey, are you going to eat rice or pasta?

464
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,383
Anything.

465
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,587
Then should I just make rice next time?

466
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,856
-Yeah, that'd be better.
-All right.

467
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,525
-Anything I can help with?
-Nope. Thanks, though.

468
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,793
JIMIN'S POT RICE NEXT TIME

469
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,529
JUNG COOK'S SECOND DISH

470
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,798
JUNG COOK'S PASTA RECIPE
1. POUR OLIVE OIL IN POT

471
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,700
2. ADD MILK

472
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,137
3. ADD PLENTY OF BUTTER

473
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,472
4. GRIND SALT AND PEPPER

474
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,608
If I make the sauce now,

475
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,311
it'll be easy to cook the pasta later.

476
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,079
Carbonara pasta.

477
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,014
JUNG COOK'S SECOND DISH
CARBONARA PASTA

478
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,584
SAUCE KICK: CARBONARA STICK

479
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,153
How did they come up with this?

480
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,554
It's going to be delicious.

481
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,956
ADDING SAUCE

482
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,930
One more packet will be perfect.

483
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,934
MORE SAUCE IS BETTER

484
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,671
This pasta water is salty.

485
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,807
So it should be a bit bland.

486
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,812
If you cook pasta in plain water,
it won't be seasoned.

487
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,513
So it tastes sweet.

488
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,848
And it doesn't blend.

489
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,554
Delicious.

490
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,023
I'll be using a wide pan.

491
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,727
Once it thickens,
I'll turn it off and refrigerate.

492
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,899
CARBONARA PASTA SAUCE DONE

493
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,668
It will be thickened
when it mixed with noodles.

494
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,670
Done. I'll go get some rest now.

495
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,839
RESTING WHILE THE MEAT COOKS

496
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,541
REST COMES TO THE LODGING

497
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,914
WHEN JUNG KOOK RESTS, JIMIN MOVES

498
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,651
It's not hard to peel garlic. It's easy.

499
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,554
STARTING WITH GARLIC

500
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,690
WITH HIS BARE HANDS

501
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,926
EXPERIENCED VIBE
JIMIN'S QUICK GARLIC PREP

502
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,662
Everyone watching this...

503
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,098
What are you thinking as you watch this?

504
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,768
Do you think I'm really bad at this?

505
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,237
Caught you, right?

506
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,075
You're thinking, "Jimin can use a knife.
He's all grown up."

507
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,309
Caught you, right?

508
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,946
"Look at Jimin, focusing so hard."

509
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,015
I got it, right?

510
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,718
Surprised, weren't you?

511
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,054
WHILE JIMIN PLAYS WITH THE CAMERA

512
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,858
SINGING PUPPY APPEARS

513
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,193
[Jung Kook] What?

514
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,929
Were you peeling it in advance?

515
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,898
-Actually...
-Yeah.

516
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,300
This was supposed to be a surprise.

517
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,202
-Okay.
-You shouldn't have come out now.

518
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,737
-Me?
-Can you go back in?

519
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,272
I'll ask them to edit it out.

520
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,374
Can you come out saying, "What?"

521
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,742
-Should I?
-Yes.

522
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,012
Come out and say,
"He peeled all this? He's amazing."

523
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,480
What?

524
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,915
-Not like that.
-No?

525
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,018
What a cocky reaction.

526
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,053
This guy.

527
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,255
This garlic is pretty dug out.

528
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,893
-Did you dig while peeling it?
-Yeah.

529
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,731
Stress makes the garlic delicious.
Apparently, the juice comes out.

530
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,365
Should I give it proper stress?

531
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,601
Should I roll it a few times?

532
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:39,004
Hey, focus. Hey.

533
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,573
It'll be delicious.

534
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,743
Oh! My eyes.

535
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,078
Good job.

536
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,613
Good work.

537
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,682
-Hold on.
-What is it now?

538
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,319
Hey, you're here already?
I was going to surprise you.

539
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,620
I'm going in.

540
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,889
Not cool.

541
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:57,957
[laughing]

542
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,561
JUNG COOK STARTS COOKING FOR REAL

543
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,372
IT'S TIME TO ENJOY WATCHING JUNG KOOK COOK

CHECKING PRE-COOKED MEAT

548
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,791
The sauce is all absorbed.

549
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,193
Wait, wait.

550
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,162
Where are the plates?

551
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,197
Jimin, where are the plates?

552
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,232
Plates?

553
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,869
Drawer above the fridge, on the right.

554
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,604
[Jung Kook] Here? Oh.

555
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:49,008
CHECKING THE MEAT

556
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,448
-[Jimin] Can I ask you something?
-Yes.

557
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,284
Why are you putting it in here?

558
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,085
I'll cook it once more.

559
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,555
And this...

560
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,924
KEEPING THE MEAT OIL SEPARATELY

561
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,994

JIMIN CLEANS UP NEATLY

563
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,366
Do we have red wine?

564
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,869
-Yes, we do.
-Can you bring it?

565
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,037
I'll bring it.

566
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,307
-Oh, it was there.
-Here. That was quick, right?

567
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,509
-Can you tell me when to stop?
-Yes.

568
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,544
[Jung Kook] That's enough.

569
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,747
AFTER MAKING THE RED WINE SAUCE
FOR THE MEAT

570
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:32,351

TWO DISHES AT ONCE, SMOOTHLY

576
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,176
Jimin, stir-fry this nicely, please.

577
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,244
Okay.

578
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,180
Let's make a feast.

579
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,084
SUPER FOCUSED

580
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,720
DILIGENTLY STIR-FRYING VEGGIES

587
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,903
-Thank you so much.
-Yes.

588
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,239
You were a huge help.

589
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,210

JUNG KOOK TASTING PASTA

597
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,136
JIMIN MOVES SECRETLY BEHIND HIM

598
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,271
[woman] You want to eat this,
you can cook it.

599
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,539
[in English] What is this?

600
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,207
-[in Korean] Potato pancake?
-Yeah.

601
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,109
You can just fry it as is in a pan.

602
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,212
Great. Now I have something
I can cook for him.

603
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,581
WAIT, JUNG KOOK, I'LL MAKE IT FOR YOU

604
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,650
PLENTY

605
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,453
DUMPING THE POTATOES IN

606
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,223
Oh, no, this isn't right.
It's all broken. Goodness.

607
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,391
This...

608
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,261
Spread it like this.

609
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,196
EYEBROW WIGGLE

610
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,899
PICKING UP OIL AGAIN

611
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,601
ADDING MORE OIL

612
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,071
LOOKING SATISFIED

613
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,240
FEELING LIKE IT'S GOING SMOOTHLY

614
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:37,910
Oh, really?

615
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,348
RÖSTI REBELS VIOLENTLY

616
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,416
PASSED OUT?

617
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,151
Pancakes don't go easy, Jimin.

618
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,187
JUNG COOK TAKES OVER

619
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,055
[both exclaiming]

620
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,092
RÖSTI POTATO PANCAKE EXPLOSION

621
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,994
RÖSTI HAS ELIMINATED PARK JIMIN

622
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,862
RÖSTI HAS ELIMINATED JUNG KOOK TOO

623
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,832
RÖSTI IS GOING CRAZY

624
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,701
Hey, Jimin. What did you do to this?

625
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,170
The potatoes are moist.

626
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,140
JUNG COOK STEPPING IN TO TAKE CARE OF IT

627
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,842
But I need to do this.

628
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,310
-What?
-Please leave.

629
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,947
I'm not getting the look I imagined.

630
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,049
-Jimin.
-Yes.

631
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,451
Did you want to eat this?

632
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,553
Potato?

633
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,522
I wanted to make something for you.

634
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,325
Enjoy it.

635
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,193
-What?
-I mean, make it delicious.

636
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,195
-You want me to?
-Why won't it cook?

637
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,463
Why won't this cook?

638
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,466
JIMIN'S BATTLE WITH THE RÖSTI CONTINUES

639
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,738
NOTICES SOMETHING

640
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,411
SEALING IT

641
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,880
SOUNDS VIOLENT

642
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,449
Sounds like popcorn inside.

643
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,484
TIME TO CHECK

644
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,552
Wait a second.

645
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,987
SCARED

646
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,056
EVEN MORE VIOLENT RÖSTI

647
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,259
CAREFULLY OPENING THE LID

648
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,326
SECOND SEALING

649
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,394
[Jung Kook] Jimin.

650
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,896
Are you okay?

651
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,533
I'm thinking of just washing it like this.

652
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,436
BRAVELY OPENING THE LID

653
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,271
THE ATTACK RESUMES

654
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,574
THE ATTACK IS RELENTLESS

655
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,445
USING ROLLING SKILLS

656
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,580
REJECTION

657
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,182
You okay?

658
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,249
TASTING IT

659
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,118
-Let's just eat it.
-Should we?

660
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,554
Yeah, it'll be fine.
Let's use it as a garnish.

661
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,855
FINAL SEALING

662
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,157
Cooking feels like a war
for the first time.

663
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,625
-Jimin.
-Gosh.

664
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,994
Let's use it as a garnish here, okay?

665
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,496
-On here?
-Put it on here.

666
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,664
[in English] Okay, okay.

667
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,200
[in Korean] It felt like getting shot.

668
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,937
RÖSTI STATUS CHANGED FROM MAIN TO GARNISH

669
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,004
[Jung Kook] Perfect.

670
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,107
-Let's eat now.
-Yeah.

671
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,112
-[Jimin] Let's try it.
-See, the bone's separated, right?

672
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,646
Fork it like this and...

673
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,785
JUNG KOOK SHOWING
HIS CARBONARA PASTA

674
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:00,919
Look.

675
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,223
If you have this with the pasta...

676
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,091
JUNG COOK IS KIND ENOUGH
TO CUT THE MEAT FOR HIM

677
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,159
Thank you.

678
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,928
I can eat this in one bite.

679
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,463
SERVICE SATISFACTION

680
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,031
Thank you.

681
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,569
-Mmm!
-It's good, right?

682
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,739
-So good to eat together.
-Right?

683
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,108
[Jimin] I'm really curious about this.

684
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,811
I mean, is this even edible?

685
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,282
WHAT IS THIS?

686
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,350
Why?

687
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,953
JUNG KOOK TASTES IT TOO

688
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,990
The potato's good.

689
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,192
It's good.

690
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,096
Why so shy?

691
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,831
I'm not shy.

692
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:46,899
Why?

693
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,567
I'm grateful that you're eating it.

694
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,803
-It's a war-like potato.
-Mmm!

695
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,472
-Call it war potato.
-War potato.

696
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,275
FIERCE BUT DELICIOUS

697
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,544
The pasta...

698
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,012
is seriously good.

699
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,849
If we add two more carbonara
sauce packets, won't it be better?

700
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,552
Should we set some aside for the staff
and add more?

701
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,619
-Should we?
-Yeah.

702
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,488
SETTING PASTA ASIDE FOR THE STAFF FIRST

703
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,689
What?

704
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:11,757
[groans]

705
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,559
That's a lot of pasta.

706
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,327
Send it back if it's not good.

707
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,630
Should I add two packets?

708
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,370
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

709
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,372
Oh, Jimin.

710
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,440
Here we go.

711
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,108
It got even better.

712
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,210
JIMIN HAVING A BITE

713
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,349
EATING MEAT TOO

714
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,051
It's delicious.

715
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,285
SATISFIED

716
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,254
-Thank you.
-This is so good.

717
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,390
I just realized I love pasta.

718
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,725
You just realized?

719
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,393
PROUD

720
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,064
Tonkatsu was number one food for me,
but this probably tops the list now.

721
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,733
THE PERFECT DINNER
HAS CHANGED JIMIN'S FAVORITE FOOD

722
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,301
I'm so full.

723
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,469
SWISS NIGHT DEEPENS

724
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:58,770
[director] Clap once.

725
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,640
One, two, three.

726
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:02,708
START

727
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,876
Today, we have...

728
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,312
-one powerful penalty.
-Tell us the game first.

729
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,748
SCARED

730
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:10,816
What is it?

731
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,818
-A penalty?
-[director] Yes.

732
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,886
[director] Well, rather than a penalty...

733
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,156
While planning this trip,

734
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,261
we wanted to pursue minimalism
and follow current trends.

735
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,364
You can think of this game
as a reflection of that.

736
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,299
You're not taking everything away, right?

737
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:31,603
[director] This year's travel trend
is minimalism.

738
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,774
So you'll be packing as light as possible.

739
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:39,044
Just pack the essentials for now.

740
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,746
[Jung Kook] Put them in for now.

741
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:46,251
FORCED TO MOVE THEIR STUFF
INTO SMALL SUITCASES

742
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,087
AND MINIMALISM STRIKES AGAIN

743
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,090
THIS TIME, IT'S TIME

744
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,628
[director] This game
has six questions in total.

745
00:29:56,695 --> 00:30:00,365
Listen to the lyrics
and name the artist and song title.

746
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,334
If you get nothing right, it's 12 hours.

747
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:07,039
But what does minimalism
have to do with time?

748
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,841
Okay, here we go. We'll begin right away.

749
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,911
[AI voice] Jumping like this
and jumping like that.

750
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,947
ME

751
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,082
MAYBE NOT

752
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,383
Jin's "Super Tuna"?

753
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,119
I think I heard that jumping part. No?

754
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,521
[AI] Your eyes are sparkling.

755
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,156
-"Super Tuna"?
-Let's be friends.

756
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,490
"Let's be friends"?

757
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,125
It's not our song at least, is it?

758
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,194
Is it our song?

759
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,496
"Let's be friends."

760
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,532
Do we have such a song?

761
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,368
Wait, wait a minute.
Why would we be friends?

762
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,771
[AI] Your eyes are sparkling.
Let's be friends.

763
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,972
GOING CRAZY

764
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,042
"Your eyes are sparkling,
let's be friends"? These are lyrics?

765
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,211
BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

766
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,980
YES, THAT IS MY BROTHER'S SONG LYRICS

767
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,983
WHAT KIND OF SONG IS THIS?

768
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,219
[singing]

769
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,154
TITLE: UNTITLED
COMPOSITION & VOCAL: JIMIN

770
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,657
I have no idea.

771
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,425
[director] Now, what's your answer?

772
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,593
I really don't know.

773
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,362
One, two, three.

774
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,629
Jin's "Super Tuna."

775
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,132
-Correct.
-We were right!

776
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,572
WHY IS THIS THE ANSWER?

777
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,773
Wow, really?

778
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,508
-It was Jin's song.
-Amazing.

779
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,878
Because of the jump part,
I thought it was Jin.

780
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,313
-Yes.
-Yes.

781
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,914
-Deducted two hours.
-Okay.

782
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,449
[director] You got one right.

783
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,651
Next question.

784
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,520
[AI] When our music starts...

785
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,155
Ah.

786
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,656
Wait.

787
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,892
[AI] People go crazy, go nuts.

788
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,428
-Our style is No More Dream.
-Must be our song.

789
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,764
Stepping on our seniors' backs on stage.

790
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,831
What?

791
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,435
Isn't this BTS's "No More Dream"?
No? Wait, it's not.

792
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,870
Stepping on backs...

793
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,238
Why step on backs?

794
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,541
In our "No More Dream," you know,

795
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,843
the highlight is stepping on backs.
That's why?

796
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,645
PLAYING MORE

797
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,514
-Last one? Yes.
-Playing it.

798
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,315
[AI] When our music starts,

799
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,418
people go crazy, go nuts.

800
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,686
Our style is No More Dream.

801
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,055
That guy is really annoying.

802
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,525
-Because of that voice...
-I can't focus.

803
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,760
AI GUY IS DEFINITELY THE SABOTEUR

804
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,396
[director] Okay, here we go.
One, two, three.

805
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,931
BTS's...

806
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,100
-"Dope"?
-[director] Wrong.

807
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,234
[Jimin] What is it?

808
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,071
[AI] Stepping on our seniors' backs
on stage.

809
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,506
[in English] I'm sorry, man.

810
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,875
What? What more can I say?

811
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,178
Ah.

812
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,245
TOTALLY KNOWS

813
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,981
WHAT IS IT...?

814
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,817
-"Attack on Bangtan."
-Correct.

815
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,885
That guy is really annoying.

816
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,821
YEAH, ME TOO

817
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,055
STILL TEN HOURS LEFT

818
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,423
Third question.

819
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,493
[AI in Korean] Twenty-four hours,
if I could only be with you.

820
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,561
I KNOW

821
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,796
[director] One, two, three.

822
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,864
Two, three.

823
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,132
BTS.

824
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,900
"Just One Day"?

825
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,302
-Correct.
-Right. Good.

826
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:54,339
[AI] I'd kiss you starting in the morning.
Can't forget to grab some brunch.

827
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,407
SO ANNOYING

828
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,242
Seriously cheesy.

829
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,845
"All these things."

830
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,214
"I'll confess to you."

831
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,748
-"Just One Day."
-"Just One Day."

832
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,117
CURRENT SCORE
4 HOURS DEDUCTED FROM 12

833
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,153
Get three more right,
down to two hours.

834
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,055
-Here we go.
-[AI] Don't even apologize.

835
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,557
Look closely. Look at your pathetic self.

836
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,161
"Don't even apologize"?

837
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,096
SEARCH COMPLETE

838
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,298
I think I know.

839
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,268
PLEASE GET IT RIGHT

840
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,569
[director] One, two, three.

841
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,571
BTS, "MIC Drop"?

842
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:27,639
[director] Correct.

843
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,307
Wow! You're so good.

844
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,344
We didn't intend it,
but we have Jung Kook.

845
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,481
-Here we go.
-[AI in English] Where my money? Yah.

846
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:37,749
[both singing]

847
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:38,850
I KNOW THIS

848
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,452
What song?

849
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,287
"Go Go."

850
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,855
BTS's "Go Go."

851
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,790
CORRECT

852
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,892
Last question.

853
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,027
4 OUT OF 5 CORRECT
ONLY 1 QUESTION LEFT

854
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,129
[AI in Korean] What were you
dreaming of...

855
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,465
[both singing]

856
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,868
SO EXCITED,
LIKE THEY'RE SURE THEY KNOW

857
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,937
[continue singing]

858
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,073
BTS, "No More Dream."

859
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,242
CORRECT

860
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,443
I got one wrong.

861
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,380
But this is pretty good, right?
Just two hours of penalty.

862
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,881
-Okay.
-Yes.

863
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,016
Penalty.

864
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,685
What is it?

865
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:14,753
EYES FIXED

866
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,889
PENALTY FINALLY REVEALED

867
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,358
WHAT...

868
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,260
IS...

869
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,995
THAT?

870
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,064
It's a prison.

871
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,600
YES, IT'S A PRISON

872
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,668
I know.

873
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,470
We have to lock our wallet
in the prison for two hours.

874
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,039
-Right?
-No.

875
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,841
IF NOT THE WALLET...

876
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,210
-Phones?
-[director] That's right.

877
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,445
[Jimin] Starting now?

878
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,314
[director] We'll do it when we want.

879
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:47,218
[Jimin] Not having to give back this
phone? It felt incredible last night.

880
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,689
So I forced myself to stay awake
just to keep using it.

881
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:58,196
WHILE WAITING FOR FOOD AT RESTAURANTS

882
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,633
EVEN WHILE RESTING AT THE LODGE

883
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,703
THEY HELD THEIR PHONES TIGHT
UNTIL THEY WENT TO SLEEP

884
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,138
SO WE PREPARED DIGITAL MINIMALISM

885
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,407
-Is this the military?
-It's the military.

886
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,543
NIGHT OF MADNESS

887
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,745
The only thing that makes me happy now

888
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,614
is using my phone at night.

889
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,849
PHONE IS THIS IMPORTANT
10 DAYS AFTER DISCHARGE

890
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,784
If you do this, they'll take it at night.

891
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,152
So annoying.

892
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,588
Is this the military or what?

893
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,726
They'll take it right when we're done
and we're going to bed.

894
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,828
Seriously, so annoying.

895
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,997
I won't sleep for two hours
no matter what.

896
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,331
Eyes open.

897
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,733
"Give me back my phone!"

898
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,802
This is random, right?
You'll ambush us unexpectedly.

899
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,271
Yes, but we'll make sure
it's for two hours.

900
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,439
-Okay.
-Okay.

901
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,441
Didn't expect you to get them all right.

902
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,177
-Thanks.
-We have even have locks on them.

903
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,748
DIGITAL MINIMALISM
COMING SOON

904
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,318
Now, another important thing
is deciding when to wake up.

905
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,020
DECIDING WAKE-UP TIME

906
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,555
-Honestly, this is more important to me.
-Right.

907
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,025
-It's important to us all.
-Right, it is.

908
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,459
What game do you want to play?

909
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,495
We're not good at brain stuff.

910
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,196
No, we're not.

911
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,132
What game are we good at?

912
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,434
How about racing Jung Kook?

913
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,568
Push-ups?

914
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,736
Arm wrestling?

915
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,139
SHAKING HEAD

916
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,341
WE REFUSE PHYSICAL COMPETITION
WITH JUNG KOOK

917
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,543
-Or how about Cham Cham Cham?
-[director] Good.

918
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,211
I've gotten better at it.

919
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,782
I actually picked up a skill for it
in the army. Yes.

920
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,851
I didn't just waste
that year and a half, you know.

921
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:31,322
CHAM CHAM CHAM - 4 ROUNDS
MUK-JJI-PPA - 3 ROUNDS

922
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,726
IF THEY WIN ALL ROUNDS,
THEY CAN WAKE UP AT 10:30

923
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,828
-This is pretty big.
-But...

924
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,930
YOU WANT TO WAKE UP LATE?

925
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,867
-Why'd you do that?
-It's just...

926
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,869
If we win, it's good for the director too.

927
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,337
DIRECTOR, YOU WANT IT TOO?

928
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,539
Who's going first?

929
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,107
-Good luck.
-Let's go.

930
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,509
Wow. When we played yutnori the other day,

931
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,846
you were like, "Did you shout 'Go'?"
And now...

932
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,214
Did you shout "Go"?

933
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,749
Come on.

934
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,250
STAFF TRIED TO NITPICK

935
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,686

937
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,192
REVEALING HIS SKILL

938
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,428

Still got 30 minutes.

950
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,218
I'll try for 30 minutes too.

951
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,652
[Jimin] You must look up, okay?

952
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,588
EYES UP AND READY

953
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,623

-Keep the momentum going.
-Go now.

958
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,531
GAMES ARE ABOUT MOMENTUM

959
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,999
Cham, cham, cham!

960
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,567

962
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,138
WELL DONE

963
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,640
This is a good skill.

964
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,075
It's 8:30 for now.

965
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,343
Okay.

966
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,278

968
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,581
-Right.
-Just Muk-jji-ppa left.

969
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,883
Hey, use the skill.

970
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,851
How about that?

971
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,453
I'll go first then.

972
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,054
-Let's try one round each.
-Okay.

973
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,122

-Momentum.
-Momentum.

981
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,134
Should I go for one more?

982
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,803
-Or you?
-It's your momentum.

983
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,105

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,318

Sorry.

994
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,521
EMBARRASSED

995
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,622
It's okay.

996
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,292
What if I lose?
Okay, I'll try the last one.

997
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,726
FINAL SHOWDOWN FOR LAST 30 MIN

-Yeah.

1002
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,504
-Let's get to 9:30.
-9:30.

1003
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,006
Here we go, rock-paper-scissors.

1004
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,075
Rock-paper-scissors.

1005
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,810
Defense.

1006
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,178
PLEASE, DEFENSE

1007
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,246

BYE-BYE, SWEET 30 MINUTES

1011
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,087
No. Nine o'clock is...

1012
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,722
-That's not bad.
-It's good.

1013
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:21,292
I can wake up smiling at 9:00.

1014
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,328
MY HEART

1015
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,762
CALM DOWN

1016
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,297
But we leave at 10:30.

1017
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,633
Turns out Muk-jji-ppa
is bad for your heart.

TODAY'S FINAL ACTIVITY

1021
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,109
[Jung Kook] Right now.

1022
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,714
[singing]

1023
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,049
I want to experience the night.

1024
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:50,021
For the past three days,
we've been seeing such pretty things,

1025
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,357
but only in the daytime.

1026
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,125
I like nighttime,

1027
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:57,795
and I hear the nights in Switzerland
are incredible.

1028
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,332
[director] At night, in the Zermatt area
we're going to,

1029
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,235
-they have a stargazing tour.
-Really?

1030
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,070
[Jung Kook] Wow. What?

1031
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,006
JUNG KOOK'S LISTENING TOO

1032
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,340
I want to go.

1033
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,945
[director] We'll check
if we can make a reservation.

1034
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,213
Oh, thank you.

1035
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,248
It's an honor.

1036
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:22,086
But will we see stars
like we saw in New Zealand?

1037
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,788
That was legendary.

1038
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,189
-The Milky Way?
-Yeah.

1039
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,525
The Milky Way was really wow.

1040
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,295
It was the best. I even dreamed about it.

1041
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,729
-Let's take a selfie.
-Yeah.

1042
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,032
It's brighter than I thought.

1043
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,303
They were going to take our phones?

1044
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,274
Don't make me angry.

1045
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,878
ARRIVED AT STARGAZING TOUR SPOT

1046
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,579
This is where we see the stars?

1047
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,416
[director] We need to walk up
a bit from here.

1048
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,851
[Jimin] Need to go
where there's no light.

1049
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,054
It's here. Jung Kook.

1050
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,722
MOVING TO FIND BEST NIGHT SKY

1051
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,490
I can see some stars even now.

1052
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,125
Even though there's light.

1053
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,263
[Jimin] Darn these weeds.
Time to trim them down.

1054
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,898
STILL THINKING LIKE SERGEANT PARK

1055
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,537
-Wow, I can already see tons of stars.
-I know.

1056
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,439
Probably because of the altitude.

1057
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,540
I know.

1058
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,408
Where is it?

1059
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,177
Where could it be?

1060
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,847
Where?

1061
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,048
I think this is it.

1062
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,249
I think so too.

1063
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,884
ARRIVED SOON AT STARGAZING SPOT

1064
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,086
[Jimin] Wow.

1065
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,021
Hey, look up.

1066
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,824
-[Jung Kook] Wow.
-Hey, there are so many stars.

1067
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,058
[Jung Kook] I know. Wait.

1068
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,794
It'd be better if that light wasn't there.

1069
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,529
That orange color.

1070
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,666
[Jung Kook] Wow.
There really are lots of stars.

1071
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,434
-[Jimin] Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

1072
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,236
[Jimin] This is it.

1073
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,604
SCURRYING

1074
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,905
It's a prime spot.

1075
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,642
JUNG KOOK DISAPPEARING INTO DARKNESS
TO GET TO PRIME SPOT

1076
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,312
[Jung Kook exclaiming]

1077
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:58,916
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK WATCHING STARS
IN IDENTICAL POSES

1078
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:00,685
This is good.

1079
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,520
I can see them so well.

1080
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,858
COUNTLESS STARS EMBROIDER THE NIGHT SKY

1081
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,195
THEY CAN'T STOP EXCLAIMING

1082
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,764
[Jung Kook] I can't believe this.

1083
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,599
This is crazy.

1084
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:20,038
Honestly, it wasn't like this
on our way up.

1085
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,572
JUNG KOOK WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH

1086
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,042
[Jimin] This is insane. It's so romantic.

1087
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,644
ZERMATT'S BEAUTIFUL NIGHT SKY
HAS GOT THEM SPEECHLESS

1088
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,079
Wow, it's incredible.

1089
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,948
EMOTIONS THEY'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE
RUSHING IN

1090
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,317
[Jung Kook] I need to...

1091
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,520
capture this with a camera.

1092
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,754
DIGITAL LIGHT ATTACK

1093
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,890
WANTING TO KEEP IT LONGER BY TAKING PHOTOS

1094
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,925
Where's it? Oh, it's here. Geez.

1095
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,960
JUNG KOOK ATTEMPTING
TO PHOTOGRAPH NIGHT SKY

1096
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,195
[Jung Kook] Oh, sorry.

1097
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:47,799
[Jimin] Galaxy.

1098
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:51,335
JIMIN LEARNING HOW TO SHOOT ON YOUTUBE

1099
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,405
Timer two seconds.

1100
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,607
-Wait.
-Wow, look at this, Jimin.

1101
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,810
MEANWHILE, JUNG KOOK
SUCCESSFULLY TAKES A PHOTO

1102
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,877
Look.

1103
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,081
ZERMATT'S NIGHT SKY
PHOTOGRAPHED BY JUNG KOOK

1104
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,483
Wow, this is amazing, isn't it?

1105
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,785
[Jimin] Okay, I'll try too.

1106
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:08,886
I'm all set.

1107
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,289
JIMIN APPLYING WHAT HE JUST LEARNT

1108
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,825
[Jung Kook] Should I shoot in wide angle?

1109
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,828
I should try again with the wide angle.

1110
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,663
-[Jimin] Hey, we have a problem.
-What?

1111
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,699
[Jimin] I didn't know I had to hold it
for, like, 30 seconds.

1112
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,202
-I should put it down on the ground.
-I did that.

1113
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,237
[Jimin] Let me try this first.

1114
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,773
THE NIGHT SKY KEEPS MAKING THEM EXCLAIM

1115
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:37,648
JIMIN DOESN'T GIVE UP
AND PERSISTENTLY FILMS THE STARS

1116
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,256
-Shoot.
-Why?

1117
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,859
-What is it?
-I held it for 30 seconds, but...

1118
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,594
Did you take a photo of yourself?

1119
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,895
[both laughing]

1120
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,836
God. I was taking a picture of my face
for 30 seconds.

1121
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:02,140
THE RESULT OF 30 SECONDS OF PATIENCE:
JIMIN'S FACE SPARKLING LIKE A STAR

1122
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,077
Hope you have a good time with this.

1123
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,879
-[Jimin] Thank you.
-What is this?

1124
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,247
-[Jung Kook] What is it?
-This is...

1125
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,315
A GIFT FOR MORE SPECIAL MEMORIES

1126
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,317
[Jung Kook] What is this?
What could it be?

1127
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,520
-[Jimin] Wow, no way.
-What is this?

1128
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,522
[Jung Kook] Wow, it's whiskey.

1129
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,589
-Really?
-Yeah.

1130
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,959
[Jung Kook] And it's the whiskey
that was in the freezer.

1131
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:26,063
-They're really giving us a proper gift.
-Director, if you do this...

1132
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,565
I'll work hard at the games.

1133
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,201
-Hey, give them the phone.
-What?

1134
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,936
-Give them the phone.
-The phone?

1135
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,139
No.

1136
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,074
-Should we toast?
-Sounds so good.

1137
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,911
Good. But I'm really grateful for this.

1138
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,012
I know.

1139
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,848
Since we've just been discharged
from the military...

1140
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:44,916
You see this?

1141
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,918
Wow.

1142
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,286
Wow, drinking it from this?

1143
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,887
-This is...
-Cheers.

1144
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,890
CHEERS TO A DEEP NIGHT AND DEEP MEMORIES

1145
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,961
[Jimin] In the end, this world
is about emotions and romance.

1146
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,031
-It's kind of perfect right now.
-[Jung Kook] Right.

1147
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:01,966
[Jimin] It exploded.

1148
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,335
CHILLY SWISS NIGHT
A GLASS OF WHISKY WITH THE STARS

1149
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,804
THEY'LL NEVER FORGET TONIGHT'S STARRY SKY

1150
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,940
-Those stars over there...
-Yeah.

1151
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,108
-They're all twinkling. Just there.
-Yes.

1152
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,276
I see it too.

1153
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:16,547
And not just there.
There's a bunch of them over there, too.

1154
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:19,417
Yeah. You see that over there?

1155
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,320
I think that's the Milky Way. That part.

1156
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,422
Here. Don't you see some kind of a path?

1157
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,724
-Yeah.
-Right? That's the Milky Way.

1158
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:30,995
Gotta see them with your own eyes.

1159
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,830
Yeah, there's no other way.

1160
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:40,304
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK
QUIETLY GAZE AT THE NIGHT SKY

1161
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,244
[Jung Kook] I want to do a concert soon.

1162
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,112
[Jimin] Me too.

1163
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:54,352
[♪ upbeat music playing]

1164
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,856
THE COUNTLESS STARS
REMIND THEM OF THE ARMY

1165
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:05,329
THE MOMENTS THEY SHONE
WITH THE STARS CALLED THE ARMY

1166
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,167
THEY LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING THEM AGAIN

1167
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,203
Jimin, let's live hard tomorrow too.

1168
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,972
-Let's do that.
-That was so random.

1169
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,510
[Jung Kook] If a shooting star
passed by right now,

1170
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:21,279
that'd be awesome, right?

1171
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,615
[Jung Kook] I don't know why,
but only those stars are twinkling.

1172
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:25,683
-Oh!
-Oh!

1173
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:27,685
...are twinkling.

1174
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:28,753
-Oh!
-Oh!

1175
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:31,422
...are twinkling.

1176
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:32,490
-Oh!
-Oh!

1177
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,259
NOT A FROZEN SCREEN

1178
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:36,560
Make a wish.

1179
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,862
A shooting star, right?

1180
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:40,498
-Definitely.
-It fell vertically.

1181
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,166
Yeah. I saw it too.

1182
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,235
A SHOOTING STAR
A GIFT FROM THE SKY

1183
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,237
What's happening? Make a wish.

1184
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,305
Wow!

1185
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,173
[Jung Kook] We're seeing it here again.

1186
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,143
MAKING WISHES WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED

1187
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,681
WHAT ARE THEY SILENTLY WISHING FOR?

1188
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:59,116
I wished for BTS to last 40 more years.

1189
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,385
You can't say it out loud.

1190
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:04,255
What? It's my wish, not yours.

1191
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,724
If you say your wish...

1192
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,694
It'll be okay. It's my wish.
No one can touch that.

1193
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,762
This is the third one I've seen so far.

1194
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,165
-I saw one in Malta.
-Yeah.

1195
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,900
Do you know when the other time was?

1196
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,134
In the military.

1197
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,170
-Really?
-When I stayed outside one night.

1198
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:25,409
THE LOVE FOR THE SWISS NIGHT SKY
NEVER ENDS

1199
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,111
We even saw a shooting star.

1200
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,613
If we stay here,
I feel like we'll see one more.

1201
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,682
Was this arranged too?

1202
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,417
Isn't that usually your thing?

1203
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:34,685
[Jimin chuckles]

1204
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:36,020
The sky is your department.

1205
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:37,321
Everything's been arranged.

1206
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,758
So I told the moon
to move aside for tonight.

1207
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:41,926
[both chuckle]

1208
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,861
-[Jimin] Moon isn't visible, is it?
-No.

1209
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:46,664
I asked it to move aside
so we could see the stars tonight.

1210
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:48,199
So, was it an event?

1211
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,700
-The shooting star?
-Of course.

1212
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:53,070
But that wasn't discussed earlier,
so I'm touched.

1213
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:56,107
So it was kind of a surprise for a client?

1214
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:02,980
You know, when lightning strikes...

1215
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,383
-Yeah.
-...they try to time it

1216
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,752
-and end up doing it perfectly.
-Yeah.

1217
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:08,953
In those videos.

1218
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,255
But it's hard to capture shooting stars.

1219
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,124
It's not just hard, it's impossible.

1220
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,525
What if it happens now?

1221
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:17,528
Right now.

1222
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,363
Like this.

1223
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,533
Right now?

1224
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:24,969
Right now?

1225
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:28,873
[Jung Kook] This is so good.

1226
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:32,443
-But this stargazing thing...
-Yeah.

1227
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:37,515
[Jimin] I feel like
the memory fades quickly.

1228
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,283
-Why?
-I mean,

1229
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,818
there are good memories.

1230
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:43,020
For example, we went paragliding.

1231
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,122
-There are certain scenes.
-Yeah.

1232
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,124
Those remain as memories.

1233
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,393
The good feeling
of seeing the stars remains.

1234
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,895
Right, come to think of it.

1235
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,797
-Somehow, this...
-The scene?

1236
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,899
Yeah, the scene doesn't stick in memory.

1237
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,934
So it's shocking every time.

1238
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:00,638
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY EVERY SINGLE TIME
IS AS THRILLING AS THE FIRST TIME

1239
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,574
It's really nice.

1240
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,443
SAYING IT'S NICE FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME

1241
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,446
We would've regretted it
if we hadn't come here.

1242
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,381
It's cold, but it's so good.

1243
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,283
GLAD THEY DIDN'T MISS THIS MOMENT

1244
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,986
LOOKING AROUND

1245
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,423
Is the staff enjoying it?
Or are they cold?

1246
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,192
I'm really, really enjoying it.

1247
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,027
I don't care about the cold.

1248
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,729
They must be enjoying too.
They're seeing the same stars.

1249
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,964
[Jimin] I hope so.

1250
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:33,871
AN UNFORGETTABLE NIGHT FOR EVERYONE

1251
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,147
Jimin, this is crazy.

1252
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,648
This shot is crazy.

1253
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:45,983
So pretty.

1254
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,685
[Jimin] You're even giving us fire?

1255
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,155
-[Jimin] I'm flustered.
-Isn't this too cute?

1256
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,623
[Jimin sighs]

1257
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,494
It's nice.

1258
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,862
[sighs]

1259
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,830
This is how we heal again.

1260
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,368
-Are You Sure?! is always right.
-They were right.

1261
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,303
-Yeah, always right.
-Always.

1262
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,039
I want to keep doing this show.

1263
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,508
Except America, maybe?

1264
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,011
-That was really for you.
-Really.

1265
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:17,081
I lean, and I see only half the stars.

1266
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,618
Sing a song with the lyrics.

1267
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,653
TITLE:
I LEAN, AND I SEE ONLY HALF THE STARS

1268
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,358
♪ I lean, and I see only half the stars ♪

1269
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:35,399
♪ But behind them, there's a lot more ♪

1270
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,401
It'd be nice to see another shooting star.

1271
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,236
ONCE LAST SHOOTING STAR BEFORE LEAVING

1272
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,304
HELLO. MEOW

1273
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,372
It's a cat.

1274
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,541
-What?
-A cat is here.

1275
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,644
It's amazing
that we're meeting a cat like this.

1276
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,647
What was your nickname? Blue mold?

1277
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,749
-[Jimin] Mmm.
-Calico cat?

1278
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,050
-Calico cat.
-Calico cat?

1279
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,685
The cat came to you.

1280
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,086
You shouldn't touch it.

1281
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,521
I'll wash my hands later.

1282
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:00,257
I have cat allergies,
so I don't want to have one.

1283
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,226
-Yeah.
-But strangely, cats come to me.

1284
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:03,861
That's fate.

1285
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:06,430
But it's cute
that the cat came to the fire.

1286
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,498
Come here.

1287
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,366
TRYING TO TALK TO THE CAT

1288
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,035
HELLO. COME HERE.

1289
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,404
IS IT WORKING?

1290
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,039
[laughing]

1291
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,106
Cute.

1292
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,643
How can a cat be so gentle?

1293
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:23,280
SWISS CAT STICKING CLOSE TO CALICO CAT

1294
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:24,582
What are you looking for?

1295
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,617
INFINITE BUTT PATS

1296
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,352
Cats like butt pats.

1297
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,790
FOND MEMORIES PLUS A SWISS CAT
THANKS TO THE STARS

1298
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,993
So cute. Is it here because it's cold?

1299
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,762
I'M LEAVING. MEOW.

1300
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,497
[Jung Kook chuckles]

1301
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,366
It's so nice.

1302
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,669
SWITZERLAND, NIGHT SKY,
GLASS OF WHISKEY, TORCH, AND A CAT

1303
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:50,274
I think it's my first time gazing at stars
and fire at the same time.

1304
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,844
Wow. Hey, that star
has green and red light.

1305
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,846
That's a meteorite.

1306
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:57,982
Wow.

1307
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,516
It's a UFO.

1308
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,086
[Jimin] It's a UFO. It's a flying saucer.

1309
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:04,588
[Jung Kook] They're here to get us.

1310
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:05,723

1312
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,827
[Jung Kook] They're coming! No!

Just rock-paper-scissors, one round?

1319
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,088
One round. I'm playing rock.

1320
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,390
I'm playing rock too.

1321
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,525

Rock-paper-scissors.

[groans softly]

1332
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,923
What time did you go to bed last night?

JIMIN'S ALREADY AWAKE

1339
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:38,749
Hello.

1340
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,385
Good morning.

1341
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:44,221
-Did you sleep well?
-I slept really well.

1342
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,456
Okay, let's go.

1343
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,524
Where?

1344
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,329
Since you slept well, let's go.

1345
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,831
GO AWAY

1346
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,304
-Jung Kook...
-Yes.

1347
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,939
...hasn't woken up yet.

1348
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,073
He's up.

1349
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,408

-He's up.

1350
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:10,314
LET'S GO

[in English] Goodbye, Zermatt.

1355
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,802
[in Korean] I need to know
where we're going to say hello.

1356
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,477
LET'S JUST EAT FOR NOW

1357
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,713
[sighs] Delicious.

1358
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,984
JIMIN APPEARS

1359
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,887
-How have you been?
-I've been good.

1360
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,724
CAREFULLY CHOOSING JAM

1361
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:54,958
My whole body hurts.

1362
00:54:56,193 --> 00:55:00,397
SEVERE AFTERMATH OF SKIING

1363
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,967
SOMEONE'S JUST ENJOYING THE FOOD

1364
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,135
Avocados?

1365
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:06,970
HIS INTEREST: AVOCADO

1366
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,972
Avocados are so good for you.

1367
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,407
Good fat.

1368
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,076
-Oh, this is fat?
-Yeah.

1369
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,814
FIRST BITE OF GOOD FAT

1370
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,650
HEARTILY SPREADING BUTTER ON BREAD

1371
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,751
Butter is...

1372
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:22,419
Smooth like butter.

1373
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,087
Is it bad fat?

1374
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,991
I guess. Because it's delicious.

1375
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,131
SUDDENLY HEARING STAFF'S VOICES
(BOILED EGGS)

1376
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,265
What?

1377
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,201
LAUGHING

1378
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,204
-Did I buy boiled eggs?
-[director] Aren't these boiled eggs?

1379
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,840
Doesn't it mean
we could also eat them like that?

1380
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,075
[director] Let's test it then.

1381
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,644
Rock-paper-scissors
and smack it on the forehead.

1382
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,513
-It's a raw egg.
-A raw one?

1383
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,681
DEFINITELY A RAW EGG

1384
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,182
Cook the eggs, Jimin.

1385
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:54,551
-You want it?
-Breakfast should have eggs.

1386
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:55,853
Okay, wait.

1387
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,123
Season with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

1388
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,226
Season with salt and pepper and what?

1389
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,027
I've never done that.

1390
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,898
WATCHING

1391
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:09,766
-Look ahead.
-What is it?

1392
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,369
CUSTOMER BANNED FROM WATCHING

1393
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,838
Where's olive oil? Here?

1394
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:18,742
Wait, I need butter to make it smooth.

1395
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,278
Right, better with butter.

1396
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,148
-Smooth like butter.
-Like butter.

1397
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,017
HE MEANT EATING BUTTER

1398
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:30,787
♪ I can't eat flour ♪

1399
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:34,224
TOO MUCH SOULFUL EARLY IN THE MORNING

1400
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,826
How do you want it?

1401
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,296
I want it sunny side up, please.

1402
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:40,998
-Fully cooked?
-Sunny side up.

1403
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,333
Sunny side up?

1404
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,670
Yeah. Would that be hard?

1405
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,507
Have I ever gotten sunny side up right?

1406
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,477
How about scrambled eggs?

1407
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,846
-No, sunny side up.
-Okay.

1408
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,715
I'm nervous.

1409
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:02,953
My biggest challenge... on this trip.

1410
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,088
Needs lots of oil, right?

1411
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,156
[Jung Kook] Yes.

1412
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,693
-[Jimin] You don't like frying it?
-That's right.

1413
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,428
Is this right?

1414
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:13,297
CHECK AND DOUBLE

1415
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:18,101
SPREADING OIL EVENLY

1416
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,637
Season well with salt and pepper.

1417
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,372
That's another issue.

1418
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,808
How about adding that after it's done?

1419
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,043
Is that not good?

1420
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,811
What?

1421
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,314
I'll do it on low heat.

1422
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,283
Medium-low heat is better for fried eggs.

1423
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,219
Medium-low heat. Perfect.

1424
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:40,390
FIRST EGG DROPPED

1425
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,493
SECOND EGG IS ALSO SUCCESSFUL

1426
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,128
[Jung Kook] Looking forward to it.

1427
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,665
When you cut the yolk, it flows out.

1428
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:51,401
Richly flowing down.

1429
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,370
You know?

1430
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:54,504
You know what I mean?

1431
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,074
SO BUSY SMELLING THAT HE CAN'T HEAR

1432
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,544
SHAKING

1433
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,312
LET'S SEE

1434
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,782
What are you doing?

1435
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,984
I found salt.

1436
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,585
We have salt?

1437
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,320
SPRINKLING SALT WITH HIS MOUTH

1438
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:12,289
COMING OUT NOW

1439
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,359
PEPPER TOO

1440
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,562
SECOND BATTLE WITH OIL AFTER LAST NIGHT

1441
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:21,765
Jimin, do you have a problem with oil?

1442
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,900
[imitates splattering]

1443
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,637
When Jimin cooks, the food gets angry.

1444
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:30,807
GROWLING

1445
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,342
COMING OUT OF CURIOSITY

1446
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,644
What? The egg's shape is interesting.

1447
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,747
-[Jimin] It's like a croissant.
-Croissant.

1448
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,383
Jung Kook, it's almost done.

1449
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,219
Right. It looks so delicious.

1450
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,589
This is the best egg I've made in my life.

1451
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:46,857
-Really?
-Yes.

1452
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,626
Taking it out is hard, too.

1453
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,228
ENDLESS HARDSHIP

1454
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:55,198
GETTING LESS CONFIDENT NOW THAT IT'S DONE

1455
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:59,569
CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK THE YOLK

1456
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,638
JIMIN'S FRIED EGG IS FINALLY COMPLETE

1457
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,975
-Jung Kook, this one will taste better.
-Understood.

1458
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,244
-You did well.
-Really?

1459
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,813
You did well.

1460
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:12,482
You need ketchup with the eggs, right?

1461
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,650
That's right.

1462
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,120
A fried egg made by Jimin.

1463
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:19,456
[Jimin humming]

1464
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:21,124
SAVORING WITH HIS FOREHEAD

1465
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,726
-Jimin.
-Yes.

1466
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,729
Very crispy. The bottom is crispy.

1467
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,197
-This is so delicious.
-Good.

1468
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,399
[Jimin] I'll put some here.

1469
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,534
[Jung Kook] Thank you.

1470
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,702
-Amazing.
-Good.

1471
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,439
Gosh, we need rice now.
Jimin, can you make rice?

1472
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,107
At the next place.

1473
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,943
Hold that egg in your mouth
and eat it with rice then.

1474
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,413
PERFECT COMBO BITE INSTEAD OF RICE

1475
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,483
CHEF FINALLY TAKES A BITE

1476
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,617
Mmm.

1477
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:50,554
What should I eat this yolk with?

1478
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,056
I'm torn.

1479
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,124
VERY BIG CONCERN

1480
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:55,792
You know what?

1481
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,994
-I'll put this on it.
-Okay.

1482
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,162
And then...

1483
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:02,032
IN ONE BITE

1484
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,502
EVERY LAST PIECE

1485
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,104
I'm going to make a sandwich.

1486
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,171
CROISSANT SANDWICH

1487
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:11,541
Because Jimin made it
in the shape of a croissant,

1488
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,243
I'll take a croissant...

1489
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,512
and put some on it.

1490
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,448
EGG CROISSANT SANDWICH
1. CUT CROISSANT IN HALF

1491
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,751
2. PUT THEM TOGETHER AND PRESS FLAT

1492
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,087
3. PLACE JIMIN'S FRIED EGG ON ONE SIDE

1493
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:26,289
4. ADD HAM AND CHEESE

1494
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,991
5. ADD KETCHUP AND BUTTER

1495
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:30,260
6. COVER IT WITH THE OTHER HALF

1496
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:35,332
DELICIOUS BITE

1497
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,834
CHEF IS VERY SATISFIED

1498
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:41,238
LOST IN THE EGG CROISSANT

1499
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,807
VERY SATISFIED

1500
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,842
-This is good.
-That's good.

1501
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:49,846
I'll dip it like this in the yolk.

1502
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,317
I think people in other countries
will follow the recipe.

1503
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:57,053
I feel like it'll become a meme.

1504
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,491
Eating it the way Jung Kook ate it.

1505
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,793
-He says it's good.
-Wait! Avocado!

1506
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,162
DISCOVERS FORGOTTEN AVOCADO

1507
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,997
And they'll copy this too.

1508
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,331
RECOMMENDS ADDING AVOCADO

1509
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,933
When you have one bite left...

1510
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,935
-Yes.
-...you find the avocado.

1511
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:16,039
It was too heavy, but the avocado
makes it less heavy.

1512
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,707
It changes to a luxurious taste.

1513
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,376
Luxurious fattening taste?

1514
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,445
IF IT'S DELICIOUS,
IT'S ZERO CALORIES, YOU KNOW?

1515
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,416
ENJOYING EVEN THE LAST BITE

1516
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,251
Eating it like this is really good.

1517
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,420
Looks really delicious.

1518
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,658
IT'S NOT SOUP, IT'S MILK

1519
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,560
FINISHED ALL OF HIS BREAKFAST

1520
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:37,794
Thank you for the meal.

1521
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,629
I should shampoo,

1522
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,431
wash my face, and brush my teeth.

1523
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:45,001
PREPARING TO LEAVE

1524
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:52,676
JIMIN'S READY FIRST

1525
01:01:54,911 --> 01:02:01,017
JUNG KOOK FOLLOWS HIM OUT

1526
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,319
Shall we go now?

1527
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,954
-Yes.
-Let's go.

1528
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,156
Embarrassing.

1529
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,794
TRAIN RIDE
FERRY RIDE

1530
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,163
HOT TUG, DINNER, GAMES

1531
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,667
-[Jimin] We're taking this?
-Yes.

1532
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,837
MOVING TO TRAIN STATION VIA TAXI

1533
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,573
I should've slept early.

1534
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,342
I was on my phone.

1535
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,912
I fell asleep after watching
a Shin-chan short.

1536
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,280
Shin-chan short!

1537
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,783
-I did it wrong.
-I'm wrong!

1538
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:39,055
NOTHING TO SAY SINCE HE STARTED IT

1539
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,858
-I did it wrong.
-I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

1540
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,794
Mirror therapy is the answer.

1541
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:46,796
Mirror therapy!

1542
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:51,134
SCRATCHING

1543
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:54,771
HEADING TO THE TRAIN STATION

1544
01:02:55,939 --> 01:03:00,010
TAKING IN ZERMATT ONE LAST TIME

1545
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,580
CAUTION: TOO BRIGHT

1546
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:05,715
Too much sunlight.

1547
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,118
Vitamin D is exploding.

1548
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,420
Vitamin explosion!

1549
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,790
Mirror therapy properly.

1550
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:15,125
WILL BE FULLY CURED TODAY

1551
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,394
RUNNING TO THE TRAIN STATION

1552
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,096
[Jung Kook] Wow, everyone, good morning.

1553
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:25,035
Let's make it an energetic day
today as well.

1554
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,371
We're not late today, are we?
I feel relaxed.

1555
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,206
ENJOYING LEISURE THANKS TO HURRYING

1556
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,643
ARRIVED AT TRAIN STATION

1557
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,512
[Jimin] The train's arrived, Jung Kook.

1558
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,548
WHERE WILL THE NEXT DESTINATION BE?

1559
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,051
GOING STRAIGHT FIRST

1560
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,154
-Do you know where we're going?
-The 12:06 one.

1561
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,221
Ah.

1562
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,590
PLANNING TO TAKE THIS TRAIN

1563
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,159
IT'S JUNG KOOK

1564
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:55,932
NO IDEA

1565
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,901
Jimin left me behind.

1566
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,704
Hey, cute one.

1567
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,406
JUNG KOOK STOPPED TO LOOK AT A CUTE DOG

1568
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:05,809
What about Jung Kook?

1569
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,411
REALIZING JUNG KOOK'S
DISAPPEARANCE MUCH LATER

1570
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,948
Reunion.

1571
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:14,184
Where is it?

1572
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:16,152
Not here.

1573
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:20,323
All right. I've arrived at the train.

1574
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,925
Should I go inside?

1575
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:22,992
LOOKING FOR HIS SEAT

1576
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,060
That's it.

1577
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,595
JUNG KOOK SAFELY ARRIVED

1578
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:29,265
I'm here.

1579
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,373
-Entering. Hello.
-[man] Hello.

1580
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,209
Jimin, nice to see you.

1581
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,310
Nice to see you.

1582
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:41,778
NICE TO SEE YOU INDEED

1583
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:46,616
[Jung Kook] So where's
the next destination?

1584
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,118
It's written there. No?

1585
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,621
-We'll give you an address.
-Okay.

1586
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,556
-Check the address.
-Okay.

1587
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,659
Transfer if necessary and go to the place.

1588
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,194
-On our own?
-Yes.

1589
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,396
Shall we go?

1590
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:05,135
TODAY'S TRAVEL CONCEPT:
FIND DESTINATION ON YOUR OWN

1591
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,369
Oh, we got the address.

1592
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:09,205
-We did? Let's see.
-Yeah.

1593
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,974
The address is... What?

1594
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,876
A place called 633.

1595
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:16,012
-We need to get off at Visp here.
-Right.

1596
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,547
-Right?
-Yeah.

1597
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,549
It takes quite a while.

1598
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,918
-Spiez.
-Spiez.

1599
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,420
[Jimin] Transfer.

1600
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,923
Interlaken Ost.

1601
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,358
Transfer there.

1602
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,593
[Jung Kook] Then keep going, right?

1603
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,995
-Yeah.
-We can take IC6.

1604
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,463
And then...

1605
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,432
-What? IC6?
-Yes.

1606
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,267
Mine says IC8.

1607
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,536
Why are you cursing?

1608
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:44,507
DON'T GET HIM WRONG.
IT'S THE ACTUAL TRAIN NAME.

1609
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,209
No, I'm saying it shows IC8.

1610
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,678
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH

1611
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:51,948
Look at this here. It's right there.

1612
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:53,950
We need to take IC8 from here.

1613
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:57,253
But mine says IC6.

1614
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,521
Must be similar.

1615
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,024
-Right.
-If you refresh in real time.

1616
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,959
-Must be the same.
-Yeah.

1617
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,595
Let's get off at Visp.

1618
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,432
[director] Anyway, we have
quite a lot of staff members.

1619
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:12,469
-Fifteen people are moving together.
-Yes.

1620
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,904
[director] You have to lead everyone well.

1621
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:15,972
Us?

1622
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,440
MUST SAFELY LEAD STAFF TOO

1623
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,542
Aren't you all adults?

1624
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,945
LAUGHING

1625
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,648
-They're not kids.
-[Jung Kook] Exactly.

1626
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,351
They're all adults,

1627
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,987
so it's okay to get left behind.

1628
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:33,490
They can catch up later.

1629
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,959
JUNG KOOK ALWAYS MAKES SENSE

1630
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,528
EVERYONE'S AN ADULT,
BUT LET'S ALL GO TOGETHER

1631
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,129
TIME TO ENJOY PICTURESQUE SCENERY

1632
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,065
[Jung Kook] Mountains are really high.

1633
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,834
By the way,
the train runs so smoothly. No?

1634
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:47,136
-Yeah, I think so too.
-Right?

1635
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:51,941
You know, on railroad tracks,
there's wood between the metal.

1636
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:54,811
Do you know why it's wood?

1637
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,213
-I know.
-Why is it?

1638
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:01,050
The tracks are made of metal, right?

1639
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,453
-Yes.
-When it receives heat,

1640
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,989
it can expand and bend.

1641
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,056
Okay.

1642
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,425
But the wood in the middle,

1643
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,929
if it were metal,
the shape would change drastically.

1644
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:13,997
Okay.

1645
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,365
Right?

1646
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,799
I asked because I didn't know.

1647
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,736
Really? I was just guessing too.

1648
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,337
NEITHER OF THEM KNOWS

1649
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,506
-[Jung Kook] But I think you're right.
-Right?

1650
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,408
IN ANY CASE, IT WAS A VALUABLE TIME

1651
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:30,346
THE TRAIN KEEPS RUNNING
THROUGH SWISS NATURE

1652
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,750
ARRIVED AT VISP,
THEIR FIRST TRANSFER STATION

1653
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:36,085
This is our first transfer station.

1654
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,487
A PICTURE BEFORE GETTING OFF

1655
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,823
GETTING PUMPED BEFORE GETTING OFF

1656
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,626
Let's go. We need to get ready to get off.

1657
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,862
NERVOUS FOR NO REASON

1658
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:46,930
Let's go down.

1659
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,265
Let's board quickly.

1660
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,602
-We're IC6, okay?
-Okay.

1661
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,605
DOOR OPEN

1662
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,374
LET'S SEE

1663
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,376
Let's go down the stairs first.

1664
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,312
[Jimin] Let's go down here.

1665
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,213
[man in English] A ramp over there.

1666
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,381
[Jimin] This way.

1667
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:09,218
We only have seven minutes left.

1668
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,353
Should we run?

1669
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:15,458
Hold on. Where should we go?
I think we should go to the fifth floor.

1670
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,629
TRACK 4 - 7

1671
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,366
FOLLOWING THE SIGNS

1672
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:27,070
EYES SEARCHING FOR IC6 NON-STOP

1673
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:28,738
Where is it?

1674
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:29,973
CONFUSION - CHAOS

1675
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,741
Just look for IC.

1676
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,210
Isn't it there?

1677
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,311
That's it, right?

1678
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:37,146
-In the middle.
-In the middle?

1679
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,683
No, this is five and four.
We need to go that way.

1680
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,051
That's seven and six.

1681
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:44,354
Yeah, here.

1682
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,688
FINALLY FOUND IC6

1683
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:46,990
There's C here.

1684
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,428
STOPPING

1685
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:53,563
Is this right?

1686
01:08:56,032 --> 01:09:01,137
CAREFULLY CHECKING TRAIN INFORMATION BOARD

1687
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:04,207
PERFECT MATCH

1688
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,475
Is everyone here?

1689
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,609
CHECKING ON STAFF

1690
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:08,811
-We can go, Jung Kook.
-Let's go.

1691
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:10,780
Let's go up now.

1692
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:15,151
PEACE OF MIND RETURNED
AFTER THEY FOUND THE TRANSFER GATE

1693
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,321
[Jung Kook] You can just hold here.

1694
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:21,624
SMART BUT CLUMSY...
CLUMSY BUT COOL...

1695
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,559
Here, here.

1696
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,361
TOO EARLY TO RELAX

1697
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,363
What is it?

1698
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,165
This one. On our right.

1699
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:31,501
We need to go to number one.

1700
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,736
-What?
-Our seats.

1701
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,905
We have a minute before departure.

1702
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:37,874
Let's just board then.

1703
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:39,942
This must be it, right?

1704
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,278
Just board.

1705
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,147
-Just board.
-Just board.

1706
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:45,348
-Don't know.
-Don't know.

1707
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,716
Whatever.

1708
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:47,850
Just board.

1709
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,586
BOARDED SUCCESSFULLY

1710
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:51,854
[Jimin] Where is it?

1711
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,357
Whatever. Let's just board.

1712
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:55,892
THE PATH I TAKE IS THE ANSWER

1713
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,627
Jung Kook's just going in?

1714
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:01,230
Perfect.

1715
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,399
JUNG KOOK SUCCESSFULLY SEATED

1716
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:04,934
I don't know either.

1717
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:07,136
WHATEVER

1718
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,907
-The air conditioner's working.
-I don't know. We can sit anywhere, right?

1719
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:14,544
-No?
-We're VIPs, so it doesn't matter, right?

1720
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,746
That's right. Don't worry.

1721
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:20,383
Everyone, I'll guide you safely.
Directors.

1722
01:10:21,117 --> 01:10:22,318
MOVING TO SPIEZ STATION

1723
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,054
This time, we just need to get to Spiez.

1724
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,491
That's the next station.

1725
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,792
What?

1726
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:32,628
-That's right. It takes 26 minutes.
-Yes.

1727
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:33,696
Good, good.

1728
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:35,198
GAINED 26 MINUTES OF REST TIME

1729
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:37,533
RELIEVED

1730
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,837
We're going to Interlaken now.

1731
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,873
In about 40 minutes...

1732
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,143
we'll transfer to another train...

1733
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,080
and then walk to the destination.

1734
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,082
How many minutes left?

1735
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,085
It's... Nine minutes.

1736
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:58,354
-Nine minutes?
-Yes.

1737
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,455
Yep.

1738
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,726
WHILE ENJOYING SWISS SCENERY,
NINE MINUTES FLY BY

1739
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:07,063
-[director] Listen.
-Yes?

1740
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,932
The train tracks to Interlaken
have been broken.

1741
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,203
Let's get off as soon as possible.

1742
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,271
Okay.

1743
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:16,773
-We'll get out?
-[director] Yes.

1744
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,308
What? Why is it broken?

1745
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,376
It can't be helped.

1746
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,979
TRYING TO STAY CALM

1747
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,782
-We just needed to transfer once.
-[Jung Kook] I know, right?

1748
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:27,750
DISAPPOINTED

1749
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:28,985
Let's go.

1750
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,254
Let's go.

1751
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,823
[Jung Kook] I got caught in it.

1752
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,691
-[Jimin] Must get our suitcases.
-Right.

1753
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,560
-Up there.
-You put it up there?

1754
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:41,931
NOT FORGETTING TO GET THE LUGGAGE

1755
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,332
Broken, broken.

1756
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:47,470
So, what do we do now?
Should we take a bus?

1757
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:49,405
STEPPING OUTSIDE

1758
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,606
This place is pretty.

1759
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:54,177
Our fate. Oh, it's so bright here.

1760
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:57,847
THEY GOT HERE BY CHANCE, BUT IT'S PRETTY

1761
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,982
From Interlaken to Spiez...

1762
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,618
There's a ferry.

1763
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:05,955
Looks like it operates on that lake.

1764
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:07,089
JIMIN FOUND A FERRY

1765
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,592
Spiez Lake Thun... Is it that one?

1766
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,596
JIMIN'S CHOICE
LAKE THUN FERRY

1767
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,299
LAKE THUN FERRY
SWISS PUBLIC TRANSPORT

1768
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,367
DEPARTING FROM INTERLAKEN

1769
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:22,805
LIKE A BUS, YOU CAN GET ON AND OFF
AT EVERY DOCK

1770
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:23,873
Oh!

1771
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,709
-Hold on.
-There's one.

1772
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:28,878
This one, the 3:28 one.

1773
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:32,348
Then how about we eat first?

1774
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:34,784
-There's a restaurant nearby.
-Okay. Let's go.

1775
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,353
Here. Let's go. Let's walk there.

1776
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,089
ONE HOUR UNTIL DEPARTURE
LET'S FILL OUR STOMACHS FIRST

1777
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:41,457
Let's go down.

1778
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,794
LET'S GO EAT!

1779
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,330
Let's take a ferry.

1780
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:48,497
OUR ONLY HOPE IS A FERRY

1781
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,434
Let's just take a ferry.

1782
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,636
-There's shade here. Shade!
-Hey.

1783
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,938
-On our right.
-Shade!

1784
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:57,006
Come into the shade.

1785
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,307
CHECKING ON THE STAFF

1786
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:00,576
Let's go!

1787
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:03,679
This is what traveling is.

1788
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,181
UNPREDICTABLE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE

1789
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:06,382
Go straight, right?

1790
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,785
Just go straight this way. Straight.

1791
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:11,687
It's hot.

1792
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:13,422
MAX TEMPERATURE: 29 DEGREES

1793
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,157
I'd do anything for a bicycle.

1794
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,994
I want a scooter so bad.

1795
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,595
SCOOTER PASSING BY

1796
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:23,499
I want a bike like that even more.

1797
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,502
-How about renting a motorcycle?
-A motorcycle?

1798
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,037
What about the luggage?

1799
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:31,841
Let's just go.

1800
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,411
We're almost there.

1801
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:40,750
COMING ACROSS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING

1802
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:44,754
That building is pretty too.
What could it be? A church? A castle?

1803
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:47,924
Oh! It's Spiez Castle.

1804
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:49,792
It's really pretty.

1805
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:50,860
IT'S SPIEZ CASTLE

1806
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,628
I want to live in a place like that.

1807
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:56,232
It's so nice. It's pretty. It really is.

1808
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,601
-Where is it?
-Over there.

1809
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,403
-Do we need to go inside?
-Yes.

1810
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,671
We're almost here.

1811
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,540
[in English] Okay. I got it. I understand.

1812
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,642
TODAY'S JOURNEY
MUST BE A BIT TOUGH FOR HIM

1813
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,711
The water is pretty.

1814
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:10,579
Why is this place so pretty?

1815
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:11,948
EVERYTHING'S PRETTY IN SPIEZ

1816
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,583
Isn't this place insane as well?
Wow, this is so pretty.

1817
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,285
What a beautiful place!

1818
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:20,389
FINALLY ARRIVING AT DOCK
AFTER GOING THROUGH BEAUTIFUL SCENERY

1819
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,590
[Jung Kook] I can breathe now.

1820
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:24,493
COOLING OFF FOR A MOMENT

1821
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,897
[in Korean] It was hot when we were
walking, but the sun hid a bit now.

1822
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,165
Wow, look at the clouds.

1823
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:33,836
AFTER STOPPING, THEY CAN FINALLY SEE
THE BEAUTIFUL SKIES OVER SPIEZ

1824
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,271
Hey, let's go get hot dogs.

1825
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,940
-We have to eat hot dogs.
-They looked good.

1826
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:39,275
For eight francs,

1827
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,945
they give you one with two sausages.

1828
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:44,013
What?

1829
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,382
The most expensive hot dog.

1830
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,950
-The eight-franc one?
-Yeah.

1831
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:49,919
No, it'll be too salty.

1832
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:52,588
No, I want to eat that.

1833
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,756
Too salty.

1834
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,158
WHAT?

1835
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,693
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Okay.

1836
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,029
-Best of three?
-No, one round.

1837
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:01,964
-One round? You won't regret it?
-No.

1838
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:03,466
-No?
-You think I'll regret it?

1839
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,835
Wow, you're going to lose.

1840
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,336
One round? Loser pays.

1841
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:09,505
Rock-paper-scissors.

1842
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:12,041
TIE

1843
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,043
WHY IS THIS SO NERVE-RACKING?

1844
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,177
Rock-paper-scissors.

1845
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,979
JIMIN WINS

1846
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:19,115
UGH

1847
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,249
Go get it.

1848
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:27,323
JUNG KOOK GOING TO ORDER HOT DOG

1849
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,226
I just lost half of my stamina.

1850
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,528
RELIEVED

1851
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:34,597
What's the expensive one?

1852
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:35,765
ENTERING HOT DOG SHOP

1853
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,333
LOOKING FOR WHAT JIMIN MENTIONED

1854
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,667
No, these are drinks.

1855
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:44,540
FOUND HOT DOG MENU

1856
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,776
[in English] Two double, please.

1857
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,144
-[cashier] Two?
-Yeah.

1858
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,281
[in Korean] Wait, it's nine francs.

1859
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:55,351
IT'S TOO MUCH

1860
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:58,621
DESPITE THE PRICE,
JUNG KOOK BOUGHT IT FOR JIMIN

1861
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,356
TWO SAUSAGES

1862
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:01,490
Enjoy your meal.

1863
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,926
This looks more delicious,
so I'll eat this one.

1864
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,495
[Jimin] Why didn't you
buy the same one?

1865
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,763
I ordered the same one.

1866
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,932
-Oh, really? I see.
-Yes.

1867
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:11,534
Mine's double too.

1868
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,570
But somehow yours has more stuff in it.

1869
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:16,338
-Should I give you some of it?
-No.

1870
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,475
What? They made it crispy.

1871
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:22,611
HOW DOES THE DOUBLE HOT DOG TASTE
IN SPIEZ? - CRISPY

1872
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:24,447
Mmm!

1873
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,583
CRISPY

1874
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:32,254
FOREHEAD SAYS IT ALL

1875
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:33,923
[Jimin] Mmm.

1876
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:35,758
Okay, take it and eat comfortably.

You came after the smell, huh?

1882
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,174
Who came?

1883
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:55,678
SPIEZ NEIGHBORHOOD BOSS, 'SPARROW'

There are a lot of people.

1903
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:08,517
CROWDED DUE TO TRACK BREAKDOWN

1904
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:10,386
There really are a lot of people.

1905
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:13,389
SUCCESSFULLY BOARDED
WE'RE TAKING A FERRY

1906
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:19,628

1907
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,199
HI THERE

1908
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,467

-It's cool.
-Can we just stand like this?

1910
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,138
LOOKING AROUND THE FERRY

1911
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:32,141
It's nice and cool. God, I can breathe.

1912
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,443
PLANNING TO ENJOY LAKE THUN COOLLY

1913
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,914
IS IT COMING OUT WELL?

1914
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,218
[Jung Kook] Ahh. I can breathe.

1915
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,820
WE'RE HEADING TO INTERLAKEN NOW

1916
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,057

1917
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:51,527

[Jimin] So beautiful.

1919
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,268
TAKING IN THE SCENERY OF LAKE THUN
WITH THEIR EYES

1920
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,707
JUNG KOOK COMPLETELY CAPTIVATED
BY LAKE THUN

1921
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,742
Wow.

1922
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,779
This is good. This is nice.

1923
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:12,781
[Jimin] Upstairs is good.

1924
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,551
But it feels like it might rain.

1925
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,654
CLOUDY LAKE THUN
MAKES THEM EVEN MORE SENTIMENTAL

1926
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,357
But wouldn't the rain here be clean?

1927
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,127
Walking around in the rain here
would be really nice.

1928
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,197
When else would we get rained on?

1929
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:33,135
SWISS MAGIC THAT TURNS
EVEN CLOUDY WEATHER INTO ROMANCE

1930
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,904
ENJOYING PRETTY SCENERY...

1931
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,210
WHAT?

1932
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,480
THEN ACTING CUTE ON CAMERA

1933
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,983
What, are you acting cute?

1934
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,051
No.

1935
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:52,421
HE'S ADORABLE

1936
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:53,555
Shall we go down now?

1937
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,124
LET'S GO DOWN

1938
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,258
No.

1939
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:57,660
You want to be downstairs?

1940
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,528
No, there's no place to sit here.

1941
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:01,764
Then go downstairs.
I'll stay here a bit longer.

1942
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,998
Okay, I'll go down.

1943
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,067
DECIDING TO STAY DOWNSTAIRS

1944
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,603
I'll come up if it's hot.
I should order a beer.

1945
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:09,772
Wait, with our money?

1946
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:12,975
It's hot.

1947
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:20,182
JUNG KOOK, WHO SEEMED LIKE HE WAS
ABOUT TO DRINK BEER ON THE 1ST FLOOR

1948
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,384
YAWNING

1949
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:33,662
HE MUST HAVE BEEN TIRED.
HE FELL ASLEEP.

1950
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:36,799
It's not that cool now,
so I want to go down.

1951
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,435
JIMIN EVENTUALLY GOES DOWN

1952
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,669
It's not cool upstairs.

1953
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:42,371
[woman] It's really hot downstairs.

1954
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:43,439
Oh, really?

1955
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,640
NEWS: FIRST FLOOR IS HOT

1956
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:46,241
Did Jung Kook buy beer?

1957
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:47,343
[woman] He's sleeping.

1958
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,411
How does he sleep?

1959
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:52,348
LIKE THIS?

1960
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:58,187
JIMIN HAS COME OUT
TO THE 1ST FLOOR OUTDOOR AREA

1961
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,688
This is much better.

1962
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:01,724
Pretty.

1963
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:07,930
We were there.

1964
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,801
We were over there. We've come so far.

1965
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,672
This lake is huge.

1966
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,274
It's this big, but it's not the ocean.

1967
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:23,879
JUNG KOOK IN DEEP SLEEP

1968
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:26,148
STARTLED

1969
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,389
It's hot.

1970
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,758
It's so hot.

1971
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,597
JUNG KOOK ALSO GOES TO WHERE JIMIN IS

1972
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,432
-[Jimin] Did you sleep a bit?
-Yeah.

1973
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:44,967
I woke up because it's hot.

1974
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,034
FOUND COMFORT AGAIN

1975
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,403
It's like a sauna.

1976
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:48,971
I feel so hot.

1977
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:04,052
FRIENDLY SHOULDER HUG

1978
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,687
FRIENDLY SHOULDER HUG???

1979
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,822
Smells good, right?

1980
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:11,493
PASSED OUT WITH EYES OPEN

1981
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:14,630
-It's huge.
-Huh?

1982
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,665
It's huge.

1983
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:20,002
The color of the water
is prettier on the other side.

1984
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,069
What?

1985
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,739
There are birds flying over there.

1986
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,874
This side is pretty too.

1987
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,310
[man] Go to the other side.

1988
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:30,179
The other side? Are there seats?

1989
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,447
[man] We saved seats.

1990
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:32,514
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

1991
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,483
MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE

1992
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:38,887
WHO IS HE GREETING?

1993
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,123
That baby is so cute.

1994
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,430
How long are you going to wave for?
How long?

1995
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:52,034
So cute. He must be a little kid.

1996
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:55,571
We have to get off at the next stop.

1997
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,240
I know. We'll go through the river now.

1998
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:02,177
I wonder how clean the water must be
to look like this.

1999
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,179
A lot of people get off here.

2000
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,248
This must be a good place.

2001
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:12,254
EMERALD COLORED LAKE THU
WAS FORMED BY MELTED GLACIERS

2002
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:16,692
THE WATER IS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR,
AND MANY PEOPLE ENJOY WATER ACTIVITIES

2003
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:18,594
Should we swim during the day?

2004
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,096
That dog is so cute.

2005
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,664
So excited.

2006
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:23,966
-Retriever?
-Yeah.

2007
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:27,236
-Its steps show how excited it is.
-Yes.

2008
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,471
SO EXCITED, WOOF!

2009
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,974
That dog really doesn't listen.

2010
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,375
So excited.

2011
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:36,078
WE'LL BE THIS EXCITED SOON TOO

2012
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:38,347
Its butt went in the water.
It's excited now.

2013
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,683
-It refused at first.
-Because it's cool.

2014
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,652
Then it realized how cool it was.

2015
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,020
[Jung Kook] It's so excited.

2016
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:46,288
[Jimin] It's going crazy.

2017
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:48,390
That video was really funny.

2018
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,092
Retrievers are dumb, apparently.

2019
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:53,128
Right. A thief came in,
and it played with him.

2020
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:56,164
They're actually really smart,

2021
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,499
but dumb at the same time.

2022
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,701
-Is that RM?
-Right.

2023
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:02,471
Dumb dog.

2024
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:06,208
ONLY RM WILL FEEL FOREVER WRONGED

2025
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:08,210
Seems like we're going that way.

2026
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:09,745
INTERLAKEN DOCK COMING INTO VIEW

2027
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,614
Let's go get ready to get off.

2028
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:15,384
-[Jung Kook] Let's get off.
-Wow, it's so pretty.

2029
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,185
The final stop is so pretty too.

2030
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,554
Let's go.

2031
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,122
[Jimin] That was tough.

2032
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,823
We're in Interlaken.

2033
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,860
Since the train tracks were broken,

2034
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:26,995
we had to take a ferry.

2035
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,032
We were supposed to arrive
an hour and a half ago.

2036
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,099
I know.

2037
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,834
Our tour car is here.

2038
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,902
[Jimin laughs]

2039
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:36,305
-Buddy.
-Buddy, you were waiting.

2040
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:38,340
Oh, this is good.

2041
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,108
Feels good. It's been a while.

2042
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,944
Let's go.

2043
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,412
Turn on the air conditioner.

2044
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:46,181
POWER COOLING ON IMMEDIATELY

2045
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,382
This is so cool.

2046
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,685
Right, it's so thrilling right now.

2047
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,853
We're going to Brienz Lake now, right?

2048
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,122
-Our first... Yes.
-Destination.

2049
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,958
Thirty minutes? It's close.

2050
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:00,128
SETTING OFF TO BRIENZ RIGHT AWAY

2051
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,130
Hey, this is so pretty here too.

2052
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:04,333
Each city has a different feel.

2053
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,835
A CITY WITH A DIFFERENT AMBIENCE
FROM SPIEZ

2054
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,973
LOCATED BETWEEN
LAKE THUN AND LAKE BRIENZ

2055
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,043
A CITY FULL OF TRAVELERS' ENERGY

2056
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:19,481
INTERLAKEN

2057
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:21,717
-It's so nice because it's cool.
-Yes.

2058
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,119
[Jimin] Nice being in this car again
after a while.

2059
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,621
[Jung Kook] I can breathe now.

2060
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:28,824
DRIVING WITH THE AC ON
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE

2061
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:32,661
[Jimin] You know what?
I really like these roundabouts.

2062
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,296
We don't have to stop.

2063
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,898
Yes, the encircling never stops.
It's so great.

2064
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:41,236
You know what they introduced.
Roads that never have traffic jams.

2065
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:44,373
They're all like this. Roundabouts.

2066
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:46,575
And the way they yield is great.

2067
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:49,444
-One car passes, then another passes.
-Right.

2068
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:52,781
So as long as you yield
to those already in the circle...

2069
01:25:52,848 --> 01:25:53,849
Right.

2070
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,418
OUT OF THE CITY CENTER

2071
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,987
IT STARTS DRIZZLING

2072
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:02,024
The lake here is so nice too.

2073
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:04,760
This place feels kind of different.

2074
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:08,897
-But this city seems to go well with rain.
-[Jimin] Right.

2075
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:11,099
[Jung Kook] Damp like this.

2076
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,902
[Jimin] Isn't the color
suddenly a bit different too?

2077
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:15,404
-[Jung Kook] Right.
-Right?

2078
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,572
-[Jimin] Roof colors are different too.
-Yes.

2079
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,942
[Jung Kook] Less flashy,
but deep and soft.

2080
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,879
-Yes. Should I say the colors blend well?
-[Jung Kook] Right.

2081
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,914
-[Jimin] So charming.
-Definitely different.

2082
01:26:25,981 --> 01:26:27,249
Brienz

2083
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:30,385
The roof colors
are just so good right now.

2084
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:32,087
[humming]

2085
01:26:32,154 --> 01:26:34,222
Ji-seg-ddak-nuh-jot.

2086
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:35,624
What?

2087
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:38,026
"The colors right now are just so good"?

2088
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,429
HERE HE GOES AGAIN...

2089
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,697
King Sejong!

2090
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:43,632
I'm sorry!

2091
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,101
My little brother is immature.

2092
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:47,769
FINDING IT SO FUNNY

2093
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:50,439
I started it. I'm sorry.

2094
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:51,973
Si-jeo-jae!

2095
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:58,814
[Jung Kook] The rain's getting heavier.

2096
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,048
RAIN GETTING HEAVIER

2097
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:04,953
You know, we can only see
the trees and the lake here.

2098
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,855
It really looks like a movie scene.

2099
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:08,924
Yeo-jin-jang?

2100
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,560
THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT

2101
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:14,262
Why do you sound so weak?
Put more energy into it.

2102
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:15,330
Han-se!

2103
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,600
This is ridiculous, but funny.

2104
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:19,668
Uh-woot!

2105
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:22,804
Uh-woot!

2106
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:26,708
Hey, if it's outdoors where we're going,

2107
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:29,511
then doing something in the rain
would be really nice.

2108
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,446
-Right.
-That's what's romantic.

2109
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:34,082
[Jung Kook] There are cool guys here too.

2110
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:35,183
[Jimin] You're right.

2111
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,052
[Jung Kook] A romantic bicycle.

2112
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:38,820
That's what's romantic.

2113
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:42,190
That's romance.

2114
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,493
-I want to get rained on out there.
-What?

2115
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:46,495
I'll drive and go ahead.

2116
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:48,130
Please pull up over there.

2117
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,297
No, no.

2118
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:52,934
It's pretty. So pretty!

2119
01:27:59,074 --> 01:28:02,244
FORCED ROMANTIC EXPERIENCE

2120
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,013
JUNG KOOK ALSO STARTING ROMANTIC DRIVE

2121
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:08,250
[whoops]

2122
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:12,587
MAN SOAKED IN ROMANCE

2123
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:14,790
MAN JUST SOAKED IN RAIN

2124
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,793
STILL LOVING IT

2125
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,428
FEELING BRIENZ'S VIBE WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

2126
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:23,298
-So nice!
-That's what I'm talking about!

2127
01:28:23,365 --> 01:28:25,634
TWO GUYS MAKING ANOTHER MEMORY IN THE RAIN

2128
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,835
ALREADY NEAR DESTINATION

2129
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:27,936
[Jimin] We're here.

2130
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:30,305
[Jung Kook] Is this it?

2131
01:28:30,372 --> 01:28:34,242
[car alarm beeping]

2132
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:38,346
Let's get out.

2133
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:40,315
-Get out right away?
-Yeah.

2134
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:42,818
-Should we stop this? After one clap?
-We can.

2135
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:44,853
12 YEAR IDOLS DECIDING
THE ENDING THEMSELVES

2136
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,756
The rear one will capture it too, right?
One, two, three.

2137
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:53,728
Waste of storage.

2138
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:55,230
The rear one is a bit far.

2139
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:57,365
Don't look down on me.

2140
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,768
I'll hold you.

2141
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,903
What good is holding my butt?

2142
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,874
Hey, how do we film us getting out, then?

2143
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:07,375
Should we turn it back on?

2144
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:11,346
Now, this is a separate recording.
We couldn't film us getting out.

2145
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:14,115
Getting out together like this.
You know, right?

2146
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,754
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

2147
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:25,060
Before we could film ourselves
getting out,

2148
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:27,796
we clapped and stopped the cameras.

2149
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:31,266
But we turned on the center camera
and made a separate recording.

2150
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,434
Take it out.

2151
01:29:32,968 --> 01:29:34,302
Take it.

2152
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,871
Take it and get lost.

2153
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:38,874
I knew it.

2154
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,276
On a day like this,
you should walk in the rain.

2155
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:44,713
There's something scary
about trips, everyone.

2156
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,015
You shouldn't travel too often.

2157
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:50,418
You forget how precious they are.

2158
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,387
You start craving beer.

2159
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:54,122
BIG PROBLEM: BEER COMING TO MIND

2160
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:55,490
When I was driving here...

2161
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,859
the trees, the lake...

2162
01:29:57,926 --> 01:29:59,928
MEANWHILE, MAN DRUNK ON ROMANCE HERE

2163
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:01,863
...and the rain, the three together...

2164
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:04,799
Wow, I was amazed the whole way
while driving.

2165
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:07,369
I almost flew off while driving.

2166
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:09,371
To the lake.

2167
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,907
This place is quite local, they say.

2168
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,541
-[Jimin] Are you ready?
-Yes.

2169
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:14,843
[Jimin] I'll open the door.

2170
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:18,413
Hey, this is so nice.

2171
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,650
Saying it's nice as soon as I walk in.

2172
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:23,752
Can we go in with our shoes on?

2173
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,820
I think they wear shoes inside here.

2174
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:28,056
But this place has low ceilings.

2175
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:30,692
That's actually better.
It has a good vibe.

2176
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,428
I'd like it
if a lizard or something came out.

2177
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:37,632
♪ Want to come change clothes with me? ♪

2178
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:38,900
GOING TO CHANGE CLOTHES

2179
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:42,771
WHILE THEY GET CHANGED

2180
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:45,307
THE BRIENZ SKY CLEARS UP

2181
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:50,712
WHAT ROMANTIC JOURNEY AWAITS IN BRIENZ?

2182
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,014
-Why was this made? Who made it?
-[man] Hey, guys.

2183
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:54,816
[Jung Kook] I'm getting nervous too.

2184
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:56,718
Getting a bit nervous.

2185
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:59,154
-Jung Kook, you can get ready.
-Okay.

2186
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,489
WHAT MAKES JUNG KOOK NERVOUS IS...

2187
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:03,625

THRILLING CANYON SWING!

2188

-This way. Yeah?
-[in English] Okay.

2190
