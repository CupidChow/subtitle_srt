A TASTE YOU CAN'T STOP EATING

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,434
It's so good. It's really good.

7
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,502
HUGE SUCCESS

[Jung Kook] This place
feels like Europe.

00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,680
A DRINK IN ZURICH, EUROPEAN VIBES

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,883
THEY ENJOY THE VEAL THEY'VE WANTED TO TRY

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,485
EVEN TENDER FISH, CLEARED

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,353
-It was good.
-I think that was great.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,322
I think we should take a photo here.

18
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,057
CAPTURING BEST MOMENTS

19
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,259
Curious about Switzerland in the winter.

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,761
THEY'D LOVE TO COME AGAIN

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,563
[Jung Kook] Tonight is our last night.

22
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,630
FINAL NIGHT HERE

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,165
Where are we heading next?

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,300
[Jimin] Going to Korea?

25
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,568
A NEW JOURNEY BEGINS

26
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,769
FLUSTERED

27
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,671
Why are we transferring in Korea?

28
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,540
WHAT'S THEIR NEXT DESTINATION?

29
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,011
AFTER A LONG FLIGHT,
THEY FINALLY ARRIVE IN KOREA

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,414
AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE, CAMERAS ARE ON

31
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,217
We've arrived in Korea.

32
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:29,590
QUICKLY PACK UP AND GET READY TO GET OFF

33
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,724

36
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:43,937
AFTER THANKING THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
FOR A COMFORTABLE FLIGHT...

37
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,273
WRAPPING UP THEIR SWISS TRIP

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,108
[Jung Kook] Thank you for everything.

39
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,677
I really enjoyed Switzerland.

40
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,049
[Jimin in Korean] To transfer, we don't
have to go out and come back in, right?

41
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,086
WAIT, THE TRANSFER IN KOREA IS REAL?

42
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,289
10 HOURS EARLIER... SWISS AIRPORT LOUNGE

43
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,924
-[director] Okay, guys.
-Yes?

44
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,926
[director] Are You Sure?! isn't over yet.

45
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,461
It's not over yet.

46
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,229
All right. Now...

47
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,931
ASSESSING THE SITUATION

48
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,300
This is the kit for your next destination.

49
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,304
CHECKING THE KIT FIRST

50
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,240
Why do I not have it?

51
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,209
[Jung Kook] Open it up.

52
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,478
We're going to Vietnam?

53
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,280
The next destination

54
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,282
is Da Nang, Vietnam.

55
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,350
Da Nang.

56
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,956
A RELAXING COASTAL CITY
WHERE THE SEA MEETS THE HEART OF THE CITY

57
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,260
A GOURMET PARADISE FILLED WITH FLAVORS

58
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,298
A THRILLING HAVEN FOR LEISURE,
WHERE YOU RIDE WAVES THROUGH WIND

59
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,670
ARE YOU SURE?! SEASON 2 IN DA NANG

60
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,906
[director] While Jimin
and I were chatting earlier...

61
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,842
SOMETHING CAME TO MIND

62
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,145
-Right.
-Why? What?

63
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,980
Did you kind of guess it?

64
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,416
I've been wanting to visit Southeast Asia.

65
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,484
-But I couldn't bring myself to go.
-Right.

66
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,654
It had to be Southeast Asia?

67
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,557
Yeah, and it was Vietnam specifically.

68
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,960
I talked about
how there are good dishes in Vietnam.

69
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,429
And now we're really going.

70
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,964
-Right away.
-Is this right?

71
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,035
This is right. Then everyone,
we're heading straight to Vietnam.

72
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,806
Wow, it's been ages
since I've been to Southeast Asia.

73
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,007
How many years?

74
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,310
SECURITY CHECK IN PROGRESS

75
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,678
CLEARED

76
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,848
THE PRODUCTION CREW SUDDENLY IN A RUSH?

77
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,783
RETREAT

78
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,251
[Jung Kook] That's thrilling.

79
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,486
I forgot my passport.

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,255
I made such a crucial mistake.

81
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,493
If I'd lost my passport,
I wouldn't be able to go.

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,261
-[Jimin] You don't want to go?
-No.

83
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,464
BOTH PASS THROUGH

84
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,966
[Jung Kook] I usually don't keep
my passport on me.

85
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,702
Since they normally take it for flights...

86
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,270
EXPLANATION TIME

87
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,040
[Jimin] It's 8 a.m. in Korea right now.

88
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,208
It's actually 9.

89
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,044
We're up and moving from 9 a.m.

90
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,446
I'm exhausted.

91
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,482
Jung Kook, should we take a break?

92
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,750
[Jung Kook] Yeah.

93
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,718
GETTING READY TO CLAP THE SLATE

94
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,125
CAMERAS ROLLING AGAIN AFTER A SHORT BREAK

95
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,029
Just keep eating, keep going.

96
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,565
BLOWING IT

97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,307
SLURP, SLURP

98
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,909
Gosh, this is good.

99
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,481
ALMOST GONE IN JUST THREE BITES

100
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:46,286
CLEARED IN AN INSTANT

101
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,089
I'm not drinking the soup.

102
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:53,827
HEADS STRAIGHT TO THE RESTROOM
TO BRUSH TEETH

103
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,830
STOPS BRUSHING MID-WAY
AND STARTS WARMING UP

104
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,971
FOCUSES BACK ON BRUSHING

105
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,343
HE NEVER STOPS MOVING WHILE BRUSHING TEETH
NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND

106
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,412
I'LL WRAP IT UP NOW

107
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,713
All right, now we're...

108
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,881
JIMIN'S ALL READY

109
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:18,718
going to leave for Vietnam. Let's go.

110
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,388
Let's leave for Da Nang.

111
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,492
BOARDING COMPLETE

112
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,598
I'M WATCHING YOU

113
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,068
JIMIN BEHIND HIM

114
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,903
We're on the plane.

115
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,072
In five hours...

116
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,407
IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE HOURS

117
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,509
We'll be arriving in Da Nang.

118
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,846
[Jimin] Did you look up
anything about Da Nang?

119
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:46,913
Nope.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,281
Just the food...

121
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,017
Only the food.

122
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,620
Trips are best
when you figure things out there.

123
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,688
Once you arrive?

124
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,755
PERCEIVING TYPE

125
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,823
As for food...

126
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,291
ENTRUSTED JUNG KOOK

127
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,726
I trust him.

128
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,127
Some good spots to visit.

129
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,430
Many beautiful places.

130
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,633
While looking up what people post,

131
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,201
you find some pretty spots.

132
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,403
And if you see what you like,
you go there.

133
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,606
I wanted to try something like that.

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,277
DA NANG BUCKET LIST #2:
SCORE A DISCOUNT WITH SMOOTH TALK

135
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,980
If you go, "Ah, that's too expensive,"

136
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,015
and turn around, they'll lower it.

137
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,552
What's special about this trip

138
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,054
is that...

139
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,890
Maybe we've grown a little bolder?

140
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,193
You just use a bit of body language.

141
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,863
People go, "Oh, oh, oh!"
and they're so nice about it.

142
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,300
These are all the photos
I took during this trip.

143
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,269
It's basically from here to here.

144
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,539
I've taken more pictures than I have
in the past two and a half years.

145
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,575
I've taken the most photos this past week.

146
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,913
WARMTH, MEMORIES, AND COUNTLESS PHOTOS...
SO MANY THINGS GAINED FROM THIS TRIP

147
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,881
If you scroll down just a bit,

148
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,249
you see all the trips.

149
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,617
ALL THE PHOTOS POP UP

150
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,954
I usually don't take many pictures.

151
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,258
TRIPS ARE AN EXCEPTION...
FULL OF MEMORIES CAPTURED IN PHOTOS

152
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,127
Taehyung in a good mood.

153
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,362
SEE ARE YOU SURE?! EP.4

154
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,365
Just so adorable.

155
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,937
JUNG KOOK, LOOK AT THIS

156
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,106
INVITING JUNG KOOK
ON A MEMORY TRIP TO JEJU

157
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,843
MEMORIES BUBBLING UP

158
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,846
This is why you take photos.

159
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,116
IN A MEMORY LANE

160
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,952
Wow, the hair was so long.

161
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,555
We're taking off soon.

162
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,158
To Da Nang.

163
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,261
To Da Nang.

164
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,997
I hope we're there
the moment I open my eyes.

165
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,503
I'LL BE BACK

166
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,274
ME TOO

167
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,313
FELL ASLEEP RIGHT AFTER TAKEOFF

168
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,950
IS HE ASLEEP?

169
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,853
ALREADY?

170
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,624
JUNG KOOK'S NOT ASLEEP...

171
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,926
See you in Da Nang.

172
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,096
You can lean all the way back.

173
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,163
All the way.

174
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,000
-It'll be uncomfortable for you.
-I'm fine.

175
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,436
JIMIN, THE KING OF CONSIDERATION,
IS SO SWEET

176
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,906
CONSIDERATE, BUT MOVING A BIT SUSPICIOUSLY

177
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,843
BECAUSE WHAT REMAINS ARE PHOTOS AND VIDEOS

178
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,711
LET'S SEE...

179
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,050
TITLE:
EVERYONE, LOOK AT OUR JUNG KOOK SLEEPING

180
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,353
I'M GOING TO SLEEP TOO

181
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,789

184
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,764

it was about healing and...

195

Is it normal to go on a trip
right away like this?

Antarctica.

261
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,589

What do we even do there?

269
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,635
Shake hands with penguins, maybe?
Rock-paper-scissors.

270

Or maybe a polar plunge challenge.

271

00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,319
But I got to say, here in Da Nang,

363
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,722
it really feels like a tourist spot.

364
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,657
It definitely has that tourist vibe.

365
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,696
I mean, Switzerland
was more like pure peace itself.

366
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,464
BECOMING ONE WITH THE GREEN NATURE

367
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,834
A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD TRULY RELAX

368
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:48,441
SWITZERLAND, THE VERY DEFINITION
OF TRANQUILITY

369
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,210
But this place feels like
one big festival.

370
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,180
BRIMMING WITH PASSION LIKE THE BLAZING SUN

371
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,383
FULL OF ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT

372
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,955
VIETNAM, A LAND OF VIBRANT FESTIVITY

373
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,758
Definitely different.

374
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,661
So many motorbikes, indeed.

375
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,064
-[Jung Kook] Wow.
-So casually.

376
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,933
[Jimin] Riding bikes with backpacks on.

377
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,434
[Jung Kook] Seriously.

378
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,502
MOTORBIKE CULTURE

379
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,405
A UNIQUE CULTURE SHAPED BY MANY FACTORS

380
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,674
There are more bikes than cars.

381
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,478
MOTORBIKES OUTNUMBER CARS ON THE STREETS

382
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,547
Feels like a group ride.

383
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,118
Wherever they go, they've got company.

384
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,252
Sounds fun.

385
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,954
No one waves though.

386
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,022
True.

387
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,623
It's everyday life here.

388
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,559
The goal isn't the ride...

389
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,794
It's just transportation, just driving.

390
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,996
EVERYONE'S ON THE MOVE FOR THEIR OWN LIFE

391
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,432
Wow, Vietnamese pho in Vietnam.

392
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,533
I know, right?

393
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,935
Have we tried it before?

394
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,003
Not sure, we probably have?

395
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,040
I can't remember. It's been too long.

396
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,745
THE CAR GRADUALLY COMES TO A STOP

397
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,949
I think this is our stop, Jimin.
Let's get out.

398
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,718
Let's get out.

399
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,622
Let's go soak up some Da Nang in Da Nang.

400
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,224
Thank you.

401
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,531
Some biker called my name earlier.

402
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,435
This place is... Hello.

403
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,409
THEY'RE IN VIETNAM,
BUT THEY ENTER GREETING IN KOREAN

404
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,044
-Hello.
-Hello.

405
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,647
Thank you.

406
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,719
FILLED WITH LOCAL CHARM,
STARTING WITH VIETNAMESE PHO

407
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,621
Let's just dig in.

408
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,257
A TABLE FULL OF VARIOUS VIETNAMESE DISHES

409
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,595
SO MANY DISHES
THAT THE TABLE LEGS MIGHT GIVE OUT

410
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,131
[director] We won't give you the food
just like that.

411
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,933
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

412
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,402
You're going to take them away one by one?

413
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,572
No way.

414
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,973
No way.

415
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,075
We must protect the pho no matter what.

416
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,410
Let's just take a peek.

417
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,745
SHRIMP DUMPLINGS

418
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,747
-What?
-We can't eat it right away?

419
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:12,318
EACH QUIZ QUESTION
PUTS ONE DISH ON THE LINE

420
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,020
[director] Initial consonant quiz.

421
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,788
-[Jimin] Okay.
-[Jung Kook] Easy.

422
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,556
TWO TURNS BACK AND FORTH

423
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,592
If you fail, one dish gets taken away.

424
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,926
Got it.

425
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,063
FIRST QUESTION, LET'S BEGIN

426
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,765
Here we go. First one.

427
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,832
I'll go first.

428
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,401
-You first?
-Here we go.

429
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,468
S B

430
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,070
-One, two, three.
-Watermelon.

431
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,738
One, two, three.

432
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,873
Sobok.

433
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,041
-Two, three.
-Dawn.

434
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,009
-One, two, three.
-Shabang.

435
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,444
Oh, that works, sure.

436
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,613
WE PASSED, RIGHT?

437
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,881
-Correct.
-Okay, okay.

438
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,149
-One, right?
-Pho.

439
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,216
Pho.

440
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,918
Second question.

441
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,320
G G

442
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,388
Meat.

443
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,223
-One, two, three.
-Begging.

444
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,858
-One, two, three.
-Browsing.

445
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,493
-One, two, three.
-Furniture.

446
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,696
BREEZE THROUGH THE SECOND ONE TOO

447
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,132
You see, we trained hard in Switzerland.

448
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,300
Honed our skills.

449
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,935
THE SWISS AIR MADE US SHARPER

450
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,003
THE SWISS BUFF

451
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,706
We got better in Switzerland.

452
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,773
Here we go.

453
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,841
O J

454
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:09,909
Agree.

455
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,143
-One, two, three.
-Space.

456
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,511
-One, two, three.
-Woman.

457
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,979
-Two, three.
-Friendship.

458
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,283
THE THIRD ONE IS A SUCCESS TOO

459
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,617
One.

460
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,685
Two.

461
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,753
Three.

462
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,987
THREE DISHES SECURED

463
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,055
Focus, focus.

464
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:28,427
WILL THEY BE ABLE
TO SECURE ALL OF THEM...?

465
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,897
Okay, next. Jung Kook first.

466
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:32,965
O O

467
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,033
Milk.

468
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,101
PHEW

469
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,902
-One, two, three.
-Wooyoung.

470
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,171
-One, two, three.
-Youngwoo?

471
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,973
That works, Youngwoo.

472
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,209
Who's Youngwoo?

473
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,177
My army buddy's name.

474
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,512
Youngwoo.

475
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,049
-Oh, burdock, burdock.
-Okay.

476
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,183
Take this one out.

477
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,019
THIS ONE = SAUCE

478
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,187
-Just sauce.
-Yeah.

479
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,689
Come on, it's in a bowl too.

480
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,857
Why are you so...

481
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,059
Well, we should play fair.

482
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,961
Since when did we ever play fair?

483
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,430
-You're the only unfair one.
-Oh boy.

484
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,898
Here, take this one.

485
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,199
REFUSING TO GIVE UP

486
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
-That one looks good.
-Fine, take this.

487
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,803
ALSO SAUCE

488
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,871
Just give it.

489
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,639
-Let's give this one.
-Here.

490
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,709
VIETNAMESE SHRIMP DUMPLINGS OUT

491
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,377
Aw, there it goes.

492
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,012
We could've taken that one.

493
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,214
Huh? No, it's good. It's tasty.

494
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,349
All right, next.

495
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,451
-I'll be easy.
-The last one.

496
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,286
-Who first?
-You go ahead.

497
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,521
I'll go first.

498
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,022
B S

499
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,223
-Emergency.
-Two, three.

500
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,291
Shaved ice.

501
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,359
Conservative.

502
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,227
-One, two, three.
-Fountain.

503
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,363
FINAL QUESTION, SUCCESS!

504
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,931
The dishes you still have...

505
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,599
One, two, three, four,

506
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,835
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

507
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:43,969
NINE DISHES REMAIN

508
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,237
[director] Neologism quiz.

509
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,572
[Jung Kook] Neologism quiz?

510
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,074
-Oh, that's tough.
-We'll do five questions.

511
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,911
-Got it. So we'll lose five dishes.
-Neologism?

512
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,078
-Who's first?
-I'll go.

513
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,680
-Let's go.
-Have to do it alone?

514
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,782
HMH

515
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,917
H and M.

516
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,984
No.

517
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,719
H-M-H.

518
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,388
H-M-H?

519
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,823
H-M-H.

520
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,758
H-M-H, H-M-H.

521
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,359
Huh-muh-huh.

522
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,928
[director laughs]

523
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,363
Is it like an expression?
But they said slang...

524
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,365
Oh, it's so HMH today.

525
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,500
Like that?

526
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,837
It's something you two have been
showing this whole trip.

527
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,240
They say you've been so HMH.

528
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,441
-Me.
-Yes?

529
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,509
Free-spirited.

530
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,910
-Wrong.
-What is it then?

531
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,046
-Down if you're down.
-Oh?

532
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,114
Oh, like that. I'm down if you're down.

533
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,483
Isn't it easier to type it out?

534
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,085
Or is HMH easier?

535
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,454
CALM DOWN, PLEASE...

536
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,089
Maybe it's just a text thing.

537
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,490
Take one out.

538
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,160
-Maybe separate it?
-We should play fair.

539
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,829
BEEP, THEY'RE A SET

540
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,998
-But it looks so good.
-This one.

541
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,366
-This one?
-This one and...

542
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,034
These two are enough for me.

543
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,536
Then take that one out.

544
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:54,874
STIR-FRIED MORNING GLORY OUT

545
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,477
NEXT, GMG = 'I'LL GO IF YOU GO'
THEY NAIL IT IN ONE GO

546
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,578
Great.

547
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,247
Three questions left.

548
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,648
Three more to go.

549
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,049
Here we go.

550
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,451
REEL-CEPTION

551
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,887
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

552
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,255
Maybe it's about Reels?

553
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,490
Like watching the same Reel over and over.

554
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,493
[director] Kind of what you've been doing
this whole trip.

555
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,729
-Huh?
-When we took your phones away.

556
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,232
When do you struggle most
with your digital minimalism?

557
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,300
Late at night.

558
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,370
THAT'S THE HINT?

559
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,604
[Jung Kook] Reel-ception.

560
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,872
Do you even get it?

561
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,707
-No, right?
-Reel-ception.

562
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,011
It must come from Inception.

563
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,146
Is it when you stay up watching Reels?

564
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,281
Something like that?

565
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,949
Endlessly looping.

566
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,617
-What's the answer?
-My answer is...

567
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:39,919
I give up.

568
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,620
Staying up late on your phone?

569
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,555
-Incorrect.
-What is it?

570
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,225
When you watch Reels just for a minute
before bed

571
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,394
and suddenly hours have passed.

572
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,197
You clearly gave that one
just to make us lose food. This?

573
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
AND AGAIN, SAUCE

574
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,101
JUST KIDDING

575
00:23:56,168 --> 00:24:00,205
SO MUCH MORE TORN THAN EXPECTED

576
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,740
Let's take this one out.

577
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,042
This one's noodles.

578
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,945
MÌ QUẢNG: NOODLE DISH
WITH A BIT OF BROTH AND TOPPINGS

579
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,881
NO, DON'T GO

580
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,849
You're taking this one next, right?

581
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,152
-Yeah.
-Or maybe the spring rolls.

582
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,921
-Two questions now.
-But the spring rolls are good.

583
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,022
Your turn.

584
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,257
-Okay!
-Here we go.

585
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,325
NEUJOT

586
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,260
-Good vibes.
-[director] Correct.

587
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,695
Correct.

588
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,798
Why do you only give me the hard ones?

589
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:27,933
Gosh.

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,201
The last one's mine too.

591
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,870
Another tough one's coming.

592
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,238
[director] Here we go.

593
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,406
CHUGUMI

594
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,308
FINAL QUESTION FOR JIMIN REVEALED

595
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,477
-Pursuing...
-Pursuing...

596
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,012
Aesthetic.

597
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,080
[director] Elaborate.

598
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,382
Like when you say, "What's your chugumi?"

599
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,450
Isn't that it?

600
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,685
So in one sentence. What does it mean?

601
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,754
The beauty you pursue?

602
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,056
Pursued beauty? No?

603
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,992
Webfoot octopus.

604
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,426
The one you eat?

605
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,197
What you said earlier was actually close.

606
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,264
Oh, really?

607
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,500
Oh, the aesthetic you pursue.

608
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,035
Kind of aesthetic you seek.

609
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,870
-[director] Correct.
-Really?

610
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,605
Thank you for the food.

611
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,675
[director] It refers to
one's personal sense of aesthetic.

612
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,310
That one was easy.

613
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,245
-So we're done?
-Yes, please enjoy.

614
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,480
Yay!

Enjoy.

621
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,896
ADDING A SPICY KICK

622
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,435
[director] Anything you want
from the dishes we took?

623
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,271
Jung Kook wanted that bok choy one.

624
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,339

-Minus one.
-Okay, minus one.

628
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,249
Wait, so what do I lose if I lose?

629
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,917
-You don't lose anything.
-No?

630
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:52,985
I only win it?

631
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,487
Rock-paper-scissors.

632
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,656
SCANNING

633
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,857
Minus one.

634
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,592
JEON JUNG KOOK LOSES

635
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,428

[director] This is so good,
so let's do another round.

654
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,219
It's good, right?

655
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,587
Yeah, I told you.

656
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,856

I love it.

00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,572
[Jung Kook] So good.

677
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,007
Really good.

678
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,645
Did you add the sauce to yours?

679
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,547
Yeah, just the red one.

680
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,081
READY FOR SPRING ROLLS

681
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,449

684
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,593
It's good.

685
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,028
Isn't it hard?

686
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,863
It softens up in my mouth.

687
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:19,798
I'm curious.

688
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,801
What did you wrap in there?

689
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,304
YOU GOTTA PUT EVERYTHING IN

690
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,872
Did you add shrimp too?

691
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,940
All in one go?

692
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,309
WANTS TO EAT IT JUST LIKE HIM

693
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,544
So this is how you're supposed to eat it?

694
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,845
Did you eat it in one bite?

695
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,381
A little dip here, a big dip there.

696
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,583
A little here...

697
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,518
-Big dip.
-A big dip here.

698
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,156
Mmm.

699
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,424
[Jimin] Good, right?

700
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,594
CHIPMUNK CHEEKS ENGAGED

701
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,729
It gets soft fast.

702
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,301
CAN'T HELP BUT DO A SHOULDER DANCE

703
00:28:56,368 --> 00:29:00,072
MEANWHILE, JIMIN IS FARMING NEM LUI

704
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,007
What's that?

705
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,242
CURIOUS KID JUNG KOOK

706
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,744
I thought this might be
one of those, you know.

707
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,579
-The ones you wrap?
-Yeah.

708
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,051
ROLL IT UP AND BOOP... INTO THE SAUCE

709
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,387
SERVES THE YOUNGER ONE FIRST

710
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,488
Thank you.

711
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,291
How is it?

712
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,359
Is it good?

713
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,893
Is this better?

714
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,961
Kinda similar.

715
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,129
Tastes similar?

716
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,466
But the meat's a bit more seasoned.

717
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,838
JIMIN FINALLY TAKES A BITE TOO

718
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,608
CARE FOR A BITE?

719
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,678
BEEP... CAMERAS CAN'T EAT

720
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:44,616
THEN I'LL HAVE TO EAT IT

721
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,685
-It's good.
-Yup.

722
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:54,126
HUMMING BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD

723
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:59,364
DRINKING THE BROTH STRAIGHT FROM THE BOWL

724
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,901
I'm full.

725
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:08,473
When there's a lot to try, you wonder,

726
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,076
"What should I put in my mouth next?"

727
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,779
Put the tasty one in.

728
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,381
A WISE ANSWER TO A SILLY QUESTION

729
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,016
That was so good.

730
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:19,785
So good.

731
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,054
AFTER THE SATISFYING MEAL...

732
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,489
-You've got shopping next, right?
-Right.

733
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:28,460
SHOPPING SPOT =
A LOCAL MARKET FULL OF LOCAL VIBES

734
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:29,795
Can I haggle?

735
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,862
WANTS TO HAGGLE

736
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:35,300
At the market, they only take cash.

737
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,603
So we'll play a simple game.

738
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,273
ALLOWANCE GAME
2 MILLION VND AT STAKE

739
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,141
The food you just had

740
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,410
and the food for all the staff...

741
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,479
Guess the total bill.

742
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,481
DA NANG FILMING STAFF STATUS

743
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,116
A TOTAL OF 19 STAFF
GUESS THE COST

744
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,951
MARGIN OF ERROR:
± 20,000 WON

745
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,052
That's tough.

746
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,589
We'll have to do some math.

747
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,124
I'll try...

748
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,425
Let me make an estimate.

749
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,128
Can I go count how many there are?

750
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,696
Sure.

751
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:08,633
FIRST, SCAN ALL THE DISHES ON THE TABLES

752
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,070
COUNTING CAREFULLY

753
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,673
19 PEOPLE
TOTAL CONFIRMED: 43 BOWLS/PLATES

754
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,209
JUNG KOOK IS COUNTING BY DISH TYPE

755
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,077
STARTLED AND EMBARRASSED

756
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,645
One green dish.

757
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,482
One bun cha... something like that.

758
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,751
-How much?
-I can roughly guess.

759
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,354
Somewhere between 17,000 won
and 23,000 won.

760
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,789
By my math...

761
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:35,026
But you said the margin of error is
20,000 won, right?

762
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,762
Yes, 20,000 won.

763
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,163
Then if I just say 20,000,

764
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,232
-that covers 0 to 40,000 won.
-Yes.

765
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,533
I can't miss, then.

766
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,636
I should just say 20,000 won.

767
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,071
No, what do you mean?

768
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,039
We had 16 bowls of pho alone.

769
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,842
Total number of items: 43.

770
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,346
How does that add up to 20,000 won?

771
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,815
Per item... Did I count in thousand-dong?

772
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,217
-No, that's right.
-No, it's not.

773
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:03,388
The pho alone is like 41,000 won.

774
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:04,856
Did I mess up the math?

775
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,927
If you're right, this restaurant's
going out of business.

776
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,862
RECALCULATING

777
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,230
That's way too cheap.

778
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,533
I did the math wrong.

779
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,068
-The spring rolls.
-I missed a zero. One zero.

780
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,473
We have to guess the total cost.

781
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,543
Let's say one bowl of pho costs
50,000 dong.

782
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,245
Then how much would this one be?

783
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,582
Let's say around 64,000 dong.

784
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,518
And the green dish...

785
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,423
Around 300,000 dong.

786
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,492
No, wait, make it 250,000 dong.

787
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,295
That bun cha over there.

788
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,731
I BELIEVE IN MY OWN WAY OF CALCULATING...

789
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,534
One bowl of pho is 88,000 dong.

790
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,437
Huh? Then my math is wrong.

791
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,372
Then, I got the number.

792
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,309
DON'T PANIC, JEON JUNG KOOK

793
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,478
STICK TO YOUR OWN MATH

794
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,480
This is my guess.

795
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,381
-Not the final answer.
-Okay.

796
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,519
I think around 200,000 to 210,000 won.

797
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,288
You're avoiding eye contact.
I think I'm right.

798
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,990
CERTAIN HE'S CORRECT

799
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,425
I feel like I got it right.

800
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,726
Okay, here's the total.

801
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,294
JUNG KOOK FINALLY FINISHES

802
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:17,963
GUESSES 170,000 WON

803
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,464
-How?
-170,000 won.

804
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,633
-How did you get that?
-Just a gut feeling.

805
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,869
-Let's meet in the middle, 190,000.
-190,000?

806
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,871
190,000 won is perfect.

807
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,906
It's just 20,000 above 170,000.

808
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:28,974
190,000 won?

809
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,475
If your guess is 210,000...

810
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:31,877
-190,000 won.
-190,000.

811
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:32,944
The answer is...

812
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:37,916
-4,446,225 dong.
-Wow, that's a lot.

813
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:43,421
Which is 232,537 won.

814
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,956
Fail.

815
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,458
ACTUAL AMOUNT: 232,537 WON

816
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,692
= ABOUT 40,000 WON OFF

817
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,494
THEY FAIL TO GET ALLOWANCE

818
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,229
I should've said 220,000 won.

819
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,731
TOTAL LOSS...

820
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,967
TRAGICALLY CLOSE

821
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,068
What did I miss?

822
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,403
Drinks, maybe?

823
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,905
No way.

824
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,040
I set the food prices too low.

825
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,576
210,000 won.

826
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,812
But we're loaded.

827
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:13,652
Want to exchange 40 francs
for 2 million dong?

828
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,420
Huh? Let's trade.

829
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,488
Two million dong...

830
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,890
We can't use francs here anyway.

831
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:19,958
-True.
-True.

832
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,092
Wait a sec.

833
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,128
Let's see how much 48 francs are worth.

834
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,296
MGH.

835
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,497
That's true.

836
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,132
INVENTING A NEW SLANG TERM

837
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,533
Not bad.

838
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,601
RATE CHECKED

839
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,636
It's 200 francs? 2 million francs?

840
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,205
Oh, two million dong? Okay.

841
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,007
COOL-HEADED DEAL

842
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,476
We'll give you it.
Here's two million dong.

843
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,011
[cheering]

844
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,081
Show me what the bills look like.

845
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,917
DEEPLY FASCINATED

846
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,154
[Jung Kook] The note feels different
from the one from Switzerland's.

847
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,523
It's only a three-minute walk.

848
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,591
Okay.

849
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,692
Let's go.

850
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,494
AFTER A FUN DINNER, DA NANG ONCE AGAIN

851
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,063
This place is beautiful too.

852
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,766
It's got that vacation-spot vibe.

853
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,668
BEAUTIFUL EVENING FULL OF VACATION VIBE

854
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:07,439
I should at least learn how to say
"thank you" in Vietnamese.

855
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,873
I'll look it up.

856
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,176
LESSON 1: THANK YOU

00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,411

-Cảm ơn.
-I'm full.

860
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,749
-Cảm ơn.
-Cảm ơn.

861
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,284

862
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,352
And...

863
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,921
How much is it?

864
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,924
[in Vietnamese] Bao nhiêu tiền.

865
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,559

Oh, what's that fruit again?

869
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,036
Is that a fruit? Or a veggie?

870
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,771
FULL OF INTERESTING STUFF

871
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,640
Beetroot? No.

00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,707
No idea.

873
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,411
It smells like flowers.

874
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,014
Mm-hmm.

I want to smell the market air.

879
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,965
When I was little, I used to go
to markets all the time with my mom.

880
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:10,902
Like when they roasted beans,
I loved those smells.

881
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,071
At markets.

882
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,975
WANDERING THROUGH DA NANG'S STREETS,
THEY ARRIVE AT THE MARKET

00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,524
HALF AWAKE...

1081
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,794
SWITZERLAND - DA NANG

1082
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,564
BOTH EXHAUSTED FROM THE LONG TRAVEL

1083
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,902
Massage.

1084
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,205
Massage.

1085
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,407
Nice.

1086
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,547
DESPERATELY NEEDS A MASSAGE...

1087
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:48,319
TIRED SILHOUETTES

1088
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,689
ARRIVED QUICKLY

1089
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,563
[exclaiming in relief]

1090
00:44:58,629 --> 00:44:59,630
LET'S GO REST

1091
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,865
We're here.

1092
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:02,700
Wow, I dozed off.

1093
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,868
Huh? Where are we?

1094
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,637
Isn't this our place? No?

1095
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,705
Not the resort.

1096
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,173
We're here for a massage?

1097
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,577
MASSAGE OUT OF NOWHERE?

1098
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,946
RIGHT AFTER DINNER

1099
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,714
THEY PLAYED A GAME FOR MASSAGES

1100
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,082
[director] Look at the photo

1101
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:21,452
and guess who this outfit belongs to.

1102
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,187
-Okay.
-Here we go.

1103
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,590
WHOSE OUTFIT IS THIS?

1104
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,659
STARING INTENTLY

1105
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,328
-Me.
-Me.

1106
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,230
The answer is? One, two, three.

1107
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,398
-Director Park Jun-soo.
-Director Park Jun-soo.

1108
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,633
Correct.

1109
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,335
-Too easy.
-We knew right away.

1110
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,437
-You wore this in Switzerland.
-Yes.

1111
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,738
INTO MASSAGE OUTFITS

1112
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:41,806
Haven't tried it.

1113
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,076
GRUNTING

1114
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,012
RELAXATION FLOODS IN
THE MOMENT HIS FEET GO IN

1115
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,580
Is it hot?

1116
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,515
NERVOUS

1117
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,184
TOUCHED

1118
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,252
It's not that hot.

1119
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,322
We soak our feet for 10 minutes?

1120
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:02,560
SEE YOU IN 10 MINUTES

1121
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,762
I could fall asleep like this.

1122
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,632
AS THE FEET RELAX,
THE WHOLE BODY LOOSENS UP

1123
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,368
If I don't remember the massage at all,

1124
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,170
I'd be sad.

1125
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,742
A SHORT MOMENT OF PEACE

1126
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,311
I think I take great wallpaper photos.

1127
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:24,115
SCROLLING THROUGH THE GALLERY

1128
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,850
They've got vibes, really.

1129
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,452
Feels like film photos.

1130
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,522
They look great.

1131
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,494
But I didn't take many photos
of the background.

1132
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,298
MASSAGE BED FLOOR POV - JIMIN

1133
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,234
Oh, what's this?
You seriously put a camera here?

1134
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,137
MASSAGE BED FLOOR POV - JUNG KOOK

1135
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,806
[director] Enjoy your time.

1136
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,975
-[Jimin] Thank you.
-[Jung Kook] Thank you.

1137
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,643
[Jimin] Off to dreamland, everyone.

1138
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:54,945
I'll enjoy this.

1139
00:46:56,681 --> 00:47:00,117
She's pressing each toe one by one.

1140
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,185
[Jimin] Me too.

1141
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,221
[sighing]

1142
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,289
First time...

1143
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,391
getting a massage.

1144
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,093
THUMBS-UP

1145
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,530
CAN'T HELP BUT GROANING

1146
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,702
SNORING...

1147
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:23,908
JUNG KOOK FALLS ASLEEP
THE MOMENT IT STARTS...

1148
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:29,547
THEIR FIRST NIGHT IN DA NANG
MELTS AWAY ALL THE TRAVEL FATIGUE

1149
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,815
[Jimin] That was great.

1150
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,653
FEELING RELAXED

1151
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,390
RECHARGED THANKS TO THE MASSAGE

1152
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,258
It was great.

1153
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:47,865
LOOK RELAXED AND LIGHTER NOW

1154
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,938
I want to get it again tomorrow.

1155
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:56,774
Tomorrow?

1156
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:03,748
LET'S HEAD BACK TO THE ROOM NOW

1157
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,120
We're here.

1158
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,323
I want to ride longer.

1159
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,793
I want to ask them
to drive us 10 more minutes.

1160
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,161
GETTING OFF RELUCTANTLY

1161
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,229
Thank you.

1162
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
Thank you.

1163
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:26,404
I just realized I bought a black shirt
but got no pants to go with it.

1164
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,243
What do I do?

1165
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,578
Thank you.

1166
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,414
Thank you.

1167
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:40,284
REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED

1168
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,352
This feels nice.

1169
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,387
So nice.

1170
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,624
THE MASSAGE FEELING STILL LINGERS...
(FT. TOTAL SATISFACTION)

1171
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,329
I don't remember anything.
I passed out right away.

1172
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,032
What's this now?

1173
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,101
Another food game, huh?

1174
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,936
So we can't just eat it right away.

1175
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,705
Oh, come on.

1176
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,809
I was actually craving beer
the moment the massage ended.

1177
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,245
WITH REFRESHING BEER

1178
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,849
LATE-NIGHT SNACKS
TO FILL THEIR HUNGRY STOMACHS

1179
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,621
A GAME TO WIN LATE-NIGHT SNACKS!

1180
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,689
No way.

1181
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,858
PLEASE JUST LET US EAT...

1182
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:23,160
We're going to lose everything.

1183
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:26,764
Because of what I said earlier,
you won't go easy on us anymore.

1184
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,902
We should lose at least once
and not get to eat anything at all.

1185
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,306
But we haven't had that moment yet.

1186
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,875
SO WE'VE RETURNED EVEN STRONGER

1187
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:40,044
ROUND 1
ONE HEART, TWO BODIES GAME

1188
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,846
THE CUE WORD
STRIKE DIFFERENT POSES

1189
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:42,913
SUCCESS

1190
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,216
MUST GET 7 OUT OF 10 RIGHT
TO EARN ONE FOOD

1191
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,717
Just do whatever you want.

1192
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:47,885
-Whatever I want?
-Yup.

1193
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:50,354
-Okay. No thinking? Okay.
-Go with your feeling.

1194
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,456
[director] Here we go. First one.

1195
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,893
"Standing Next to You."

1196
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,528
One, two, three.

1197
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,431
Three.

1198
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,966
ONE HEART, TWO BODIES

1199
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,334
SUCCESS

1200
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,902
-Yes!
-Success.

1201
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,203
Do whatever you want.

1202
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,139
But which part was that?

1203
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,709
[humming]

1204
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,478
A PART EVEN THE ORIGINAL SINGER
DIDN'T EXPECT...

1205
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:16,013
No, it's right.

1206
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,248
[humming]

1207
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:18,349
Before this part.

1208
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,651
[speaking indistinctly]

1209
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,253
It wasn't that folksy...

1210
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,423
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A COOL DANCE...

1211
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,058
[director] All right, next one.

1212
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,827
"Set Me Free Pt. 2."

1213
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,195
One, two, three.

1214
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,397
Three.

1215
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,267
One, two, three.

1216
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,369
TECHNICALLY DIFFERENT

1217
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,137
It's different. What is this though?

1218
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,039
[singing indistinctly]

1219
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,207
There's that move.

1220
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,575
-Like this.
-Yeah, right.

1221
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:45,643
There really is.

1222
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,944
Different, right?

1223
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:48,312
It's the lift at the end.

1224
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,014
JIMIN'S POSE:
THE FINAL LIFT

1225
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,215
[director] Two correct.

1226
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,617
Next.

1227
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:54,952
Heart. One, two, three.

1228
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,523
-Military drill.
-Military drill?

1229
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,891
Drill. One, two, three.

1230
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,961
PERFECTLY DIFFERENT POSES AGAIN

1231
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,163
[director] Four correct so far.

1232
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,531
FIFTH CUE

1233
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,767
Jimin. One, two, three.

1234
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,968
IT'S JIMIN

1235
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,036
Three.

1236
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,304
HE IS JIMIN

1237
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,538
Aren't these the same?

1238
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,607
They're different.

1239
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,642
-The poses are different.
-The poses.

1240
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,244
DIFFERENT, RIGHT?

1241
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,545
5 OUT OF 5 SO FAR

1242
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,780
TWO MORE AND EARN FOOD

1243
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,182
SIXTH CUE

1244
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,250
[director] Motorcycle.

1245
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:27,818
One, two, three.

1246
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,854
TECHNICALLY DIFFERENT POSES... (HMM)

1247
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,490
JUNG KOOK IS CLEARLY RIDING A BIKE

1248
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,492
I'm hanging on in the back.

1249
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,495
SIMILAR, BUT... (HMM)

1250
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,565
I always hang on in the back, don't I?

1251
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:42,967
Like this in the back.

1252
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:45,169
Yeah.

1253
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,104
I was being serious.

1254
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,207
Maybe stand back-to-back?

1255
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,910
Oh, you don't trust us?

1256
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:54,078
The last one, right?

1257
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,879
-Do whatever you want.
-Okay.

1258
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,415
Are You Sure?!

1259
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,050
One, two, three.

1260
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,785
PERFECTLY DIFFERENT AGAIN

1261
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,153
Different, right?

1262
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:06,056
SUCCEEDING, BUT IT'S ODD...

1263
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,324
I knew it.

1264
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,159
7 CORRECT!
1 SNACK EARNED

1265
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,728
-What do we want?
-Yeah.

1266
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,162
BEER FIRST

1267
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,964
-From these?
-Yeah.

1268
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,000
GOING STRAIGHT FOR IT

1269
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,901
GULPING

1270
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,205
LET'S WET OUR THROATS FIRST

1271
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,176
CURRENT FOOD STATUS
ONE COLD BEER EACH

1272
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,312
So we can't eat food then?

1273
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,382
[director] You must earn it
at the next one.

1274
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:34,918
-Seriously?
-What game?

1275
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:37,921
-[director] All right.
-So we're not getting a break.

1276
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,957
-We'll keep playing games tonight.
-Yes.

1277
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:43,227
[director] This time, it's saying words
ending in what I say.

1278
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,496
-Ah! This one seems hard.
-Yes.

1279
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,764
ROUND 2: WORD RELAY GAME

1280
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,198
SAYING WORDS THAT RHYME

1281
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,333
SUCCEED 3 ROUNDS

1282
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,901
-Who's first?
-I'll go first.

1283
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,904
[director] Okay, we need six in a row.

1284
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:55,339
Here we go.

1285
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,841
Words ending in "soup,"
except seaweed soup.

1286
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,610
-One, two, three.
-Paste soup.

1287
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,045
Soybean paste soup.

1288
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,713
-One, two, three.
-Kimchi soup.

1289
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,248
Red pepper paste...

1290
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,350
-soup.
-Wrong.

1291
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,485
If you put red pepper paste in soup...

1292
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,621
NO LOOPHOLES THIS TIME

1293
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:11,922
SO CLOSE

1294
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,691
So we fail then?

1295
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:14,825
You'll take one food?

1296
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,360
Nope.

1297
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:17,995
You just can't eat it.

1298
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:19,163
YOU CAN ONLY SEE IT

1299
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,664
Well, then...

1300
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,266
-Not getting it.
-Nice view.

1301
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:24,768
Good view.

1302
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:26,937
You see this?

1303
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,039
How is it?

1304
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:31,442
TWIN BURGER TOWER

1305
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,509
Nice stack.

1306
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,610
Want a picture?

1307
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,446

1308
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,715
SECOND ATTEMPT

00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,918
Say words ending in "dumpling."

1310
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,052
Here we go.

1311
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,754
Except kimchi dumpling.

1312
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,489
-Pork dumplings.
-One, two, three.

1313
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,924
Boiled dumplings.

1314
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,292
Fried dumplings.

1315
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,927
Steamed dumplings.

1316
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,428
Deep-fried dumplings.

1317
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,130
LAST ONE!

1318
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:55,265
Fail!

1319
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,433
Kathmandu.

1320
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:00,104
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

1321
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:02,106
IT'S OKAY

1322
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,042
What else is there?
Steamed, fried, kimchi dumplings...

1323
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,110
Shrimp dumplings.

1324
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,112
-Mushroom dumplings.
-Gyoza dumplings.

1325
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,246
All those exist?

1326
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:10,881
Of course, of course.

1327
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,649
-There are a lot of dumplings.
-Yes.

1328
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,717
Makes sense.

1329
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,187
Words ending in "ball."

1330
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,689
There are so many.

1331
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:19,757
Okay.

1332
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:20,891
Here we go.

1333
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,326
Except ping-pong ball.

1334
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,927
-Soccer ball.
-One, two, three.

1335
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,262
Basketball.

Volleyball.

1337
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,631
Badminton ball.

1338
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:28,699
WRONG

1339
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,601
-Isn't it a badminton ball?
-Nope.

1340
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,270
BADMINTON USES A SHUTTLECOCK, NOT A BALL

1341
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:34,338
Fair.

1342
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,405
YEAH, FAIR CALL

1343
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:36,473
Yeah, fair.

1344
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,442
Don't people still say 'ball' casually?

1345
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:39,510
When talking?

1346
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,545
No, I just say "that thing."

1347
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,215
-So you don't remember saying it either.
-Right.

1348
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,652
-Shuttlecock is correct though.
-It is.

1349
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,989
Volleyball, bowling ball...
There were so many options.

1350
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,591
But I really thought it was a ball.

1351
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,659
WHIMPER

1352
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,528
-It hurts my heart.
-Yeah.

1353
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,463
Honestly, I'm fine though.

1354
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,765
I'm doing my best for you, you know.

1355
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,133
-Right.
-Yes.

1356
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,935
I just feel bad for myself.

1357
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,170
I'd feel really bummed.

1358
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,838
Darn, I want to eat it though.

Sure.

1381

01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:18,762
-but it didn't work.
-So hilarious.

1630
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,430
What else do we have?

1631
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,599
ROUND 4: ONE MIND
STRIKE THE SAME POSE

1632
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,901
THEY NEED 7 OUT OF 10 TO WIN ONE DISH

1633
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,970
Oh, that's too easy. Do whatever.

1634
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:28,371
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

1635
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:29,439
You sure?

1636
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,575
Just be moderate.
Not something out of the ordinary.

1637
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,078
-Whatever comes to mind.
-Something average.

1638
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,146
All right, let's go.

1639
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,182
ONE MIND, FIRST CUE WORD

1640
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,817
REVEALING NOW!

1641
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:43,153
[director] Jung Kook. One, two, three.

1642
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,623
One, two, three.

1643
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:50,460
One, two, three. Jung Kook.

1644
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,530
SIDE-EYE STRATEGY

1645
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,299
HOW CAN YOU CHEAT THIS OBVIOUSLY...

1646
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,367
NOT WATCHING THAT

1647
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:58,501
-[director] Fine.
-Fine.

1648
01:03:58,568 --> 01:03:59,569
FIRST ONE SUCCESSFUL

1649
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:00,670
All right, next.

1650
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:02,505
Selfie. One, two, three.

1651
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:03,873
CLICK!

1652
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,842
Beer. One, two, three.

1653
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,145
Sloth. One, two, three.

1654
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,780
PERFECT SYNC!

1655
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,816
Elephant. One, two, three.

1656
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,218
Pig. One, two, three.

1657
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:16,920
SIX IN A ROW IN A FLASH

1658
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,655
Da Nang. One, two, three.

1659
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,957
RIGHT HERE

1660
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,259
SEVEN IN A ROW!

1661
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,261
SEVEN CORRECT
ANOTHER DISH SECURED!

1662
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,931
CURRENT WINNINGS:
1 BEER, CHICKEN, AND ANOTHER BEER

1663
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:29,599
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1664
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,834
Have another one.

1665
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,337
At least not for me.

1666
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:40,009
THE SWEET TASTE OF BEER EARNED
THROUGH STRUGGLE

1667
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,045
OFF TO THE NEXT LATE-NIGHT SNACK

1668
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:43,680
-Is this the last one?
-Last?

1669
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,148
-For real?
-The last one?

1670
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,916
Pick what you want to eat.

1671
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:48,485
This one.

1672
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,886
FISH & CHIPS SELECTED

1673
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:52,188
THE FINAL GAME FOR FISH & CHIPS IS...?

1674
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,858
CHAM CHAM CHAM
BEST OF 3

1675
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,526
Want me to go first?

1676
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,261
Yeah.

1677
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,731
-It sure isn't easy feeding Jung Kook.
-Should I?

1678
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:03,733
This is the burden of being older.

1679
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,001
And what if you lose?

1680
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,337
DON'T WORRY
I'VE GOT A SECRET WEAPON

1681
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,705
PRODUCTION STAFF VS. JIMIN

1682
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:10,140

LOST THE SECOND ROUND

1686
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,379
TIED
ONE LAST ROUND TO DECIDE!

1687
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:17,480
Cham Cham Cham.

1688
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,783
SUCCESS!

1689
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:20,917
STAFF 1 : 2 JIMIN

1690
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:21,985
Oh, did I win?

1691
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,821
ROUND 5: JIMIN WINS
SNACK SECURED!

1692
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,791
A BIG BRO TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS YOUNGER BRO

1693
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,895
Jung Kook's peach and chips, peace...

1694
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:37,767
PROVIDING FOOD AND LAUGHS
TRULY THE BEST OLDER BROTHER...

1695
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,636
DOOMED...

1696
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,004
This is embarrassing.

1697
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:43,807
[director] Can we even air this?

1698
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,809
SUCCESSFULLY SECURED FISH & CHIPS

1699
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,478
TOTAL HAUL:
2 BEERS + CHICKEN + FISH & CHIPS

1700
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,213
Thank you for the food.

1701
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:52,482
[Jimin] Enjoy.

1702
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,451
It's late, but still...

1703
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,187
You went through a lot
traveling so far today.

1704
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,688
Everyone worked really hard.

1705
01:05:58,755 --> 01:05:59,756
Thank you all.

1706
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:00,990
Oh, this is good.

1707
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,860
THANKS TO JIMIN,
JUNG KOOK'S MOUTH STAYED HAPPY

1708
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:06,095
[Jimin] Let's go in.

1709
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,131
[whooping]

1710
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:13,036
THE NIGHT ISN'T OVER YET
THEY DIVE RIGHT IN

1711
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,239
It's deeper than I thought?

1712
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,108
Oh, this is nice here.

1713
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,176
Oh, it's warm.

1714
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:25,982
OUR NIGHT IN DA NANG BURNS
HOTTER THAN THE DAY

1715
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,819
I want to float.

1716
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:31,454
BUT HE SINKS

1717
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:35,325
They say if you fill half your lungs
with air, you'll float.

1718
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:38,228
SINKS AGAIN

1719
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,362
Why is he sinking?

1720
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:40,864
INHALE

1721
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,002
SINKS AGAIN

1722
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:52,242
I, PARK JIMIN, DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GIVE UP

1723
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:56,779
COACH JEON ENTERS

1724
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,751
WITH COACH JEON'S HELP, HE SOMEHOW FLOATS

1725
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,558
All I gotta do is move my legs. Nice.

1726
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,661
One foot, one foot.

1727
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,133
NEXT CHALLENGE: RIDE THE FLOAT

1728
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,436
BOARDS SUCCESSFULLY

1729
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,208
CAPSIZES ONE SECOND AFTER LAUNCH

1730
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:27,710
Hey, chicken fight?

1731
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:31,281
LATE-NIGHT 1V1 CHICKEN FIGHT BEGINS

1732
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,222
FORGET FIGHTING...
BOARDING IS THE REAL CHALLENGE...

1733
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,565
JIMIN BOARDS FIRST...

1734
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,233
NO, HE FAILS

1735
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,905
NEXT, JUNG KOOK'S TURN

1736
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,609
JUNG KOOK SUCCESSFULLY BOARDS FIRST!

1737
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:02,712
AT LAST, THEY MEET ATOP THE WATER

1738
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:06,549
CAPTAIN JEON VS. CAPTAIN PARK
DA NANG DUEL BEGINS

1739
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,452
GRAB THE LEGS AND FLIP

1740
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,454
SUCCESS

1741
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,491
DEFEATED WAY TOO EASILY...

1742
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,561
FUMING

1743
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,797
No, come after getting back on it.

1744
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,131
I said get back on.

1745
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:28,605
I TOLD YOU TO GET BACK ON, DIDN'T I???

1746
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,642
ATTACK POWER: ZERO

1747
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:34,544
THE FATE OF THE ONE WHO DISOBEYS

1748
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:35,945
I don't need water today.

1749
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:38,915
I've hydrated plenty.

1750
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:42,685
DA NANG BATTLE II BEGINS!

1751
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,888
DEFEAT DOES NOT EXIST IN MY DICTIONARY
JEON JUNG KOOK

1752
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,690
WARMED UP AND READY

1753
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,527
REVENGE IS MINE!
PARK JIMIN

1754
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,964
So we meet again, Jeon...

1755
01:08:55,031 --> 01:08:56,466
Wait, no. General Jeon.

1756
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,835
THE SHOWDOWN OF THE CENTURY(?)

1757
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,936
DA NANG BATTLE II

1758
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:02,672
GENERAL PARK SINKS ON HIS OWN...

1759
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:06,142
They say enemies meet
on a narrow bridge...

1760
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,111
So we meet again, General Jeon.

1761
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,178
Hyah!

1762
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,880
SINKS

1763
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,115
LAUGHING

1764
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,619
COME FIGHT ME AT ONCE

1765
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:22,792
LET'S DO THIS FOR REAL!

1766
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:27,263
AT LAST, FACE-TO-FACE!

1767
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,369
GENERAL PARK SINKS IN 5 SECONDS

1768
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:38,908
IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER

1769
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,510
UNDERWATER OFFENSE

1770
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,711
STRONG DEFENSE

1771
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:43,046
NECK-AND-NECK BATTLE

1772
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,115
GENERAL JEON HAS FALLEN!

1773
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,018
FAREWELL

1774
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:52,789
That was fun.

1775
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,325
ON OUR FIRST NIGHT IN DA NANG,
A FUN SWIM'S OVER!

1776
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,728
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1777
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,264
I brought a shower filter.

1778
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,435
JIMIN'S MUST-HAVE TRAVEL ITEM

1779
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,670
-I got a new one.
-Really?

1780
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,073
TRAVEL SHOWER HEAD

1781
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,075
[Jung Kook] Why is it so small? It's cute.

1782
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,043
[Jimin] Someone recommended it.

1783
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,546
Since it's small, I usually pack a few.

1784
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,747
-Since it's small?
-Yup.

1785
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:19,282
-That's what they say.
-Good.

1786
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,486
-Want to try it? You just attach it.
-Sure. Jimin, I actually...

1787
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,688
-Look.
-I really needed this.

1788
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,256
I'll show you how.

1789
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,324
I WILL INSTALL IT

1790
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,026
-Take this part off.
-Okay.

1791
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,127
And then...

1792
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,330
OPEN THE SHOWER HEAD CAP

1793
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,699
ATTACH IT AND YOU'RE DONE!

1794
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:40,870
TA-DA

1795
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:43,139
-Good water pressure, right?
-So good!

1796
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:44,674
That's how you do it.

1797
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,908
See?

1798
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,977
The water goes in here and flows out.

1799
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,047
JIMIN'S TRAVEL SKINCARE HACK

1800
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:52,181
The pressure's good.

1801
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,249
I know, right?

1802
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,752
SMALL BUT POWERFUL PRESSURE

1803
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,453
Don't underestimate it.

1804
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,988
FEAT. FILTERED SHOWER HEAD

1805
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:02,125
NO WATER-QUALITY WORRIES WHEN TRAVELING

1806
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,326
HOLD UP A SECOND

1807
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,762
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING...?

1808
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,897
IN BRIENZ
THE 1-HOUR RULE BECAME 3 HOURS

1809
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,398
-One hour for kimchi.
-Okay.

1810
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:13,603
3 HOURS OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM

1811
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:14,971
Digital minimalism.

1812
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,639
1 HOUR AT THE LODGE IN BRIENZ

1813
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:17,707
Complete!

1814
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,110
1 HOUR ON THE TRAIN

1815
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:23,780
AND STILL 1 HOUR LEFT

1816
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,815
[director] Jimin.

1817
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:26,883
You know,

1818
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,851
minimalism...

1819
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:35,458
RUNS AWAY IMMEDIATELY

1820
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,361
I knew it. I put my phone down on purpose.

1821
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:41,497
STAFF IMMEDIATELY CHASING AFTER HIM

1822
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,735
DOOR ALREADY LOCKED TIGHT

1823
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,104
THANK GOODNESS

1824
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:49,672
I locked the door.

1825
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:50,740
Minimalism.

1826
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:54,477
PROUD

1827
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,380
-[Jung Kook] We have one hour left.
-[groans]

1828
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:58,815
Not opening it.

1829
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,251
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

1830
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,020
[Jung Kook] Jimin, they say, open it.

1831
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,321
Nope.

1832
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,356
[Jung Kook] No?

1833
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,457
Nope.

1834
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,630
RELENTLESS STAFF KNOCKING

1835
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:15,698
Who is it?

1836
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,300
[man] Delivery.

1837
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:18,367
"Delivery."

1838
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,435
[laughing]

1839
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:20,903
"Delivery." Seriously?

1840
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,205
WHAT A LAME LIE

1841
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:27,577
JIMIN EVENTUALLY GOES TO OPEN THE DOOR

1842
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,981
[director] Let me come in.

1843
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:39,555
RELUCTANT STEPS TOWARD DIGITAL MINIMALISM

1844
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,692
-Ah!
-[director] For a peaceful night's rest...

1845
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,461
-[director] Start.
-Start.

1846
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,030
[Jung Kook] What should we do, Jimin?

1847
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,165
Want to play Yutnori?

1848
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:50,867
JUNG KOOK WANTS TO PLAY YUT

1849
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,836
1 VS. 1 YUT BOARD OPEN

1850
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:55,371
Let's each add one space.

1851
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:56,772
This goes back to start.

1852
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,875
ADDING TRAPS

1853
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,209
I added one too.

1854
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,212
BLACK JUNG KOOK VS. WHITE JIMIN

1855
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,214
-I'll take black.
-Okay, I'll be white.

1856
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:07,083
I'm the man in black.

1857
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,718
Rock-paper-scissors.

1858
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,019
-I go first.
-Okay.

1859
01:13:10,086 --> 01:13:11,254
First strike wins.

1860
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:15,024
Geol.

1861
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,695
JIMIN STARTS TOO

1862
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:20,763
Caught you.

1863
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,331
JUNG KOOK GOT CAUGHT

1864
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,399
Oh, not yet.

1865
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,701
JIMIN THROWS AGAIN

1866
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,870
That's a foul. It bounced out...

1867
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:29,839
-Okay.
-It bounced.

1868
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,641
Then you stay here, right?

1869
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:32,708
Yes, stay there.

1870
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:35,845
Back-do.

1871
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:36,913
BUSY HANDS

1872
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,180
Back-do.

1873
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:44,453
This is do.

1874
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,556
ONE MORE SPACE AND IT'S A TRAP

1875
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:48,758
I'll just get do.

1876
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,126
Okay, okay, okay.

1877
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:52,795
Do! Caught you again.

1878
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:54,764
CAUGHT AGAIN

1879
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,831
Gae.

1880
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,833
Geol.

1881
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,869
THINKING...

1882
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,003
I'm catching you.

1883
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,138
CAUGHT AGAIN

1884
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,339
I gotta catch you.

1885
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:06,342
FORGETTING DIGITAL MINIMALISM
THEY'RE FULLY IMMERSED IN YUT...

1886
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,210
If I get do, I'm catching you.

1887
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,278
Back-do.

1888
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:10,746
[groans]

1889
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,115
Good game, you're good.

1890
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,183
You're good.

1891
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,551
STILL 25 MINUTES LEFT

1892
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,887
HOW THESE TWO SPEND TIME WITHOUT PHONES

1893
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,088
The right foot, no?

1894
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:24,126
REVIEWING CHOREO FROM OLD PROMOS

1895
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,264
WHAT IS THAT...? IS THAT RIGHT...?

1896
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:29,765
-What are you doing?
-Dunno.

1897
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:32,368
Isn't it this?

1898
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,537
WHATEVER, JUST ENJOY IT

1899
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:35,604
Isn't it this?

1900
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,243
SORRY, J-HOPE...

1901
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,545
TIME FLEW WHILE PLAYING

1902
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:43,646
Jimin, time's up.

1903
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:45,881
One second, done.

1904
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:48,584
MISSION COMPLETE!

1905
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:49,652
Key, please.

1906
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,722
GIVE ME THE KEY!!!

1907
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,191
SIDE EFFECTS OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM

1908
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:59,328
BOTH PHONES SAFELY RETRIEVED

1909
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:00,896
Bye, everyone.

1910
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,701
NIGHT FALLS DEEPER.
IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED.

1911
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:07,937
BEDTIME PREP DONE

1912
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,105
[Jung Kook] Let's sleep.

1913
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:10,873
No.

1914
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,076
Is this right?

1915
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:20,683
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE

1916
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:24,120
THROUGH THE DEEP NIGHT OF VIETNAM

1917
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,088
DAY TWO BEGINS

1918
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,258
A MORNING GREETED BY A NEW VIEW

1919
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:33,195
WHAT ADVENTURES AWAIT TODAY?

1920
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:37,700
WHERE'S JUNG KOOK?

1921
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:42,605
FOUND HIM

1922
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,811
COULD IT BE A MIRACULOUS MORNING?

1923
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,984
BACK TO DREAMLAND...

1924
01:15:55,751 --> 01:16:00,990
DEEP SLEEP EVEN IN MORNING SUNLIGHT

1925
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,363
WHERE AM I? WHO AM I?

1926
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,500
CHECKS THE TIME ONCE

1927
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:16,238
JUNG KOOK'S UP FIRST

1928
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:20,009
AND HEADS TO WASH UP...

1929
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:26,182
THANKS TO THAT,
JIMIN SLEEPS A LITTLE LONGER

1930
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,422
JIMIN WAKES TO THE SOUND OF MOVEMENT

1931
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:36,926
Ten minutes left.

1932
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,564
[director] We need to head out
in five minutes.

1933
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:51,307
JIMIN GOES TO WASH UP TOO

1934
01:16:57,513 --> 01:17:01,517
BE BACK AFTER WASHING UP

1935
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:03,519
TODAY'S PLAN:
ISLAND HOPPING TOUR

1936
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:06,255
LUNCH, PARASAILING
DINNER, HỘI AN SIGHTSEEING

1937
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:11,193
[Jimin] Vietnam's weather
really is the best for swimming.

1938
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:14,697
A.K.A. ISLAND-HOPPING
FIRST ACTIVITY: WATER TIME

1939
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,603
HEADING TO THE BUS

1940
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:23,272
The weather is so...

1941
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,275
good.

1942
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:27,877
I slept late because of him.

1943
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:28,944
I'm exhausted.

1944
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,179
Why is it because of me?

1945
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:34,550
I was falling asleep and you woke me up...

1946
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,554
JIMIN ASLEEP

1947
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:39,688
[Jung Kook] You asleep?

1948
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:44,927
THE CRAZY ONE(?) WAKES HIM SLEEPING

1949
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:48,030
ROUGHLY BAD LANGUAGE

1950
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,901
[Jimin] Just wait.
Tomorrow, I'm going to torment you.

1951
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,436
JEON JUNG KOOK, JUST WAIT TILL TOMORROW

1952
01:17:55,037 --> 01:18:00,109
ATTEMPTS TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN

1953
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,111
I'm awake now.

1954
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,812
I was falling asleep.

1955
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:07,483
When I came back from the bathroom,
he was snoring.

1956
01:18:09,585 --> 01:18:12,288
I'm so tired.
I didn't even have four hours of sleep.

1957
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:16,125
HE HAS NO EXCUSES...

1958
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:20,196
WE ACTUALLY GET ALONG WELL

1959
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:24,266
-I'm sleepy.
-Huh?

1960
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:25,401
I'm sleepy.

1961
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,071
ARRIVED AT THE BUS STOP

1962
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,439
Let's go.

1963
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:33,209
It's hot.

1964
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,144
It's scorching.

1965
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:39,682
BACK OF THE HEAD SMACKED BY THE SUN

1966
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:43,519
LET'S HOP ON THE BUS AND GO TO HAVE FUN

1967
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,489
I'm worried.

1968
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,994
RESORT - HOPPING TOUR PIER

1969
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:55,231
DRIVING UNDER THE BLAZING SUN

1970
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:59,969
HEADING TO THE PIER TO MEET THE COOL OCEAN

1971
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:04,373
ARRIVED AT THE HOPPING TOUR PIER

1972
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,141
Let's go.

1973
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:14,149
[exhales]

1974
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,619
Gosh, it's hot.

1975
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,354
Ah!

1976
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,556
Ah!

1977
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,391
Ah!

1978
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,727
The sun is way too strong.

1979
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,663
THEY ARRIVE, ENDURING THE BURNING SUN

1980
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,931
Is this it?

1981
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,236
THE SPEEDBOAT THAT'LL
TAKE THEM ON TODAY'S TOUR

1982
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,138
SHALL WE GET GOING?

1983
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:37,640
[director] We're finally going.

1984
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:40,609
There aren't sharks here, right?

1985
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:43,746
SHARKS...?

1986
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,414
IF YOU ENCOUNTER A SHARK,

1987
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:46,682
DO NOT PROVOKE IT

1988
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:49,018
GET OUT OF THE WATER OR STAY STILL!

1989
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,986
What if it bites first?

1990
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:52,788
Give it your foot.

1991
01:19:52,855 --> 01:19:54,723
Then another shark comes. What then?

1992
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:58,060
DEFEAT IT WITH STRENGTH

1993
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,063
ONE-TWO PUNCH
SITUATION SOLVED(?)

1994
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,798
But you get slow in the water.

1995
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:03,866
EXCITED OVER SHARK

1996
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:05,534
Push it back like this.

1997
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:06,602
Just whack it.

1998
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,837
You dodge two sharks and turn around,

1999
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,006
and there's another. Now what?

2000
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:17,246
SOLVE IT WITH STRENGTH AGAIN

2001
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,714
Whack it again.

2002
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:20,716
IT'S HIS IMAGINATION. DO NOT IMITATE THIS.

2003
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,985
-But are there sharks here?
-No idea.

Wouldn't it be cool if a shark
suddenly showed up right under us?

2082
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,795
I'll lift my legs up.

2083
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,763
You have to go super slow here.

01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,812
This is different from a lake.

2097
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:51,880
NOT EASY...

2098
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,950
NOW THEY EVEN PADDLE LYING DOWN

2099
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:56,318
This is the fastest way.

2100
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,421
I guess it's wind-free.

NEED SUGAR

2119
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,480
Gotta drink something.

2123
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:16,398
JUNG KOOK HYDRATES TOO

2124
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:17,899
Ah!

2125
01:27:19,034 --> 01:27:20,469
Gosh, I feel better now.

2126
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,238
Was coconut water always this sweet?

2127
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,108
Hydro-coconut?

01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:47,963
Do we hold hands and...

2135
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:50,832
No, the one where you lift up
from the boat like this.

2136
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:51,967
Oh, that one?

2137
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,971
-We've done it, right? Right.
-In Kota Kinabalu.

It feels like you're in heaven.

2139
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:02,844
I want to try the one where you just
grab the jet thing behind...

Imagine we're at the ocean.

01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,318
Probably?

01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:45,620
Rookies are like 13 years younger than me.

We're old now.

I'm 15 years older than some rookies.

2165
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:58,867
Yeah, old.

2166
01:28:58,934 --> 01:29:01,503
I thought,
"They're so young. How did they debut?"

2167
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:03,538
But we debuted in high school too.

2168
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:06,374
-I debuted in 10th grade.
-Exactly.

2169
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:08,710
They can call us uncles now.

2170
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,078
Wow, really.

2171
01:29:10,145 --> 01:29:12,180
I'm still only 29.

2172
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:15,050
I gotta enjoy these last months,
before I turn 30.

2173
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:16,885
I'm 27.

2174
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,121
Why do you look so young?

2175
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:21,623
Nah, I look exactly my age.

2176
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,824
My face does.

2177
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:24,593
I look like I'm 20.

2178
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,429
You have a baby face though.

2179
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:32,234
CAN'T HIDE THAT SMILE

2180
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:33,869
You're baby-faced.

2181
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:36,404
If you say so, thanks.

2182
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:37,472
What?

2183
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,740
Thanks!

2184
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:39,808
Thanks?

2185
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:42,310
Thanks?

2186
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,346
Grateful I said that?

2187
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:51,119
LAUGHING AGAIN

2188
01:29:51,186 --> 01:29:53,388
You're just so hilarious.

2189
01:29:53,455 --> 01:29:55,657
This show survives because of you.

2190
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:59,027
THUMBS-UP

2191
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:02,964
ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT FOR LUNCH

2192
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:04,065
Let's go.

2193
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:07,168
WELCOMING THE TWO

2194
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,004
IS A FULL KOREAN FEAST SPREAD

2195
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,373
-[Jimin] Smells amazing.
-This is real Korean food.

2196
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,208
There's going to be another game.

2197
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:14,376
We're in trouble.

2198
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:15,443
CHEATING MODE ON

2199
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,445
-Let's eat.
-Before the director comes?

2200
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,681
CAMERA SHOWS THE URGENCY

2201
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,216
[Jung Kook] They didn't tell us.

2202
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:22,884
Eat fast.

2203
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:24,519
-No, no.
-One fishcake.

2204
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:27,822
ONE FOR YOU

2205
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,925
ONE FOR ME

2206
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:31,026
COVERING UP

2207
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,527
Hide the chopsticks.

2208
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:36,264
THE STAFF ENTERS AFTER THE CRIME

2209
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:38,199
Hey, we can't lose the meat.

2210
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:39,267
CHANGE THE SUBJECT

2211
01:30:39,334 --> 01:30:43,605
PRETENDS TO FIX HIS BANGS

2212
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:45,473
[director] How's the food? You like it?

2213
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,942
-Yes.
-Yeah.

2214
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:49,411
Let's just hurry. I'm going crazy here.

2215
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:50,912
Put the meat on the grill?

2216
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,214
Just put it on?

2217
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,382
-No, no.
-Put it on.

2218
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,784
You might lose the meat.

2219
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,819
NO WAY... RIGHT?

2220
01:30:57,886 --> 01:30:59,721
GAME #1

2221
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:03,525
THE FIRST KOREAN DISH TO BEAT THE HEAT

2222
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:05,894
COLD NOODLES ARE ON THE LINE

2223
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,096
-Call a friend
-Okay.

2224
01:31:08,163 --> 01:31:11,666
and get them to say "naengmyeon"
within 30 seconds.

2225
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:12,734
A friend?

2226
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:14,970
-In 30 seconds?
-In 30 seconds.

2227
01:31:15,704 --> 01:31:18,239
But that sounds too easy.

2228
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,175
"What do we eat to cure a hangover?"

2229
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,276
Oh, that's good.

2230
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:23,812
THEY HAVE A PLAN AND A STRATEGY, BUT...

2231
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:26,514
-But we don't have many friends.
-Exactly.

2232
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,049
j-hope?

2233
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:30,352
-j-hope.
-It starts as soon as he picks up.

2234
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,754
But j-hope doesn't really drink...

2235
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,456
Jin sounds good.

2236
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:38,226
Jin sounds good. I'll call Jin, then.

2237
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:39,861
Timer starts when he picks up?

2238
01:31:41,096 --> 01:31:42,664
-[line ringing]
-Will he answer?

2239
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,000
-Speakerphone?
-Yeah.

2240
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,336
THE RINGING KEEPS GOING...

2241
01:31:48,403 --> 01:31:49,471
No, Jin?

2242
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:50,638
Not a good time?

2243
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:52,841
Is he working?

2244
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,478
Then I have no one to call.

2245
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,313
Say we're filming first.

2246
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,748
FAILED TO REACH JIN

2247
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:01,016
Gotta ask right away.

2248
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:03,618
-Do I really not have friends?
-I don't have many...

2249
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:07,188
Find a friend.

2250
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:08,390
You've got Dongmin.

2251
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:09,524
Mingyu, Dongmin.

2252
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,860
Let's try calling Mingyu.

2253
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,331
He won't answer.

2254
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:17,532
NERVOUS

2255
01:32:17,599 --> 01:32:20,101
He barely picks up. Might be overseas too.

2256
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:23,038
So is our mission basically
"Someone, please pick up"?

2257
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,974
-No one's answering...
-Please, pick up.

2258
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,777
FRANTICALLY SCROLLING THROUGH CONTACTS

2259
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,879
What about my mom?

2260
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:32,781
-He won't answer either.
-That's fine.

2261
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:35,116
Or my dad? I don't usually do this...

2262
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:36,684
He kind of loves attention.

2263
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:37,852
There's Chan too.

2264
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:42,924
CALLING JIMIN'S DAD RIGHT AWAY

2265
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,559
Are you back in Korea?

2266
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:46,027
-Dad.
-Huh?

2267
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:49,697
What's the noodle we eat with pork belly?

2268
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:51,399
Pickled garlic leaves.

2269
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,301
No, no, the noodle.

2270
01:32:53,368 --> 01:32:55,503
Oh, the noodle you eat with pork belly?

2271
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,671
Yes.

2272
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,972
Where are you? Vietnam?

2273
01:32:58,039 --> 01:33:00,341
No, what's that noodle called, Dad?

2274
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:01,876
10 SECONDS PASSED

2275
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:03,711
Noodles with pork belly?

2276
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:06,714
Wheat noodles.

2277
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:07,982
Or naengmyeon.

2278
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:10,718
Not the spicy one, the other one?

2279
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:13,421
-Mul-naengmyeon.
-Cold noodles.

2280
01:33:13,488 --> 01:33:16,391
-Mul-naengmyeon.
-Cold noodles.

2281
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,026
24 seconds. Success.

2282
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,662
Dad, we were playing a game.

2283
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,030
It's delicious together.

2284
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,998
Thanks, Dad.

2285
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,066
Where are you now?

2286
01:33:25,133 --> 01:33:26,801
I'm in Vietnam right now.

2287
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:29,137
I know, I know. I know all about Vietnam.

2288
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:32,240
I'm filming a game segment
with Jung Kook right now.

2289
01:33:32,307 --> 01:33:33,475
Did you guys win?

2290
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:36,077
-Yes.
-Thanks to you, we did.

2291
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:37,512
I'll call you later.

2292
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:39,914
-Have a good shoot.
-Okay, Dad.

2293
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:40,982
Love you.

2294
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,617
-Love you.
-Love you.

2295
01:33:42,684 --> 01:33:44,819
-Jung Kook, take care.
-Thanks.

2296
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:48,690
SWEET CALL WITH DAD ENDS

2297
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:51,359
All right, you've secured
the cold noodles.

2298
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:52,760
Oh, we got the noodles?

2299
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,629
-Let's taste the broth first.
-Okay.

2300
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:57,365
A QUICK SIP OF THE BROTH

2301
01:33:57,432 --> 01:34:01,603
THEN JUN KOOK TAKES A SIP TOO

2302
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:03,471
-All right, let's go.
-Okay.

2303
01:34:03,538 --> 01:34:05,306
Next up, pork belly's on the line.

2304
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:06,374
-Okay.
-Okay.

2305
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:09,677
TODAY'S MAIN DISH THAT YOU CAN'T MISS

2306
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:12,180
PORK BELLY & PORK JOWL SET

2307
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:14,949
Okay, this is a consonant quiz.
At the same time...

2308
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:16,251
I should put this down.

2309
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:20,088
Both of you have to say the same word
at the same time.

2310
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:21,956
-You go, just relax.
-Okay.

2311
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:23,258
-We'll do three.
-Okay.

2312
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:26,027
Get two out of three right to win.
Here we go.

2313
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:28,096
-H-B.
-H.

2314
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:30,165
-H-B.
-One, two, three.

2315
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:31,799
-Altitude.
-Pumpkin. Altitude?

2316
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,003
-I thought you'd say pumpkin.
-Fail.

2317
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:37,272
Okay, I get the vibe now.

2318
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,073
VERY UNUSUAL TYPE

2319
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,341
[director] Second round.

2320
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:43,044
-D-N.
-D.

2321
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:44,145
-D-N?
-N?

2322
01:34:44,212 --> 01:34:45,313
-N.
-Okay.

2323
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,381
One, two, three.

2324
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,448
-Da Nang.
-Da Nang.

2325
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:48,516
-Yes.
-Yes.

2326
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,385
Let's go.

2327
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:54,355
WRITING IT DOWN ON THEIR PALMS

2328
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:57,025
-B-T.
-B.

2329
01:34:57,091 --> 01:34:58,259
-B-T?
-Okay, okay.

2330
01:34:58,326 --> 01:34:59,594
B-T, one, two, three.

2331
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:00,662
-Bangtan.
-Bangtan.

2332
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:02,363
-Success.
-Great.

2333
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,865
MEAT ACQUIRED!

2334
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,767
-Grill it!
-Grill it!

2335
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,101
Where are the tongs?

2336
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:08,369
Just use chopsticks.

2337
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:09,437
Use scissors.

2338
01:35:09,504 --> 01:35:12,440
Can we get one pair of tongs?
I'll grill it.

2339
01:35:12,507 --> 01:35:14,642
-Not going to put it on?
-No, not sideways.

2340
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,077
BRAIN FREEZE

2341
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:18,313
-Vertically?
-Yeah.

2342
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,614
SERIOUS ABOUT MEAT

2343
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:21,182
Melt the fat first.

2344
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:25,119
You've got the pork belly
and the cold noodles.

2345
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:26,421
What do you want next?

2346
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:27,555
-Next...
-Next?

2347
01:35:27,622 --> 01:35:28,656
Just give up?

2348
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,325
No way, what do you mean?

2349
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:32,760
All right, next.

2350
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:34,462

WELCOME, JAPCHAE

2364
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,455
What's next?

2365
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:02,257
Isn't this game way too easy?

2366
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:04,425
You're just letting us win on purpose?

2367
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:05,760
This one, this one.

2368
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:07,161
This one.

2369
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:10,331
THE STEW BOILING FURIOUSLY

2370
01:36:10,398 --> 01:36:12,634
-Stew, stew, stew.
-Oh, right.

2371
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,168
THIS TIME, IT'S STEW!

2372
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,336
Take a bite of this.

2373
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:16,904
What if it's a tricky one?

2374
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:19,107
BUT...

2375
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:21,276
SUCCEED AGAIN WITH UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM!

2376
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:22,343

AND THEY NAIL THE NEXT ONE TOO

2378
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:25,213
Wife's...

2379
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,347
-Temptation.
-Correct.

2380
01:36:26,414 --> 01:36:28,983
CRAZY TEAMWORK

2381
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,885
YAY!

2382
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:31,953
That was perfect.

2383
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,821
What did we get so far?

2384
01:36:33,888 --> 01:36:34,889
Pretty much all.

2388
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,399
Can we bet for the wraps this time?

2389
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,700

01:36:58,746 --> 01:36:59,947
Okay, Jung Kook?

2395
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:01,015

-The Outlaws.
-[both exclaim]

2402
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:14,262
Oh, right.

2403
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:16,230
That one was relatively easy.

2404
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:17,298
Yeah.

2405
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:21,969

01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:45,560
S-O-O-CH-O.

2415
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:46,994

01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,571
Right, movies are included.

2421
01:37:58,106 --> 01:38:00,808

The Thieves.

2428
01:38:14,756 --> 01:38:17,125
CORRECT ANSWER: THE THIEVES

2429
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:18,493
We can't eat the wraps.

2430
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:19,560
No wraps?

2431
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:23,498
♪ Bye, bye, bye ♪

2432
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:27,735
Okay then, the last one.
Stir-fried pork or green onion pancake.

2433
01:38:27,802 --> 01:38:30,004
-Pancake.
-Okay, pancake.

2434
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:33,441
Each of you name three Korean cities.

2435
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:35,543
-Jung Kook first.
-Too easy.

2436
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,011
Excluding Cheongju.

2437
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:38,112
Seoul.

2438
01:38:38,179 --> 01:38:39,180
Jangheung.

2439
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,248
Gyeonggi-do?

2440
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:41,315
-Wrong.
-Huh? What?

2441
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:42,517
-Huh?
-Why?

2442
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,918
What?

2443
01:38:43,985 --> 01:38:45,953
You have to say a city.

2444
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,656
TOO LATE TO ARGUE
ALREADY FAILED

2445
01:38:48,723 --> 01:38:50,091
Isn't that right?

2446
01:38:50,825 --> 01:38:52,326
Like, Yeosu.

2447
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:54,061
You only said "Gyeonggi-do."

2448
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:56,230
WHAT ARE YOU DOING...?

2449
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:57,799
Oh, right, put it down.

2450
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,903

Are we betting something for this?

2453
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:09,210
-[Jung Kook] Mango juice?
-Mango juice.

2454
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:12,246
Do you take the subway these days?

2455
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:15,383
-Nope, not really.
-It's been like three years.

2456
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,451
Okay.

2457
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:19,687
Dig into your memory.
Subway station names, go.

2458
01:39:20,421 --> 01:39:21,589
NOT CONFIDENT AT ALL

2459
01:39:21,656 --> 01:39:23,691
-How many each?
-Three each.

2460
01:39:24,325 --> 01:39:25,793
-You got this, right?
-Yes.

2461
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:26,861
All right, let's go.

2462
01:39:26,928 --> 01:39:28,196
Oksu Station.

2463
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:30,064
-Apgujeong Station.
-Sinsa Station.

2464
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:31,399
Rodeo Station?

2465
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,201
-Wangsimni Station.
-Sinsa Station.

2466
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:34,335
-Wrong.
-Why?

2467
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:35,937
You already said that?

2468
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:38,706
I was cutting the meat.

2469
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:39,841
AH, MY MANGO JUICE...

2470
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:41,342
[director] Mango juice, please.

2471
01:39:43,211 --> 01:39:44,545
I can't multitask.

2472
01:39:44,612 --> 01:39:46,080
Ohh!

2473
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:48,549
DETERMINED TO TASTE EVEN A SINGLE DROP

2474
01:39:48,616 --> 01:39:50,218
That mango juice tastes bad.

2475
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:51,285
I liked it.

2476
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:53,754
Self-comforting logic.

2477
01:39:54,856 --> 01:39:57,625
-It's over.
-Anything else you'd like to eat?

2478
01:39:57,692 --> 01:39:59,594
-We have enough.
-It's enough.

2479
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,162
[director] Okay. Enjoy your meal.

2480
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:02,597
-Enjoy!
-Enjoy!

2481
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:09,370
STILL CAN'T WASH OFF THAT MILITARY TONE

2482
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:14,475
THE MEAT WAS PERFECTLY COOKED
DURING THE GAMES

2483
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:18,446
FIRST, A BITE OF MEAT

2484
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:19,614
Oh, Jimin.

2485
01:40:20,615 --> 01:40:22,049
A whole chunk of pork belly.

2486
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:24,285
A WHOLE PIECE OF PORK BELLY IN THE STEW

2487
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,220
I wanted the stew the most.

2488
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:28,823
SCOOPS IT UP GENEROUSLY FOR JIMIN FIRST

2489
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:29,891
Try it.

2490
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:33,160

2500
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:01,789
QUICKLY HAVING RICE TO MAKE IT LESS HOT

01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:04,025
Wow, this really brings
your appetite back.

LOADS OF SPICY SAUCE ADDED IN

2505
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:11,032
[Jung Kook] This isn't ssamjang.

2506
01:41:15,102 --> 01:41:16,170
Is it good?

2507
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,674
SLURP SLURP

2508
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,877
THE STANDARD OF A COLD-NOODLE MUKBANG

2509
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:26,113
If we had soju with this,

2510
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:28,482
it'd be perfect.

2511
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:30,351
Right?

2512
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:31,786
GLANCING AROUND

BOLDLY PICKS IT UP

2518
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:48,169
A CHILI PEPPER?

2519
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:52,073
SWIFTLY SECURES THE TARGET

01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:02,083
SECRETLY RETRIEVES IT

2524
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:03,684
SSAMJANG IS A MUST

2525
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,457
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH

2526
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:14,195
YEAH! THAT'S THE STUFF

2527
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:20,935
EVEN TASTIER WITH THAT SPICY KICK OF CHILI

2528
01:42:21,435 --> 01:42:23,004
Korean food really does...

2529
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:25,006
GUILTY CONSCIENCE

2530
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:28,075
It goes down so smoothly.

2531
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,211
♪ Grow, grow ♪

2532
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:31,846
♪ Grow, grow ♪

2533
01:42:31,912 --> 01:42:33,447
GLANCING AGAIN

2534
01:42:35,016 --> 01:42:37,184
SNEAKS ANOTHER CHILI AWAY

2535
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,858
SMOOTHLY

2536
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:45,893
FAILS TO HOLD BACK LAUGHTER

2537
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,662
SECRET TRY-NOT-TO-LAUGH CHALLENGE

2538
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:49,497
THINKING OF SOMETHING SAD

2539
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:55,770
THE SECRET DEAL RESUMES

2540
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:58,472
WAITING FOR THE PERFECT TIMING

2541
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:01,409
ADVANCED SKILL ACTIVATED

2542
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:03,210
[coughs]

2543
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,081
What, what?

2544
01:43:07,148 --> 01:43:11,485
THE TWO-MAN CHILI-THIEF CREW PULLS OFF
THE PERFECT CRIME(?)

2545
01:43:12,153 --> 01:43:14,522
AN UNEXPECTED TWIST OCCURS...

2546
01:43:14,588 --> 01:43:15,623
Oh, man...

2547
01:43:16,257 --> 01:43:17,458
Whoa, that's spicy.

2548
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:19,160
Spicy, right?

2549
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:20,928
THE CHILI IS SPICIER THAN EXPECTED

2550
01:43:20,995 --> 01:43:23,064
TREATING IT TEMPORARILY WITH MEAT

2551
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:25,366
EVEN STUFFING IT DOWN WITH RICE

2552
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:27,134
STILL WAY TOO SPICY

2553
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,202
I'm so full.

2554
01:43:29,937 --> 01:43:31,005
I'll go.

2555
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:34,675
JIMIN SUDDENLY JUMPS UP...?

2556
01:43:34,742 --> 01:43:37,144
OFF TO MAKE A DEAL TO GET MANGO JUICE

2557
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,680
[director] Mango juice? [laughs]

2558
01:43:39,747 --> 01:43:41,682
AND SO, A BONUS GAME BEGINS

2559
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:44,518
Rock, paper, scissors. Minus one.

2560
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:46,487
AHH...

2561
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,489
THE MANGO JUICE IS GONE IN AN INSTANT

2562
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,191
NEXT CHALLENGER

2563
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:51,692
MANGO-JUICE BATTLE, ROUND 2

2564
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:53,060
Minus one.

2565
01:43:53,127 --> 01:43:54,195
Rock-paper-scissors.

2566
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:55,596
A TIGHT MATCH

2567
01:43:55,663 --> 01:43:56,864
Rock-paper-scissors.

2568
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:58,132
Minus one.

2569
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:00,267
Rock-paper-scissors, minus one.

2570
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:01,936
VICTORY AFTER A FIERCE MATCH

2571
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:04,438
OFF TO CLAIM THE MANGO JUICE

2572
01:44:04,505 --> 01:44:07,541
BITTERSWEET...

2573
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:11,245
DRINKING MANGO JUICE WHILE TEASING HIM

2574
01:44:11,312 --> 01:44:13,247
A SECRET SIGNAL UNDER THE TABLE

2575
01:44:14,682 --> 01:44:15,750
SIDE GLANCE

2576
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:19,019
THE SECRET EXCHANGE BEGINS AGAIN

2577
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:21,489
BUSTED

2578
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:23,257
WANT TO PLAY FOR IT?

2579
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:25,126
A DUEL FOR MANGO JUICE

2580
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:27,061
Rock-paper-scissors, minus one.

2581
01:44:27,128 --> 01:44:28,362
FINALLY, JIMIN WINS!

2582
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:29,430
It was just for fun.

2583
01:44:31,332 --> 01:44:33,167
A HAPPY ENDING AFTER ALL

2584
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:37,471
AFTER A MEAL MADE EVEN BETTER
WITH GOOD KOREAN FOOD

2585
01:44:37,538 --> 01:44:39,006
THEY GET READY FOR PARASAILING

2586
01:44:39,073 --> 01:44:42,676
You got to apply at least
as much as two joints of your pinky.

2587
01:44:42,743 --> 01:44:45,846
APPLYING PLENTY OF SUNSCREEN
FOR THE STRONG SUNLIGHT

2588
01:44:45,913 --> 01:44:47,348
It's not sticky.

2589
01:44:48,516 --> 01:44:51,952
And it doesn't even leave
a white cast, it's perfect.

2590
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:54,622
And it's not a sunscreen,
it's a sun serum.

2591
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:56,223
THE HYDRATING SUN SERUM

2592
01:44:56,290 --> 01:45:00,327
Usually, it makes your skin white
and feels sticky, but...

2593
01:45:01,195 --> 01:45:02,963
MOIST BUT NEVER STICKY

2594
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:04,865
PERFECT UV PROTECTION

2595
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:08,302
See, it's not white.

2596
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:09,670
It's not, right?

2597
01:45:09,737 --> 01:45:10,771
Mine's a bit white.

2598
01:45:10,838 --> 01:45:12,506
I did that on purpose.

2599
01:45:12,573 --> 01:45:14,742
-So my skin doesn't peel.
-The sun's strong.

2600
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:18,345
It applies nicely, kind of dewy.

2601
01:45:19,413 --> 01:45:20,915
It all absorbs in.

2602
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:22,650
I should put some on my hands.

2603
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:28,489
GENEROUSLY APPLYING IT
TO THE BACK OF THE HANDS TOO

2604
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:31,125
ALL SET
LET'S GO PARASAILING

2605
01:45:31,192 --> 01:45:32,927
Let's go fly.

2606
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,361
Let's go flying.

2607
01:45:34,428 --> 01:45:35,596
Let's go fly.

2608
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:37,498
-[Jimin] Let's go fly.
-Let's go fly.

2609
01:45:37,565 --> 01:45:42,703
TIME TO SOAR THROUGH THE DA NANG SKY

2610
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:44,038
PROTECT THE ITEM

2611
01:45:44,104 --> 01:45:47,308
-[director] You'll hide it five minutes.
-Where do I hide this?

2612
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:48,876
How do we protect it?

2613
01:45:48,943 --> 01:45:50,711
THE TENSION IN THE AIR IS PALPABLE

2614
01:45:50,778 --> 01:45:52,780
[Jimin] No way it's hidden that sloppily.

2615
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:54,515
Where is it? Tell me where!

2616
01:45:54,582 --> 01:45:56,050
AND SO BEGINS THE BROTHERS' WAR

2617
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:58,252
[Jung Kook] Look at you
keeping me in check first.

2618
01:45:58,319 --> 01:45:59,453
I'll destroy everything.

2619
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,554
This is it!

2620
01:46:00,621 --> 01:46:02,022
Break it!

2621
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,124
We just break it? Like this?

2622
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:07,728
WHO WILL WIN THIS TENSE MORNING MISSION?!

2623
01:46:07,795 --> 01:46:09,496
-Where is it?
-Where did you hide it?

2624
