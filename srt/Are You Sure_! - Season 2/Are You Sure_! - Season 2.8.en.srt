8
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,706
ANGRY AT NEOLOGISMS

9
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,041
SAD THEY GOT MANY WRONG

10
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,376
ENJOYABLE AT THE SAME TIME

11
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,044
THEY HAD A TASTE OF ALL EMOTIONS

12
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,712

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,281

19
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,704
WHAT OTHER TOUR IS WAITING FOR THEM?

20
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,039
[Jung Kook] I'm full.

21
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,473
[Jimin] Put your seat belt on.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,175
FASTENING

23
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,477
Gosh, I enjoyed it so much.

24
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,513
HE LOST CONTROL AND BINGED ON KOREAN FOOD

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,647
I'm so full.

26
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,482
JIMIN IS JUST AS FULL

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,018
I'm getting sleepy now that I'm full.

28
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,755
THE BLOOD SUGAR SPIKE KNOCKS HIM DOWN

RESTAURANT TO AN BANG BEACH

31
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,066
THEY ARRIVE AT AN BANG BEACH

32
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,935
Where is it? Here?

33
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,003
HALF ASLEEP

34
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,071
Where is it?

35
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,106
JIMIN FOLLOWS HIM OUT

36
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,874
Oh, it's a beach.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,083
CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT WATER
AND FINE SAND THAT LIES ENDLESSLY

38
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,518
YOU CAN ENJOY VARIOUS SEA ACTIVITIES HERE

39
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,920
[Jung Kook] This is paradise.

40
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,390
-But the sun is...
-What?

41
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,192
...way too hot. Unbelievably hot.

42
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,994
THE SUNLIGHT IS EXTREMELY STRONG

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,895
[Jung Kook] My clothes might catch fire.

44
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,597
My clothes might get torn.

45
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,832
THEY ARE BOTH IN BLACK...

46
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,500
My clothes might melt down.

47
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,569
It's too hot.

48
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,770
It's burning hot.

49
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,341
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THE SUN IN VIETNAM?

50
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,812
Acting cool.

51
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,216
GETTING READY TO ACT COOL AGAIN

52
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,219
I'M BEWITCHED BY MYSELF

53
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,822
IN A TRANCE

54
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,990
Anyway...

55
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,493
what are we riding?

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,495
That one?

57
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,230
We'll be hanging there?

58
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,699
-[director] Guys.
-Yes.

59
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,868
You have a mission.

60
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,436
-A mission? Okay.
-Yes.

61
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,739
-It's protecting an item over one hour...
-Okay.

62
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,307
...of digital minimalism.

63
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,144
SURPRISE MISSION
PROTECT AN ITEM WHILE PARASAILING

64
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,446
[director] It shouldn't be torn or broken.

65
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,148
You must maintain the shape.

66
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,616
DEBATING WHERE TO HIDE IT

67
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,718
Isn't this the safest place?

68
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,255
JIMIN CHOOSES TO KEEP IT ON HIS CALF

69
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,158
FUMBLING

70
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,994
JUNG KOOK WRAPS IT TIGHT
AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET

71
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,296
A MUST ROUTINE FOR UV PROTECTION

72
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,799
ENOUGH OF SUN SERUM

73
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,834
A FULL PALM OF IT

74
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:27,140
APPLYING IT TO ALL EXPOSED SKIN THOROUGHLY

75
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,976
I'd be doomed if not for this sun serum.

76
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,611
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BAD WITHOUT IT...

77
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,114
-Are you ready?
-[Jimin] I am.

78
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,182
SHALL WE GO FLY NOW?

79
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,718
A LIFE JACKET IS A MUST FOR SAFETY

80
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,387
THEY'RE ON PARASAILING GEAR TOO

81
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,855
It wouldn't be scary, right?

82
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,492
It might be scarier to be on the back.

83
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,394
Want to switch?

84
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,795
HE SHYLY SUGGESTS A SWITCH...

85
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,030
It's up to you.

86
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,265
Want to switch?

87
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,834
I'll give it a try.

88
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,937
I hope I can keep this thing safe.

89
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,140
[woman] Tell them the directors
have to get on the boat first.

90
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,208
TAKING OFF SOON

91
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,211
THE CAMERAMAN IS ON HIS WAY TO GET ABOARD

92
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,512
SUDDENLY STOPPING

93
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,047
WHAT'S GOING ON...?

94
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,115
THE STAFF IN A RUSH

95
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,017
Shouldn't we get aboard first?

96
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,289
THE BOAT LEAVES WITHOUT THE STAFF...

97
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,127
WAIT FOR US...

98
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,194
FLUSTERED AND CONFUSED

99
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,296
-No camera to capture their faces?
-No.

100
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,802
THEY'RE PARASAILING FOR NOTHING

101
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:33,740
BACK TO JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK'S PERSPECTIVE

102
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:38,578
EVEN THE BACK OF JIMIN'S HEAD
LOOKS SO EXCITED

103
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,547
-Jung Kook.
-Yes.

104
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,782
[Jimin] We're in the sky!

105
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,683
[Jung Kook] I know! But it's still slow.

106
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,787
It's so nice.

107
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,389
It's amazing.

108
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,590
ENJOYING TIME IN THE SKY

109
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,860
[Jung Kook] The way I see it,
the boat will slow down at the end.

110
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,996
-[Jimin] We'll go in for sure.
-We'll fall in.

111
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,063
We'll sink.

112
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,534
THEY BEGIN GOING DOWN
AS SOON AS HE SAYS IT

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,803
[Jung Kook] Wait.

114
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,071
-[Jimin] No! No.
-No, sir.

115
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,373
[Jung Kook] My snack.

116
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,109
[both scream]

117
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,177
-[Jung Kook] No!
-No!

118
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:14,314
THEY'RE FORCED TO FALL INTO THE WATER

119
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,849
[Jimin] He did it intentionally.

120
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,551
[Jung Kook] Hey, mister!

121
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,855
THE TIGHT GRIP SHOWS THAT HE'S SURPRISED

122
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:22,989
[Jung Kook] It's salty!

123
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,558
-[Jimin] Gosh, it's salty.
-Gosh.

124
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,827
[Jimin] He's going to do it again.

125
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,261
THEY SENSE A SUSPICIOUS MOVE

126
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
GOING DOWN AGAIN
TO APPRECIATE THEIR CHEER...

127
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,432
[Jung Kook] No, this is not right. Mister.

128
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,334
-Just race, mister.
-No!

129
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,537
CURLING THEIR LEGS NOT TO TOUCH THE WATER

130
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,707
SPLASH

131
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:41,775
SHOUTING

132
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,347
Jung Kook, say hi to our right.

133
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,049
Hello.

134
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,119
PROFESSIONAL IDOLS GREET PEOPLE
IN ANY KIND OF SITUATION

135
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,690
THE LAST GIFT CATCHES THEM OFF GUARD

136
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,458
[Jimin] He's making us fall in again.

137
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,095
SPLASH

138
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:09,202
THE TOUGH PARASAILING IS OVER...

139
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,476
WAIT HERE

140
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,578
-I'll swim there. Bye.
-Okay.

141
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:25,685
JUNG KOOK HEADS TO LAND FIRST

142
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,156
[in English] Thank you.

143
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,027
[in Korean] It's fun.

144
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,095
VERY SATISFIED

145
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,097
[director] You have to do it again.

146
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,164
-Really?
-Yes.

147
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,432
Sounds good.

148
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:46,206
JIMIN SAFELY COMES BACK AS WELL

149
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,507
[in English] Thank you.

150
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,313
Jimin.

151
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,081
It's fun, right?

152
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,352
IT IS FUN

153
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,855
LET'S DO IT AGAIN

154
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,557
INSTALLING A WRIST CAMERA JUST IN CASE

155
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,625
TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT

156
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,728
-We must not drop it.
-[in Korean] Or it'll be lost for good.

157
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,196
FACE CAMERAS ARE READY

158
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,865
JIMIN IS READY AS WELL

159
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,267
JUNG KOOK IS AT THE BACK THIS TIME

160
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,971
THEY'RE OFF FOR THE SECOND TIME!

161
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,979
FLYING!

162
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:30,483
[both yelling in delight]

163
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,121
TO THE BLUE SKY ABOVE THE OPEN SEA

164
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,090
[Jimin] I kind of feel like a bird.

165
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,959
This is so nice.

166
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,226
Like a bird.

167
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
I'm flying.

168
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,630
WE'RE FLYING!

169
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,200
THE CAMERA MOVE EXPRESSES
A SENSE OF FREEDOM

170
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,235
[Jung Kook] It's exciting.

171
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,338
FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINDS,

172
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,606
THEY LOOK AT THE HORIZON

173
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,608
-It's nice.
-[Jimin] It's so nice.

174
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,710
[Jung Kook] Nice.

175
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,845
HAPPY TO THE MAX

176
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,480
I love it.

177
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,618
FLYING ABOVE THE OPEN SEA
WITHOUT ANYTHING IN THE WAY

178
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,721
[Jung Kook] We don't know
when we'll descend.

179
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,823
[Jimin] Right. We're going far this time.

180
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,890
[Jung Kook] I know.

181
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,493
You descend after the boat turns.

182
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,661
We're going down now.

183
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,664
A SAD EXPECTATION
ALWAYS TURNS OUT RIGHT...

184
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,132
It's the time.

185
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,567
Here we go.

186
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,969
Ahh! [laughing]

187
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,270
[Jung Kook] I didn't go in.

188
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,875
DETERMINED NOT TO FALL IN

189
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,943
-I didn't go in.
-No.

190
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,479
THEY WOULDN'T FALL FOR IT TWICE...

191
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,847
-I didn't go in.
-This is it.

192
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,515
-This is it.
-This is it.

193
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,983
THEY GO UP AGAIN

194
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,590
LET'S FLY HIGH AGAIN!

195
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,026
Is it capturing us?

196
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,065
WHILE THEY'RE OFF GUARD,
THEY'RE DESCENDING AGAIN

197
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,566
-[Jimin] Run some more.
-More.

198
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,302
-Are you ready?
-I am.

199
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,738
Bring it on.

200
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,808
WE'LL NEVER FALL INTO THE WATER!

201
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,078
SPLASH

202
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,848
He saw us and did it intentionally.

203
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,385
HE WOULDN'T GO EASY ON THEM TWICE EITHER

204
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,721
WE LOST...

205
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:15,789
This is...

206
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,124
It gets more painful
after descending once.

207
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,593
-But it's fun.
-It's fun.

208
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,828
[Jimin] It's almost over.

209
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:27,000
IT'S A SHORT MOMENT DURING THE LONG TRIP,
BUT THAT MAKES IT MORE MEMORABLE

210
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:33,440
THEY'LL BE BACK TO THEIR DAILY LIFE SOON

211
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,246
THEY GET TO SEE THE WORLD
FROM UP HIGHER BEFORE THE RESTART

212
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,116
FULLY RECHARGED WITH NEW ENERGY,

213
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,351
THEY'VE GAINED THE POWER
TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN

214
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,253
We're descending now.

215
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,355
No, we can avoid going into the water.

216
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,291
They may ask for another take.

217
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,428
[Jimin] We think we'll fall in.
We're going to land now.

218
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,496
ANYONE CAN TELL...

219
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,797
We're landing.

220
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,666
Raise your legs.

221
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,568
Legs.

222
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,169
GET READY

223
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:07,373
FALLING IN AS EXPECTED

224
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,478
THEIR MESSY PARASAILING IS OVER

225
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,346
That was nice.

226
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,414
Did you like it?

227
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,951
DO THEY REMEMBER THE MISSION...?

228
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,018
IT'S TIME TO CHECK

229
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,854
-What about your snack?
-Snack?

230
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,391
ARE THE SNACKS SAFE...?

231
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,994
CHECKING JIMIN'S

232
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,195
It's safe.

233
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,563
-It snapped.
-No.

234
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,731
It didn't.

235
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,033
-Chocolate. What?
-No, at the end.

236
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,970
HE TRIES TO STAY CALM,
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY BROKEN...

237
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,471
Look carefully. It didn't snap.

238
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,740
LET'S GO THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH CHECK

239
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,675
-[Jimin] It didn't snap.
-It snapped here.

240
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,210
[Jimin] You snapped it just now.

241
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,112
IT'S BROKEN FOR SURE

242
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,748
CHECKING JUNG KOOK'S

243
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,116
[director] It's wet.

244
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,891
-Too bad.
-Jung Kook, one hour for you too.

245
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,728
THEY'RE GIVEN AN ADDITIONAL HOUR
OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM

246
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,863
WASHING UP BEFORE GETTING ON THE BUS

247
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,965
REFRESHED

248
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,033
REMINDED OF A STORY

249
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,401
Say this is a shower room.

250
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,171
You just go in to wash up first.

251
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,273
-You leave your bag here.
-A basket here.

252
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,409
So, I was rinsing my hair.

253
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,013
JIMIN'S SURPRISE ATTACK ON JUNG KOOK

254
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,614
I was washing up like this.

255
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,552
WITH TENSION,
HE DOESN'T REACT BUT PLANS A REVENGE

256
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,520
JUNG KOOK FINALLY MAKES A MOVE

257
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:31,925
A MERCILESS FIGHT WITHOUT YIELDING

258
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,695
JUNG KOOK FINALLY GETS HIS REVENGE

259
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,065
[Jimin] Shall we go?

260
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,100
LET'S LEAVE FOR THE NEXT PLAN

261
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,036
ON THEIR WAY TO THE LODGING

262
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,038
-[Jimin] Let's go home and shower.
-Shower.

263
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,873
[man on phone] Hey, Jimin!

264
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,776
Hey, what's that noodle dish
you have with pork belly?

265
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,978
[director] Call a friend

266
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,548
and get them to say "naengmyeon"
within 30 seconds.

267
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,616
A friend?

268
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,817
Jin sounds good.

269
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,752
CALLING JIN

270
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,853
No, Jin?

271
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,988
Not a good time?

272
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,592
Hey, what's that noodle dish
you have with pork belly?

273
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,860
-Naengmyeon?
-Not the spicy one.

274
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,063
-Mul-naengmyeon.
-Correct.

275
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,998
CONGRATULATIONS

276
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,666
We're having dinner now.

277
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,769
We needed you to guess it right
for us to have it.

278
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,939
Oh, no, I didn't mean to say it.
It's not mul-naengmyeon.

279
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,408
My goodness.

280
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,644
It's bibim-naengmyeon. I said it wrong.

281
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,512
We already had dinner.

282
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,214
Oh, really? What a shame.

283
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,515
What are you doing?

284
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,917
Playing a game, of course.

285
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,118
I see.

286
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,953
I'm in Vietnam.

287
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,022
HE WANTS TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION

288
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,090
[Jimin] Beats me.

289
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,125
Are you perhaps filming something too?

290
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,860
No.

291
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,795
You're mistaken.

292
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,131
I'll see you at your concert on the 29th.

293
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,699
Okay. Wait, you guys are coming?

294
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,368
I'll be there on the 28th.

295
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,704
-Me on the 29th.
-Then sing some songs on stage.

296
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,641
But I don't have any ballads...

297
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,946
Anyway, I'll talk to you back in Korea.

298
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,147
Okay.

299
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,515
-[Jimin] Bye.
-Bye, Jin.

300
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,217
Bye. Good luck with the filming.

301
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,385
-[Jimin] Thanks.
-Thanks.

302
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,654
THANKS FOR THE CALL, JIN

303
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,489
Jung Kook, a game for you.

304
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,991
-Omok?
-It's a neologism quiz.

305
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,527
CONFIDENT TO THE MAX

306
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,595
I'm good at it.

307
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,463
-It's a multiple choice question.
-Okay.

308
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,634
"What's an expression
that can replace dukung?"

309
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,702
Dukung?

310
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,770
-Dukung.
-Okay.

311
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,538
"Shimkung."

312
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,907
"Number two, migraine."

313
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,143
"Number three, dum-dum."

314
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,811
"Number four, the visual."

315
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,147
Shimkung or migraine.

316
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,316
-It doesn't say what's correct.
-What?

317
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,684
Wait, no.

318
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,155
"Dukung means a drop in your head
like shimkung, a drop in your heart."

319
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,324
-So, it's migraine.
-You're right.

320
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,959
Then I got both right.
Shimkung and dukung.

321
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,227
I'll give you a question.

322
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,962
A SUDDEN NEOLOGISM QUIZ MATCH

323
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,531
Come on. Let me give you one.

324
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,301
"What does ppatae mean?"

325
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,036
-Ppatae?
-Ppatae.

326
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,204
Well, isn't it

327
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,139
-a word used in Europe?
-No.

328
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,443
It means to change something quickly.

329
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,745
-Quick change in attitude?
-Correct.

330
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,215
-Jimin.
-[woman] You give a question and we guess?

331
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,184
[director] One more hour
of digital detox.

332
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,887
THE STAFF, LIKE HYENAS,
DON'T MISS A CHANCE

333
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,955
Does this count?

334
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,657
NOT A CHANCE

335
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:18,725
No way.

336
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,060
[director] We'll give you one that counts.

337
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,163
NEOLOGISM QUIZ OVER DIGITAL MINIMALISM

338
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,865
Thirty minutes for each question.

339
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:26,933
-[Jimin] Okay.
-Okay.

340
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,301
[director] Let's go.

341
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,369
Betainji.

342
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,338
-Betainji?
-[director] Yes.

343
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,406
What does that mean?

344
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,142
Say your name to make a guess.

345
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,544
Betainji, not metainji?

346
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,612
Betainji.

347
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,348
Me.

348
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,850
An ability to sense hunger.

349
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,386
I told you to say your name.

350
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,453
-Jung Kook.
-Jimin.

351
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,623
-Jung Kook.
-An ability to sense hunger.

352
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,691
Correct.

353
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,226
SNATCHING THE ANSWER AWAY

354
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,027
I'm lost for words.

355
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,996
This is so annoying.

356
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,931
So annoying. Hey!

357
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,334
JIMIN'S GIVEN 30 ADDITIONAL MINUTES

358
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,702
Moving on right away.

359
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:03,770
Here it comes.

360
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,672
Kominse.

361
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,608
-Kominse?
-Kominse?

362
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,878
-[director] Kominse with an "E."
-What?

363
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,513
The last syllable must be "world."

364
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,148
Isn't it world?

365
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,483
Kominse?

366
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,651
Kominse...

367
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,488
Imposing a tax on how much time
you spend on worrying.

368
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,656
It's similar.

369
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,292
Tax on an amount of time to worry?

370
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,360
IT'S SIMILAR?

371
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,661
[director] Very similar.

372
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,729
It is?

373
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,230
I don't follow.

374
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,432
-Pass.
-Pass.

375
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,567
-What is it?
-The price you pay on hesitating.

376
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,236
A SITUATION WHERE YOU HESITATE
AND END UP SPENDING MONEY

377
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,038
-Kominse.
-Kominse.

378
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,440
THEY TOTALLY GET IT

379
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,974
That's what it means.

380
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,976
GIVEN 30 ADDITIONAL MINUTES EACH

381
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,980
Now, this one is very easy.

382
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,048
I see.

383
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,483
[director] Sexy food.

384
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,784
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

385
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,919
Delicious food.

386
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,220
Delicious food.

387
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,488
Correct.

388
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,424
JIMIN IS GIVEN 30 MINUTES AGAIN

389
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,693
Here's another one. Gugujok.

390
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,328
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

391
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,563
Those who buy everything.

392
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,897
Purchase people.

393
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,965
Correct.

394
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,201
Kangjikin.

395
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,268
-Jimin.
-Jung Kook.

396
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,704
-[director] Jimin was faster.
-Workers with pet dogs.

397
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:12,905
[director] Correct.

398
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
Colgeonjok.

399
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,909
-Jimin.
-[director] Jimin?

400
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,513
People who have high-calorie food
with Diet Coke.

401
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,281
-Correct.
-Calbak.

402
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,150
-Jung Kook.
-[director] Jung Kook?

403
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,384
Saved on calendar.

404
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,452
Correct.

405
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,553
CURRENT STATUS

406
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,156
JIMIN: 3.5 HOURS
JUNG KOOK: 2.5 HOURS

407
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,425
[director] Oh, calendar.

408
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,394
-We have two left?
-You have two left.

409
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,130
I WON'T GO DOWN ALONE.
I'LL GO ALL OUT!

410
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,132
He's dying to make a tie somehow.

411
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,835
Just like in the military.

412
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,971
Go.

413
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,205
You only have two left.

414
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,340
-Okay.
-Let's go.

415
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,008
I will get this one.

416
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,077
Be fast on this one. Here it comes.

417
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,779
ONE DETERMINED TO GET IT RIGHT

418
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,982
ONE DETERMINED TO WIN

419
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,650
-Jeommechu.
-Jung Kook!

420
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,452
Recommend what to have for lunch.

421
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,520
[director] Correct.

422
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,888
JEEZ, FOUR HOURS...

423
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,257
-One more question.
-[director] Here it comes.

424
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,391
[Jung Kook] One more.

425
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,026
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, JIMIN

426
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,794
[director] This is so...

427
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:13,566
It describes Jimin's current situation.

428
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,635
Seubuljae.

429
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,538
Seubuljae?

430
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,339
-[director] Seubuljae.
-Seubuljae?

431
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,108
It totally describes his situation.

432
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,910
IT MEANS A SELF-CAUSED DISASTER

433
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,245
It's stressful but awfully fun.

434
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
INCORRECT...

435
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,983
[director] It'll be 4.5 hours
or three hours depending on this.

436
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,285
JIMIN MUST GET THIS RIGHT

437
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,520
Jimin just brought it upon himself.

438
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,923
Hold on.

439
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:43,663
SEUBULJAE... WHAT CAN IT BE?
HE'S GETTING A FEELING?

440
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,731
-I know! Jung Kook.
-[director] Jung Kook?

441
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,867
-I know! Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

442
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:48,935
THIS IS BAD...

443
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,436
Self-caused disaster?

444
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,504
[director] Correct.

445
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,875
[Jung Kook] Self-caused disaster?

446
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,143
[director] Correct.

447
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,011
THIS IS REALLY BAD FOR HIM

448
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,380
A TOTAL OF 4.5 HOURS
OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM...

449
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,117
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE...

450
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,486
Can you take it away now?

451
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,691
Jimin has 4.5 hours to do,

452
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,459
and Jung Kook has 2.5 hours to do.

453
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,294
It's a two-hour difference.

454
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,197
This sure is a seubuljae situation.

455
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,699
THE EXAMPLE OF SEUBULJAE

456
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,133
I was against the idea.

457
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,937
SINGING TO GET OVER IT

458
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:31,010
He suggested this to get me more hours
rather than reducing his time.

459
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,748
-Your intentions...
-♪ Park Jimin of victory ♪

460
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,885
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

461
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,523
[vocalizing]

462
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,660
♪ Park Jimin of victory ♪

463
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,729
"Park Jimin of disaster."

464
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:54,100
I CAN'T BE A DISASTER...

465
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,968
[vocalizing]

466
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,470
SAD

467
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:03,442
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW...

468
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,781
I'M VERY MUCH DEPRESSED...

469
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,082
LOOK OUTSIDE WHEN YOU ARE.

470
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,718
I better use my phone around Jimin
for two hours today.

471
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,120
HE CAN SEE HIS DARK FUTURE...

472
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,224
HE JUST CAN'T HOLD HIS LAUGHTER

473
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,393
It's fun.

474
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:28,434
THEY'RE IN OPPOSITE MOODS

475
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,970
[director] How about one last question
over an hour?

476
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,038
Bring it on!

477
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,041
I'm ready!

478
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,848
THE EFFECT OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM ON JIMIN

479
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,316
Get off me. Don't stop me.

480
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,018
[Jung Kook] One hour?

481
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,521
IF HE GETS IT RIGHT, 1 LESS HOUR
IF NOT, 1 MORE HOUR

482
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,725
RESOLUTE

483
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,528
Bring it on!

484
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,534
Even if you take it now,
I'll get it back at 10:30 p.m.

485
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,369
I might sleep tight tonight.

486
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,506
THE LAST QUESTION OVER AN HOUR

487
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,142
-Wissusigae.
-Jung Kook.

488
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,310
Hold up.

489
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,878
Don't do it!

490
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,781
-Jung Kook.
-[director] Jung Kook?

491
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:19,719
-When your stomach growls out of hunger...
-Okay.

492
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,687
-Time to feel hungry?
-Wrong!

493
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,322
-Jimin.
-Jimin?

494
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,224
JIMIN TRIES RIGHT AWAY

495
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:30,796
Sticking water into your stomach.

496
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,864
NO

497
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,833
Rinsing your stomach with water.

498
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,836
Wrong. It kind of explains
your situation now.

499
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,139
Jimin needs a wissusigae now.

500
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,273
-Jimin!
-Jimin?

501
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,842
-Feeling bitter.
-Wrong.

502
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,144
HE'S WAITING FOR JIMIN TO GET IT RIGHT

503
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,278
Come on.

504
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,647
I'M GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT...

505
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:49,982
BUMPING

506
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,853
IN PAIN...

507
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,789
I'll give you a hint to be fair.

508
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,924
I'll call it off
if none of you get it right.

509
00:20:58,991 --> 00:20:59,992
Here's the hint.

510
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,560
When you're stressed out.

511
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,630
What's the answer?

512
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,065
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

513
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,566
ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT...?

514
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,535
DON'T...

515
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,504
PLEASE DON'T...

516
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,571
A stomach cramp?

517
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,575
-Wrong.
-Jimin.

518
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,877
-Jimin.
-Jimin?

519
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,646
Stuffing your stomach with spicy food
when stressed out.

520
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,548
Having spicy food when stressed out.

521
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,818
It's not exactly stuffing.

522
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,319
Eating spicy food.

523
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,387
Correct.

524
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,490
I'M SAVED

525
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,125
Jimin reduced his time by an hour.

526
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,460
Congrats, Jimin.

527
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,595
Bring it on!

528
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,598
Bring it on!

529
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,934
CLOSE-UP SHOT

530
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,235
Bring it on!

531
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,673
THIS IS HOW SCARY
DIGITAL MINIMALISM CAN BE...

532
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,679
At least you reduced it to 4.5 hours.

533
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,181
-It's 3.5 hours.
-Oh, 3.5 hours.

534
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,582
[director] Jimin's hilarious.

535
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,784
TRANSFERRING TO A CART TO GET TO THE ROOM

536
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,353
IT'S FUNNIER THE MORE HE THINKS ABOUT IT

537
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,522
ONE MORE TIME?

538
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,728
I was discharged two weeks ago.

539
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,065
But they keep taking my phone away.

540
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,203
I only wanted to use my phone at night.

541
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:24,877
CRYING HIS EYES OUT

542
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,080
-Is it 3.5 hours?
-Let's play yutnori for 3.5 hours.

543
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,883
Yutnori for 3.5 hours?

544
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,618
No, I'll do it for 2.5 hours.

545
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,019
Bring it on.

546
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,022
As if I'll let you off.

547
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,524
ALREADY EXCITED FOR TONIGHT...

548
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,992
Bring it on.

549
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,095
WITH LAUGHTER, THEY ARRIVE AT THE LODGING

550
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,163
THEY'RE BACK

551
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,831
Bring it on.

552
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,167
-Let's hurry up.
-It's cool.

553
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:52,037
THEY'RE SHOWERING TO FRESHEN UP

554
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,975
AFTER A WHILE

555
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,514
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK ARE DRESSED UP AND OUT

556
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:06,752
Remember when we first filmed the show?

557
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,054
I wonder how different we look from then.

558
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,056
I doubt we look too different.

559
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,258
I think we do.

560
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,293
THEY LOOK THE SAME!

561
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,794
[man] Are you ready?

562
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,096
LET'S GO

563
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,631
[in English] I'm ready for this.

564
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,005
We're having lobster for our last dinner.

565
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,040
[in Korean] We have another dinner to eat.

566
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,342
What are we having?

567
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,477
Bibimmyeon.

568
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,345
LATE NIGHT SNACKS ARE READY ANYTIME

569
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,181
Aren't you so meticulous?

570
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,583
That one meal was so hearty.

571
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,018
LUNCH WAS ESPECIALLY HEARTY

572
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,720
ARRIVING AT THE BUS PARKING LOT

573
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,088
-Let's go...
-[Jimin singing]

574
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,858
have lobster.

575
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,795
I'm going to have my fill while I'm at it.

576
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,864
But I'm not hungry at all.

577
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,934
SETTING UP THE CAMERA
AS SOON AS HE GETS ON

578
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:59,405
LODGING TO RESTAURANT

579
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,741
THE DAY WENT FAST AS THEY LAUGHED

580
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,477
AND IT FEELS FASTER ON THE WAY

581
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,279
THEY ARRIVE IN AN INSTANT!

582
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,847
[Jung Kook in English] Thank you.

583
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,620
LET'S GO HAVE DINNER

584
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,522
[in Korean] Where is it?

585
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,656
Hello.

586
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,693
THEY CAN ALREADY TELL IT'S GOOD

587
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,895
-[Jimin] Hello.
-[woman] Welcome.

588
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:28,701
FOLLOWING THE APPETIZING SCENT

589
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,704
AND A HEARTY VIETNAMESE MEAL
IS READY FOR THEM...

590
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:33,973
Goodness.

591
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,109
HE KEEPS EXCLAIMING

592
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,177
It's so much.

593
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:40,879
What is this?

594
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,514
JIMIN FOLLOWS IN

595
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,084
What is this?

596
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,820
How are we supposed to finish all this?

597
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,954
It's so much.

598
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,158
A GIANT LOBSTER

599
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,361
AND LOTS OF VIETNAMESE SEAFOOD DISHES

600
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,796
THE MOST LUXURIOUS DINNER EVER

601
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,567
[director] This time, you must...

602
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,069
win a game to take out a dish.

603
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,040
Or you have to...

604
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,808
-Finish all this?
-That's right.

605
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,510
You shouldn't make leftover food.

606
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,847
-Yeah, it's Korean manners not to leave...
-Right.

607
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,648
-...any food.
-Correct.

608
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,885
Jung Kook, don't you want
to have a taste of all this?

609
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,020
I'd like to.

610
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,921
THEY'RE FULL, BUT THEY WANT IT ALL...

611
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,391
TORN WHETHER TO WIN OR LOSE...

612
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,160
[director] As a simple warm-up game,

613
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:32,431
let's play the neologism quiz
from earlier.

614
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,100
FIRST GAME: NEOLOGISM QUIZ
GUESS ONE RIGHT, TAKE ONE OUT

615
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,735
Here comes the question.

616
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:37,836
It looks appetizing.

617
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,671
Let's see what you can take out.

618
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,840
Eoljuko.

619
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,008
Eoljuko?

620
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,610
WHAT'S THAT...?

621
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,311
-One, two, three.
-Jimin.

622
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,913
Cocoa even if it's dead-freezing.

623
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,982
-Wrong.
-Is it coconut?

624
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,051
You cannot take a dish out.

625
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,621
I want to have a taste of everything.
It looks so good.

626
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,156
-[director] Let's go.
-Hold up.

627
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,824
So, what's eoljuko?

628
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,826
Coat even if it's dead-freezing.

629
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,828
-I see.
-Oh.

630
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,996
I know what that means.

631
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,697
That was me when I was younger.

632
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,834
-Aren't coats warm?
-You go back to tracksuits and puffers...

633
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,569
-Compared to puffers?
-...in the end.

634
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,638
LONG PUFFERS ARE THE BEST IN WINTER

635
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,705
Kkuwhewhek.

636
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,174
THE NEXT QUESTION: KKUWHEWHEK

637
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,241
Kkuwhewhek.

638
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,576
Kkuwhe... What?

639
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,144
Kkuwhewhek.

640
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,679
-Kkuwhewhek?
-Kkuwhewhek?

641
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,515
PERFECT HARMONY

642
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,583
Duck?

643
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,651
DID YOU CALL ME?

644
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,718
Duck?

645
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:30,155
This is a neologism in any case, right?

646
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,124
A combined word.

647
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,725
This is a little...

648
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,927
We need a hint.

649
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,031
It's kind of like a neologism.
It's not an abbreviation,

650
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,133
but it's just a new word.

651
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,338
It's a different pronunciation
of the original word.

652
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,639
When you get hit.

653
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,908
LIKE THIS...?

654
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,577
This is too difficult.

655
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,312
Is this egg?

656
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,981
LET'S GUESS FIRST

657
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,049
Kkuwhewhek.

658
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,585
It sounds like quack.

659
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,620
-When you're surprised? No.
-[director] No.

660
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,055
[Jimin] Shrimp looks good too.

661
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,323
[director] Regret it.

662
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,924
-What?
-[director] You regret it?

663
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,194
-You regret it?
-Do I regret it?

664
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:13,432
Ah! This isn't why Hangeul was created.

665
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,666
Is it?

666
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,169
No, I think abbreviations are fun.

667
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,671
But they unnecessarily made a new word

668
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,040
from the word "regret,"
which already existed?

669
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,609
You regret it?

670
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,277
THEIR ANGER DOESN'T GO AWAY

671
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,981
-It's easier to pronounce.
-Next is the picture game after this.

672
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,883
-Here's an easy one.
-Okay.

673
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,951
Dangmochi.

674
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,219
-Oh!
-Ah!

675
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,688
This was mentioned on Run BTS! too.

676
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,690
THIS WORD WAS ON RUN BTS!

677
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,259
I've heard of it.

678
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,095
-But I don't think I guessed this right.
-[director] Hotel.

679
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,530
BUT HE DOESN'T REMEMBER

680
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,597
In the hallway.

681
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,134
Of course, every kind of fried chicken

682
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,003
-is right?
-Correct.

683
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,105
GOOD JOB, BRO

684
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,273
What will you take out?

685
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,574
WHAT AN IRONY

686
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,708
I can't choose any.

687
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:01,880
HOW CAN THEY TAKE ONE OUT FROM THESE...

688
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,349
-We honestly have to eat this.
-This for sure.

689
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,585
We shouldn't take these two out.

690
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:07,753
You're right.

691
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,988
There are two soups.

692
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,056
How about one soup?

693
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,558
Ah!

694
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,861
It's my first time playing games
to exclude stuff.

695
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,496
There are too many dishes.

696
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,364
The way I see it, there are two soups.

697
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,832
-This one?
-It's like porridge.

698
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,068
-Should we take it out?
-We have noodles.

699
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,536
So, let's take one carb out.

700
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,271
-We'll take this out.
-This.

701
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,941
CRABMEAT PORRIDGE IS OUT

702
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,843
Now, there's nothing I'd like to take out.

703
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,746
Why don't we change the rule
to the other way?

704
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,782
-You'll add one?
-Yes.

705
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,750
-Okay.
-That way, we can be more true.

706
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:39,918
-Right.
-Okay.

707
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,454
SECOND GAME: PICTURE GAME

708
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,690
Here. Take this.

709
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,858
FACING EACH OTHER TO GATHER ENERGY FIRST

710
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,995
-So, we draw and make a guess.
-[director] Yes.

711
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,397
Jung Kook is good at drawing,
so let me do it.

712
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,233
JIMIN IS IN CHARGE OF DRAWING!

713
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,301
You're too good at drawing.

714
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,439
You have one minute.

715
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,740
Get ready.

716
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:02,808
Set, go.

717
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,913
FOCUSED

718
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,449
Jimin, is that it?

719
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,516
WAITING

720
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,218
I got it right away.

721
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,989
I already feel sorry.

722
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,056
Why?

723
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,225
-Ugh!
-What's wrong?

724
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,129
[director] You also have to guess it right
in a minute.

725
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,998
[Jung Kook] We have to guess it too.

726
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,666
Tell me you're done.

727
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:28,734
THROWING IT OUT

728
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,868
Let me draw again.

729
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,704
But it's been 30 seconds.

730
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,174
HIS BACK SHOWS ANXIETY
THEY HAVE 30 SECONDS LEFT

731
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,876
You have 10 seconds left.

732
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,011
Guess.

733
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,078
-Pig.
-What...

734
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,813
-[director] One, two...
-Platypus?

735
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,182
What is it?

736
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,052
-Time's up.
-Water pig.

737
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,120
TIME'S UP

738
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,288
What is it?

739
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,455
Hippo.

740
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,159
-Ugh!
-I was in a rush. I only had 20 seconds.

741
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,961
The first one was too...

742
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,929
What is it like?

743
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,669
Give me one more chance.

744
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,304
How can a hippo...

745
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,638
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND JIMIN

746
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,640
I had it in mind, but it was hard to draw.

747
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,409
Shouldn't you draw it like this?

748
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,944
Let me go again.
I want to see him get it right.

749
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,280
Wait. Must we take one out?

750
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,882
Yes, what will you take out?

751
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,217
Don't you like clams?

752
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,352
What are ocean quahogs?

753
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,220
-Is that it?
-Yes.

754
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,288
You want to try it?

755
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,225
-You don't eat clams?
-I can't have shellfish at all.

756
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,727
Let's take shellfish out, then.

757
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,862
-This one.
-This or scallops?

758
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,332
Let's leave this.
Its quality looks higher.

759
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,501
VIETNAMESE OCEAN QUAHOGS ARE OUT

760
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,537
-Here we go.
-What is it?

761
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,805
THE SECOND QUESTION BEGINS

762
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,340
I got a feeling.

763
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,008
DRAWING WITHOUT A HITCH

764
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,576
Tell me at the 30th second.

765
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,744
[director] Okay.

766
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,746
[Jung Kook] Let us know every 10 seconds.

767
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,214
AS IF IT'LL BE A MASTERPIECE

768
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,716
Time's flying.

769
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,086
It's been 20 seconds.

770
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,321
Guess.

771
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,857
JIM-CASSO'S SECOND PIECE IS REVEALED

772
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,492
Opera singer?

773
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,928
-What's your guess?
-Opera singer.

774
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:03,995
Correct.

775
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,599
This is thanks to the pose.

776
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,434
-No.
-No?

777
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:12,671
-Not many perform on stage, you know.
-[laughing]

778
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,872
That's true.

779
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,941
-You have three questions left.
-Okay.

780
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,878
JIM-CASSO IS DRAWING A LOT TODAY

781
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,781
I need to listen carefully.

782
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,149
LISTENING TO SENSE IT

783
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,817
What could it be?

784
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,986
How much time do I have left?

785
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,721
[director] It's been 20 seconds.

786
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,990
It sounds hectic and rushed. What is it?

787
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:37,496
MOVING FAST

788
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,998
This is a hard one.

789
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:45,404
IT'S ALREADY PAST
MORE THAN HALF THE GIVEN TIME

790
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,906
It's taking this long?

791
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,708
-Oh, this isn't it.
-Cheetah?

792
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,877
-Cheetah.
-Correct.

793
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:52,944
My guess is cheetah.

794
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,012
Correct.

795
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,450
JIM-CASSO'S THIRD PIECE: CHEETAH

796
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,684
Didn't I do well?

797
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,819
It looks fast.

798
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:04,122
I know, right?
Isn't this brilliant? 130 km per hour.

799
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,625
-You have two questions left.
-All right.

800
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,126
I'm doing quite well.

801
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,961
My drawings are easy to guess.

802
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,463
JUNG KOOK WILL DRAW THE REST

803
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,664
Me? I'm not good.

804
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,067
STRICTLY PLAYING FAIR

805
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,702
I'M COUNTING ON YOU

806
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,837
[director] Let's begin.

807
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:19,905
Show him the question.

808
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,574
THE FOURTH QUESTION BEGINS
WITH ARTIST JEON

809
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,712
THE PICTURE-LIKE ARTIST
IS DRAWING A PICTURE

810
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,048
AND JIMIN IS LIKE A CARTOON CHARACTER

811
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,249
WIGGLING

812
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,555
Are they our fans?

813
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,523
-Never mind.
-Jimin.

814
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,525
ARTIST JEON'S DRAWING
FINALLY GETS REVEALED

815
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,394
-I'll go.
-What is it?

816
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,528
-Producer Kibeom.
-No.

817
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,863
-Wrong.
-No?

818
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,964
It's just a producer.

819
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,033
Ah! Anyway, it's well-drawn.

820
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,367
I drew Junsoo.

821
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,569
EXCLAIMING

822
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,538
COPY AND PASTE

823
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,074
Seriously, this looks really like him.

824
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,342
Take a few out.

825
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,511
A FEW? THAT'S TOO HARSH

826
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,745
What are you saying?

827
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,347
Let's take the shellfish out.

828
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,116
GRILLED SCALLOPS ARE OUT

829
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,318
Is it the last question?

830
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,452
It's the last question.

831
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,888
ARTIST JEON'S LAST PIECE IS COMING SOON

832
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,292
Let's go.

833
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,762
Ready. Set, go.

834
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,864
Ah!

835
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,434
[Jimin humming tune]

836
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
How should I draw it?

837
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,873
HE'S AT A LOSS...?

838
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,879
DESPITE HIS CONCERN, HE FINISHES QUICKLY

839
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,447
My guess is hedgehog.

840
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,716
-Correct.
-You're good.

841
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,551
How would I have drawn it?

842
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,920
You just have to draw it
roughly and quickly.

843
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,022
Just enough to be able
to notice what it is.

844
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,090
HE TRIES DRAWING IT

845
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,791
All right, guys.

846
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,993
[Jimin laughs]

847
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,262
[director] Enjoy your food now.

848
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,329
Are we done?

849
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,466
THEY'LL BE GIVEN A NEW HOT SEAFOOD RAMYEON

850
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,968
THEY'VE MANAGED TO PROTECT
A TOTAL OF EIGHT DISHES

851
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,904
Jung Kook, let me draw your profile.

852
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,972
JIM-CASSO IS SUDDENLY INTO DRAWING

853
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,708
I'm known for drawing people accurately.

854
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,278
Really? Oh, this must be fried crab.

855
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,879
Can I have it as a whole?

856
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:08,947
Wow.

857
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:12,551
A BIG BITE OF THE FRIED CRAB FIRST

858
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:21,459
HIS EYES OPEN WIDE
TO SHOW HOW DELICIOUS IT IS

859
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:27,699
HAVING ANOTHER BITE SINCE IT'S GOOD

860
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,135
What is this? Crab?

861
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,403
Why is it so soft?

862
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,372
IT'S SOFT-SHELL CRAB

863
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,274
HE'S FINALLY DONE WITH HIS PIECE

864
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,543
JIM-CASSO'S FOURTH PIECE: JUNG KOOK

865
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,579
IT'S UP TO THE VIEWERS TO JUDGE

866
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,646
Let me draw you.

867
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,014
TAKING TURNS

868
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,885
THEN I'LL START EATING

869
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,720
I wanted a bite of this one.

870
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,425
THERE'S SO MUCH MEAT UNDERNEATH THE SHELL

871
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,927
This doesn't need any sauce, right?

872
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,930
PUTTING THE PLUMP MEAT IN HIS MOUTH...

873
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,900
TOUCHED

874
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,905
THE RICH FLAVOR SPREADS IN HIS MOUTH...

875
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:11,309
THIS TIME, HE TRIES THE FRIED CRAB
THAT JUNG KOOK LIKED

876
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,713
Mmm.

877
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,417
NOW, HE GOES FOR THE SEAFOOD RAMYEON
HE WANTED

878
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,521
HIS EYES OPEN WIDE

879
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,156
Mmm!

880
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,827
GLANCING

881
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,695
You're already smirking.

882
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,763
HE FEELS UNEASY...

883
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,198
I wonder how it will be.

884
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,668
HE FOCUSES ON EATING FOR NOW

885
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,403
THE SHRIMP IS SO GOOD TOO...

886
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,338
Everything is good.

887
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,706
WHAT IF HE HADN'T TRIED ANY?

888
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,208
I should try this one too.

889
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,978
ARTIST JEON IS FOCUSING
ON DRAWING HIS PIECE

890
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:50,882
FINISHING IT UP WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN

891
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:51,950
No?

892
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,388
[Jung Kook laughing]

893
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,690
The eyebrows are too long.

894
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,692
I should've drawn them shorter.

895
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,160
HE'S UNHAPPY WITH SOMETHING...

896
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,464
HE'S FINALLY DONE

897
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,768
HOW DID ARTIST JEON DRAW JIMIN...?

898
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,237
It's him touched by the food.

899
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,706
IT IS AND IS NOT SIMILAR...

900
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,741
I look...

901
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,613
so greedy over food this way.

902
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,315
It looks so much like me.

903
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,718
HE'S SATISFIED

904
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm going to put it on my social media.

905
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,358
LET'S FOCUS ON EATING NOW

906
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,326
Mmm!

907
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,896
I can actually eat again.

908
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,765
IT'S PROVEN THAT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR DELICIOUS FOOD

909
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,504
EATING

910
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:51,009
AND EATING AGAIN

911
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,046
I'LL EAT IT ALL!

912
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,481
Mmm.

913
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,183
JIMIN IS INTO THE SEAFOOD RAMYEON

914
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:02,520
It's hard to eat noodles
because of the clams and stuff.

915
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,689
Wow.

916
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,024
The broth is crazy.

917
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,293
THE BROTH IS CRAZY

918
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,062
I wasn't going to have dinner.

919
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,698
LIFE NEVER GOES AS PLANNED

920
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,836
AND THEY HAD DINNER
AS IF IT WAS THEIR FIRST MEAL...

921
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,370
Stuff it in, Jimin.

922
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,505
[Jimin] In where? Home?

923
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,606
[Jung Kook] No.

924
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:22,741
Into your mouth!

925
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,776
BOTH THEIR STOMACHS AND HEARTS ARE FULL...

926
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,344
How about a massage?

927
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,347
[both laughing]

928
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,450
AFTER THE SATISFYING DINNER

929
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,853
We can go to Hoi An,
but there will be many people.

930
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,888
-Too many?
-In Hoi An?

931
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,125
HOI AN IS A MUST-GO IN DA NANG

932
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,093
So that's what I searched.

933
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,161
It did look pretty.

934
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,797
ON THE PLANE TO DA NANG

935
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,832
The night view in Hoi An.

936
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,868
Its night view is like this.

937
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,738
JIMIN WANTED TO SEE
THE NIGHT VIEW IN HOI AN

938
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,540
You want to go, but you're worried.

939
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,608
Right.

940
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,576
Let's go. We have time anyway.

941
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,744
Should we give it a try?

942
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,914
WAIT FOR US TO COME,
THE NIGHT VIEW IN HOI AN!

943
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,749
We got on the bus.

944
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,119
HE PICKED A STRAW HAT IN THE MEANTIME?

945
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:09,254
Wait, the size...

946
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,793
JUST PUT IT ON

947
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,395
[woman] You look like a child explorer.

948
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,563
LIKE A CHILD EXPLORER

949
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,066
AND HE'S FINALLY SATISFIED WITH THE LOOK

950
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,571
We're now off to Hoi An,
which I mentioned to the producer.

951
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,073
It's said to be crowded,
but let's give it a try.

952
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,141
Okay.

953
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,312
-Hoi An!
-Hoi An!

954
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,751
WHILE THEY'RE ASLEEP,
THE BUS LEAVES THE CITY

955
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,987
AND GOES BACK IN TIME

956
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,423
TO ARRIVE AT THE ROMANTIC OLD TOWN
IN HOI AN

957
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,092
TURNING ON CAMERAS AS SOON AS THEY WAKE UP

958
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,427
Hold on. The angle is off.

959
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,864
GETTING THE ANGLE RIGHT

960
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,206
We've arrived...

961
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,876
in Hoi An, but it's so crowded

962
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,780
that we need to disguise ourselves.

963
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,848
Right.

964
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,586
THE DISGUISE ITEM IS A HAT

965
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,688
NOW IN DISGUISE

966
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,756
It might be better with the glasses off.

967
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,125
Let's go.

968
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,193
IN PERFECT DISGUISE

969
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,928
-Are we riding that?
-[director] Yes.

970
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,365
QUICKLY GETTING ON A BUGGY

971
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,566
[Jimin] Let's go.

972
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,504
OFF TO THE OLD TOWN RIGHT AWAY

973
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,506
People are driving wildly.

974
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,975
That's the way it is here.

975
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,245
So we have to ride this to the bridge.

976
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,083
We're going side by side
with those on our right.

977
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,118
UNEXPECTED DRIVING MATES

978
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,487
We've agreed to have a drink
together today.

979
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,089
-Oh, you invited them?
-Yes.

980
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,490
Say hi.

981
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,558
Right.

982
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,094
-[director] Jimin.
-Yes?

983
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,161
How is it?

984
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,763
Why did you want to come here?

985
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,333
The night view at the river
looked so pretty.

986
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,135
-The river?
-Yes.

987
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,437
I thought it'd be nice to go there.

988
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,473
Is this the place? The old town?

989
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,542
-That's right.
-I see.

990
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,512
I just thought it'd be nice
to enjoy it with Jung Kook.

991
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,448
AS BEFITS THE CITY OF LAMPS,

992
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,583
THE ROADS ARE COLORFUL

993
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,418
[Jung Kook] We must be almost there.

994
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:21,953
It's cool.

995
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,721
THEY LOVE THE COOL NIGHT BREEZES TOO

996
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,890
We're outside,
but it's cool to be driving.

997
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,627
[Jimin] Is this the last station?

998
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:33,898
Get off right away.

999
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,634
We've arrived.

1000
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,038
IT CAPTURES JUNG KOOK'S ATTENTION
RIGHT AWAY

1001
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,274
HOI AN

1002
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,610
VIETNAMESE TRADITION AND VIBES STAY

1003
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,612
IN THIS CITY FULL OF TRAVELERS' EXCITEMENT

1004
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:51,149
YOU GET TO BE ABOARD A WISH BOAT
WITH TRADITIONAL LAMPS ON

1005
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,085
AND FLOAT YOUR WISHES ON THE THU BON RIVER

1006
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,922
GETTING ON A BOAT WITH WISH CANDLES

1007
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,763
We're aboard.

1008
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,932
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1009
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,535
This is why I wanted us to come here.

1010
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,803
-Really?
-Yes.

1011
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,272
It's nice.

1012
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,873
We should float the candles.

1013
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,776
THE BOAT BEGINS SAILING WITH EXCITEMENT

1014
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,145
It's a river in Hoi An.

1015
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,213
Isn't it pretty?

1016
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,548
SHARING WITH THE FANS

1017
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,615
Isn't it pretty?

1018
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:31,389
We came for this event
where you make a wish and stuff.

1019
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:32,957
It's nice.

1020
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,726
It's romantic.

1021
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,231
It feels like the best activity
of all that we've done in Vietnam.

1022
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,206
Are they busking?

1023
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,908
It feels like a festival.

1024
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,043
I know.

1025
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,678
It feels like a festival.

1026
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,623
This is universal.

1027
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,259
-[woman] Say ho!
-Ahh!

1028
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,762
-[woman] Say ho!
-[both] Ahh!

1029
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:15,099
-[woman] Ahh!
-[both] Ahh!

1030
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,037
[Jimin] How nice. I guess
it's supposed to go slowly.

1031
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,105
-[Jung Kook] It's nice.
-I know.

1032
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:24,409
[Jung Kook] It feels like I've become
a hero of this world.

1033
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:26,911
I'm loving it.

1034
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:28,846
-You are?
-Yes.

1035
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,014
That's good to hear.

1036
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,315
Jimin.

1037
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,717
Jung Kook.

1038
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:35,353
There's one thing I didn't get to say.

1039
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,721
HE'S TAKING THIS CHANCE...

1040
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:37,789
What is it?

1041
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,457
You see...

1042
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,461
I can't wait to drink.

1043
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,464
Jung Kook.

1044
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:47,732
What is it, Jimin?

1045
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:51,469
I'd like to say one thing too.

1046
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:52,637
What is it?

1047
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,205
Yesterday...

1048
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,975
I couldn't sleep because you were snoring.

1049
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,044
I'm sorry.

1050
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,048
No, brace yourself.

1051
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,116
Brace myself?

1052
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,087
-I said sorry.
-Okay.

1053
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,155
-I'm sorry.
-You know what?

1054
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:12,323
What?

1055
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,093
The camera is at the perfect angle
to capture both of us...

1056
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,228
-Right.
-...but the man in the middle

1057
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:18,896
really pulls attention.

1058
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,800
CENTER

1059
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,470
It's nice.

1060
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,872
You see that man on the left?

1061
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,308
He resembles RM with my eyes half closed.

1062
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,244
Jung Kook.

1063
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,779
What is it, Jimin?

1064
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:36,147
Let me confess something.

1065
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,215
What is it?

1066
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,350
My glasses are lens-less.

1067
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,020
That's why things look prettier.

1068
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,222
Because of the glare?

1069
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,657
-There's too much glare.
-It must feel like this.

1070
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,959
[Jimin] A little like this.

1071
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,994
[Jung Kook] Like this.

1072
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,796
-It's pretty.
-It looks so pretty.

1073
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,598
SELF-BEAUTIFYING FILTER ON

1074
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,533
-It's no joke.
-How pretty.

1075
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:01,639
THEY SAIL ALONG THE WATERWAY
AND ARRIVE NEAR THE BRIDGE

1076
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,407
[Jung Kook] Is this the bridge?

1077
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,076
Let me take a photo of you.

1078
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,144
MUST TAKE PHOTOS

1079
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,646
Can you move towards the end?

1080
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:09,847
-Here?
-Yes.

1081
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,683
That's better.

1082
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,886
FULL OF A FILM CAMERA VIBE

1083
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,054
-[Jung Kook] Want me to take a picture?
-Sure.

1084
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,290
One, two, three.

1085
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:22,793
NOT AS COOL AS EXPECTED,
BUT STILL SENTIMENTAL

1086
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,562
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1087
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,796
Let's make a wish now.

1088
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,031
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

1089
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:29,300
TAKING THE LIGHTER FROM THE BOATMAN

1090
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,501
[in English] Thank you.

1091
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:31,569
[in English] Okay.

1092
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,172
[in Korean] We're going
to make a wish now.

1093
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,073
Let me hold the camera for you.

1094
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,744
JIMIN GETS THE CANDLES READY,
AND JUNG KOOK TAKES THE CAMERA

1095
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:46,017
PLAYING WITH THE CAMERAS ALONE

1096
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,686
Jung Kook, let's throw them to this side.

1097
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:49,754
Okay.

1098
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:56,093
LIGHTING JUNG KOOK'S WISH CANDLE FIRST

1099
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,929
-It's yours.
-Okay.

1100
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,399
FILMING AN INSERT SHOT HIMSELF

1101
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,268
Hold one camera.

1102
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,503
I've turned it around.

1103
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,271
No, it's that one.

1104
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:08,506
-This?
-Yes.

1105
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,842
THE CANDLES ARE ABOUT TO GO
A LONG WAY WITH THEIR WISHES

1106
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,611
Bangtan.

1107
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:14,845
All the best for BTS.

1108
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,514
It wouldn't come out.

1109
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:17,715
All the best for BTS.

1110
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,183
All the best for BTS!

1111
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,285
ALL THE BEST FOR BTS

1112
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:24,855
[Jung Kook] It's floating away.

1113
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:28,726
THE CANDLES ARE OFF TO A LONG JOURNEY
WITH THEIR SINCERE WISHES

1114
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:32,964
DIRECTOR JEON'S HEARTY INSERT SHOT

1115
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,599
[Jung Kook] It's floating away.

1116
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,869
THE TWO OF THEM
STARE AT THE CANDLES SILENTLY

1117
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,072
Now, BTS will make it big.

1118
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,775
That was nice, Jimin.

1119
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,010
It's good to hear.

1120
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,746
I'm happy if you're happy.

1121
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,915
You're hardly around many people.

1122
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,016
-Right.
-I know.

1123
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,319
-[Jimin] I had a good time.
-I know. I loved it.

1124
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:58,289
AWAY FROM ATTENTION,
THEY COULD DO WHAT THEY WANTED

1125
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,357
[Jung Kook] Nice.

1126
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,527
Let's go get a massage.

1127
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,264
-And play a round of yutnori.
-Let's do that.

1128
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,799
Then I'll won't have my phone
for three hours.

1129
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,736
It makes me tear up.

1130
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,238
We play it
every time they take our phones away.

1131
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:15,906
-Right.
-It's nice.

1132
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,109
JUST LIKE THE CALMLY FLOWING RIVER,

1133
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,810
THE LAST NIGHT IN VIETNAM PASSES

1134
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,746
[Jimin] Is that where we were?

1135
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,781
Us? No, it's that side.

1136
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:26,183
-Oh, there. We're almost there.
-Yes.

1137
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,251
It was amazing.

1138
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,553
Let's go get a massage.

1139
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,791
Let's go.

1140
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,860
AFTER ENJOYING
THEIR SHORT FREEDOM IN HOI AN,

1141
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:40,031
THEY TAKE OFF TO RELIEVE TODAY'S FATIGUE

1142
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:41,732
One, two, three.

1143
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,335
THEY REFRESHEN THEMSELVES
AND TURN THE CAMERAS BACK ON

1144
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,803
Hoi An.

1145
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:46,937
-We're back.
-Hoi.

1146
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,205
Hoi An.

1147
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:49,273
Hoi.

1148
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,478
-Hoi. Hoi. Hoi.
-Hoi. Hoi. Hoi.

1149
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,381
THEIR UNNECESSARY BATTLE BEGINS AGAIN

1150
00:46:57,448 --> 00:46:58,449
An.

1151
00:46:58,516 --> 00:46:59,517
LET'S STOP HERE

1152
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,885
We're back. How was it?

1153
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:03,354
We even made a wish.

1154
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,422
We did!

1155
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,592
GLANCING

1156
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,660
BTS.

1157
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:12,430
I'm disciplining him.

1158
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,933
He can't control his power,
so he's getting a muscle training.

1159
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:17,635
How do you do it?

1160
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:19,337
-There you go.
-Let's do it, BTS.

1161
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,005
-BTS will make it big...
-Right.

1162
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,341
...because we made wishes.
We made two wishes.

1163
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,010
THAT'S TWICE THE WISH!

1164
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,645
It was nice in Hoi An, and now...

1165
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:29,780
At last.

1166
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,882
Massage.

1167
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,050
Massage.

1168
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:35,653
ANYWAY, THEY'RE OFF TO GET A MASSAGE

1169
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,821
Jung Kook.

1170
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:40,358
Let's see how much you know
about neologisms.

1171
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,226
Me too.

1172
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,196
If you get this one wrong,
you'll take 30 minutes from my time.

1173
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,430
What are you saying?

1174
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,165
Think of something else.

1175
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,667
I'm not sharing your time.

1176
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:53,003
HIS PLAN DIDN'T WORK...

1177
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,106
Here's one question. The neologism quiz.

1178
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,642
"What's the neologism that means,

1179
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,079
"'Wow, this place is so pretty,
and I love the vibe'?"

1180
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:06,250
There are choices. Number one, "wownae."

1181
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,953
Number two, "leesaengmang."

1182
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,123
Number three, "numulbo."

1183
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,859
Number two, "janahgwe."

1184
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,060
What's your answer?

1185
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,262
Whoa. Wow.

1186
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,764
Wownae?

1187
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,931
The correct answer is...

1188
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,268
wownae.

1189
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,306
-That's all?
-Yes.

1190
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,908
THAT'S THE END?

1191
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,010
[director] Wanna try
a few simple questions?

1192
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,079
We might end up getting more hours.

1193
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,448
No. How about deduction this time?

1194
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:38,549
REACTING AUTOMATICALLY

1195
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,718
-If I get it right?
-The one who gets it right.

1196
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:43,187
-Oh, this is...
-Minus 30 minutes each.

1197
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,523
HIS EYES CHANGE DRAMATICALLY

1198
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,158
SUDDEN GAME: NEOLOGISM QUIZ

1199
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,059
MINUS 30 MINUTES FOR EACH CORRECT ANSWER

1200
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,828
CURRENT STATUS

1201
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,763
3.5 HOURS - 2.5 HOURS

1202
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,064
Here we go.

1203
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,168
DETERMINED TO GET IT RIGHT!

1204
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,770
Yodeulgab.

1205
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,239
-Yodeulgab?
-Yodeulgab.

1206
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,141
These days...

1207
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,209
These days?

1208
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,278
It's frustrating.

1209
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,646
The price has become lower.

1210
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:12,450
Incorrect. It refers to
a certain behavior.

1211
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,785
NEEDLESSLY IMPOSING MUSIC IS ON

1212
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,387
SMIRKING

1213
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,488
These days...

1214
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,790
How did you find such music?

1215
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,260
OVERLY IMMERSED

1216
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,930
-We can't use this.
-It can't be used.

1217
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,732
DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES...

1218
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,434
Play such imposing music for him.

1219
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:33,704
REPLACING IT WITH OTHER IMPOSING MUSIC

1220
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:36,774
You're making such a yodeulgab.

1221
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,742
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

1222
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,278
Distracting and fussy these days.

1223
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,047
Distracting and fussy.

1224
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,482
Distractingly fussy.

1225
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,883
No.

1226
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,251
Me.

1227
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,819
Jimin.

1228
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:51,522
Distractingly hyper and noisy.

1229
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,123
-Correct.
-[Jung Kook] Really?

1230
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:56,327
SEARCHING OTHER MUSIC

1231
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,661
Don't play it again.

1232
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,230
Touching background music.

1233
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:04,168
HUMMING HIMSELF

1234
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,003
Jimin, you now have four hours.

1235
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,872
No, it's three hours now.

1236
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,773
He keeps adding one hour.

1237
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,308
Jimin, you have three hours.

1238
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,910
Three hours.

1239
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,311
Just a 30-minute difference.

1240
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,479
Here we go.

1241
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,415
Annammi.

1242
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,217
-Annammi?
-Yes.

1243
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:21,519
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

1244
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,454
-If not dressed up...
-Yes?

1245
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,023
...you'll be sorry to others?

1246
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,091
Incorrect!

1247
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,094
Is the first part even right?

1248
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,730
-Annammi?
-It's about the two of you.

1249
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,232
THE TWO OF US?

1250
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,134
The fans see it as your case.

1251
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,804
THEY SEE IT AS OUR CASE...?

1252
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,573
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

1253
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,142
It's embarrassing already. This is crazy.

1254
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,013
Incorrect.

1255
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,315
Can you give us a hint
for the first syllable?

1256
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,518
I can't tell you the first syllable,
but the last syllable.

1257
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,320
-Annammi?
-Mi.

1258
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,455
It's "I'm sorry," right?

1259
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,591
It means beautiful.

1260
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,393
Ah!

1261
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,194
-Jung Kook!
-Yes?

1262
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:08,732
Beauty of a man with glasses on?

1263
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,067
Incorrect.

1264
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:11,135
-Jimin.
-Jimin?

1265
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,170
Prettier than others
even if not dressed up.

1266
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,639
-Correct.
-Really?

1267
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:19,176
Beauty that drives others crazy
even if not dressed up.

1268
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,444
That's not us.

1269
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,846
-Not me.
-[director] The fans think so.

1270
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,716
Music that expresses wings
on my shoulders.

1271
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:26,784
I'VE MADE IT AGAIN!

1272
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,485
What's that supposed to mean?

1273
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,455
[exclaiming]

1274
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,425
Now, I have 2.5 hours just like Jung Kook.

1275
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,060
Yes. You have two questions left.

1276
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,995
It's an abbreviated word this time.

1277
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:39,063
Hanso.

1278
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,732
-What?
-Hanso.

1279
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,300
You're good at abbreviations.

1280
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,468
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

1281
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:45,536
Hangang blind date?

1282
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:48,872
Wrong.

1283
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:50,808
-Jung Kook.
-Jung Kook?

1284
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,042
Precious Korea.

1285
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,310
Wrong.

1286
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,445
-Jimin.
-Jimin?

1287
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,781
Han, there's this joke in Korea.

1288
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,751
So, who's going to raise cows?

1289
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:01,819
HE LOVES IT

1290
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,322
Wrong. Neither of you got this one right.

1291
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,423
-What is it?
-Hanso?

1292
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,092
One sentence introduction.

1293
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,259
I see.

1294
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,894
One sentence introduction.

1295
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,530
Here's the last question.

1296
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,666
I'm going to deduct 30 minutes for sure.

1297
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,034
Bidam.

1298
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,102
What?

1299
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,170
-Bidam.
-Dam.

1300
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,841
BIDAM...

1301
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,309
-Jimin.
-Jimin?

1302
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,511
Getting a cramp on a rainy day.

1303
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,913
-You did?
-Yes.

1304
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,548
Give us a hint.

1305
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,952
It's a role in a group.

1306
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,720
Jung Kook. The visual.

1307
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,788
Correct.

1308
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,723
JUNG KOOK GETS MINUS 30 MINUTES

1309
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,759
Bidam. That's how it's called?

1310
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:44,928
DIGITAL MINIMALISM TIME

1311
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,597
2.5 HOURS - 2 HOURS

1312
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,333
All right. Let's hit a slate.

1313
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,001
One, two, three.

1314
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,704
[both singing]

1315
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,877
I can't believe we think the same.

1316
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:08,085
ARRIVING AT THE MASSAGE STUDIO
IN THE MEANTIME

1317
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:09,753
Let's go.

1318
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,021
-I think it's here.
-Right.

1319
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,089
OFF TO GET CHANGED

1320
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:13,157
Let's go in.

1321
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:19,697
Oh, it's here too.

1322
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:21,598
[Jung Kook] I like the clothes.

1323
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,734
It feels so nice and silky.

1324
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,303
GETTING CHANGED

1325
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,775
A SENSATIONAL APPEARANCE

1326
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:39,650
THEY START WITH THE FOOT BATH

1327
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,652
[man] Please put your feet
inside and wait.

1328
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,187
Jimin.

1329
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,888
The water is hotter than yesterday.

1330
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,123
[Jimin] I like hot water.

1331
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,093
JIMIN BEGINS THE FOOT BATH TOO

1332
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,029
WARM AND HOT

1333
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,432
I heard that
something was on the action camera.

1334
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,334
It was my saliva.

1335
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,470
I dozed off for the first three minutes.

1336
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,240
But my saliva...

1337
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,509
HE MUST'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY
FOR THE THREE MINUTES

1338
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,444
It made a smile mark.

1339
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:10,047
LOL

1340
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:11,648
[Jung Kook] Thank you.

1341
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,851
IT'S THE SAME ANGLE AGAIN TODAY

1342
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,321
IT'S JUNG KOOK

1343
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:18,388
It feels better.

1344
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,357
There's a camera here again.

1345
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,660
It's exactly below my mouth again.

1346
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,630
What is this?

1347
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:27,798
FOOT WARMING FIRST

1348
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:29,299
It's a hot foot compress.

1349
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,367
A hot compress.

1350
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,171
I'll never fall asleep today.

1351
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:35,873
-Jung Kook.
-What?

1352
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,341
Talk to me when you're sleepy.

1353
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,343
PROMISING TO WAKE EACH OTHER UP

1354
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:45,516
BUT AFTER FIVE MINUTES...

1355
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:51,188
EVEN BEFORE THE MASSAGE BEGINS

1356
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:56,560
BOTH ARE DEEPLY ASLEEP

1357
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:04,168
THEIR LAST NIGHT PASSES LIKE A DREAM
WHILE THEY'RE RELEASING THEIR FATIGUE

1358
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:09,473
THE MASSAGE IS OVER IN A SPLIT SECOND

1359
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,310
I twitched and snored like crazy.

1360
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:15,112
-You did?
-Yes.

1361
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,148
I didn't think I'd get sleepy, but...

1362
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,452
YOU KNOW, RIGHT?

1363
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,655
I DO!

1364
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:25,756
It was nice.

1365
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,825
It was much better than yesterday.

1366
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:28,892
HIGHLY SATISFIED

1367
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,396
I'd even come again if I could.

1368
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,697
It was nice.

1369
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,533
It was so nice.

1370
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,536
THEY'RE OUT AFTER THE MASSAGE...

1371
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,805
[crew cheering]

1372
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:46,410
THE STAFF GIVE THEM A HAND ALL TOGETHER

1373
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,477
Did you get it?

1374
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,514
-Did you really get it?
-[man] Yes.

1375
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,582
WHAT HAPPENED WAS...

1376
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,117
It was like paradise.

1377
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,452
[Jimin] Especially my feet.

1378
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,287
I guess we did walk a lot.

1379
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,355
Is there any place

1380
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,257
-we can get it together?
-It's well-made.

1381
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:02,626
[Jimin] Why don't we get
a group massage tomorrow?

1382
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,694
I'm all for it.

1383
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,130
-What is the bet about?
-Why don't we get a massage...

1384
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,600
-Again?
-...all together tomorrow?

1385
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,168
-A group massage?
-Yes.

1386
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:13,136
AND THE BET WAS MADE

1387
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,339
A GROUP MASSAGE
IF JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK WIN

1388
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:18,208
A MASSAGE ONLY FOR TWO
IF THE STAFF WINS

1389
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:20,611
[Jung Kook] Let's go, Jimin.
Everything except geol.

1390
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,112
I hardly get geol.

1391
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,248
THE YUT GOD HAS COME

1392
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,315
-Yut.
-It's yut.

1393
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,284
Yut!

1394
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,486
-Yut!
-Yut!

1395
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,622
YUT THREE TIMES IN A ROW!

1396
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:35,592
-Do, gae, geol, yut.
-Do, gae, geol, yut.

1397
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:36,660
It's over.

1398
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,428
THE GAME ENDS WITH THEIR VICTORY

1399
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,731
-[Jung Kook] Congratulations.
-Congrats.

1400
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,667
Let's get a massage all together tomorrow.

1401
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,269
-Good work.
-Good work.

1402
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,604
Let's drink some beer and go to bed.

1403
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,039
GRANTING A MASSAGE TO ALL

1404
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:52,476
We're getting a massage
with the staff who worked hard.

1405
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,244
-Right.
-So, let's get down...

1406
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,646
-To it.
-Hoi.

1407
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,714
So the whole production crew is doing it?

1408
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,216
CHECKING EVEN AT THE STUDIO

1409
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,350
In separate rooms.

1410
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,518
[in English] Yes.

1411
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,755
THEY ENJOYED IT
THANKS TO JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK

1412
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,424
YOU ARE THE BEST.
FROM THE STAFF

1413
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:08,926
Goodness.

1414
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,528
[in Korean] The two of us
snored like crazy.

1415
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,831
We ended up falling asleep.

1416
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,366
It was irresistible.

1417
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,001
SLURPING MANGO JELLY

1418
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,038
Let's go play yutnori now.

1419
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,175
OFF FOR THE FINAL SCHEDULE OF THE DAY

1420
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,344
PRETENDING TO FOLLOW

1421
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:28,979
REACHING FOR JELLY

1422
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:33,417
THIEF JUNG KOOK IS STEALING MANGO JELLY

1423
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,988
TAKING A WHOLE BUNCH

1424
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,456
HESITATING

1425
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:43,760
TAKING ONE MORE FOR THE LAST TIME

1426
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,329
FINALLY SATISFIED

1427
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:51,234
HE LEISURELY LEAVES THE PLACE...

1428
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,203
-[Jung Kook] Nice.
-Nice.

1429
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,838
THE LAST NIGHT IN DA NANG SPARKLES

1430
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,308
[Jimin] It was heavenly.

1431
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,711
THE STREET LIGHTS BRIGHTEN OUR WAY

1432
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,780
AND WE FEEL BAD AS THE NIGHT DARKENS

1433
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,848
Freshen up.

1434
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,450
And hurry over to play yutnori.

1435
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:09,753
A FAMILIAR TIMER IS PLACED
INSTEAD OF YUTNORI

1436
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,588
Are we starting digital minimalism?

1437
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,057
No.

1438
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,159
I'll use it to the last second.

1439
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,661
TO USE IT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN

1440
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:20,097
BUT THE PREPARATION IS DONE QUICKLY

1441
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,298
Clap once for us.

1442
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:23,033
One, two, three.

1443
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,735
THE FILMING BEGINS

1444
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,069
[director] All right.

1445
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:28,305
It's time for digital minimalism.

1446
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:31,041
-Jung Kook, you have...
-I have 1.5 hours.

1447
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:32,175
No, two hours.

1448
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,577
JUNG KOOK: TWO HOURS

1449
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,112
Jimin, you have 2.5 hours.

1450
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,346
JIMIN: 2.5 HOURS

1451
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:37,481
Gosh, 30 minutes.

1452
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,117
Give me your phones.

1453
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,785
IT'S TIME TO COLLECT THEIR PHONES

1454
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,853
See you.

1455
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,455
JUNG KOOK HANDS HIS PHONE OVER

1456
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,825
JIMIN HANDS HIS PHONE OVER TOO

1457
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,661
THEIR PHONES ARE CONFINED

1458
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,130
A timer for 2.5 hours

1459
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,932
and a timer for two hours
have both started.

1460
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay.

1461
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,002
And you have a wakeup mission.

1462
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,137
-A wakeup mission?
-Yes.

1463
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,873
The point of this is
that you have to do it individually.

1464
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:03,940
I see.

1465
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,877
The loser will have...

1466
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,713
breakfast tomorrow morning.

1467
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,181
PENALTY: HAVE BREAKFAST

1468
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:13,683
Let me tell you what the rule is.

1469
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,951
You'll be given an item.

1470
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,086
[Jung Kook] I see.

1471
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:18,889
I'd like the top one,
but I'll go for the bottom one.

1472
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,926
He won't know if I stick it on a pot.

1473
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,228
BUT THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL MAY DIFFER

1474
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,764
WHERE CAN I HIDE THIS?

1475
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,067
[director] You'll have five minutes
to hide it.

1476
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,234
Out of all three floors?

1477
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,736
KNOCKING FIRST

1478
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,604
Just smash it like this?

1479
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,273
Just eat it.

1480
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,474
This may be the item.

1481
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:38,608
EATING ALL THAT HE SEES

1482
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,545
THEY GET TO TEST THEIR TRUE FRIENDSHIP

1483
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,580
-[Jung Kook] Where is it?
-[Jimin] Smash it!

1484
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,650
WHO WILL GET TO CLEAR
THIS VERY EMOTIONAL MISSION?

1485
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,784
Hmm.

1486
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,953
-I'm horrible at this.
-Me too.

1487
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,021
UNSURE

1488
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,355
Anyway, okay.

1489
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,224
Okay, let's begin right away.

1490
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,860
[director] Who will draw an item first?

1491
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,495
Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

1492
00:59:58,562 --> 01:00:00,097
Okay. To decide the order?

1493
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,132
-How about ga-je-cham?
-Sounds good.

1494
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:05,469
The loser will take a flick
and draw an item first.

1495
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,337
Oh, draw an item first? Okay.

1496
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,206
THEY START PLAYING THE GAME

1497
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,474
Zero, zero, one.

1498
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,541
Cham-cham-cham.

1499
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:13,743
Rock, paper, scissors.

1500
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,612
LOSING AT ONCE

1501
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:16,680
Zero, zero, one.

1502
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,148
LOSING AT ONCE

1503
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,216
Cham-cham-cham.

1504
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,251
LOSING AT ONCE AGAIN

1505
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,319
Cham-cham-cham.

1506
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,888
A CLEAN WIN

1507
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:27,023
Take a flick.

1508
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,258
HERE COMES A FLICK

1509
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:31,094
IN PAIN...

1510
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,464
-Please go upstairs.
-Okay.

1511
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:35,999
Jimin, to your room.

1512
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,634
-To my room?
-Yes.

1513
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,236
-Do I draw an item first?
-Yes.

1514
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,537
JIMIN WILL WAIT IN THE ROOM

1515
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,038
Goodness.

1516
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,406
[Jimin singing indistinctly]

1517
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,575
It's better to choose first.

1518
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,411
THINKING POSITIVELY

1519
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,946
That's right.

1520
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,014
What could it be?

1521
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,416
Whatever it may be, I'm ready.

1522
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,653
ENTERING WITH POSITIVE ENERGY

1523
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,754
There are six choices.

1524
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,257
SIX RANDOM CHOICES ARE WAITING

1525
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,458
PRAYING

1526
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,493
I thought there'd be two choices.

1527
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,596
This makes it harder.

1528
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,766
DEEP IN THOUGHT

1529
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:13,136
Psychologically,
you tend to choose the second one.

1530
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:16,339
But the second one is
highly likely to be something big.

1531
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,674
I'll give it a twist.

1532
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:20,911
And tend to choose what's on the left,
so I must go for the right one.

1533
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,347
And I'd like the top one,
but I'll go for the bottom one. This.

1534
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,316
HE CHOOSES NUMBER SIX AFTER THE PSYWAR

1535
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,819
UNSURE

1536
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,354
I wonder if my choice...

1537
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,490
HESITATING

1538
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:36,593
SHOULD I OPEN IT OR NOT?

1539
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,827
I'll go with this.

1540
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:38,895
Okay.

1541
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,131
[grunts]

1542
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,733
[laughing]

1543
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,269
I'm totally clueless.

1544
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:47,704
I have no idea.

1545
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:49,873
I'm not sure if I can pull it off either.

1546
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,274
I'll just do it.

1547
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,643
What if it's a chip again?

1548
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,046
I better close things in advance...

1549
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,883
so he can't hide it anywhere like here.

1550
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,152
CLOSING HIS LUGGAGE

1551
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,522
CLOSING JUNG KOOK'S LUGGAGE TOO

1552
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:09,259
HE'S CLOSED ALL THE SUITCASES

1553
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,429
Here if it's something small.

1554
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,231
CHECKING WHERE TO HIDE HIS ITEM

1555
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,733
Here if it's really small.

1556
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,401
In a cream container.

1557
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,005
Or I could just place it here randomly.

1558
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,473
He'll never notice it.

1559
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,276
You can't see right under your nose.

1560
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:29,412
If it's thin,
here at the back of a camera.

1561
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,249
I could hide it here.

1562
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:35,819
I know where to hide it,
but I'm not good at finding.

1563
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,755
We might play this game all night.

1564
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:41,625
To wake up an hour late,
we might sleep two hours late.

1565
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,360
-I'll go with this.
-Okay.

1566
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,527
BACK TO JUNG KOOK'S ITEM

1567
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,470
How do I protect these?

1568
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,537
SALMON ROE...?

1569
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,605
Oh, just the roe?

1570
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:56,706
SALMON ROE APPEARS

1571
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,842
-These in here?
-I'll put them in here.

1572
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,011
-Do I keep these safe?
-Don't let them pop.

1573
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,145
Are they real?

1574
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,213
Yes.

1575
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,183
They're small at least.

1576
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,554
THAT'S THE ONLY PRO

1577
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,490
I should put them somewhere else.

1578
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,127
The salmon roes are so... Wait.
They may pop if you seal it.

1579
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,262
SAFELY PACKED AND DELIVERED

1580
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:21,064
-They didn't pop?
-No.

1581
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,399
CHECKING METICULOUSLY

1582
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,335
First off, on my way out...

1583
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,771
You have five minutes
from the moment you go out.

1584
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,340
Five minutes, start.

1585
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:37,147
CAREFUL

1586
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,416
JIMIN IS IN THIS ROOM

1587
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:44,854
CAREFULLY GOING DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR

1588
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,392
HE MUST FIND THE BEST PLACE
TO HIDE THE ROE

1589
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,028
IT'S SALMON ROE...

1590
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:57,400
REMAINING TIME

1591
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:02,072
HE PICKS A CHIP BAG WITHOUT HESITATION

1592
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:05,809
RUSTLING

1593
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,812
LET'S BEGIN THE OPERATION NOW

1594
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:11,481
TAKING OUT THE TARGET

1595
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,484
CAREFULLY IMPLANTING THE ROE

1596
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:17,320
TRYING TO REPACK

1597
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,623
IT SEEMS LIKE A DIFFICULT OPERATION

1598
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,691
Please.

1599
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:24,427
DOING HIS BEST TO FINISH UP

1600
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,598
THE OPERATION IS SAFELY OVER

1601
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:32,902
ASSESSING THE LOCATION THOROUGHLY

1602
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,605
I should fake this as my item.

1603
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,810
THIS TIME HE PLANS TO HIDE A FAKE ITEM

1604
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,646
HIDING IT UNDER THE CLOTHES

1605
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,949
JUNG KOOK IS DONE HIDING THE SALMON ROE

1606
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,951
THIS IS A FAKE ITEM

1607
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:50,854
BACK IN THE ROOM

1608
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,355
-Did you hide it?
-Yes.

1609
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:53,656
Oh, it's not this room?

1610
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,458
It's the third floor and downstairs?

1611
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:56,559
NATURALLY TAKING TURNS

1612
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,595
We can't come in here to hide it.

1613
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,797
Hold on. Let me check your body.

1614
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:02,332
No, just get out.

1615
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,033
NOT A CHANCE

1616
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,303
JIMIN IS HERE

1617
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,805
SPOTTING THE RANDOM CHOICES

1618
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:10,106
How cute.

1619
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:13,543
One, two, three, four.

1620
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,978
I choose this one.

1621
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:17,213
-You sure?
-Yes.

1622
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,415
You won't regret it?

1623
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,316
REGRET?

1624
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:25,789
WOULD HE FALL FOR IT
AND CHANGE HIS CHOICE?

1625
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:27,991
I'll go with this.

1626
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,092
NO CHANGE

1627
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,128
NO WAY

1628
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,196
This is so easy.

1629
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,998
Blueberries.

1630
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,833
It can't be a bag of blueberries.

1631
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,536
GETTING THE ITEM READY

1632
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,870
HE CAN'T HIDE HIS JOY

1633
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,607
But the thing is, hiding it might be easy,

1634
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,876
-but is everything fruit?
-What?

1635
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,178
-You won't tell me?
-No.

1636
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,047
Must I smash everything out there?

1637
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,383
I won't take the item like this.

1638
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,485
There's some air inside.

1639
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,821
THAT'S A NO

1640
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,291
LIKE A HUMAN VACUUM CLEANER

1641
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,059
I'll take the air out

1642
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,695
and carry it vacuum-sealed.

1643
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:06,830
Do I hide it now?

1644
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,565
-Can I hide it in here?
-Yes.

1645
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,533
In that case, I'll start counting.

1646
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,168
If you start counting, I'll go.

1647
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,736
Okay. Ready.

1648
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,205
Begin.

1649
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,706
JIMIN BEGINS HIDING IT TOO

1650
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,876
Jung Kook might not notice it
even if I make it obvious.

1651
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:23,346
I wonder what his item is.

1652
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:25,482
HIDING IT WHILE GUESSING WHAT HIS ITEM IS

1653
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,083
Can I hide it here?

1654
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,151
Yes.

1655
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,321
A SATISFIED LAUGH

1656
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:32,555
Okay.

1657
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,359
I'll wait here until my time is up.

1658
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,361
Play smarter, not harder.

1659
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:39,929
I'm going to win for sure.

1660
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,866
I don't think he'll find mine.

1661
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:43,933
THIS GUY'S SURE TOO

1662
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,503
But I'm not so sharp-sighted.

1663
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,040
I hope he chooses something easy to spot.

1664
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,244
I'm going to act like I'm carrying it.

1665
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:59,716
I should hover around
somewhere irrelevant.

1666
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,220
I don't think
any of us will find the item.

1667
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,023
Don't you agree?

1668
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,525
YES, WE AGREE...

1669
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,393
SO A SPECIAL MEASURE IS TAKEN

1670
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,528
Pick one each.

1671
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,663
We must...

1672
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,599
JUNG KOOK CHECKS THE ITEM FIRST

1673
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:17,667
What is it?

1674
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:21,037
HE'S CURIOUS TOO

1675
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:22,705
Mangosteen.

1676
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,407
[director] Mangosteen.

1677
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,210
This is not bad.

1678
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:28,278
IT'S SMALL

1679
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,079
He won't know if I stick it on a pot.

1680
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,247
Go hide it.

1681
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:33,316
OFF TO HIDE HIS SECOND ITEM

1682
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,419
You have five minutes
to hide your second item.

1683
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:37,820
THE TIMER STARTS

1684
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,889
MEANWHILE, JIMIN PICKS AN ITEM TOO

1685
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:40,957
What?

1686
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:49,232
Where should I hide this? Is it even here?

1687
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,569
Isn't it huge?

1688
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,104
SIGHING

1689
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,240
I should just leave it

1690
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,342
somewhere visible.

1691
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:01,678
That way, he won't know.

1692
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,180
Want to know where I hid mine?

1693
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,615
WHERE DID HE HIDE IT?

1694
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,052
WHAT? WHERE...?

1695
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,054
You make a guess too.

1696
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,256
I bet they edited my voice out.

1697
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:20,063
And I'm sure this one
will be blurred out too.

1698
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,764
Make a guess.

1699
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,702
First off, I should use this as a fake.

1700
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,439
THE SNACK HE TOOK
WHEN HE HID THE FIRST ITEM

1701
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:32,642
PLACING IT SOMEWHERE VISIBLE AS PLANNED

1702
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:33,710
Isn't it crazy?

1703
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,379
NOW, THE PROBLEM IS THE MANGOSTEEN...

1704
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,483
NOT HERE...

1705
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:43,353
NOT THE LIVING ROOM

1706
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,788
NOT THE FRIDGE...

1707
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,858
KEEPING IT IN HIS POCKET FOR NOW

1708
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:49,926
Gosh, I'm tired.

1709
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:54,097
RETURNING TO THE SECOND FLOOR
WITHOUT HIDING IT ON THE FIRST FLOOR

1710
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:55,665
What is yours, Jimin?

1711
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:56,833
-What?
-What is yours?

1712
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,635
CHECKING ON HIM FOR NOTHING

1713
01:08:58,701 --> 01:08:59,769
I'm lost for words.

1714
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:06,042
Now that he left, I need to hide it here.

1715
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:07,243
PLANNING TO HIDE IT HERE

1716
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,146
WHERE SHOULD I HIDE IT...

1717
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:17,420
THIS LOOKS GOOD!

1718
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,824
WHERE THE MANGOSTEEN IS

1719
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,660
I should put it back to how it was.

1720
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:29,432
My items aren't big,

1721
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,868
so he must've drawn something big.

1722
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,738
A RESENTFUL GLARE

1723
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,674
Oh, you already checked.

1724
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,108
HE ALREADY CHECKED WHAT IT WAS

1725
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,410
AM I SHAKING?

1726
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,412
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

1727
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,947
Where am I supposed to hide this?

1728
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,482
Please take it out.

1729
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,751
CRACKING UP

1730
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,253
Do I have to hide this?

1731
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,654
HIS ITEM IS FINALLY REVEALED

1732
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,623
DURIAN

1733
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,025
IT'S BIG AND STINKY

1734
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,394
You want me to hide this?

1735
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,729
He needs to destroy it?

1736
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,333
It'd be hard to destroy it.

1737
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,069
Only then will it count.

1738
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:09,072
Do we have to find one of the two items?

1739
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,741
Both, faster than the other.

1740
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:13,109
-Both items?
-Yes.

1741
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,144
[laughs]

1742
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,679
-Do I start?
-Yes.

1743
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:20,083
It's hard just to carry this.
It can't be hidden here.

1744
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:21,718
Jimin.

1745
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:22,919
-Begin.
-Begin.

1746
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,088
THE TIMER BEGINS

1747
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,657
TAKING OFF HIS SHOES

1748
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:33,796
WHERE DO I HIDE THIS?

1749
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:37,500
IT'S SO NOTICEABLE EVEN FROM AFAR...

1750
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,635
Where on earth should I hide it?

1751
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,974
CAREFULLY LOOKING FOR A SPOT

1752
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,442
I'm lost for words.

1753
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:47,777
Where can I hide this?

1754
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:49,612
REPEATING HIMSELF...

1755
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,316
I think it should be somewhere obvious
for him not to suspect it.

1756
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,852
It can't be hidden.

1757
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,986
Where do I...

1758
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,655
IT STANDS OUT TOO MUCH

1759
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,892
He'll most likely find this.

1760
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,794
What do I do with this?

1761
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,232
This is hopeless.

1762
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:16,906
WRIGGLING IN THE CORNER

1763
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,312
HE FINDS IT HILARIOUS HIMSELF

1764
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,916
IT'S TAKEN THE SPOT
FOR A FIRE EXTINGUISHER

1765
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:29,819
Is it too obvious?

1766
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,057
I have to use my brain.

1767
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,893
-What's the remaining time?
-Two.

1768
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,094
That's quite a lot.

1769
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:41,397
HE SPOTS A RED CLOTH

1770
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,232
It's red.

1771
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,600
DISGUISING IT IN RED

1772
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,637
Gosh, it stinks.

1773
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:52,308
IN PERFECT DISGUISE

1774
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:53,876
THOROUGH TO THE END

1775
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:55,478
Let's put it somewhere random.

1776
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,983
PLACING IT NATURALLY IN A CORNER

1777
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,554
HE'S BUSY HIDING THE DURIAN

1778
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,357
PUSHING IT TO A CORNER
TO MAKE IT AS NATURAL AS POSSIBLE

1779
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:12,261
SATISFIED

1780
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:14,197
It's not bad.

1781
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,965
Right under your nose.

1782
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:17,033
HIS IDEA OF HIDING

1783
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:20,002
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1784
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,905
TAKING THE BLUEBERRIES OUT
FROM THE CAMERAMAN'S POCKET

1785
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:25,808
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO
HIDE IT RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE

1786
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:26,876
I'm done.

1787
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:27,944
THE DURIAN IS HERE

1788
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,912
AND THE BLUEBERRIES ARE HERE

1789
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:32,582
IN A RUSH

1790
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,317
[whispering] Time isn't up yet.

1791
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,387
CHANGING THE LOCATION IN A RUSH

1792
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:47,196
FINAL LOCATIONS

1793
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:51,000
THEY FINALLY MEET AGAIN

1794
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,406
CHECKING EACH OTHER'S BODIES RIGHT AWAY

1795
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,375
-You don't have it.
-No?

1796
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:02,111
[director] Now, please begin searching.

1797
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:03,179
THE MISSION BEGINS

1798
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,047
Is it only the third and first floors?

1799
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,382
-Yes.
-[director] This room.

1800
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:08,851
-This room too?
-But we couldn't...

1801
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:12,021
This room was never empty
for anyone to hide anything.

1802
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:15,057
JIMIN SEARCHES THE THIRD FLOOR FIRST

1803
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,226
He couldn't have hidden it this sloppily.

1804
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,931
There's no evidence of raising it.

1805
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,866
JUNG KOOK IS SEARCHING THE 3RD FLOOR TOO

1806
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,768
Look at you keeping me in check first.

1807
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:26,836
VERY SENSITIVE

1808
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,004
Is it there?

1809
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,139
-I got you.
-No.

1810
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,207
SUSPICIOUS TO THE MAX

1811
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:34,710
I think you're putting up a similar act.

1812
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:40,082
Both of you have one small item
and one big item.

1813
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,150
Both of you.

1814
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:43,586
JUNG KOOK MOVES TO THE FIRST FLOOR FIRST

1815
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,554
I should just smash whatever I see.

1816
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:46,989
It may be in the bathroom.

1817
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:49,425
Can I check your bag, sir?

1818
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,927
[man] Yes, of course.

1819
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:56,832
HE MAY HAVE HIDDEN IT
IN A STAFF'S BELONGINGS...?

1820
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:59,035
Look meticulously.

1821
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,269
METICULOUS

1822
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:01,938
Since Jung Kook is strong.

1823
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:05,408
CHECKING UNDERNEATH THE MATTRESS TOO

1824
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,445
PRESSING NONSTOP

1825
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:12,048
EVEN CHECKING THE INSIDE

1826
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,418
THEN HE SPOTS A SUSPICIOUS SPACE

1827
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,689
Everything's blurry without contacts on.

1828
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:21,924
It shouldn't be there.

1829
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,960
Let's stop with this room.

1830
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:27,296
JUNG KOOK IS ON THE FIRST FLOOR

1831
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:31,300
CHECKING THE INNOCENT SHOES

1832
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:35,004
YOU CAN'T SEE RIGHT "NEXT TO" YOUR NOSE

1833
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:39,008
GETTING PAST THE DURIAN
AND CHECKING HIS ROE

1834
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,778
STOPPING

1835
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:46,215
I feel uneasy.

1836
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:48,284
ANXIOUS...

1837
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:52,355
Why is the bag turned around?

1838
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,726
I really suck at finding things.

1839
01:14:58,361 --> 01:15:02,365
CHECKING THE FAKE ITEM OUT OF ANXIETY

1840
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,899
Why isn't Jimin coming down?

1841
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,267
IT MAKES HIM FEEL UNEASY TOO

1842
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,070
Found anything?

1843
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:09,705
THEY MEET AGAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR

1844
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,743
ACTING AS IF HE'S FINE

1845
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,211
I'll go to the second floor.

1846
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,512
JIMIN CLUELESSLY HEADS OUT

1847
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,180
Our room is included, right?

1848
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,248
[director] Right.

1849
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:23,319
I'm going to smash all the food.

1850
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:27,490
SPOTTING SUSPICIOUS MANGO JELLY

1851
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,425
Let's just eat it.

1852
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,293
JUST EAT IT!

1853
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:34,830
This may be the item.

1854
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:40,302
SPOTTING ANOTHER JELLY

1855
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,505
IT MAY BE FAKE,

1856
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,507
BUT JUST EAT IT

1857
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,343
He kept searching this room?

1858
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,245
Goodness.

1859
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,312
SEARCHING AGAIN

1860
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,149
I have no clue.

1861
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,719
I think they're all food.

1862
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:58,120
HE ASSUMES IT'S FOOD AS WELL

1863
01:15:58,187 --> 01:16:00,556
I'm sure he hid it on the first floor.

1864
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:01,624
Not the bathroom.

1865
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,993
-Jung Kook.
-What?

1866
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,328
I got you, punk.

1867
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,997
I destroyed one of yours.

1868
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,331
What are you saying?

1869
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,500
-It was in our room.
-What?

1870
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,102
-It was in our room.
-No.

1871
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,403
What could it be?

1872
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,639
I have no idea.

1873
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,076
HE'S CLUELESS, BUT HE KEEPS SEARCHING

1874
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,813
HE'S CLUELESS

1875
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,849
I'm sure he pulled a trick too.

1876
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:30,119
CHECKING THE WHOLE SOFA

1877
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,022
TEARING AND SEARCHING

1878
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:34,590
Where could it be?

1879
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,292
I'm clueless.

1880
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:40,362
PASSIONATE

1881
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,064
Where did you hide yours?

1882
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,699
One of yours is big.

1883
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,135
I know what mine is,

1884
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:48,804
and I think it's insane.
But where is yours?

1885
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,473
Jung Kook.

1886
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:51,540
I got a feeling.

1887
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,410
I'm going to smash everything here.

1888
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,612
Smash.

1889
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:58,114
DESTROYING THE WELCOME FOOD

1890
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,181
Smash.

1891
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,383
I can't smash all these.

1892
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:03,919
Is it you?

1893
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,022
JUNG KOOK PASSES BY

1894
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,757
AND SPOTS IT

1895
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:09,959
GRASPING THE SITUATION

1896
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,066
CHECKING HIM AGAIN

1897
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:19,969
THIS IS BAD

1898
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,972
I don't think this is it.

1899
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,240
BUT HE PUTS IT DOWN

1900
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:26,208
Have I seen it?

1901
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:27,810
UNSURE

1902
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:31,313
HE BECOMES STIFF OUT OF ANXIETY

1903
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,716
HESITATING

1904
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,417
HE TAKES IT OUT...?

1905
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,155
I don't feel good smashing all these,
so just one in case.

1906
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,789
ONLY IF HE'D TAKEN THE NEXT ONE...

1907
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:45,060
JUNG KOOK BARELY SURVIVED

1908
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,962
HE BEGINS SEARCHING CAREFULLY AGAIN

1909
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,030
It's driving me nuts.

1910
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:51,000
BEATING RANDOMLY

1911
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,535
Do I just smash it like this?

1912
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,805
LYING DOWN RANDOMLY

1913
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,108
THIS IS JUNG KOOK

1914
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,176
Where is it?

1915
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:01,377
TO AVOID BREAKFAST

1916
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,578
Where is it?

1917
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:05,714
THEY SEARCHED HARD AND LONG,
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY...

1918
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,584
[director] Both of you
seem way too clueless.

1919
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:09,652
Right.

1920
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,187
You're near the items.

1921
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,122
THEY'RE NEARBY

1922
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:16,625
Jimin even touched one.

1923
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:17,693
What?

1924
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,864
-What about me?
-You're very close to the item too.

1925
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:22,932
Right now?

1926
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:25,401
IT'S IN THE CAMERAMAN'S POCKET
IN FRONT OF HIM

1927
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,903
Am I close to the items too? Let me know.

1928
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,471
He said you touched one.

1929
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,541
-Farther than Jung Kook is from yours.
-What?

1930
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,577
I touched it?

1931
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,512
I'm farther away from it than Jung Kook?

1932
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:38,581
I'm close to it right now?

1933
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,648
[Jimin] Jung Kook.

1934
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,418
You hid it in a nerve-racking place?

1935
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:48,490
[director] I think Jimin is
within about a 2.5 m radius from it.

1936
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,627
Jung Kook is almost
within a one-meter radius from it.

1937
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:53,696
That's this much.

1938
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,566
Where is it? Where?

1939
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:01,437
IT'S SO FUN TO WATCH

1940
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,339
This is a one-meter radius.

1941
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,406
It's here.

1942
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,044
I didn't touch it. He said I touched it.

1943
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,046
Wait. Jung Kook is approaching.

1944
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,682
He's anxious. Jeon Jung Kook!

1945
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,785
BEATING

1946
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,987
Where is it?

1947
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,989
WHERE WITHIN A ONE-METER RADIUS?

1948
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,090
One meter.

1949
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:23,559
I found... This is it.

1950
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:26,061
-This is it!
-No.

1951
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,130
MADNESS

1952
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:29,365
Smash it!

1953
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,367
HE FELL FOR IT

1954
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,269
No? It's not the one?

1955
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,937
Within a one-meter radius.

1956
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:36,005
What's here?

1957
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:38,107
IS IT ON THE CEILING?

1958
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,109
Want to go to bed?

1959
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,377
Shall we do it tomorrow?

1960
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,112
Should we both have breakfast?

1961
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,948
Jimin, I want to find the items.

1962
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:47,182
HE'S DYING TO FIND THEM

1963
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,619
Your hidden items are close to each other.

1964
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:54,023
LIFE IS A COMEDY FROM AFAR

1965
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,324
Where did you hide them?

1966
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,925
Look at me, punk.

1967
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,394
AND A TRAGEDY FROM UP CLOSE

1968
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,163
-[Jimin] Where?
-You make a move first.

1969
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,065
[Jimin] You first.

1970
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,166
A HEAD MASSAGE HOTSPOT

1971
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:05,901
Where is it for real?

1972
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,303
Within a one-meter radius...

1973
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,370
It's here.

1974
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:09,872
AN ELEGANT ONE-METER TURN

1975
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,874
HIS TOES TOUCH THE CAMERAMAN THAT TIME

1976
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,475
Can you take off your socks?

1977
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:14,710
Where is it?

1978
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:16,178
-Where?
-Where?

1979
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:17,513
DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA

1980
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:18,981
Jung Kook.

1981
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:20,349
Jimin.

1982
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:21,583
You can hide stuff well.

1983
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,751
THE DANGER SPOT

1984
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:23,886
You punk.

1985
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,154
Jimin.

1986
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,122
You got better, punk.

1987
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:30,125
We might end up going to bed
two hours late.

1988
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,495
It's almost within a 50 cm radius now.

1989
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,897
What, 50 centimeters?

1990
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,165
Jung Kook.

1991
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,534
You touched it, Jimin.

1992
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,936
I touched too many things.

1993
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,204
You touched it just now.

1994
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,741
-What about me?
-It was within a 50 cm radius.

1995
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,143
You're good.

1996
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,512
[Jung Kook] Be honest with me.
Let's negotiate.

1997
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:51,580
Negotiate?

1998
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,682
Let's give each other a hint.

1999
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:55,651
How about this?

2000
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:59,722
Say this area is the first zone.

2001
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,224
The second zone.
And the third zone is here.

2002
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,926
Let's just tell which zones.

2003
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,363
Okay. Where is it?

2004
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:09,031
-You sure you'll tell me?
-Yes.

2005
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:10,399
Mine is in the third zone.

2006
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:11,567
Me too.

2007
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:12,835
Liar.

2008
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,737
Don't lie.

2009
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:18,073
-I mean it.
-Then let's go together.

2010
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,174
You lied, didn't you?

2011
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,743
I didn't.

2012
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,044
I swear on my everything.

2013
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:25,447
Then within the given radius
in the third zone?

2014
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:28,617
Where is it?

2015
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:31,653
Jung Kook.
We can't find them in this small area?

2016
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,955
Where is it?

2017
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,590
YOU'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE

2018
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:35,891
I got you.

2019
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:36,959
Must I take this off?

2020
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,361
I doubt he put it in here.

2021
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:40,629
No? It's...

2022
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:41,764
Jung Kook.

2023
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:42,831
Jimin.

2024
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:44,600
Be honest.

2025
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,101
Be honest.

2026
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:49,838
SOMETHING UNFAMILIAR
IS MIXED WITH THE SNACKS

2027
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,641
HE'S DOOMED...

2028
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:54,443
TEASING

2029
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,245
Pop.

2030
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,648
POPPING THE SALMON ROE

2031
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:00,816
[Jung Kook] What the?

2032
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,985
My salmon roe's gone without a trace.

2033
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:06,355
Just admit your defeat and have breakfast.

2034
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:08,724
Gosh, it stinks.

2035
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,993
CHECKING THE DURIAN AFTER FINDING ONE

2036
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,061
You said it was within a 50 cm radius.

2037
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,329
But it makes no sense.

2038
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:15,898
But it is.

2039
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,400
IT'S WITHIN A 30 CM RADIUS NOW

2040
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,836
Isn't it around 50 centimeters
from Jung Kook?

2041
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:21,904
Now?

2042
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,040
But this zone is less than 50 centimeters.

2043
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,476
[director] It's almost within a 1m radius.

2044
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,344
Almost 50 centimeters.

2045
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:30,679
[Jimin] The third zone.

2046
01:22:30,746 --> 01:22:31,880
[Jung Kook] Me too.

2047
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,983
Jung Kook, let me give you a hint.

2048
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,352
The other item is really big.

2049
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:38,420
REALLY BIG

2050
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:39,521
What?

2051
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,591
My other item is really big.

2052
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:43,659
IT'S HUMONGOUS

2053
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:45,961
I didn't see anything really big.

2054
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:47,963
How big is yours?

2055
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,832
Mine? It's this big.

2056
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,834
A SMALL MANGOSTEEN

2057
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,369
-You want a hint for mine?
-Yes.

2058
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,005
A 4XL DURIAN

2059
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,340
-What?
-I'm telling you.

2060
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:00,008
-What?
-I'm telling you.

2061
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,076
I didn't see it.

2062
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,078
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING THAT BIG

2063
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,251
I was unlucky with my draw.

2064
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,086
You were lucky.

2065
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,288
Then why can't I find them?

2066
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:14,857
I searched every floor,

2067
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:17,392
and I couldn't find your item this big?

2068
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,128
I better check our room.

2069
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:21,530
Did you leave it there?

2070
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,265
NERVOUSLY FEIGNING IGNORANCE

2071
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,400
[director] I'll give you a quick hint.

2072
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:26,935
-Have a seat here.
-[Jimin] Okay.

2073
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,505
Let me give Jung Kook a hint first.

2074
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,008
One is bigger than this.

2075
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:34,810
It's bigger than this case.

2076
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:36,211
It's bigger than this.

2077
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:37,779
I didn't see anything like that.

2078
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,516
If you drew what I drew,

2079
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,652
you'd have a mental breakdown.

2080
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,421
"Why is it even here?"

2081
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:50,158
You'd think so if you found it.
It's located that randomly.

2082
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,161
The other item was in the third zone.

2083
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,531
It was within a 50 cm radius.

2084
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:59,201
You're telling him everything.
I might lose.

2085
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,335
Are you carrying it?

2086
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:02,638
No?

2087
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,275
-And now, here's a hint for Jimin.
-Okay.

2088
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:09,278
It's somewhere inside.

2089
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,581
You're too hard on me.

2090
01:24:12,648 --> 01:24:14,383
What? Isn't it a crucial hint?

2091
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:15,517
[Jung Kook] Yes, it is.

2092
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:21,223
Jung Kook's item and Jimin's first item

2093
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,958
are both movable.

2094
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:24,359
Where did you hide it?

2095
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,395
Is there anything movable there?

2096
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,596
In the third zone.

2097
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,134
It's movable? Your item is movable?

2098
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:34,803
It's almost...

2099
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:36,505
Right.

2100
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,576
But really...

2101
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,377
Anyway, all right. Do we resume now?

2102
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,445
[director] Resume.

2103
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:48,550
They're originally for moving.

2104
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:50,652
What's movable here?

2105
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:54,222
Right, you're moving around.

2106
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,557
THE FILMING EQUIPMENT BAG

2107
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,960
Didn't I check this? I did.

2108
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:59,194
WHILE HE'S RANSACKING IT

2109
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,797
It's a bag. It has to be a bag.

2110
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:02,864
It's a bag.

2111
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,334
It's in a bag.

2112
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,003
It's not like I can
ransack all your pockets.

2113
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:09,404
Ransack all your pockets...

2114
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:15,043
HE HOLDS HIS BREATH
IN CASE JUNG KOOK HEARD HIM

2115
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:16,945
I did check this.

2116
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:18,580
FORTUNATELY, HE DIDN'T HEAR ANY

2117
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:22,184
CHECKING ON JUNG KOOK

2118
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,251
Is it not here?

2119
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,387
It may not be here on this floor.

2120
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,223
I'll quickly find the other item
and send him to breakfast.

2121
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:31,526
It may be a shoe.

2122
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:33,595
HE SPOTS SHOES BY THE GATE ON HIS WAY UP

2123
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,332
Their sole purpose is moving.

2124
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:38,934
To move... A suitcase?

2125
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:44,539
HE GOT A SURE FEELING

2126
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,476
Nothing changed. He hid it here?

2127
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,877
Let's start with the bags.

2128
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:52,447
SEARCHING THE BAGS FIRST

2129
01:25:53,015 --> 01:25:54,149
It's very close by.

2130
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:57,285
If it's very close by, why can't I see it?

2131
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,221
PLEASE LOOK BEHIND YOU...

2132
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,089
This is insane.

2133
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:03,725
Where is it?

2134
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:06,194
It's not in the third zone now.

2135
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,262
IT'S IN THE 2ND ZONE

2136
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,599
IT WAS IN THE THIRD ZONE
WHEN JIMIN WAS WITH HIM

2137
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,101
-Is it Jimin?
-It's not in the third zone.

2138
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,503
Then it's Jimin.

2139
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,872
HE GOT THE WRONG IDEA

2140
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,742
HE CAUGHT IT RIGHT AT ONCE

2141
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:22,544
PRESSING AGAIN

2142
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:25,213
SENSING SOMETHING

2143
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,849
WILL HE FIND IT?

2144
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,653
NO, IT'S A MULTI ADAPTER

2145
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,754
I doubt it's here.

2146
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:35,057
He said it wasn't here. He wouldn't lie.

2147
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:36,124
Did he?

2148
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,693
DO I BELIEVE HIM?

2149
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:38,760
Hold on.

2150
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:40,595
JUNG KOOK COMES UP

2151
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,663
Did you find it?

2152
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,331
Come here. Where is it?

2153
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,734
You can't find it anywhere on me.

2154
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:47,736
IT'S NOT WITH ME

2155
01:26:47,803 --> 01:26:49,671
Where is it? Is it in your ear?

2156
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:51,440
No, it's not on me.

2157
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:54,209
-It's not on you?
-No, it's not.

2158
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:56,411
Imagine a bubble around me.

2159
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:58,947
It's not within a 30 cm radius from me.

2160
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:00,115
Then where is it?

2161
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,884
Hey. Is yours in here?

2162
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:04,886
No.

2163
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:07,689
I said no.

2164
01:27:07,756 --> 01:27:08,857
READING HIS FACE

2165
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:09,925
Where is it?

2166
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,060
-I got you.
-I said no earlier.

2167
01:27:12,127 --> 01:27:14,329
-Jung Kook.
-I said it wasn't here.

2168
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:15,731
You lost.

2169
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:17,833
It's over for you.

2170
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,535
Why is yours getting farther away?

2171
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:24,072
It moves close to me
and then far away from me.

2172
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:26,441
[director] It's very close by.

2173
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:28,343
It's in the suitcase. I'll empty it.

2174
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,578
HE SUDDENLY MOVES FORWARD

2175
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,348
OH, WELL...

2176
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:37,652
HE FOUND IT

2177
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,254
Are you kidding me?

2178
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:41,356
No wonder I couldn't find it.

2179
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:42,657
Hold on. Now...

2180
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:45,060
I found one. What a hint.

2181
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:47,496
REST IN PEACE, BLUEBERRIES...

2182
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:49,831
I'm at a disadvantage now.

2183
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:51,433
Let's go find the big one.

2184
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,202
It's here? Are you sure?

2185
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,338
"Why is it even here?"

2186
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:57,939
"Why is it here?"

2187
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,242
"Why is it here?"

2188
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:03,078
I can't believe he was carrying it.
How smart.

2189
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:04,679
He's smart.

2190
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,983
So he was near me
because I was ransacking his stuff.

2191
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,184
RANSACKING THE SUITCASE

2192
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:10,318
BACK TO THE 2ND FLOOR

2193
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,554
-Jung Kook.
-Why is it here?

2194
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:15,590
Why is this here?

2195
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,125
Why is this here?

2196
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:22,931
TEARING

2197
01:28:22,998 --> 01:28:24,065
It's torn.

2198
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,667
[Jung Kook] I'll enjoy breakfast.

2199
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:26,735
WITH MANGOSTEENS

2200
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:29,004
The winner of this game is...

2201
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:31,039
Jimin.

2202
01:28:31,106 --> 01:28:32,374
Congrats.

2203
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,276
[director] You can sleep until 10:00 a.m.

2204
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:35,777
HE GETS TO SLEEP UNTIL 10:00 A.M.

2205
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,013
You have to be ready by 10 a.m.

2206
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,115
What about me? What time should I wake up?

2207
01:28:40,182 --> 01:28:41,983
You have to go out at 8:30 a.m.

2208
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,486
I see. Anyway, what's that big item?

2209
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:46,655
-It's...
-Can I show him where?

2210
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:48,423
Yes, sure.

2211
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,425
-I didn't notice it?
-How did you not?

2212
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,894
It stinks, but you couldn't find it.

2213
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:54,429
Is this it?

2214
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,665
THAT'S RIGHT

2215
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,466
-Is it a durian?
-Yes.

2216
01:28:58,934 --> 01:29:01,636
PICKING A RED DURIAN

2217
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:03,305
Jeez.

2218
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:07,776
Because it's red...

2219
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,445
I found the cloth here and used it.

2220
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:11,513
Oh, really?

2221
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,849
It was like this when I got it.

2222
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,219
Gosh, the fire extinguisher...

2223
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,221
I didn't suspect it at all.

2224
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:20,322
Thanks.

2225
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:23,158
I was so flustered when I drew it.

2226
01:29:23,225 --> 01:29:26,328
Where would you hide it if you drew it?

2227
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,997
There's nowhere to hide it.

2228
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,233
Why couldn't I find it?

2229
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:32,801
Isn't it smart how I covered it?

2230
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,169
Yes.

2231
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:36,671
It wasn't suspicious at all in my eyes.

2232
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,909
[Jimin] It smelled so much there,
but you didn't bother at all.

2233
01:29:40,976 --> 01:29:42,344
HE WAS THERE FOR QUITE A WHILE

2234
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,912
-Didn't it stink?
-I don't know.

2235
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:45,413
I kept smelling it.

2236
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,115
I was busy looking for the items.

2237
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:48,750
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE LEISURE

2238
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,953
If you hadn't given us any hints,

2239
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,323
we'd have been clueless until the end.
Even on the plane, "Where?"

2240
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:57,692
Good job.

2241
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,662
You too. I must say I'm horrible
at this kind of game.

2242
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,197
Me too.

2243
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:03,265
I really am.

2244
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,300
Hold on. I have a question.

2245
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:06,735
Is it still not over?

2246
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,471
[director] You have one hour
and four minutes left.

2247
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:12,274
Jung Kook, you have 34 minutes left.

2248
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,676
-I see.
-Anyway, good job.

2249
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,511
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

2250
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,213
Let's wrap it up with a slate.

2251
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,581
One, two, three.

2252
01:30:19,648 --> 01:30:21,816
THE LAST MISSION IS OVER

2253
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:23,919
I want to show him the video.

2254
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:25,020
AFTER THE MISSION...

2255
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,321
He might get it back soon.

2256
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:27,689
CHECKING THE REMAINING TIME

2257
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,991
He has 20 minutes left.
I have 50 minutes left.

2258
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:31,126
Jeez!

2259
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:32,694
Let's play a game.

2260
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:34,529
-Yutnori?
-Yes.

2261
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,766
SETTING THE GAME UP

2262
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:41,303
We've added a lot of fun rules.

2263
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:49,277
THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO!

2264
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:52,614
WE'RE SAFE AND WELL

2265
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:54,049
THEY START PLAYING YUTNORI

2266
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,116
Yut!

2267
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:57,786
Yut.

2268
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:58,887
I should keep going.

2269
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,589
-Geol.
-Geol. And then...

2270
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,191
Right. Geol and then go.

2271
01:31:03,258 --> 01:31:05,093
-[Jimin] Wait.
-Go around once again.

2272
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,963
YUT GOD MAKES A GREAT START

2273
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,864
-What the?
-One more time. You caught it.

2274
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:12,467
What... You really are a Yut god.

2275
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:16,004
-[Jimin] Back-do.
-[director] Back-do.

2276
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:17,839
EVEN ON THE LAST NIGHT IN DA NANG

2277
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:19,341
[Jung Kook] Gosh, I got caught.

2278
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:20,408
I got caught.

2279
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,010
Geol.

2280
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:25,280
THEY'RE FULL OF LAUGHTER

2281
01:31:27,716 --> 01:31:29,818
[Jimin] This trip was so fun too.

2282
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:32,721
THE MORNING COMES AGAIN

2283
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:36,458
FACING THE GOLDEN SUN
THAT SPREADS OVER THE HORIZON,

2284
01:31:36,925 --> 01:31:38,526
WE MEET THE LAST MORNING IN DA NANG

2285
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:40,295
GOOD MORNING

2286
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:43,431
-[Jimin] Jung Kook.
-What?

2287
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,233
Did you have breakfast at 8:00 a.m.?

2288
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,735
Breakfast?

2289
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,405
Yes. I woke up to have breakfast,

2290
01:31:51,373 --> 01:31:53,074
but I wasn't hungry at all.

2291
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:59,948
HE WOKE UP ON TIME EARLIER AT 8:00 A.M.

2292
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:01,049
[director] Let's go.

2293
01:32:01,116 --> 01:32:02,117
What?

2294
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:04,486
-To have breakfast?
-Yes.

2295
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,460
But I have no appetite.

2296
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,430
Then again,
I might have one once I get there.

2297
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:25,173
HE HAD NO APPETITE

2298
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:30,278
AND HE WOKE UP ON TIME, SO IT COUNTED

2299
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:36,418
WANDERING

2300
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:40,922
LYING DOWN ON THE SOFA

2301
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:42,924
It's nice.

2302
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:50,965
WAITING FOR JIMIN ON HIS BACK

2303
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,569
[director] Come down when you're ready.

2304
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:55,770
-Okay.
-Okay.

2305
01:32:57,839 --> 01:32:58,907
Let's go.

2306
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:00,575
OFF TO HAVE LUNCH

2307
01:33:00,642 --> 01:33:02,143
These shoes really are comfy.

2308
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:03,411
I know.

2309
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:05,713
Even when I jump.

2310
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,348
JUMPING

2311
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,250
It's impact-free.

2312
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:11,453
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THESE COMFY SLIPPERS?

2313
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:15,824
THEIR TRIP IS EVEN MORE PERFECT
THANKS TO THE COMFY SLIPPERS

2314
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:22,864
WITH THEIR FEET FEELING COMFORTABLE,
THEY FEEL AT EASE

2315
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,066
-I know.
-I like black.

2316
01:33:25,133 --> 01:33:26,835
[Jung Kook] These are that comfy.

2317
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:29,437
-[Jimin] They really are.
-They are.

2318
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:31,940
ON THEIR WAY TO EAT IN THE COMFY SLIPPERS

2319
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:35,009
-Jung Kook, let's eat.
-Yes.

2320
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:38,213
THE LAST MEAL IN DA NANG
BANH MI, CHA GIO, PHO, BUN CHA

2321
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,748
Jimin, have a taste
and decide whether to add this.

2322
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:42,750
-Let's add it.
-Have a taste first.

2323
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:43,952
Dip some.

2324
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,753
HE'S OBEDIENT

2325
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,355
-Let's add it.
-Do we?

2326
01:33:47,422 --> 01:33:49,057
ADDING SAUCE TO THE PHO

2327
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:50,592
-Is this chili?
-Yes, add it.

2328
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,129
-It's spicy.
-This is garlic.

2329
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,196
Do I put it in?

2330
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:57,532
NOT GARLIC...

2331
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:00,602
NOW, MIX THEM WELL TOGETHER

2332
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,238
HE CAN'T WAIT

2333
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:07,342
LET'S EAT NOW

2334
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:09,210
Enjoy.

2335
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:10,278
You too.

2336
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:12,547
Aren't the staff members eating?

2337
01:34:12,614 --> 01:34:14,315
SLURPING

2338
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,151
Are the staff members not eating?

2339
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:18,086
[director] We ordered sandwiches to go.

2340
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,154
-You did?
-Yes.

2341
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:22,924
A BIG MOUTHFUL

2342
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,794
A SATISFIED NOD

2343
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:29,631
GOING FOR ANOTHER MOUTHFUL

2344
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:33,301
DIGGING IN OUT OF SATISFACTION

2345
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,238
[Jung Kook] Hmm.

2346
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,841
What is this?

2347
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:41,176
THIS

2348
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:43,845
Do we dip the noodles in here?

2349
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,079
Right, that's bun cha.

2350
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:47,649
TEACHING HIM HOW TO EAT IT

2351
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:50,418
MIXING THEM INSTEAD OF DIPPING

2352
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:58,560
OFFERING SOME TO JUNG KOOK FIRST

2353
01:35:01,296 --> 01:35:03,531
SAVORING

2354
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:06,668
SAVORING

2355
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:09,137
THIS IS DELICIOUS!

2356
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,074
So, this is how it tastes. It's good.

2357
01:35:13,141 --> 01:35:14,209
-You like it?
-Yes.

2358
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:15,276
Good.

2359
01:35:15,343 --> 01:35:17,745
SOME FRESH VEGETABLES TOO

2360
01:35:19,347 --> 01:35:21,282
NOODLES, MEAT AND VEGGIES WITH SAUCE

2361
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:25,019
JIMIN TRIES SOME BUN CHA TOO

2362
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,387
VIETNAMESE CHILI

2363
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:28,156
THE CHILI GIVES A REFRESHING TASTE

2364
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:29,857
JUNG KOOK IS INTO BUN CHA

2365
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,526
It's good to have it with noodles.

2366
01:35:31,593 --> 01:35:34,262
I can eat it like this, right?
It's good this way.

2367
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:35,330
LOTS OF VEGGIES

2368
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:40,201
ENJOYING IT SO MUCH

2369
01:35:43,004 --> 01:35:45,740
HE WOULDN'T MISS OUT ON THE MEAT

2370
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:48,476
Try some with the sauce.

2371
01:35:48,543 --> 01:35:50,545
This with the sauce too.

2372
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,080
-It's universal.
-Right.

2373
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,048
It's an all-round sauce.

2374
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:55,149
This is...

2375
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,252
It's good.

2376
01:35:57,318 --> 01:35:58,886
THEY TRY SOME BANH MI THIS TIME

2377
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:04,559
THIS IS VERY GOOD

2378
01:36:04,626 --> 01:36:05,660
It feels like...

2379
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:08,363
a Vietnamese

2380
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,430
McMorning.

2381
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:11,165
-McMorning?
-Yes.

2382
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:12,800
It tastes so clean.

2383
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:14,902
This might be good with the sauce too.

2384
01:36:19,374 --> 01:36:21,843
ENJOYING THE BANH MI

2385
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:26,614
SUDDENLY WAVING HIS HAND

2386
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:31,486
IT'S A PRANK

2387
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:41,829
SLURPING SOME PHO AGAIN

2388
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:44,766
This itself has become really spicy.

2389
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,734
Because of the chili.

2390
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:50,038
SO MUCH CHILI PLAYED ITS ROLE...

2391
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:53,074
IT'S SPICY...

2392
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:54,842
BUT IT'S GOOD...

2393
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:58,246
IT'S SPICY, BUT THEY EAT NONSTOP...

2394
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:03,384
Goodness.

2395
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:04,519
Gosh, the chili.

2396
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:06,587
It's spicy.

2397
01:37:09,691 --> 01:37:10,692
Goodness.

2398
01:37:11,426 --> 01:37:16,931
SOOTHING HIS PALATE WITH A COLD DRINK

2399
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:21,502
ENJOYING THE FOOD THE WAY THEY WANT

2400
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:25,206
SLURPING

2401
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,509
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

2402
01:37:29,711 --> 01:37:30,712
I'm so full.

2403
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:34,015
The pho sure is good.

2404
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:36,084
-I know, right?
-Yes.

2405
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:39,954
TO THE LAST DROP

2406
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:44,225
FINISHING IT NEATLY WITH THE SOUP

2407
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,161
EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL
DOWN TO THE BROTH...

2408
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:52,166
BOTTOMS UP

2409
01:37:54,669 --> 01:37:55,670
Gosh, I'm full.

2410
01:37:56,771 --> 01:37:58,673
[director] Did you enjoy the last meal?

2411
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,641
-Yes.
-Yes, I'm so grateful.

2412
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,610
I feel sad now that I have to leave.

2413
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:06,180
IT'S ALWAYS SAD
TO MEET THE END OF A TRIP...

2414
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:07,849
It's so pretty outside.

2415
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:15,156
THE LAST SCENERY IN DA NANG SEES THEM OFF

2416
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:17,158
-Let's get going.
-Okay.

2417
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,259
IT'S TIME TO GO BACK

2418
01:38:18,326 --> 01:38:20,128
-Jung Kook.
-Good job.

2419
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:22,764
-See you in Korea. Bye.
-See you in Korea.

2420
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,499
LET'S MEET AGAIN IN KOREA!

2421
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:28,669
How would you describe our trip
in one sentence?

2422
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,938
-You were sure.
-Sure?

2423
01:38:31,706 --> 01:38:32,740
This trip was sure?

2424
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:34,776
Yes, it was sure.

2425
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:36,411
Right.

2426
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:39,080
I liked it in many ways.

2427
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:42,016
I got to make amazing memories.

2428
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:45,386
I think I'll visit the places
at least once again.

2429
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:51,225
Me too. I really want to visit Zermatt
and travel around there again.

2430
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:53,194
I loved it that much.

2431
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:54,529
ZERMATT CAPTURED HIS HEART

2432
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,833
The shape in the Matterhorn was beautiful.
That steep mountain.

2433
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,368
THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY THERE

2434
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,404
[Jimin] We even enjoyed skiing
on that snowy mountain.

2435
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:06,374
It was quite meaningful.

2436
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:08,342
SKIING IN THE MATTERHORN WAS LIKE A MOVIE

2437
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:12,313
And the whiskey under the stars.
That was unforgettable.

2438
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,149
It gave my heart a thrill.

2439
01:39:15,216 --> 01:39:16,751
I'm so grateful for it.

2440
01:39:16,818 --> 01:39:22,356
That canteen and torch
really fascinated me.

2441
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:24,392
-Make a wish.
-My goodness.

2442
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:25,927
We saw shooting stars again.

2443
01:39:26,828 --> 01:39:30,565
[Jung Kook] It was pleasant
when we drove on that rainy day

2444
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,001
and when we were on the boat yesterday.
These two experiences.

2445
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:36,370
All the best for BTS.

2446
01:39:36,437 --> 01:39:37,872
All the best for BTS!

2447
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:45,847
[Jimin] Floating a lamp away on the river,
that was so fascinating.

2448
01:39:46,614 --> 01:39:47,615
The lady.

2449
01:39:47,682 --> 01:39:49,350
THEY SHARED AFFECTION WITH LOCALS

2450
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,152
She touched my cheeks too.

2451
01:39:51,219 --> 01:39:52,753
I was so grateful.

2452
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,821
One more thing.

2453
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:57,191
Don't get a massage.

2454
01:39:57,258 --> 01:39:59,060
Because you can't remember?

2455
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:01,028
But others may remember.

2456
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:02,864
No, you'd be knocked out right away.

2457
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:05,166
THEY REMEMBER NOTHING ABOUT IT...

2458
01:40:05,233 --> 01:40:06,667
SNORING

2459
01:40:06,734 --> 01:40:08,769
-I liked it, though.
-Me too, of course.

2460
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,607
I loved it. The massage
actually is the most memorable.

2461
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,876
[Jimin] Gosh, the motorcycle riding.

2462
01:40:14,942 --> 01:40:16,544
[Jung Kook] Everything was perfect.

2463
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:17,812
Even the weather.

2464
01:40:17,879 --> 01:40:19,847
The landscape was beautiful on the way.

2465
01:40:19,914 --> 01:40:22,049
THEY MET UNFORGETTABLE SCENERIES
EVERY TIME

2466
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:23,985
And the island-hopping tour.

2467
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:25,386
It was unexpectedly fun.

2468
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,722
[Jimin] The parasailing.

2469
01:40:27,788 --> 01:40:29,023
It was really nice.

2470
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:30,758
[Jung Kook] When we ascended.

2471
01:40:30,825 --> 01:40:32,293
-It sure was thrilling.
-Yes.

2472
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,862
[Jung Kook] Felt like flying.
Like a plane taking off.

2473
01:40:34,929 --> 01:40:35,930
[Jimin] Right.

2474
01:40:35,997 --> 01:40:37,665
[Jung Kook] That was why it was fun.

2475
01:40:37,732 --> 01:40:43,070
And as for the paragliding,
it felt like I was flying in a painting.

2476
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:45,006
I felt truly happy.

2477
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:46,541
I love you, ARMY!

2478
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,576
ARMY WAS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR HAPPINESS

2479
01:40:48,643 --> 01:40:51,445
And we had so much food.

2480
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:52,513
It was delightful.

2481
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:53,948
FULLNESS BRINGS HAPPINESS

2482
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:58,319
IT WAS DOUBLY ENJOYABLE
THANKS TO THE DELICIOUS FOOD!

2483
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:03,724
[Jimin] We got to have
different kinds of food.

2484
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,093
It all tasted so different.

2485
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,529
EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THEY WERE TOGETHER

2486
01:41:08,596 --> 01:41:09,597
And the games.

2487
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:12,099
I had fun playing many games.

2488
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,835
THE MISSIONS MADE THEIR TRIP DYNAMIC

2489
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:16,404
Back-do!

2490
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:21,075
TWICE AS MUCH FUN

2491
01:41:21,142 --> 01:41:24,745
TWICE AS MANY MEMORIES

2492
01:41:25,313 --> 01:41:26,581
You have 10 seconds left.

2493
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:28,449
-Guess.
-Pig.

2494
01:41:28,516 --> 01:41:31,352
OF COURSE THERE WERE
SOME CRISES AND HARDSHIPS

2495
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:32,486
What is it?

2496
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:33,554
Hippo.

2497
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:40,628
THEY GOT TO LAUGH MORE THANKS TO THE GAMES

2498
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,631
And the digital minimalism.

2499
01:41:44,732 --> 01:41:46,200
I hated it.

2500
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:49,904
We got discharged around two weeks ago.

2501
01:41:50,404 --> 01:41:51,405
The minimalism...

2502
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:53,074
SO MUCH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT

2503
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:56,310
-But thanks to it,
-I think we needed it.

2504
01:41:56,377 --> 01:41:59,513
I enjoyed playing yutnori with Jung Kook.

2505
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,581
It was so nice.

2506
01:42:00,648 --> 01:42:03,351
THEY HAD UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS
WITHOUT THEIR PHONES

2507
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:05,586
This trip is meaningful to me because...

2508
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:07,088
HOW IS IT MEANINGFUL TO YOU?

2509
01:42:07,154 --> 01:42:09,090
It was my adjustment period.

2510
01:42:09,156 --> 01:42:15,296
I felt really awkward around cameras,
but I eventually got used to it.

2511
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:18,132
I got used to talking

2512
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:21,068
and eating around cameras.

2513
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:25,006
This trip helped me with such things.

2514
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:27,942
I'm very grateful for this trip.

2515
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:31,245
And I got to see so many beautiful sights
while I was at it.

2516
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:33,414
IT HELPED THEM RETURN TO THEIR DAILY LIFE

2517
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,016
This trip was...

2518
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,587
very meaningful, helpful, and delightful.

2519
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:40,755
What about you, Jimin?

2520
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:44,692
As for me...

2521
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:46,661
uh...

2522
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:49,830
I felt happy.

2523
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:53,234
I'd forgotten

2524
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:58,439
to feel relaxed and free in life.

2525
01:42:58,506 --> 01:43:02,743
This trip allowed me to feel emotions
that made me grateful all at once.

2526
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:06,514
It was so nice. The food was delicious.

2527
01:43:07,415 --> 01:43:09,483
I still feel happy thanks to it.

2528
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:11,018
EVERYTHING ON THIS TRIP WAS GOOD

2529
01:43:11,619 --> 01:43:12,987
One, two, three.

2530
01:43:13,054 --> 01:43:15,022
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

2531
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:19,794
Are You Sure?! was always sure.

2532
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,562
-It was always sure.
-Always.

2533
01:43:21,629 --> 01:43:26,333
I don't know
how the viewers will like this show,

2534
01:43:27,268 --> 01:43:32,540
but I just hope they enjoy watching it
without thinking much.

2535
01:43:32,606 --> 01:43:37,878
I hope watching this show can make them
feel happier, at least a little.

2536
01:43:37,945 --> 01:43:39,747
Traveling made me realize...

2537
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:45,086
this could be a purpose of life.

2538
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:49,924
It really helped me refresh myself
and take my mind off things.

2539
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:52,927
I thought it'd be nice

2540
01:43:54,161 --> 01:44:00,000
to make time to go on a trip
once in a while.

2541
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:01,836
I'd like the viewers

2542
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:06,207
to experience a trip that makes them happy
just as it made us happy.

2543
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:08,576
-Congrats on your discharge.
-You too.

2544
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:11,011
-You went through a lot.
-Congrats.

2545
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,313
CONGRATULATING THEMSELVES

2546
01:44:12,379 --> 01:44:15,583
Good work, and I had fun.

2547
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:17,885
Good work throughout the trip.

2548
01:44:17,952 --> 01:44:19,453
Let's go back to work now.

2549
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,021
Right, now...

2550
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:22,957
You're right. We should get ready.

2551
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:25,359
-I think I'm rewarded enough.
-Me too.

2552
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:28,295
I've been rewarded through this trip.

2553
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:29,663
Let's go back now!

2554
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:30,731
Let's go back.

2555
01:44:30,798 --> 01:44:32,366
To being a celebrity!

2556
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,101
To being a singer!

2557
01:44:34,168 --> 01:44:35,703
-Let's go back.
-Let's go back.

2558
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:37,304
Good work.

2559
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:39,140
-It was delightful.
-Right.

2560
01:44:39,206 --> 01:44:41,275
-Are You Sure?!
-Sure?!

2561
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,012
-Are You Sure?!
-Sure?!

2562
01:44:45,079 --> 01:44:46,080
What the?

2563
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:48,449
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

2564
01:44:49,517 --> 01:44:51,886
-All right, Jung Kook.
-Yes?

2565
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:53,921
Our next destination is the South Pole.

2566
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:57,491
Let's meet in the South Pole
for our next trip.

2567
01:44:58,259 --> 01:45:00,861
TWO DAYS AFTER FILMING

2568
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:03,164
JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK ARE REUNITED
AT JIN'S CONCERT

2569
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,166
-Didn't you come together?
-[Jimin] We did.

2570
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:07,001
THEY DID TRAVEL TOGETHER

2571
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:09,036
-You were together.
-It's been two days.

2572
01:45:09,103 --> 01:45:10,337
REUNITED AFTER TWO DAYS

2573
01:45:11,705 --> 01:45:13,240
My hair got a bit longer.

2574
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:14,508
GETTING HIS HAIR CHECKED

2575
01:45:14,575 --> 01:45:16,277
[man] It looked straight earlier.

2576
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:18,612
-I had a shoot.
-[Jimin] A penalty?

2577
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:21,081
No, it got longer. This hair...

2578
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,817
[Jimin] I... Yes, the Da Nang crew.

2579
01:45:23,684 --> 01:45:25,019
Is it the Korea special?

2580
01:45:25,085 --> 01:45:27,188
We texted each other yesterday.
"What's up?"

2581
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:29,056
"Why am I so bored back in Korea?"

2582
01:45:29,123 --> 01:45:31,025
[Jung Kook] "The LOL isn't fun."

2583
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:32,626
It feels like filming the show.
