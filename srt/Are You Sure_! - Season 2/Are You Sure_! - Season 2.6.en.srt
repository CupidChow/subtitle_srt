[♪ opening theme music playing]

2
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,628
PREVIOUSLY ON...

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,863
[Jimin] Apparently,
we drive this ourselves.

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,798
IN BRIENZ, THE MOVIE-LIKE VILLAGE,

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,700
THE TWO HAD A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE

6
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,068
It's really come.

7
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,204
FROM A THRILLING ENCOUNTER
WITH A SCARY SWAN

8
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,240
TO A REFRESHING DIVE FROM THE HOT TUG

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,379
IT'S MORE FUN BECAUSE THEY'RE TOGETHER

10
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,116
DIGGING IN SINCE IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE THEY HAD KOREAN FOOD

11
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,720
HAMBURGERS AFTER KOREAN FOOD

12
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,390
TIME FOR A NEW ACTIVITY NOW

13
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,958
-You ready?
-[in English] Ready.

14
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:01,328
-Three, two, one. Jump.
-Two, one.

15
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,765
JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF WITHOUT HESITATION

16
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,301
IT'S FUN

17
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,536
Whoa!

18
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,607
EACH DAY HAS BEEN FUN SO FAR.
WILL THEIR TRIP CONTINUE THIS WAY?

19
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:17,978
AFTER THE LAKE SWIMMING,
THEY'RE BACK AT THE LODGING

20
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,379
[in Korean] The ingredients.

21
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,681
They bought many.

22
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,250
How about we make a stew?

23
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,252
We'll go buy what you need.

24
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,421
-Ingredients for doenjang stew.
-Doenjang stew?

25
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,056
-Can we make it?
-Why don't I try

26
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,591
making doenjang stew? No?

27
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,658
-You want to?
-What?

28
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,728
-You want to?
-I'll get a recipe online and make some.

29
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,030
-No, you should cook rice.
-You're right.

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,132
I'll make both. You can rest up today.

31
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,467
-You sure?
-Yes.

32
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,802
THIS IS GREAT

33
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:42,869
[in English] Okay.

34
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,105
I'll do all the cooking
and let him relax today.

35
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,306
FULL OF CONFIDENCE

36
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,241
I finally get to repay you.

37
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,477
-[in Korean] I'd like a doenjang stew.
-Okay.

38
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,379
First for the stew, zucchini...

39
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,483
Zucchini, onion, garlic, minced garlic...

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,986
-I'll wash up first, bro.
-Okay.

41
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,287
JUNG KOOK IS OFF TO WASH UP

42
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,355
A pot rice recipe.

43
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,422
REVIEWING THE RECIPE

44
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,624
Pot rice.

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,692
It's important to use soaked rice.

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,694
SOAKING RICE RIGHT AWAY

47
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,297
PETIT

48
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,532
THIS IS TOO SMALL...

49
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,902
We only have this and...

50
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,438
There are only these two.

51
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,675
HE DOESN'T GIVE UP
UNTIL HE FINDS THE RIGHT ONE

52
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:25,045
HE FINDS THE SIZE HE WANTS

53
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,148
THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT

54
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,452
MEASURING RICE

55
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,854
SPILLING

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,590
HE'S NOT FLUSTERED...

57
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,658
One cup.

58
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,496
SPILLING AGAIN

59
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,032
HE'S QUITE EMBARRASSED

60
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:50,537
They said you shouldn't wash it too hard.

61
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,440
Gently, like this.

62
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,442
Throw the water out first.

63
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,844
GENTLY WASHING IT FOR THE SECOND TIME

64
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,513
Throw it out again.

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,816
WASHING THE RICE FOR THE THIRD TIME

66
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,017
IT'S DONE

67
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,454
The video I watched says
I need to wash it five times.

68
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,258
But my mother told me
to do it only three times. Not too much.

69
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,261
She said, "The rice won't taste good
if you wash it more."

70
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,130
WASHING THE RICE ONLY THREE TIMES
LIKE HIS MOM SAID

71
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,733
And I'll wash up for 30 minutes.

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,802
Okay, it's done.

73
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,204
HE'S OFF TO SHOWER
WHILE THE RICE SOAKS

74
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:28,308
WASHING UP FOR A WHILE

75
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,311
HE'S BACK ALL CLEAN

76
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,480
-All right.
-Jimin.

77
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,016
-What do you think, sir?
-Keep it on.

78
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,085
Onion, potato, zucchini, gochujang!

79
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,252
SHOUTING THE INGREDIENTS

80
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,320
Potato!

81
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,255
-Jung Kook.
-What?

82
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,890
Roll up my sleeves, please.

83
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,026
-One more time on this side.
-You feel unsure?

84
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,395
That's not it. Follow me.

85
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,664
[exhales sharply]

86
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,666
DANCING TO RELIEVE TENSION

87
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,368
-Out in five. A minute left.
-You didn't need my help.

88
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,436
What?

89
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,038
-You told me to stay out.
-Go in.

90
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,106
Okay.

91
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,674
JUNG KOOK LEAVES THE KITCHEN

92
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,776
GETTING READY TO REST

93
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,712
I'M COUNTING ON YOU

94
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,949
Here's the thing about cooking.

95
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,051
I don't know what to start with.

96
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,588
SUMMONING AN ONLINE TEACHER

97
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,125
SUPER FOCUSED...

98
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:23,029
HE BEGINS FOLLOWING THE STEPS

99
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,097
JIMIN'S POT RICE

100
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,200
1. PUT THE RICE WATER IN THE POT

101
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,203
CHECKING THE AMOUNT OF WATER

102
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,473
CHECKING THE VIDEO

103
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,975
There's one more thing I heard.

104
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,843
To this...

105
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,780
2. COVER THE POT WITH FOIL

106
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,848
METICULOUS

107
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:42,916
And then...

108
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,653
sprinkle some water on it.

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,157
3. SPRINKLE SOME WATER ON THE FOIL

110
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,492
4. COVER IT WITH FOIL AGAIN

111
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,593
Now...

112
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,728
Five minutes.

113
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,730
5. BOIL IT FOR FIVE MINUTES

114
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,834
HE DOESN'T FORGET TO PUT ON THE LID

115
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,870
MAKING POT RICE HAS BEGUN SMOOTHLY

116
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,606
Jung Kook usually does all the cooking,

117
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,242
so I'm planning
to keep him away from cooking this time.

118
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,544
All right.

119
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,080
THE MAIN INGREDIENTS FOR THE STEW

120
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,649
There are tofu and mushrooms.

121
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,285
Let the mushrooms wait for now.

122
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm not getting used to it.

123
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,022
HE FEELS AWKWARD IN THE KITCHEN

124
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,524
HE OBTAINS A CUTTING BOARD

125
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,126
This is a cutting board.

126
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,994
And then...

127
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,697
THE ALARM RINGS TO INFORM FIVE MINUTES

128
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,966
Okay, 15 minutes from now on.

129
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,301
Then, 2.5.

130
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,804
In the meantime,
let's cut some vegetables.

131
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,941
HE BEGINS CUTTING ONIONS

132
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,443
VERY SERIOUS

133
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,511
A zucchini.

134
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,815
Like this...

135
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,651
I don't know how to cut it.

136
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,954
CHECKING THE VIDEO

137
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,188
Cut it in half.

138
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,858
CUTTING IT ONCE

139
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,828
THEN, CHECKING THE VIDEO AGAIN

140
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,096
I see.

141
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,898
CUTTING IT AGAIN

142
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:08,301
HOW TO FOLLOW THE RECIPE BY THE BOOK

143
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,369
Cut it in half.

144
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,437
CHOPPING AN ONION

145
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,542
HE'S SLOW, BUT HE'S MAKING PROGRESS...

146
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,079
Into big pieces.

147
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,680
How do I cut a potato?

148
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,115
WATCHING THE VIDEO AGAIN

149
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,050
This must be how to chop a potato.

150
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,685
Then...

151
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,020
CHOPPING A POTATO COMPLETE

152
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,488
This is chopping, right?

153
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,090
I actually have no idea.

154
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,392
And they say it's better to add garlic.

155
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,927
So, let me use some.

156
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,196
HE BEGINS MINCING GARLIC

157
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,330
This...

158
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,901
HIS KNIFE SKILLS SHOWS
HIS CONFIDENCE AND EXPERIENCE

159
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:45,405
It's not minced, but I guess
I can say it's shredded.

160
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,507
Good. It's pretty much done.

161
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,876
-They didn't have Korean doenjang.
-What?

162
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,311
Then it might be different.

163
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,179
So it might be a bit sweeter.

164
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,849
Or I can make gochujang stew instead.

165
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,450
I'll change the dish right away.

166
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,519
HIS COOKING FLEXIBILITY
DESERVES A FULL SCORE

167
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,620
Okay.

168
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,390
LEARNING THE GOCHUJANG STEW RECIPE
WITHOUT GETTING FLUSTERED

169
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,058
I don't have chili pepper powder.

170
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,661
Since I don't need sugar,
I better add a bit of this.

171
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,330
Then... Hold on. Another five minutes.

172
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,266
I'll open it after four minutes.

173
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,168
Move to this side.

174
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,237
A FRYING PAN'S TURN

175
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,239
A bit of cooking oil.

176
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,674
Just one around of it.

177
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,110
HE GRILLS PORK BELLY FOR THE STEW

178
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,380
WATCHING THE GOCHUJANG STEW VIDEO AGAIN

179
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,249
Just enough to change colors.

180
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,018
IT'S TIME TO OPEN THE POT

181
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,086
[timer chiming]

182
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,354
Be quiet.

183
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,857
All right, the rice...

184
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,292
I wonder if it's done.

185
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,529
LET'S SEE...?

186
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,933
I don't think it's cooked at all.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,102
It seems okay, but it's not okay at all.

188
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,639
Hold on.
I can no longer pay attention to that.

189
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,908
In this case, let's close the lid.

190
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,142
Boil more over low heat.

191
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,545
The meat shouldn't be cooked too much.

192
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,448
Now, quickly...

193
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,615
ADDING MINCED GARLIC

194
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,718
Let's add this much of this.

195
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,020
Now, let's make it golden brown.

196
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,355
All right, dive in.

197
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,422
ADDING THE VEGGIES

198
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,258
STIR-FRYING THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER

199
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,260
THE KEY TO GOCHUJANG STEW IS GOCHUJANG

200
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,328
One.

201
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,663
Two.

202
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,731
Three.

203
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,265
Four.

204
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,167
ADDING ONE SPOONFUL OF DOENJANG

205
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,902
What am I cooking?

206
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,706
Boil hard now, punk. Water will be added.

207
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,477
But how do I add a liter of water?

208
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,213
Wait. Water is... Right.

209
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,582
What milliliter are you?

210
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,252
A bottle of water is
usually 500 mL, right?

211
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,755
Two bottles will do.

212
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,693
POURING 1 L OF WATER

213
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,162
JIMIN IS SMOOTHLY SAILING

214
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,199
NODDING

215
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,602
A LAUGH OF SOMEONE QUITE SATISFIED

216
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,037
The problem is the rice.

217
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,572
It's the key dish today.

218
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,807
It's legendary.

219
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,142
CHECKING THE POT RICE AGAIN

220
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,513
Is it just how this rice is?

221
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,015
Jung Kook. Should we just eat ramyeon?

222
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,484
The bottom side is awful.

223
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,787
What do I do? It's hopeless.

224
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,855
I don't think there's a way to save this.

225
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,424
Take some out.

226
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,060
THE ELDER STAFF MEMBER COMES TO RESCUE

227
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,127
Where's uncooked rice?

228
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,833
Gosh, it's...

229
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,402
MAKING IT ALL OVER AGAIN

230
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:34,507
It's different. Then, tofu...
Is it okay to put tofu in now?

231
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,476
Shouldn't it boil harder?

232
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,146
AT EASE

233
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,417
MEANWHILE, IT GETS DARK OUTSIDE

234
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,388
TAKES OFF OUT OF HUNGER

235
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,522
Jimin.

236
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,990
[Jimin] Stay inside.

237
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,992
Doenjang stew shouldn't take this long.

238
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,061
I changed the dish to gochujang stew.

239
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,263
It looks quite all right.

240
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,331
It looks a bit bland.

241
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,533
Go.

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,634
PUSHING HIM

243
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,103
-Jimin.
-What?

244
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,270
I applaud you

245
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,473
for your hard effort.

246
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:12,345
You know, moms can make a stew
in just 30 or 20 minutes.

247
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,413
Right.

248
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,082
I've been making this for 40 minutes.

249
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,417
It's taking that long?

250
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,186
I sure have no talent for cooking.

251
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,321
Can I have a taste?

252
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,556
THE EVALUATION TIME HAS FINALLY COME

253
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,225
NERVOUS

254
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,360
JUNG KOOK

255
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,129
HAS A TASTE!

256
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,331
IT'S ODDLY NERVE-RACKING

257
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,799
Did you only put gochujang?

258
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,268
-A bit of this.
-Okay.

259
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,003
-Like half a spoonful.
-I see.

260
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,106
-And four big spoonfuls of gochujang.
-Okay.

261
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,274
Some garlic.

262
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,642
What about pepper powder?

263
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,177
You want some in?

264
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,912
Maybe just a little.

265
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,814
ADDING PEPPER POWDER TO MEET HIS PALATE

266
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,816
PEPPER POWDER MARKS THE END OF STEW-MAKING

267
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,285
HOW IS IT GOING WITH THE POT RICE...?

268
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,853
Wait.

269
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,321
It looks okay.

270
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,959
IT'S COOKED WELL!

271
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,561
Let me get you some rice.

272
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,696
Okay. I can't wait.

273
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,998
JIMIN'S HEARTY STEW

274
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,332
AND POT RICE ARE READY

275
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,600
Jimin.

276
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,935
My first self-made dish.

277
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,237
Take a picture.

278
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,406
Let me.

279
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,974
-I...
-I should.

280
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,209
GETTING READY FOR PHOTOS

281
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,911
I'm sorry.

282
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,112
HIS FIRST SELF-MADE FOOD

283
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,547
It took too much time.

284
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,883
PASSIONATE

285
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,985
PASSIONATE TOO

286
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,988
JIMIN'S FIRST SELF-MADE KOREAN FOOD
IN SWITZERLAND

287
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,089
Should we try it?

288
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,058
-Okay.
-Let me move it closer.

289
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,529
Looks good.

290
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,798
Let me try the tofu first.

291
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,899
TAKING THE TOFU FIRST

292
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,837
IT'S HOT

293
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,773
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

294
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,641
NODDING SILENTLY

295
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,977
RELIEVED

296
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,045
It's good.

297
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,613
I'll enjoy.

298
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,747
JIMIN FINALLY CAN ENJOY

299
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,649
SLURPING TOGETHER

300
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
EVEN HIS BRAIN FEELS THE KOREAN TASTE

301
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,556
Should we add some more salt?

302
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,258
-Yes.
-Right?

303
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,493
We need salt. It's a bit bland.

304
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:14,234
ADDING SALT

305
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,868
-That should be enough.
-Right?

306
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,272
BE MORE DELICIOUS

307
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,009
THEY RESUME EATING WITH NEW INTENTIONS

308
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,248
-Let me have a taste.
-Maybe the fly wants to try your stew too.

309
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,484
THE FLY HEADS STRAIGHT TO THE STEW

310
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,620
It's approaching like that swan.

311
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,355
IT APPROACHED FAST AND SCARILY

312
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,422
TARGET

313
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,890
Wait. It's coming for real.

314
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,263
THE FLY IS HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE TARGET

315
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:50,303
HIS EYES ARE FIXED

316
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,939
ASIDE FROM THE FLY, IT'S TO DIE FOR

317
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,812
THE SALT MADE THE STEW PERFECT

318
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,381
IT'S DELICIOUS

319
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,484
THE BEST KIND OF FOOD IS
SOMEONE ELSE'S COOKING

320
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:09,155
HE LOVES HIS OWN COOKING

321
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,124
IT'S HOT

322
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,426
Is it good?

323
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,061
At least, the stew...

324
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,129
LAUGHING SILENTLY

325
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,998
I messed up the rice. I'm sorry.

326
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,268
I bought it this time.
Let's try drinking some.

327
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,973
DRINKING

328
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,844
IT QUENCHES THEIR THIRST!

329
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,546
REFRESHED

330
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,315
You like sweet things.

331
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,416
This is good.

332
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:37,950
It's coconut water.

333
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,420
[in English] "Original."

334
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,756
-"Made in Indonesia."
-It's refreshing.

335
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,225
We get to have a taste
of something from Indonesia.

336
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,431
Coconut water is
a good source of hydration.

337
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,168
HE LOVES IT

338
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,602
-Good?
-[in Korean] It's great.

339
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,339
-It's a bit...
-Do you feel a bit refreshed?

340
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,406
Yes, a bit.

341
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,975
It'll refresh us nonstop
if we have it after eating.

342
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,043
-Eat...
-Eat...

343
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,045
-...and drink.
-...and drink.

344
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,015
LET'S STOP AND GO BACK TO EATING!

345
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,149
But it's really good.

346
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,418
-Thanks.
-The potato is chopped so big.

347
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,887
A BITE OF THE UNUSUALLY BIG POTATO PIECE

348
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,522
Now, let me...

349
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,091
I like mixing this with rice.

350
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,359
It's delicious.

351
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,294
ONCE, TWICE,

352
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,729
THREE TIMES

353
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,830
FOUR TIMES

354
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,365
FIVE TIMES

355
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,867
MIXING THE RICE WITH ENOUGH STEW

356
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,736
STAFF: STOP

357
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,304
-Before you keep eating...
-Yes?

358
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,039
WHAT'S THAT IN HIS HANDS?

359
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,440
[director] Stir-fried kimchi.

360
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,743
A FOUR-SIDE-DISH TRAVEL KIT
FOR KOREAN FOOD LOVERS

361
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,212
FROM KIMCHI TO IRRESISTIBLE SIDE DISHES

362
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,714
Do we have to win them
or can we just have them?

363
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,384
PLUS ONE HOUR EACH

364
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,754
EMPTY LAUGHS FOR MINIMALISM...

365
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,555
I choose not to have them.

366
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,492
I actually...

367
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,963
But can we take some pork belly
to our destination tomorrow and...

368
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,399
NO, IT'S A HOTEL

369
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,500
We can't?

370
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,201
We need to have it now, then.

371
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,404
We can't bring it with us?

372
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,471
We can't.

373
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,040
Ah! Then let me grill some.

374
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,942
STANDING UP TOGETHER

375
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,212
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

376
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,448
To leave it behind is...

377
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,317
That's just not right.

378
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,586
-Right?
-Of course.

379
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,954
You won't do this bet?

380
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,257
Wait, we'll grill the meat now.

381
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,893
Let us think after that.

382
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,361
But that'll be three hours.

383
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,296
Two is bad already.

384
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,233
PORK BELLY COMES BEFORE MINIMALISM

385
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,568
[humming]

386
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,204
COATING THE POT WITH OIL

387
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,372
Thirty minutes?

388
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,908
HEATING THE POT

389
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,744
HERE COMES THE MEAT

390
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,480
CHEF JUNG KOOK'S TIP:
GRILL THE MEAT FROM THE SKIN

391
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,484
THE APPETIZING SOUND
OF GRILLING PORK BELLY

392
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,619
CHECKING

393
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,055
PRESSING HARD

394
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:02,228
WHEN THE SKIN IS COOKED,
GRILL EACH CHUNK SEPARATELY

395
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:07,033
CAREFULLY ADJUSTING THE HEAT

396
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,903
SALT

397
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,374
FLIPPING IT AT THE PERFECT TIMING

398
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,043
PERFECTLY GRILLED PORK BELLY

399
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,177
Thirty minutes?

400
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,480
MEANWHILE, JIMIN IS NEGOTIATING

401
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,849
[director] What do you want the most?

402
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,584
Kimchi? Right, Jung Kook?

403
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,952
-Kimchi?
-Yes.

404
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,653
-That sounds nice.
-Yes.

405
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,388
-You want kimchi the most?
-Yes.

406
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,625
DIGITAL MINIMALISM
+1 HOUR

407
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,794
[director] What do you want the least?

408
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,128
Stir-fried kimchi.

409
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,164
[director] One hour for stir-fried kimchi.

410
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,267
Gosh, how cruel.

411
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,970
Jung Kook, how's one hour for kimchi?

412
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,738
-That's not bad.
-Okay.

413
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,306
ADDING ONE MORE HOUR FOR KIMCHI

414
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,708
Gosh, three hours?

415
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,776
It's like the military.

416
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,312
ONE HOUR ADDED TO DIGITAL MINIMALISM

417
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,648
THE PORK BELLY IS GRILLED GOLDEN BROWN

418
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,619
QUICKLY HAVING A PIECE

419
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,686
This is it.

420
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,089
Pork belly with gochujang stew.

421
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,924
Right?

422
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,695
This is how a meal should be.

423
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,231
THE BEST FOOD COMBINATION FOR JUNG KOOK

424
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,901
HAVING A SPOONFUL OF RICE FIRST

425
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,103
AND ONE MORE

426
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,239
The stew was missing meat,
and the pork belly makes up for it.

427
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,708
THEN THE PORK BELLY

428
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,043
Is this plain kimchi?

429
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,811
Not stir-fried?

430
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,079
It's a bit aged.

431
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,348
HOW'S THE KIMCHI THEY GOT
IN RETURN FOR ONE HOUR?

432
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,584
FANTASTIC

433
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,652
Jung Kook.

434
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,120
YOU'RE WONDERFUL, BRO

435
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,655
It's nice to have pork belly.

436
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,822
FULL RESPECT

437
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,725
-What?
-This grilled pork belly is good.

438
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,260
The stew is good too.

439
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,065
It's thanks to this stew...

440
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,569
that the pork belly tastes better.

441
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,374
Mmm.

442
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,710
Good job.

443
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,412
GOOD JOB, BRO

444
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,352
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THEM
HAS MADE THEIR DINNER MORE SATISFYING

445
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,954
What?

446
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,423
I'm so full.

447
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,625
Can you eat more?

448
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,061
Yes. I like gochujang stew.

449
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,600
WITH THE STEW MADE BY JIMIN

450
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,136
We're going to smell pork tonight.

451
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,873
JUNG KOOK CONTINUED
TO ENJOY HIS HAPPY DINNER

452
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:34,880
AFTER THE HAPY DINNERTIME

453
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,784
[Jimin] Okay, I see a stopwatch.

454
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,987
-[Jung Kook] A game?
-[director] Yes.

455
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,489
I did a brief check before coming.

456
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,791
-I see.
-That camera is filming

457
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,727
a stopwatch set up there.

458
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,196
And they connected our earphones
by Bluetooth.

459
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,499
We might have to listen to something
and guess in a given time.

460
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,369
MY NAME IS JIMIN, A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

461
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,903
But it's meaningless to know.

462
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,942
[director] Tomorrow morning,
we're going to

463
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,479
take a train to Zürich.

464
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,047
Zürich.

465
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,083
[director] Once we get there,
you'll be given

466
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,486
some free time to relax downtown.

467
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,588
And to enjoy your free time,

468
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,324
you'll need an allowance
for your expenses.

469
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,859
-Right.
-In that sense,

470
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,862
we're going to give you 150 francs.

471
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,397
That's a lot.

472
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,165
TIME TO OBTAIN ALLOWANCE AGAIN

473
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,933
A MAXIMUM OF 150 FRANCS

474
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,202
FIRST GAME: 50 FRANCS
SECOND GAME: 100 FRANCS

475
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,138
All right, then. Again...

476
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,507
THE GAME BOX IS HERE TOO

477
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,379
WHAT KIND OF GAME

478
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,348
DO WE HAVE TO PLAY...?

479
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,749
SLEEP MASKS

480
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,184
-[Jung Kook] Sleep masks?
-Yes.

481
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,686
ROUND 1 OVER 50 FRANCS

482
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,220
BLIND TASTING

483
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,856
PRACTICE GAME: DATE

484
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,960
THEIR EYES ARE
TO BE COVERED WITH SLEEP MASKS

485
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,629
FLOUNDERING

486
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,930
There's nothing here.

487
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,031
Oh, here it is.

488
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,600
There's one.

489
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,135
THEY MUST USE THEIR SENSES

490
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,503
OF TOUCH, SMELL...

491
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,105
I don't smell anything.

492
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,675
...AND TASTE

493
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,177
It's a date.

494
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,779
TO GUESS WHAT KIND OF FOOD IT IS

495
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,081
[director] The answer is...

496
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,917
date.

497
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:18,984
ROUND 1
4 QUESTIONS

498
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,187
THEY'LL BE GIVEN 50 FRANCS
IF THEY GET 3 RIGHT

499
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,422
JIMIN IS UP FIRST

500
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,624
-It's hard.
-It is.

501
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,992
[director] It's a go, right?

502
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,061
-Go!
-All right, bring it over.

503
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,600
I'd like to touch it.

504
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,668
Please put it

505
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,903
on my hands.

506
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,740
HE'S READY TO TOUCH IT

507
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,907
COME ON

508
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,846
Oh, gosh.

509
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,981
It's a potato chip.

510
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,683
THE FIRST QUESTION IS TOO EASY

511
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,320
[director] Guess which flavor it is
this time.

512
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,421
Which flavor?

513
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,490
It's obviously potato chips.

514
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,824
THE FLAVOR IS IMPORTANT

515
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,695
USING THE SENSE OF SMELL

516
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,730
AND THE SENSE OF TASTE

517
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,198
TASTING

518
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,203
THIS FLAVOR IS...

519
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,573
We've had it many times, Jung Kook.

520
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,575
JUNG KOOK TRIES ONE TOO

521
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,379
WHICH FLAVOR WAS IT...

522
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,548
I have to guess its flavor right?

523
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,683
Is it good?

524
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,619
Oh.

525
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,853
HE GETS IT

526
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,688
What's your guess? One, two, three.

527
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,290
Honey butter.

528
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,391
Incorrect.

529
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,926
What's wrong with your palate?

530
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,696
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

531
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,265
Which flavor is it?

532
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,667
It's obviously pepper-flavored.

533
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,969
THE ANSWER IS PAPRIKA

534
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,238
You can taste paprika from this?

535
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,474
It's pepper-like. It is.

536
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,776
This can't be honey butter.

537
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,781
GO AWAY

538
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,684
THUMBS UP

539
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,486
[director speaking indistinctly]

540
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,989
Wait. I better not mess up
after doing this.

541
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,025
IT'S JUNG KOOK'S TURN NOW

542
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,494
Let's see what your palate can do.

543
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,895
-Are you ready?
-Wait.

544
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,298
Can I have a sip of water before I go?

545
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,933
-Water?
-Yes.

546
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,100
Honey butter?

547
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,770
HERE COMES WATER

548
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,871
Thanks.

549
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,340
RINSING HIS MOUTH WITH WATER
BEFORE TASTING

550
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:24,777
I SHOULD'VE DONE THE SAME...

551
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,646
Hey, you should've told me
to drink water first too.

552
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,683
I said honey butter
because I had that sweet date.

553
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,685
It wasn't my fault. My palate was precise.

554
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,055
Saltiness is supposed to taste stronger
after having something sweet.

555
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,624
I had them together.
Some was left in my mouth.

556
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,760
THE HARMONY OF SWEET AND SALTY
RESULTED IN HONEY BUTTER...

557
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,229
Okay, here comes the food.

558
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,597
[yells]

559
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,298
NERVOUS FOR NOTHING

560
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,933
THE FOOD IS BROUGHT OVER

561
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,470
SNORTING

562
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,538
What is it?

563
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,574
-Is this it?
-Yes.

564
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:59,211
SHAKING AND NERVOUS

565
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,480
FUMBLING

566
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,716
-It's very long.
-[Jimin chuckling]

567
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:04,783
It's long.

568
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,486
I don't like how it looks.

569
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,725
THE SECOND FOOD GOT CRITICIZED
FOR ITS LOOKS...

570
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,893
What is this?

571
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,364
HE'S JUST HAPPY

572
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,733
TRYING TO SMELL IT CALMLY

573
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,268
Isn't it a smoking pipe?

574
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,070
[director] It's okay to taste it,

575
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,839
but don't swallow it.

576
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,940
What?

577
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,311
First of all, this part feels challenging.

578
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,582
A DANGEROUS PART

579
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,650
I'll try the middle.

580
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,086
CRUNCHY - VERY CRUNCHY - BITING...

581
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,591
This tastes like ginger.

582
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,026
This tastes like ginger.

583
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,528
Oh, it's not what I thought?

584
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,597
SMELLING

585
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,998
I thought it was leek.

586
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,304
TASTING - DISGUSTED

587
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,371
WHAT IS THIS...

588
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:03,042
HIS EYES, NOSE AND LIPS
CAN'T HIDE THE TRUTH

589
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,176
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT

590
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,244
SMELLING

591
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,345
It's ginger.

592
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,047
Is it not?

593
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,115
It smells like it.

594
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,051
No?

595
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,119
-[groans]
-Don't swallow it?

596
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:19,224
ONCE AGAIN CAREFULLY

597
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,726
SHIVERING

598
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,096
HE TRIES IT AGAIN

599
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,864
DISGUSTED

600
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,968
HE CAN NEVER GET USED TO THE TASTE

601
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,003
It doesn't look like ginger.

602
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,471
This can't be ginger.

603
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,907
It's long, but it's not a mic.
What is this?

604
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,875
HE'S CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT IT IS

605
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,943
We...

606
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,878
I don't know what it is, either.

607
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,013
I can't help him.

608
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,514
What is this?

609
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,718
I have no idea even with my eyes open.

610
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:49,088
It seems like a food ingredient
I've never seen,

611
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,424
touched or smelled it before. A vegetable.

612
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,961
The way I see it, it's something
that's used instead of ginger.

613
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,029
Do you want a hint?

614
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,632
Yes, I need a hint. I've never seen...
I mean, used this before.

615
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,034
It's five syllables.

616
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,537
Countries that mainly use
this ingredient...

617
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,272
-Yes.
-...have warm climates.

618
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,209
I'm sure you've had it before,

619
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,612
but it's an ingredient
in a very famous kind of soup.

620
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,149
DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

621
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,317
Thailand? Which country?

622
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,552
-It must be tom yum goong.
-The Philippines?

623
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,088
-How am I supposed to know?
-Exactly, my point.

624
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,491
Five syllables? Can't I get a letter hint?

625
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,793
[director] I'll tell you the first letter.

626
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,861
L.

627
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,829
-L?
-L.

628
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,767
L... Lemon.

629
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,868
No.

630
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,604
Do you know any food
that starts with an L?

631
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,671
What?

632
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:41,907
What are you doing?

633
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,810
That's an original form of it.

634
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,746
WHAT ARE YOU DOING...?

635
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,382
Do you know any food
that starts with an L?

636
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,517
What?

637
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,554
Do you know any food
that starts with an L?

638
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,655
What?

639
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,691
-What are you doing?
-Water's gone.

640
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,193
WATER!

641
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,895
LAUGHING

642
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,296
I WANT SOME WATER

643
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,464
Here you go.

644
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,965
HERE'S WATER FOR YOU

645
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,033
You kept...

646
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,102
I thought you were getting the smell out.

647
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,438
"Water's gone." [laughing]

648
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,376
-I really have no idea.
-Just give up.

649
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,912
What is this? I have no idea.

650
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,713
All right. What is your guess?

651
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,015
One, two, three.

652
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,283
I give up.

653
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,684
[director] Lemongrass.

654
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,454
THEY ALREADY FAILED TO GUESS TWO RIGHT

655
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,621
Is it over?

656
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,657
[director] The 50 francs
is out the window.

657
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,092
FEELING BAD ABOUT LEMONGRASS

658
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,096
Then if you guess the remaining two right,
we will give you...

659
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,263
-Then, 50.
-Yes, 50.

660
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,199
A CHANGE IN THE RULES

661
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,266
Bring it over.

662
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,572
THE THIRD QUESTION IS BROUGHT OVER
FOR JIMIN

663
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,241
FUMBLING

664
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,577
Wait. Is it edible?

665
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,346
Hey, this is...

666
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,282
Isn't this a cap or something?

667
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,520
Are you sure it's something to eat?

668
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,223
YES, IT'S EDIBLE

669
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,427
Wait, it's melting. It must be chocolate.

670
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,263
RELIEVED TO KNOW IT'S CHOCOLATE

671
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,364
It's chocolate.

672
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,169
HE HAS TO GUESS ITS NAME RIGHT

673
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:18,937
Gosh.

674
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,542
FALLING

675
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,978
HIS EYES OPEN WIDE

676
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,681
Is it really edible?

677
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,519
ARE YOU SURE...?

678
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,655
Mmm!

679
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,824
CHOKING

680
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,659
How did they make this?

681
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,098
It's a four-syllable chocolate.

682
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,900
A four-syllable chocolate?

683
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,437
HE'S CURIOUS...

684
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,540
Jung Kook.

685
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,211
HE GETS IT!

686
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,782
HE FIGURES IT OUT AND FIDGETS

687
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,584
IT'S THAT THING!

688
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,987
GIVE HIM THE ANSWER ALREADY!

689
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,689
[all laughing]

690
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,457
A four-syllable chocolate?

691
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,327
YES, THAT

692
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,199
HE TASTES IT AGAIN AND BECOMES EVEN SURER

693
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,500
I have no idea.

694
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,901
It just tastes like liquor.

695
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,736
YES, THAT LIQUOR

696
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,542
DO YOU GET IT NOW...?

697
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,177
I have no idea.

698
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,279
Jung Kook, give him just one hint.

699
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,148
-Just one.
-A hint?

700
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,382
What should I give?

701
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,351
Its liquor bottle...

702
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,354
is rectangular.

703
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:43,989
A RECTANGULAR BOTTLE...

704
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,891
-Go right away.
-It's not vodka.

705
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,492
One, two, three.

706
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,562
-Failure.
-What is it?

707
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,097
Jung Kook, you say the answer.

708
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,432
Jack Daniel's chocolate.

709
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,600
Correct.

710
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,901
How am I supposed to know?

711
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,203
Its bottle is always rectangular.

712
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,472
Just this tastes like Jack Daniel's.

713
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,540
Try it.

714
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,542
It's Jack Daniel's for sure.

715
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:05,877
Now, it does.

716
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,114
All right, 50 francs...

717
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,850
THE 50 FRANCS IS OUT THE WINDOW AGAIN

718
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,287
I should've done it.

719
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:19,091
[director] Then, Jung Kook.
If you get this last question right,

720
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,026
we'll give you the money.

721
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,194
Thank you.

722
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,163
THEIR LAST HOPE IS READY

723
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,299
-Go!
-[director] Bring it over, please.

724
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,567
It's a tough one.

725
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,035
Why do I only get tough ones?

726
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,738
THE LAST QUESTION SHOWS UP

727
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,353
Where is it?

728
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,022
LAUGHING

729
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,257
Are you holding...

730
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:56,628
IT'S SO FUN TO TEASE HIM

731
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,497
HE BEGINS EXPLORING IT

732
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,299
Is this another chocolate?

733
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,767
It is. They cracked it here.

734
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,171
HAVING A BITE RIGHT AWAY

735
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,440
[director] For this one,

736
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,711
you just need to guess which flavor it is.

737
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:13,912
Cacao?

738
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,416
Isn't it just cacao chocolate?
Just black... Wait.

739
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:21,553
It's like...

740
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,189
TASTING IT WITH THE END OF HIS TONGUE

741
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,091
Gosh, I was going to ask for a bite.

742
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,294
Here.

743
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,534
TASTING IT TOGETHER AT ONCE

744
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,703
It tastes very familiar.

745
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,506
How am I supposed to guess
which flavor it is?

746
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,308
It tastes very familiar.

747
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,643
It's delicious.

748
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,146
I know I've had it before.

749
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,283
But I've never checked the flavor.

750
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,085
CHILI

751
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,762
CHILI

752
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:11,303
A LONELY FIGHT TO FIND THE ANSWER

753
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,671
Come on. How am I...

754
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,609
Swallow as you taste it carefully

755
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,044
at the end of a bite.

756
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,047
Can I feel it, then?

757
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,582
Yes, you can feel it.

758
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,016
You do because you know.

759
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,085
[director chuckles]

760
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,656
Now that I know, let me taste it.

761
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,927
-Have a taste and give him a hint.
-Okay.

762
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:36,995
Got it.

763
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,030
What is it?

764
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,098
Thank you.

765
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,905
SAVORING

766
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,942
I can take off the sleep mask, right?

767
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,878
[director] Okay.

768
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,613
Are you sure you can taste it?

769
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,351
Hold on. I think I know.

770
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,587
The purple-colored fruit.

771
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,824
The purple-colored fruit. No?

772
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,025
THAT'S NOT IT

773
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,527
-Jung Kook.
-What?

774
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,962
That's not it.

775
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,464
I heard the answer.

776
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,099
-You did?
-Yes.

777
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,234
It's not fruit?

778
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,705
I often order this flavor of sauce
at hamburger places.

779
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,708
Ketchup?

780
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,244
KETCHUP CHOCOLATE...?

781
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,680
-Where's the chocolate? Let me.
-I usually...

782
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:30,816
It's spicy.

783
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,321
SPICY...?

784
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,689
What's your guess?

785
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,591
Red pepper? Pepper? What is it?

786
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,394
You're almost there.

787
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,462
Don't be tensed up.

788
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,765
Is it spicy?

789
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,267
Don't be nervous. You're almost there.

790
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,735
Chili?

791
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,371
-What's your guess?
-Chili?

792
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,439
Correct.

793
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,674
How can this be chili?

794
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,409
You've earned 50 francs.

795
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,344
That's almost for free.

796
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,412
I know.

797
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,448
THEY BARELY OBTAINED 50 FRANCS

798
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,251
Please move on to the next game.

799
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,286
-[director] Let's move on right away.
-Okay.

800
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,356
The next game is Silent Scream.

801
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,191
-Oh, Silent Scream.
-[director] Yes.

802
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,061
[director] Guess five questions right
in two minutes.

803
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,130
You can pass one question. Okay?

804
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,033
If you win this game,
you'll get 100 francs.

805
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,437
All right. Play the music.

806
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,741
MUSIC IS ON

807
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,815
Can you hear me?

808
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,016
I can't hear anything.

809
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:43,121
WHEN THE MUSIC BEGINS,
I EXIST ALONE WITH THE SONG...

810
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,625
JIMIN POSSESSED BY J-HOPE

811
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,727
WHEN THE MUSIC IS OFF...

812
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,061
[director] Jimin.

813
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,263
Jimin.

814
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,497
JIMIN WOULDN'T ANSWER...

815
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,665
-Let's go.
-Okay.

816
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,000
It's starting.

817
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,169
[director] Now, begin.

818
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,205
FIRST: CANYON SWING

819
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,506
-Ca...
-"Yes."

820
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,974
IT'S DIFFICULT FROM THE START

821
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,042
Hurry up.

822
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,810
-Ca.
-"Le."

823
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,113
-Ca.
-"Gae."

824
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,148
-Ca.
-What?

825
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,584
Ca.

826
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,652
"Je."

827
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,120
JUMP

828
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,088
-Ca. No.
-"Dae"?

829
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,957
Ca... Ca.

830
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,892
GOING CRAZY

831
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,894
I have no idea.

832
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,863
REPEATING THE FIRST SYLLABLE

833
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,798
-Ca.
-"Dae"? "Jae"?

834
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,333
-Ca.
-"Ye."

835
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,601
"Gye." "Bae."

836
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,703
STILL AT THE FIRST SYLLABLE

837
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,039
-Nyon.
-"Ga-deot"?

838
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,440
-Nyon.
-"Nut."

839
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,508
Nyon.

840
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,510
-"Deot."
-Nyon.

841
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,279
HIS MOUTH IS CONFUSED

842
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,148
Canyon. Nyon.

843
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,317
What are you saying?

844
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,419
-Nyon.
-"Deot."

845
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,554
-Nyon.
-"Nut."

846
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,056
Nyon.

847
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,223
-"Neon"?
-Yes!

848
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,291
"Gae-neon."

849
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,859
-S.
-"Ji."

850
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,061
OH, MY HEAD

851
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,529
S.

852
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,663
"Chi."

853
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,265
S.

854
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,399
S!

855
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,635
-"Geu."
-Pass. I'll just pass this one.

856
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,836
SECOND: HOPPING TOUR

857
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,972
Hop. Hop.

858
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,240
-"Oho."
-Hop.

859
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,810
DECALCOMANIA

860
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,511
Hop.

861
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,946
"Oh." "Go"?

862
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,548
-Hop.
-"Hop"?

863
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,750
-Ping.
-"Pi."

864
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,785
-"Ping."
-"Hobby"?

865
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,921
WHAT, ME?

866
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,889
-Hopping.
-"Hobbit"?

867
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,291
-Ping.
-"Me."

868
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,359
THRILLED

869
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,426
Ping.

870
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,494
"Hopping"!

871
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,229
-To.
-"To."

872
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,430
-To.
-"To."

873
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,498
Ur.

874
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,966
-"Hopping tour"?
-Yes.

875
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,334
What's that?

876
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,602
Lagibolala.

877
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,870
"Lagibolala"!

878
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:40,939
Are you sure?

879
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,307
-"Are you sure?"
-Right.

880
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,441
-"Are you sure?"
-Right.

881
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,110
BUT TIME IS OVER

882
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,245
Gosh, canyon in the beginning.

883
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,515
FAIL OR NOT, HE'S JUST EXCITED

884
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,684
-I should've just passed it.
-What?

885
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,120
It was "canyon swing" at first.

886
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,655
Oh, canyon swing.

887
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,723
The others were all easy.

888
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,091
I know. What a shame.

889
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,128
THEY FAILED ROUND ONE

890
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:07,699
MUSIC IS ON

891
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,902
BRING THE MOOD UP WITH J-HOPE'S SONG

892
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,837
-j-hope.
-j-hope.

893
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,005
Go!

894
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,810
ROUND TWO BEGINS

895
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,478
-Pool.
-"Poong."

896
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,746
Pool villa.

897
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,814
-Pool villa.
-Good.

898
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,883
I better say a whole word.

899
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,351
-Hawaiian.
-Hawaiian.

900
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,786
-Grubby.
-City?

901
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,421
Grubby.

902
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,123
Hawaiian Grubby.

903
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,625
FOCUSED

904
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,926
G.

905
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:35,994
"T."

906
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,696
-"D."
-G!

907
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,763
"Tong."

908
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,331
-G. No.
-"Hong."

909
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,399
G.

910
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,834
FRUSTRATED

911
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:43,902
"Kong"?

912
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,003
G.

913
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,204
"Kyo."

914
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:47,272
Ru.

915
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,107
-"Ji."
-Ru.

916
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,376
-Hawaiian...
-Grubby.

917
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,711
Hawaiian Grubby.

918
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,279
Hawaiian Toji...

919
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,447
-Grubby.
-"Groovy"?

920
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,515
-Close.
-"Hawaiian Tojigi."

921
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,018
Hawaiian Grubby.

922
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,086
"Hyojigi"?

923
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,387
GOING CRAZY

924
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,455
IT'S ABOUT YOU!

925
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,522
Hawaiian Grubby!

926
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,757
"Hawaiian chase"!

927
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,525
WHAT CHASE IN HAWAII...?

928
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,194
-Hawaiian...
-Pass it if it's hard.

929
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,895
Hawaiian Grubby!

930
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,130
-What is it?
-Pass.

931
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,198
THIRD: COCONUT WATER

932
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,365
Coconut.

933
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,433
"Coconut."

934
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,735
-Water.
-"Water."

935
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,470
FOURTH: ZERMATT

936
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,872
Zermatt.

937
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,874
-"Zermatt"?
-Yes.

938
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,843
FIFTH: DOENJANG STEW

939
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,044
Doenjang stew.

940
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:27,746
"Origin."

941
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,347
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

942
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,415
What?

943
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:31,483
-Doen.
-"Doen."

944
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,384
-Jang stew.
-"Doenjang stew."

945
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,452
Carbonara.

946
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,987
"Carbonara."

947
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,989
-Success.
-Success!

948
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,657
WE MADE IT!

949
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,227
What is it? Hawaiian what?

950
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,328
Grubby.

951
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,029
"Hawaiian Grubby"!

952
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,931
But well done. You're good.

953
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,166
WE DID WELL

954
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,168
"Hawaiian Grubby."

955
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:54,472
All right. You obtained the allowances
from both games today.

956
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,274
THEY WON BOTH GAMES

957
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,942
How generous.

958
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,310
Thank you!

959
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,379
THE ALLOWANCE OF 150 FRANCS

960
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,415
THEY OBTAINED 150 FRANCS!

961
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,318
[director] It's 12:30 a.m. now.

962
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:12,457
You have three hours
of digital minimalism.

963
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,525
Right.

964
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,728
JEEZ, THAT DIGITAL MINIMALISM...

965
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,530
[director] Do you want a taste of it?

966
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,666
We'll do as you say.

967
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,401
-[Jung Kook] Right.
-Good.

968
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,237
[director] Then please put them in.

969
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,740
A TASTE OF DIGITAL MINIMALISM BEGINS

970
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,208
No!

971
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,745
THE DIGITAL LOCKUP SHOWS UP

972
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,413
How many hours for a taste?

973
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,349
-Let's do it for one hour.
-Okay.

974
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,684
-One hour?
-Yes.

975
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,619
I'll bring it over.

976
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,288
HE'S OFF TO GET HIS PHONE

977
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,691
This little thing actually unlocks.

978
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,393
FASCINATED BY THE TINY LOCK

979
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,494
Bye.

980
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,263
JUNG KOOK'S PHONE IS LOCKED UP FIRST

981
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,331
Goodbye.

982
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,066
Okay, one hour.

983
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,701
JIMIN'S PHONE IS ARRESTED TOO...

984
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,537
BOTH THEIR PHONES ARE CONFINED

985
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,506
Bye. Take care.

986
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:04,142
SEE YOU IN AN HOUR...

987
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,811
I better shower again...
Want to step outside?

988
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,046
What?

989
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,113
No.

990
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,951
[director] All right, then.

991
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,987
IT'S TOUGH ALREADY...

992
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,623
-Good job on today's games.
-Good work.

993
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,658
THE ALLOWANCE GOES BEHIND BARS TOO

994
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,060
If it doesn't unlock,

995
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,795
-we won't get the money back.
-Right.

996
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,898
-[Jimin] Good work.
-[Jung Kook singing]

997
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,200
[Jimin] It ended too late today. Sorry.

998
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,504
THE DIGITAL MINIMALISM STARTS

999
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:38,910
THE TWO SUDDENLY FEEL A VOID

1000
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,078
Should we lie down?

1001
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,280
I will.

1002
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:48,052
HOW TO COPE WITH DIGITAL MINIMALISM
1. JUST LIE DOWN

1003
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,921
We might end up falling asleep.

1004
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:56,628
YOU'RE RIGHT

1005
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:01,299
THE STAFF SOUND LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN

1006
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,035
OPENING HIS EYES

1007
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,371
GETTING UP TOGETHER

1008
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,506
HAVING FUN WITHOUT US?

1009
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,574
What's going on?

1010
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,109
WE CAN NEVER TOLERATE IT

1011
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:14,545
DASHING TO THE LIVING ROOM

1012
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:19,851
HOW TO COPE WITH DIGITAL MINIMALISM
2. WATCH VIDEOS WITH THE STAFF

1013
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,355
It's hilarious when he gets scared
and steps back.

1014
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,494
I'm not joking. I was dead scared today.

1015
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,696
It wants your autograph.

1016
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,897
What's your name?

1017
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,666
What's your name?

1018
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,434
[all laughing]

1019
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,075
It's funny how you're hovering around.

1020
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,444
3. HOVER AROUND FOR NOTHING

1021
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,681
HOVERING AROUND

1022
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,482
Word chain.

1023
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,351
4. A SUDDEN WORD CHAIN GAME

1024
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,819
Swiss.

1025
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,187
Sriracha.

1026
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,659
Vehicle.

1027
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,594
Brewery.

1028
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,497
Jangjorim.

1029
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,765
Im Kkeokjeong.

1030
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,801
Stamina.

1031
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,972
DO IT IF YOU CAN
FULL OF CONFIDENCE

1032
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,039
Counterattack.

1033
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,107
UNEXPECTEDLY INTENSE

1034
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,175
Study.

1035
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:18,710
Farewell.

1036
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,844
Villa.

1037
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,779
-Tension.
-Reversal.

1038
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,114
Electricity.

1039
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,183
Putting in someone's shoes.

1040
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,250
Intelligence.

1041
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,485
Indeed.

1042
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,820
Eyesight.

1043
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,555
Weightlifting.

1044
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,622
Superpower.

1045
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,690
HE'S PERSISTENT

1046
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,027
THE CHAIN OF "RYEOK" DOESN'T END

1047
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,699
JUNG KOOK...

1048
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,434
Find what can't end with "ryeok."

1049
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,904
-Ten.
-I can't think of any.

1050
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,840
I better make him run out.

1051
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,341
Weight.

1052
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,409
Vitality.

1053
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,412
This is annoying.

1054
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,314
I should've done it.

1055
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,318
-Are you giving up?
-No.

1056
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,186
CONFIDENT

1057
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,322
LET'S SEE...

1058
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,823
-Did I do weightlifting?
-Yes.

1059
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,992
-Weight too.
-Yes.

1060
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,828
I did superpower, vitality, and tension.
All those words.

1061
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,197
Well...

1062
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,265
Rage.

1063
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,566
Oh!

1064
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,235
The first one I did was stamina.

1065
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,302
Right.

1066
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,871
Organize.

1067
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,808
-Emergency.
-Standing army.

1068
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,710
Military power.

1069
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:30,281
JUNG KOOK FINALLY COUNTERATTACKS

1070
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,183
A lot of Korean words end with "ryeok."

1071
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,251
Right.

1072
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,253
I think we ran out.

1073
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,990
CONFIDENT AND PROUD

1074
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,091
It's your turn.

1075
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,027
I can hardly think of any.

1076
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:45,930
Yeoksam Station!

1077
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:52,503
IT SOUNDS THE SAME BACKWARDS IN KOREAN

1078
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,138
You rather counterattacked me.

1079
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,509
IT WASN'T EASY FOR HIM TO SWITCH TURNS...

1080
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,811
Yeoksam Station.

1081
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,746
HE'S THRILLED THE MORE HE THINKS ABOUT IT

1082
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,347
Yeoksam Station.

1083
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,418
Yeoksam Station. What a counterattack.

1084
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:08,653
Well...

1085
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,821
HIS FEET SHOW HIS AGONY

1086
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,290
[Jimin] He's in a daze
after taking that blow.

1087
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,357
DAZED...

1088
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:22,066
HE'S STARTING TO FEEL SLEEPY

1089
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,069
I'm so sleepy. I could just go to bed,

1090
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,772
but I'm eager to take my phone with me.

1091
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,909
THIS MAN IS TRAPPED
IN THE WORD CHAIN OF RYEOK...

1092
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,445
Obvious.

1093
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:36,981
Obvious is a counterattack
of Yeoksam Station.

1094
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,184
LOOK AT THIS PUNK!

1095
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,385
Fortune-telling.

1096
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,421
DEFENDING CALMLY

1097
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,522
Fortune-telling?

1098
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,658
NO WAY...?

1099
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,561
-You want to end this game with "ryeok"?
-No, nothing left.

1100
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,063
Drunkard.

1101
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,364
Exaggeration.

1102
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,599
Iridium.

1103
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,701
GAME IS OVER

1104
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,402
There's one more other than that.

1105
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,770
Dium-dium.

1106
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,939
CRAZY CHEMISTRY

1107
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,208
FINDING ANOTHER PRANK

1108
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,512
HOW TO COPE WITH DIGITAL MINIMALISM
5. FILMING

1109
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,283
[Jung Kook humming]

1110
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:18,022
DIRECTOR JEON'S FLASHY CAMERA MOVING

1111
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,925
IRRESISTIBLE "KILLIN' IT GIRL"

1112
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:39,377
HE'S MOVING SWIFTLY
TO CAPTURE JIMIN'S DANCE

1113
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,753
AN ENDING POSE

1114
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,423
IT'S ALREADY A MINUTE BEFORE THE END

1115
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,824
I'm going to wait here.

1116
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:02,733
STANDING BY RIGHT BEFORE THE LOCKUP

1117
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,106
RUBBING HIS EYES, FEELING SLEEPY

1118
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:13,544
BUT HE'S RESOLUTE

1119
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,780
It feels longer than a minute of exercise.

1120
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,482
A minute of doing cardio.

1121
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:23,187
SPENDING THE LONGEST MINUTE
IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE

1122
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,790
HIS HAND APPROACHES IN ADVANCE

1123
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,061
[alarm ringing]

1124
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:33,864
IT'S FINALLY OVER

1125
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,199
Where's the key?

1126
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,102
Where's the key?

1127
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:39,203
It's over.

1128
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,539
Digital minimalism.

1129
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,208
Success!

1130
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,280
JIMIN CAME RUNNING AT THE NEWS

1131
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,389
THE DOOR OPENS...

1132
00:45:58,456 --> 00:45:59,757
IMPATIENTLY TAKING HIS PHONE

1133
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,360
It really feels like the military.

1134
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,129
HE LOOKS MORE RELAXED THAN AN HOUR AGO

1135
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,197
It's me.

1136
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,233
I talk stupid nonsense sometimes.

1137
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,769
That cell phones must be gotten rid of.

1138
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:13,070
I take it back.

1139
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:22,446
RETURNING HAPPILY WITH THEIR PHONES

1140
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,514
Lie down right away.

1141
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,751
Lights off.

1142
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,455
[speaking indistinctly]

1143
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,228
WORRIED

1144
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,396
I don't know.

1145
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,932
I can't stand the heat.

1146
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,969
ADJUSTING THE CURTAINS TO A WINDOW GAP

1147
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,638
Let's keep it open.

1148
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,775
Is my phone screen too bright?

1149
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,842
LOWERING BRIGHTNESS

1150
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:56,280
JIMIN LIES DOWN WITH HIS PHONE TOO

1151
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:57,415
[Jung Kook] I'm sleepy.

1152
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:06,524
THEY CAN'T GIVE UP ON USING THEIR PHONES
NO MATTER HOW SLEEPY THEY ARE...

1153
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:12,263
WHILE THEY ENJOY THEIR HARD-EARNED FREEDOM

1154
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:17,268
THE MORNING SUNSHINE
SLOWLY COMES DOWN THE ROOF

1155
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:22,606
THE LAST MORNING IN BRIENZ
IS ESPECIALLY CLEAR

1156
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:26,477
THE EMERALD LAKE SHIMMERS

1157
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,246
THE DUCKS HAVE BEGUN THEIR DAY EARLY

1158
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,715
ON THE OTHER HAND,

1159
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,651
THESE TWO ARE STILL SOUND ASLEEP

1160
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:40,524
IN THE SAME POSITION...

1161
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:43,561
A STRANGE SOUND COMES FROM OUTSIDE

1162
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,865
WAKING UP AT THE SAME TIME

1163
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:55,806
SHOULD I SLEEP SOME MORE?

1164
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,911
DEAD ASLEEP CLUELESSLY

1165
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:01,979
[director] Jimin.

1166
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,482
Jung Kook.

1167
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,384
SCRATCHING

1168
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,752
Wake up.

1169
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:08,919
GOING UNDER THE BLANKET

1170
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,490
GO AWAY

1171
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,060
We have a train to catch.

1172
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,728
You need to wake up.

1173
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:19,997
What time do we take off?

1174
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,899
At 10:10 at the latest.

1175
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,401
CURRENT TIME: 9:40

1176
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,570
PRETENDING TO ANSWER
AND CLOSING THEIR EYES AGAIN

1177
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:31,609
THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP
VERSUS THOSE WHO TRY TO WAKE THEM UP

1178
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,879
HE FINALLY WAKES UP

1179
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,013
I'm sleepy.

1180
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,518
HALF-ASLEEP

1181
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,952
[crew member] Wake up already.

1182
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,390
THE STAFF LEAVES NOW THAT THEY'RE AWAKE

1183
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:50,394
THEY BEGIN PACKING UP RIGHT AWAY

1184
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,197
THESE TWO ARE AWAKE AND NOTHING ELSE

1185
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,999
THEY ONLY HAVE 15 MINUTES LEFT

1186
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,801
[director] You really need to wake up.

1187
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:01,338
JIMIN IS OFF TO WASH UP

1188
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:05,609
JUNG KOOK BRUSHES HIS TEETH
IN THE ROOM FIRST

1189
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,614
NATURALLY DOING IT ON THE BED

1190
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,651
BRUSHING

1191
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:19,824
JUNG KOOK IS OFF TO THE BATHROOM TOO

1192
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,927
THEY ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
WHEN ALL THEY DID IS WASH UP

1193
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,262
STARTING TO PACK UP QUICKLY

1194
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,330
A WASHING KIT

1195
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,098
PAJAMAS

1196
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,134
A T-SHIRT

1197
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:35,372
JUNG KOOK QUICKLY WASHED UP

1198
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,709
GETTING CHANGED FIRST

1199
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:42,279
PUTTING EVERYTHING IN THE BAG

1200
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,815
OH, THE SOCKS

1201
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:48,452
OH, THE PHONE CHARGER

1202
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,156
-Did we take the money too? 150 francs.
-What?

1203
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,224
I don't remember.

1204
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,092
I'm sure we packed it.

1205
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,795
NOT AGAIN...?

1206
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:01,332
OH, THE MOUTHWASH

1207
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:06,237
HE'S DONE PACKING UP FOR REAL NOW...?

1208
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,472
JUNG KOOK IS FINISHING UP

1209
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:11,008
JIMIN TAKES OFF FIRST

1210
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,510
[Jimin] We have seven minutes.

1211
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,811
IT'S A LITTLE PAST THE TIME

1212
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,212
Jung Kook!

1213
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,280
[Jung Kook] Yes?

1214
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:20,417
-Hurry downstairs.
-Okay.

1215
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,254
OPENING IT FOR THE LAST TIME

1216
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,289
TAKING HIS HAIRBAND

1217
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,325
HE'S DONE FOR REAL

1218
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:35,966
TODAY'S PLAN
MOVING TO ZÜRICH, FREE TIME,

1219
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,935
DINNER AT THE HOTEL, A NIGHT WALK

1220
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:46,143
BOTH OF THEM ARRIVE WITH THEIR LUGGAGE

1221
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:48,445
Thank you.

1222
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,948
QUICKLY GETTING IN THE CAR

1223
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,450
LET'S HEAD TO THE STATION NOW

1224
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,054
We're rushed every time we take a train.

1225
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,929
CHECKING HIS LOOKS BELATEDLY

1226
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,232
JIMIN IS CHECKING HIS BANGS

1227
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,668
GIVING UP ON FIXING HIS HAIR

1228
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,704
[Jung Kook] Is this the station?
Do they sell tickets there?

1229
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,940
They said it'd take five minutes by car,

1230
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,776
so the train will probably leave
in two minutes.

1231
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,111
Did you hear me?

1232
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,080
What?

1233
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:29,186
My throat is sore,
so please do what you can to hear me.

1234
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:36,093
GETTING OUT OF THE CAR QUICKLY

1235
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,462
IT'S SLOW AT THE STATION STILL

1236
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,003
LET'S MOVE QUICKLY

1237
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,842
Wait. What the...
I woke up and found myself here.

1238
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,844
It's so hectic.

1239
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,713
THE TRAIN TO CATCH

1240
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,281
Isn't this it?

1241
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,349
IT'S COMING IN

1242
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,683
Isn't this our train?

1243
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,751
I think so.

1244
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:05,089
QUICKLY GETTING ON

1245
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:10,961
THEY TAKE A SEAT AND CATCH THEIR BREATH

1246
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:12,029
[Jung Kook] It's...

1247
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,297
Oh, it's running.

1248
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:17,334
THEY'RE OFF TO ZÜRICH FROM BRIENZ!

1249
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,402
Bye.

1250
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,671
Where do we get off?

1251
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,941
I think we have a long way to go.

1252
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:27,378
THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL TIME IS 12:51 P.M.

1253
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,813
What, 12:51 p.m.?

1254
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,682
It takes more than two hours.

1255
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,886
THE SWISS LANDSCAPE WILL ACCOMPANY THEM

1256
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,391
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IN THEIR NEXT DESTINATION...?

1257
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,861
JIMIN HAS BROUGHT A DISPOSABLE FILM CAMERA

1258
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:52,403
REFUSING TO TAKE PICTURES

1259
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,340
HE'S SO NOT EASY

1260
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,108
IS HE PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP?

1261
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,244
NO, HE'S FAKING IT!

1262
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,614
You can't fall asleep like that.

1263
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:08,152
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE...

1264
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,055
Are you asleep?

1265
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,762
ZONING OUT

1266
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,364
Should we eat less from today?

1267
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,299
If possible.

1268
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,936
HOLDING HIS LAUGHTER

1269
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:27,438
Why are you smirking?

1270
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,309
FINDING FOOD RIGHT AWAY

1271
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,410
What's that?

1272
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,979
[crew member] Injeolmi chips.

1273
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,147
Sounds good.

1274
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,783
NOPE!

1275
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,319
Oh, it's a peanut-flavored one.

1276
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,422
You suggested we eat less one minute ago.

1277
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:46,724
[Jung Kook] It's not sweet.

1278
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,726
It's not sweet.

1279
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:52,629
This is addicting.

1280
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,899
HE'S IMPOSSIBLE

1281
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,770
THE LANDSCAPE IN SWITZERLAND FROM A TRAIN

1282
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:06,744
IT'S NOT BORING FOR A SECOND

1283
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,879
EVERY MOMENT IS BEAUTIFUL

1284
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,815
[director] Let's get off.
We have to transfer.

1285
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:19,056
LET'S GO TRANSFER

1286
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,630
It's not heavy.

1287
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:30,400
We have to spend a lot of time
on a train today.

1288
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,337
STRUGGLING

1289
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,404
It's heavy.

1290
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,508
THEIR TRANSFER TRAIN

1291
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,881
SAFELY ON BOARD

1292
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,750
IT'S A TWO-STORY TRAIN THIS TIME

1293
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,786
What on earth?

1294
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,989
JUNG KOOK IS EXCITED TO BE
ON THE SECOND FLOOR

1295
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,425
LET'S TAKE OFF AGAIN TO ZÜRICH

1296
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:01,932
THE CLOSER THEY GET,
THE MORE EXCITED THEY FEEL...

1297
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,000
JIMIN FELL ASLEEP

1298
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:06,270
[director] When we arrive in Zürich,

1299
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,907
you can pick a restaurant you want.

1300
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,376
DIY TRAVEL IS THEIR FIRST PLAN

1301
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:15,579
Have lunch and stuff.

1302
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,915
Remember the pass you have?

1303
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,982
Yes.

1304
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:23,887
THE SWISS TRAVEL PASS GIVES YOU
AN UNLIMITED ACCESS

1305
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:28,559
TO VARIOUS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATIONS
LIKE TRAINS, BUSES, FERRIES AND TRAMS

1306
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,327
It's an all-around pass.

1307
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,933
AS THEY ENJOY THE CHANGES
IN THE LANDSCAPE,

1308
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,768
THEY ARRIVE AT THE ZÜRICH STATION

1309
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,269
[Jung Kook] Do we get off here?

1310
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,338
Jimin, we have to get off.

1311
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,876
GETTING OFF IN A RUSH

1312
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,656
[indistinct announcement
over PA]

1313
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,126
Do we have free time from now?

1314
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,194
THE FREE TIME BEGINS

1315
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:05,562
Jimin.

1316
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,800
It's most crowded here.

1317
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,802
-What?
-It's most crowded.

1318
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,937
ZÜRICH

1319
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,340
THE BIGGEST CITY IN SWITZERLAND

1320
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,408
ITS CHARM IS A RICH AND CHEERFUL VIBE

1321
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,878
IT'S THE CENTER
OF SWISS ECONOMY AND CULTURE

1322
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,614
It's different here for sure.

1323
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,750
It doesn't feel nature-integrated.

1324
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:27,951
Right.

1325
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:30,687
It has a typical European vibe.

1326
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,789
-It's civilized.
-[Jimin] Right.

1327
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:36,293
Jung Kook.

1328
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,628
Why don't we go there?

1329
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,162
-What?
-Let's cross the street.

1330
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,764
-There?
-Yes.

1331
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,132
What's there?

1332
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:44,501
-That side is the main street.
-We should stop.

1333
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,736
The signal changed.

1334
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,204
Let's stay in the shade.

1335
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:49,406
Let's hide in the shade. It's too hot.

1336
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:53,477
TAKING SHELTER IN THE SHADE FOR A WHILE

1337
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:58,081
THEY'RE PROVIDED A LUGGAGE-KEEPING SERVICE
TO ENJOY TRAVELING AT EASE

1338
00:56:58,949 --> 00:56:59,950
-Let's go.
-There.

1339
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,023
Our necks will get tanned.

1340
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,159
I need to apply sunblock on my neck.

1341
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,230
I think we're going to a bigger crowd.

1342
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,564
STEPPING INTO A CROWD

1343
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,233
Let's avoid a crowd.

1344
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,303
Let's take a tram.

1345
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:26,043
TAKING A TRAM TO AVOID A CROWD

1346
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,978
USING THEIR TRAVEL PASSES TO GET ON

1347
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,413
[Jung Kook] You can sit first.

1348
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,148
-Are we going anywhere?
-No idea.

1349
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:32,215
Let's escape first.

1350
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,550
THEY GOT ON FIRST...

1351
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:35,552
We have no plans, right?

1352
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,088
I have no idea about where we're going.

1353
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,090
We just wanted to escape.

1354
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:43,560
Let's go where you want today.

1355
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,330
Will you be okay?

1356
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:51,368
I'M NOT SO SURE...

1357
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:52,869
[Jung Kook] We have to get off.

1358
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:56,039
ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY...?

1359
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,741
SEARCHING FOR A RESTAURANT

1360
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,676
I don't know what we should eat.

1361
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,713
You're not hungry, right?

1362
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,081
I'm not.

1363
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,785
We find it harder to spend free time.

1364
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,557
I BETTER STEP IN...

1365
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:16,793
Oh, we haven't tried the veal.

1366
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,095
There's a place.

1367
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,365
But prices are really expensive here.

1368
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,234
Why don't we have one expensive meal?

1369
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,069
-That's a good idea.
-It's not bad.

1370
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:30,907
SEARCHING HARD

1371
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,678
-Within a one-minute walk from here...
-Yes.

1372
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:38,448
JIMIN HAS FOUND A GOOD RESTAURANT
WITHIN A ONE-MINUTE DISTANCE

1373
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,117
There's a popular restaurant.

1374
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:42,786
Let's go there.

1375
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,355
But we should go
where you want to go today.

1376
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:46,423
That's the place.

1377
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,830
LET'S GO EAT

1378
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,265
Let's drink an afternoon beer.

1379
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:58,368
We have enough money too.

1380
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:01,004
-I know. We can enjoy some luxury today.
-But this is...

1381
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:03,874
This place is known for expensive dishes.

1382
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,144
Still, I can't believe
it's a one-minute distance.

1383
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,912
I searched and there was one.

1384
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,480
How did you find it?

1385
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:15,085
I searched on YouTube, Naver and Google.

1386
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,153
Here it is.

1387
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,521
THEY DID ARRIVE IN A MINUTE

1388
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,723
PROUD

1389
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,159
[Jimin] Should we just sit here?

1390
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,028
TAKING AN OUTDOOR TABLE

1391
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:26,763
They've brought us the menu.

1392
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,065
This must be it.

1393
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,633
CAREFULLY READING THROUGH

1394
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,735
Is their specialty sausages?

1395
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:32,803
I think so.

1396
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,571
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1397
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:36,673
This is for two people.

1398
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,243
Let's order this 400 gram veal dish.

1399
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,311
This?

1400
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,780
-I think it's deep-fried.
-Oh.

1401
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:49,352
And the amount is this much
with a side of this much potato.

1402
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,720
Let's share it.

1403
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,022
-Are you not hungry?
-No.

1404
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,357
Why don't we order this one and beer?

1405
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,559
Sounds good.

1406
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,194
WE'D LIKE TO ORDER

1407
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,329
[waitress in English] Yes please.

1408
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,999
-[in English] This one.
-Yes.

1409
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,901
[in English] And draft beer two, please.

1410
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,270
-Two beer? Draft beer?
-Two beer.

1411
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,673
-Okay. Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1412
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,274
[in Korean] That was neat.

1413
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,677
We've ordered
too many kinds of dishes before.

1414
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,378
This is what it should be like.

1415
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,950
Now, we're spending about 100 francs
for just this meal.

1416
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:25,088
But I think it's a good idea
to have something delicious.

1417
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:30,861
I'm surprised you searched
and found this place right away.

1418
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,997
As if we were meant to come here.

1419
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:35,065
Destiny.

1420
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,367
It's served right away.

1421
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,469
-[in English] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1422
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,538
BEER IS SERVED FIRST

1423
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,340
Let's do a toast while we're at it.

1424
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,175
[in Korean] Sure. Today...

1425
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:54,885
REFRESHED

1426
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,388
Let me search a little about Zürich.

1427
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,094
AT THE AGE TO PLAY WITH CAMERAS

1428
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,629
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1429
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,203
-I've searched a few places.
-Okay.

1430
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,541
This city is famous
for its art galleries and museums.

1431
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:22,212
There's a place you can learn
about the Swiss history and stuff.

1432
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:25,482
There's also a place you can enjoy
natural landscapes.

1433
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,684
There's a park.

1434
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:32,422
And there is
a Michelin two-star restaurant here.

1435
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:35,192
They say it's nice for dinner.

1436
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,127
Would it be expensive?

1437
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,763
We should make a deal
to use a credit card.

1438
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,331
I mean, if we're going there.

1439
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:42,766
Anyway, that's one.

1440
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,936
And this city is famous for hash browns.

1441
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,305
It's called rösti.

1442
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,340
With cheese and potatoes...

1443
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,775
It's like a potato dish.

1444
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,811
THIS IS RÖSTI

1445
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,681
It looks like potato
and this is a typical breakfast here.

1446
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,950
SOMETHING BIG HAS ARRIVED

1447
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,017
[Jimin] What's this?

1448
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,085
Wow.

1449
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,589
THE MEAT SURROUNDS A LONG SWORD

1450
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,491
IT LOOKS SO JUICY

1451
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,427
[Jimin] I can't believe what I ordered.

1452
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,695
IT'S SO BIG

1453
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,129
This is an actual sword.

1454
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:16,866
HE CAN'T PASS ON IT

1455
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,268
Let me have a taste.

1456
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,637
-Want a photo?
-No.

1457
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,506
THE OTHER DISHES ARE SERVED AS WELL

1458
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,509
[in English] Thank you.

1459
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,411
Oh, this. It's served right away.

1460
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,747
-Jung Kook.
-[in Korean] Yes?

1461
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:32,916
We get to try the potato pancake
I mentioned.

1462
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:34,317
-It came out right away.
-Yes.

1463
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,586
Let me try the potato first.

1464
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:46,429
It just tastes like hash brown.

1465
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,799
JIMIN TRIES THE VEAL FIRST

1466
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,435
Come to think of it,
there are lots of potatoes here.

1467
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,537
EXCLAIMING

1468
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,808
JUNG KOOK TRIES THE VEAL TOO

1469
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:03,213
METICULOUSLY WITH SOME SAUCE

1470
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:06,650
It's delicious.

1471
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,619
We're spending up our money right away.

1472
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,690
THE TASTE IS WORTH IT

1473
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:16,126
THIS IS DELICIOUS TOO

1474
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,360
It's good.

1475
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:22,432
THIS ONE IS GOOD TOO

1476
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,470
THEY KEEP SAYING IT'S GOOD

1477
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:33,109
DIGGING IN

1478
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,812
IT'S SUCH A SATISFYING MEAL

1479
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:38,915
We shouldn't have it all.

1480
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,884
But we finished it.

1481
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,419
CLEAN

1482
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,355
THE BEAUTIFUL MEAL IS OVER

1483
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:46,456
I enjoyed it.

1484
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:49,793
I wonder how much it is.

1485
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,229
One hundred one and sixty.

1486
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,034
I don't have it.

1487
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,237
The wallet is in my luggage.

1488
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,605
-Really?
-Yes.

1489
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,875
Then we can't spend the money in it.

1490
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:10,480
THE BILL IS SETTLED

1491
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,048
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

1492
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,350
[Jimin in Korean] Let's go.

1493
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:17,320
NOW THAT WE'RE STUFFED,
LET'S HEAD TO THE HOTEL

1494
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:21,224
GETTING IN THE CAR TO GO TO THE HOTEL

1495
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,260
[in Korean] We're finally somewhere cool.

1496
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,762
We're finally off to the hotel.

1497
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,697
Finally, the hotel.

1498
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,332
Finally, the hotel.

1499
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:34,003
We've had beer so we can't drive.

1500
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,805
So the director is...

1501
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,474
Driving for us!

1502
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,409
Is it about a 10-minute distance?

1503
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,411
No, 30 minutes.

1504
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:42,812
CHECKING THE GPS NAVIGATOR

1505
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,382
It takes 11 minutes.
It's just in the middle.

1506
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:48,151
THE CAMERA FALLS TO MARK THE TAKEOFF

1507
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,321
HE SUCCESSFULLY SAVED THE CAMERA

1508
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,727
INSTALLING A CAMERA
FOR THE BACKSEAT HIMSELF

1509
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,931
THEY'RE OFF TO THEIR HOTEL IN ZÜRICH,
THEIR LAST TRAVEL SPOT

1510
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,601
FILMING JUNG KOOK

1511
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:05,668
I'm filming myself.

1512
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:07,637
I installed one here.

1513
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:09,873
I just want to film you from here.

1514
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:13,343
How did I come up
with this brilliant idea?

1515
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,744
I hung it at the back.

1516
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:18,248
Gosh, you don't know enough.

1517
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,517
-What?
-That way,

1518
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:25,989
the staff will have to flip the screen
horizontally and stuff.

1519
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,657
That's easy.

1520
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,692
-It's easy to say.
-Have you ever done it?

1521
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,428
-What?
-Have you ever edited videos?

1522
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,129
Have you?

1523
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,597
I have.

1524
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,665
Right.

1525
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,768
Which country are we going tomorrow again?

1526
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:40,570
POKER FACE

1527
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,238
THAT'S MY BOY

1528
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,507
[director] But I haven't told you yet.

1529
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:47,744
HE DIDN'T FALL FOR IT

1530
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:49,913
I hear we're going to a fine hotel.

1531
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,014
[Jung Kook exclaims]

1532
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,216
A five-star hotel.

1533
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,051
Can you tell us which hotel it is?

1534
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,254
[director] The Dolder?
Something like that.

1535
01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,355
What?

1536
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,958
I think I saw it online earlier.

1537
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:05,228
Isn't it the place
with a famous restaurant?

1538
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,664
[director] Its restaurant is famous.

1539
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,098
-Right?
-Yes.

1540
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,367
I told Jung Kook about it earlier.

1541
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,303
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1542
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,039
Everything is going as I say today.

1543
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,474
Why?

1544
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,977
I told you
about this famous dinner place, right?

1545
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:23,446
That's where we're staying today.

1546
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,514
Seriously?

1547
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,016
-Yes.
-That's crazy.

1548
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,084
I know.

1549
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,986
The scenery there is legendary enough

1550
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:33,556
for us to stay there
without going anywhere else.

1551
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:34,724
Hmm.

1552
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,359
Our hotel?

1553
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,328
[Jimin] It looks like a castle.

1554
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,762
Like a Disneyland castle.

1555
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,997
Oh.

1556
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,833
It's awesome in winter.

1557
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,368
I know. I really...

1558
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:47,704
HOW THE HOTEL LOOKS IN WINTER

1559
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,907
This is how the hotel looks in winter.

1560
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,909
It's like that one from Frozen.

1561
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:54,210
I can't wait.

1562
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:55,979
It's beautiful. It's so pretty.

1563
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,248
I really want to see
what it's like in winter.

1564
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,084
Winter in Zermatt might be legendary.

1565
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,185
I do want to see it.

1566
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:05,822
But I'd like to visit Zürich again too.

1567
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,326
HOW WOULD SWITZERLAND LOOK
COVERED IN SNOW...?

1568
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,963
TELLING THEMSELVES
TO VISIT AGAIN IN WINTER SOMEDAY,

1569
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:16,332
THEY HEAD TO THE LAST HOTEL

1570
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,667
[Jimin] We're almost there.

1571
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:18,968
I can't wait.

1572
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:25,508
AS HE SINGS

1573
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,477
This is...

1574
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,980
Wow, I think I saw a picture of this view.

1575
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,348
[Jung Kook] What on earth?

1576
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:33,483
What is this place?

1577
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,751
THE DOLDER HOTEL IN ZÜRICH

1578
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:35,985
[Jimin] Shall we get out?

1579
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,054
[Jung Kook] We should. We've got to.

1580
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:42,759
This is one
of the most famous hotels in Zürich.

1581
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,396
When I looked it up, it was said

1582
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:51,167
to be famous for its restaurant and views.
It sure has an amazing view.

1583
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:54,470
Awesome.

1584
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,607
AN OPEN PANORAMA VIEW

1585
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:02,045
This really is legendary.

1586
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,114
Hold on. Let me take some pictures.

1587
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:11,654
If I bring my parents here,
they're going to love it.

1588
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,159
TAKING PICTURES OF THE VIEW

1589
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,931
-Should we go in?
-Let's go in. It's hot.

1590
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:24,067
LET'S GO CHECK OUT THE INSIDE

1591
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,769
ENTERING

1592
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,504
Where do we go? Do we go up?

1593
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,710
I just want to hurry in and lie down.

1594
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,912
YOU ENJOY LYING DOWN IN BED AT HIS AGE

1595
01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:43,019
If a place like this
is owned by an individual...

1596
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,224
QUICKLY HEADING STRAIGHT TO THE ROOM

1597
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,559
Finally, a hotel room.

1598
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:59,869
SLOW

1599
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:01,738
TAKING HIS TIME

1600
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,805
It's grand.

1601
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,377
This hotel itself is beautiful.

1602
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,445
The pathways are fresh.

1603
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:13,583
It's not like those typical hotels.

1604
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:17,787
Jung Kook has disappeared.

1605
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,759
HE'S ALREADY IN FRONT OF THE ELEVATORS

1606
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,560
SIGHING

1607
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:26,396
What can I do? I should wait.

1608
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,731
HURRY UP

1609
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,735
RUSHING JIMIN TO HURRY

1610
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,071
-He's too fast for me.
-He's so slow.

1611
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:37,440
-I'd like to keep my pace.
-So slow.

1612
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,574
How frustrating.

1613
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:45,915
SAME PLACE, DIFFERENT SPEED

1614
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,553
JIMIN GETS TO THE ELEVATORS TOO

1615
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,422
All right, let's get on.

1616
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,359
-Which floor is it?
-Sixth.

1617
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:57,860
I can finally get some rest.

1618
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,862
Wait.

1619
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,933
Honestly, we can sleep
just with a blanket on the floor.

1620
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,602
I can even sleep here. I have experience.

1621
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,504
Right. Like your name, Jeon Jung Kook.

1622
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,872
I know.

1623
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,874
That's for sure.

1624
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,243
Isn't it "Jeonjeok," though?

1625
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,079
My name isn't Jeon Jeok Kook.

1626
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,382
Hello, I'm Jeok Kook.

1627
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:21,250
That means "enemy country" in Korean.

1628
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,420
FORTUNATELY, THEY ARRIVE
BEFORE HE BECOMES AN ENEMY COUNTRY

1629
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:26,789
Gosh.

1630
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:30,426
All right, up to here.
Let's check the bathroom.

1631
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,361
Hold on. It's connected to where?

1632
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,564
LET'S LOOK AROUND THE HOTEL ROOM

1633
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,033
The bathroom is here. It's nice.

1634
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,435
Hold on. Let me show here too.

1635
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:43,473
A ROOM TOUR WITH JIMIN

1636
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,443
[Jimin exclaims]

1637
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,115
A VERANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL OPEN VIEW

1638
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:56,052
Okay.

1639
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:59,989
I will share a hotel bed with Jimin again.

1640
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:01,557
SO EXCITED

1641
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,897
Is it following me? It is.

1642
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,532
Bugs come in here too.

1643
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,502
A FLY CHECKED IN THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW

1644
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:14,170
Dang.

1645
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,572
Did it follow us from Interlaken?

1646
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:17,673
[Jung Kook] Did it?

1647
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:25,782
PEACE HAS COME AFTER THE ROOM TOUR

1648
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,051
We're staying here just for one night.

1649
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:31,154
What a shame.

1650
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:37,527
IT'S SHORT,
BUT THEY FULLY ENJOY THE PEACE

1651
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:42,865
HE ENDS UP DIVING ONTO THE BED

1652
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:48,204
JUNG KOOK HAS ACHIEVED ALL HE WANTED...

1653
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:53,643
RESTING THEIR OWN WAYS

1654
01:11:55,945 --> 01:12:00,316
THE LAST AFTERNOON IN SWITZERLAND
IS PASSING

1655
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:03,686
THE BREAK IS OVER
AND THEY'RE OFF TO HAVE DINNER

1656
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:10,760
US ON THE LAST DAY IN SWITZERLAND

1657
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:14,163
I hear he's coming
to the States on July 9.

1658
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,200
That's three days after we arrive.

1659
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,001
Then, can we eat for three days?

1660
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,141
I'm going to have In-N-Out for sure.

1661
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,309
Let's go, then.

1662
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,477
I can never give it up.

1663
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:29,745
We can order some in.

1664
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:35,251
We're flying to the States on July 6

1665
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:38,888
and have a song camp
to start producing our music.

1666
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,959
We'll go make some awesome songs.

1667
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,527
THEY ARRIVE AT THE RESTAURANT

1668
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:45,862
Cameras off for a while.

1669
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,763
SINCE IT'S CROWDED INSIDE

1670
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:51,133
[Jung Kook] Hello.

1671
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,102
MOVING TO THE TABLE

1672
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:54,770
SEATED

1673
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:57,540
LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU

1674
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,508
I better turn the flash on.

1675
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:02,879
A GORGEOUS POSE

1676
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,280
One, two.

1677
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,849
THE EPITOME OF A STYLISH PICTURE

1678
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,352
IT'S JIMIN'S TURN

1679
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,419
UNNATURAL AND AWKWARD

1680
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:11,754
All right, one.

1681
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:14,023
NOW, IT'S A LUXURY EVEN TO COUNT TO TWO

1682
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,025
You should've take it at "all right."

1683
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,461
ONE IS ENOUGH
IT'S GOOD HOWEVER IT'S TAKEN

1684
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,963
GOING THROUGH THE MENU

1685
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,865
-Let's...
-How about a signature dish?

1686
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:24,367
I was thinking the same.

1687
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,002
Wouldn't that be nice?

1688
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,738
But I don't understand
what's written here.

1689
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,907
They also have dishes for sharing.

1690
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:31,974
[Jimin] Hmm.

1691
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,710
Soups for starters here.

1692
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:35,845
And here...

1693
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:37,947
Do we need appetizers?

1694
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,282
No.

1695
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,717
I'd like a salad, though.

1696
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,186
Then how about an avocado salad?

1697
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,922
-Good.
-And truffle fries.

1698
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,290
Nice.

1699
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,692
This is a tomahawk steak,

1700
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:53,562
dry-aged for 28 days.

1701
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:54,897
I've wanted to try it.

1702
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:57,400
I've never had a dry-aged steak before.

1703
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,502
Should we try it? I want to try it too.

1704
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,771
I kind of want fish too.

1705
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,272
I haven't had it in so long.

1706
01:14:03,339 --> 01:14:05,875
How about these two? Is it too much?

1707
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,109
I think so.

1708
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:09,712
DEEPLY TORN

1709
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:13,049
-What do you want to ask?
-How many servings are these?

1710
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,717
That I can't ask in English.

1711
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,419
It's hard already from the start.

1712
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,521
JUNK KOOK MUSTERS UP HIS COURAGE

1713
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:19,789
When he's walking away.

1714
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,057
ASKING TO NO ONE

1715
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,692
LAUGHING

1716
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,760
SIR

1717
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,028
[in English] Excuse me.

1718
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:27,697
[in Korean] He's not listening.

1719
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:29,565
I was going to ask.

1720
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:30,967
I think it's for two.

1721
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,468
THE SERVERS ARE BUSY

1722
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:35,204
Let's order two share dishes and...

1723
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,339
One side dish,

1724
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,541
-and wine.
-Let's order some wine too.

1725
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,076
Good. Jung Kook, make an order.

1726
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,911
Well...

1727
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,180
ANYONE READY TO TAKE OUR ORDER?

1728
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:45,247
"Well..."

1729
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,050
Sir.

1730
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,285
HE TIMIDLY CALLS HIM

1731
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,654
A POLITE SMILE

1732
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:53,789
Do you have any questions?

1733
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:54,957
No questions.

1734
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:56,759
[in English] This one. This. This one.

1735
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,695
HE'S ADORABLE

1736
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:01,397
Side dishes.

1737
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,000
This one.

1738
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,568
One truffle fries?

1739
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:06,669
-Yes.
-Truffle fries?

1740
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,538
-Cool. Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

1741
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,040
UNBURDENED

1742
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:12,408
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW

1743
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:13,476
Wine.

1744
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,145
HIS EYES SHAKE

1745
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,547
Wine.

1746
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,617
-Great. Of course.
-Would you like to recommend...

1747
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,752
Oh!

1748
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:27,456
HE SILENTLY POINTS
AT SOMETHING ON THE MENU

1749
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,891
[in English] This one, please.

1750
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,292
Let me note this one.

1751
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,764
I'd go for the white, then,
for the fish, actually.

1752
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,032
TO PAIR WITH THE FISH,

1753
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,701
THEY ORDER TWO GLASSES OF WINE
AND OTHER DISHES

1754
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:40,403
-Wonderful.
-Wonderful.

1755
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,238
IT WAS A WONDERFUL ORDERING TIME

1756
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,006
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1757
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:45,474
-May I?
-Thank you.

1758
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,209
-Thank you.
-You're a gentleman.

1759
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:50,146
-[in Korean] Anyway, he's quite cool.
-[in Korean] I know.

1760
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,250
THEY FINALLY GET TO ENJOY THE VIEW

1761
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:57,286
[Jung Kook] We came out
just when it's nice and cool. I love it.

1762
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,223
It's our last evening in Switzerland.

1763
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,727
So we came
to the most expensive and finest place.

1764
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,596
I personally...

1765
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,700
liked Zermatt the most.

1766
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:13,636
It's nice here too.

1767
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:17,373
HOW THEY WAIT FOR THEIR FOOD

1768
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,143
WAIT, THIS BEAT IS...

1769
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,547
THEY CAN'T PASS ON "KILLIN' IT GIRL"

1770
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,118
AFTER A PERFORMANCE,

1771
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:32,755
THE WINE IS SERVED

1772
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:35,157
White wine.

1773
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:36,692
Let me pour you some.

1774
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,094
Okay.

1775
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,228
Thank you.

1776
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,335
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1777
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:47,970
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1778
01:16:50,573 --> 01:16:54,143
This is a way to give wine
some quick aeration.

1779
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,579
-You create a tornado inside?
-Yes.

1780
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:57,847
It's so fast.

1781
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,249
This allows the wine
to make more contact with air.

1782
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:01,350
Air contact?

1783
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,551
Right...

1784
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,688
-You're good.
-Of course.

1785
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:08,624
I know when to do it. How much contact...

1786
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:13,095
How much contact...

1787
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,297
BE EASY ON THE WINE...

1788
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,567
How much contact with air...

1789
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,705
[Jimin laughing]

1790
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,408
TOTALLY SATISFIED

1791
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,479
My wine must taste differently from yours.

1792
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:31,680
Try mine after yours.

1793
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:35,784
A SIP OF THE SLIGHTLY AERATED WINE FIRST

1794
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,486
CONFIDENT

1795
01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:38,787
This must be more fragrant.

1796
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:41,924
TASTING THE MORE AERATED WINE

1797
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:44,493
-Right?
-I think it is.

1798
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,628
-Right?
-Yes.

1799
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,729
SWIRL IT, THEN

1800
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:47,796
I think it really is.

1801
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,867
SUPER FOCUSED

1802
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:54,270
Let's keep doing it
until the meat is served.

1803
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,406
Do they bring it from there?

1804
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,377
WHERE?

1805
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,212
GETTING READY TO TEASE HIM

1806
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,283
ALL EXCITED

1807
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:13,322
DUMBFOUNDED...

1808
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,390
Wait.

1809
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:20,095
ONE WANTS TO PULL A TRICK
WHILE THE OTHER TRIES NOT TO FALL FOR IT

1810
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:27,336
A PERSISTENT FIGHT
BETWEEN A SPEAR AND A SHIELD

1811
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,404
Jung Kook.

1812
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,639
What? What is it?

1813
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,707
Goodness.

1814
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:36,111
OH, WELL...

1815
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:40,583
THAT WAS FUN

1816
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,884
-Jung Kook.
-What?

1817
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,052
Can I ask a question?

1818
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,154
-No. You too.
-Good day.

1819
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,692
Let's ask before asking something.

1820
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:52,027
-Okay, let's be polite.
-Yeah.

1821
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:55,931
-That side is the west?
-Is it a question?

1822
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:57,700
HE'S SO QUICK TO ADOPT IT

1823
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,401
No, I was talking to myself.

1824
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,738
If it were a question,
I'd have asked for permission first.

1825
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:04,640
-Jimin.
-Yes?

1826
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:06,342
May I ask you something?

1827
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,510
-No.
-All right.

1828
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,312
Okay.

1829
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:12,348
-Jimin.
-What?

1830
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,116
Shall we toast?

1831
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:16,118
Ask for permission to ask first.

1832
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:17,586
-Jimin.
-Yes?

1833
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:19,555
-May I ask for a favor?
-Of course.

1834
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:20,623
Do me a toast.

1835
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,258
-Sure.
-Good.

1836
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:26,495
THEY BARELY MANAGE TO HAVE A TOAST

1837
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,332
It's good.

1838
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:31,900
BECAUSE IT TOOK THEM A LOT

1839
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:33,102
It's become sweeter.

1840
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:35,170
Wait. I see it.

1841
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,238
FINALLY?

1842
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:39,141
10 SECONDS BEFORE THEY MEET THE FOOD

1843
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:40,709
[Jimin singing]

1844
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,212
THE FOOD IS HERE

1845
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,214
-What is it? I can't wait.
-It smells nice.

1846
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,049
[sniffing]

1847
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,183
The tomahawk steak?

1848
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,452
THE FIRST DISH IS REVEALED

1849
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,721
THE SALT-GRILLED ATLANTIC SEABASS
CHOSEN BY JIMIN

1850
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,822
Oh, he's cracking it.

1851
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:57,393
HAMMERING THE SALT CRUST COVERING THE FISH

1852
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,460
[Jimin] What is it?

1853
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:01,130
It smells so good.

1854
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,932
IT FINALLY IS REVEALED

1855
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,168
IT MAKES THEM STAND UP

1856
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:07,236
This is...

1857
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:09,438
[both exclaiming]

1858
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,006
How did they cook it?

1859
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:12,608
What's this on the outside?

1860
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:14,276
It smells a bit sweet.

1861
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:15,844
[Jimin] Gosh, I love the smell.

1862
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:18,881
AFTER THE SALT CRUST WAS TAKEN OFF,
THE FISH IS REVEALED

1863
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,516
I can't wait.

1864
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:23,018
I want to have
the white wine with it so badly.

1865
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,353
Perfect.

1866
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,921
HIS MOUTH WATERS

1867
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:30,859
ROLLING THE SKIN TO REMOVE IT

1868
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,262
-I wanted to have fish.
-Right.

1869
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,998
[Jung Kook] I can tell it's tender
just by looking at it.

1870
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:38,300
It will melt in my mouth.

1871
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:39,802
The steak is here too.

1872
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,503
[Jung Kook laughs]

1873
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:45,407
THEY'RE STRUCK SPEECHLESS
AT THE SIGHT OF IT...

1874
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:48,010
[Jimin] This is incredible.

1875
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:49,611
[both exclaiming]

1876
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,717
THE OCEAN AND LAND ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER
IN SWITZERLAND

1877
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:57,419
How appetizing.

1878
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:08,197
THE SERVER STARTS TO DELIVER THE FOOD
TO THE TABLE

1879
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:13,969
THE SEABASS AND STEAK ARE ALL SERVED

1880
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,841
THE ENDLESS BLESSING OF FOOD
LIES ON THE TABLE

1881
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,310
-The plate is hot.
-[Jimin singing]

1882
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,511
It looks delicious.

1883
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:27,082
THE BEST DINNER TO PUT A FABULOUS END
TO THEIR TRIP IN SWITZERLAND

1884
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,185
TRYING THE GRILLED SEABASS FIRST

1885
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:31,320
[in English] Thank you.

1886
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:35,157
Let me check if there are any bones.

1887
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,960
[in Korean] Wait. It tastes familiar.

1888
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,596
Where have I had this taste?

1889
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:42,998
IT HAS A FAMILIAR TASTE...?

1890
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,566
It's like having

1891
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,871
a very soft grilled mackerel
cooked by my mom.

1892
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,874
It's actually not easy
to cook something to be soft.

1893
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:56,645
IT'S SO SOFT THAT IT MELTS IN THEIR MOUTHS

1894
01:21:57,846 --> 01:21:58,914
I've craved this.

1895
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,183
A BITE OF BIG FRENCH FRIES

1896
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,285
DELICIOUS

1897
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:05,821
JIMIN TAKES A BITE TOO

1898
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:08,390
GLANCING

1899
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,459
Should we share the meat with the staff?

1900
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,462
THESE SWEET GUYS CARE
OF THE HARDWORKING STAFF

1901
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:14,730
Should we put some here?

1902
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:20,769
FILLING THE PLATE FOR THE STAFF

1903
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,372
HOW GENEROUS...

1904
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,540
Just this much?

1905
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:31,346
EVEN ASPARAGUS FOR NUTRITIONAL BALANCE

1906
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:35,751
A PLATE FULL OF THEIR CARING HEART

1907
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:36,952
I'll go give it to them.

1908
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:39,421
JIMIN IS OFF TO DELIVER IT

1909
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,489
Hello.

1910
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,760
I brought some for you to have a taste.

1911
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:48,063
ENJOY

1912
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,332
GOING BACK TO EATING HEARTWARMINGLY

1913
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:53,635
I've never had a dry-aged steak before.

1914
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:54,703
Let me try it now.

1915
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,973
JIMIN'S FIRST DRY-AGED STEAK

1916
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:06,048
IT MAKES HIM GO FOR ANOTHER BITE
RIGHT AWAY

1917
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:09,751
JUNG KOOK HAS IT WITH SOME SAUCE

1918
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,186
YUM

1919
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:13,655
A PIECE OF ASPARAGUS TOO

1920
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,425
IT CALLS FOR A SHOULDER DANCE...

1921
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,726
Can I have some bok choy?

1922
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:24,900
HE DOESN'T FORGET TO HAVE VEGGIES

1923
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,005
IT'S SUCH A FANTASTIC DINNER

1924
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:32,941
JIMIN IS APPLYING SOME SAUCE ON THE MEAT

1925
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,477
YUM

1926
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:37,613
LOVING IT

1927
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:39,781
Our white wine is here.

1928
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:44,720
EXCITED AT THE THOUGHT
OF HAVING IT WITH THE SEABASS

1929
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,457
We can finally enjoy the fish for real.

1930
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:49,591
[in English] Thank you.

1931
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,094
[in Korean] Let's have this
and then the white wine.

1932
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,862
Pour some of this.

1933
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,866
A MOUTHFUL OF THE GRILLED SEABASS FIRST

1934
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,903
THEN THE WHITE WINE

1935
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,971
CHEERS WITH WHITE WINE

1936
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:09,444
SAVORING

1937
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:14,650
Indeed. White wine
certainly goes well with fish.

1938
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:16,685
The fish is really good.

1939
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:23,692
THIS COMBINATION MAKES THEM EAT NONSTOP

1940
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:27,930
This fish is somewhat addicting.

1941
01:24:29,932 --> 01:24:32,935
It tastes kind of familiar.

1942
01:24:33,936 --> 01:24:35,470
It's so soft.

1943
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:37,506
IN LOVE WITH THE SEABASS AND WHITE WINE

1944
01:24:40,976 --> 01:24:41,977
Mmm!

1945
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,213
Mmm!

1946
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:51,520
RINSING THEIR MOUTHS WITH THE WHITE WINE

1947
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:55,457
It's nice.

1948
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,027
A grilled vegetable at the end.

1949
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,096
THE LAST MOUTHFUL OF VEGETABLES

1950
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:02,764
HE'S DONE EATING

1951
01:25:04,066 --> 01:25:05,701
-I'm full.
-Me too.

1952
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,102
I enjoyed it.

1953
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,809
-It was good.
-It was good.

1954
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,310
I want to lie down now.

1955
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:16,378
Let's go do that.

1956
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,579
Let's do that for a bit.

1957
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,414
Can we lie down for about 20 minutes?

1958
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:23,285
THEY'RE OFF TO REST A BIT

1959
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:25,821
My stomach is about to explode.

1960
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:28,457
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

1961
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:29,591
I'm so full.

1962
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:30,659
Me too.

1963
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,894
-I'm extremely full.
-I loved it.

1964
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,198
I was craving fish.

1965
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:37,299
How grateful.

1966
01:25:37,366 --> 01:25:39,201
We hadn't had fish here, right?

1967
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,268
-No.
-Right?

1968
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:44,539
And we ended up having
a very expensive one.

1969
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:47,309
Let's go in like a scene from a movie.

1970
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:49,378
-Let me film it.
-From below.

1971
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:54,349
Like this.

1972
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,418
DIRECTED, FILMED AND PERFORMED
BY JUNG KOOK

1973
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,520
TAKE ONE

1974
01:25:58,587 --> 01:25:59,588
I have no room key.

1975
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:00,822
[Jimin laughs]

1976
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:03,792
THE GENRE TURNS OUT TO BE COMEDY...

1977
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,161
I have no room key.

1978
01:26:06,228 --> 01:26:09,531
HANDING THE CAMERA HE LEFT BEHIND

1979
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:11,166
I remembered the key was with me.

1980
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:15,671
IS HE A SHADOW?

1981
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,205
TURNING

1982
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,207
TURNING AS WELL

1983
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:22,911
THE SHADOW CLOSES THE DOOR

1984
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:25,280
I AM

1985
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:26,648
TOO

1986
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:27,916
FULL

1987
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:29,885
-It was very nice.
-It was nice.

1988
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:30,952
See you.

1989
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,155
LET US TAKE A BREAK

1990
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,023
[director] Let's go.

1991
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,259
-[Jung Kook] Must we go?
-Yes.

1992
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:38,393
AFTER A SHORT BREAK

1993
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:43,632
THEY GET IN THE CAR AGAIN TO GO SOMEWHERE

1994
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,133
Should I move the seat for you?

1995
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,201
Yes, please.

1996
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:49,638
Not enough space, right?

1997
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:50,772
No.

1998
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:54,876
[in English] Is it okay?

1999
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,678
Good.

2000
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:01,183
THEY'VE REGAINED ENERGY AFTER THE BREAK

2001
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,118
[both singing]

2002
01:27:03,185 --> 01:27:08,557
OFF TO ENJOY THE LAST NIGHT IN SWITZERLAND

2003
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:15,897
DRIVING DOWN A DARKENING ROAD IN ZÜRICH

2004
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:19,034
[in Korean] The night view
must be beautiful.

2005
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:20,435
I'm getting the feeling.

2006
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,740
I think we can take
a lot of pretty pictures.

2007
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:26,742
♪ Pretty pictures ♪

2008
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:28,343
It's so pretty here.

2009
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,146
ZÜRICH SHINES MORE THE DARKER IT GETS

2010
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:37,419
THEY ARRIVE AT THE OLD TOWN IN ZÜRICH

2011
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,590
[Jung Kook] We don't turn off the camera?

2012
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:42,791
[director] No.

2013
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,199
ZÜRICH'S OLD TOWN

2014
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,502
We have to turn left
at the riverside there.

2015
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:56,138
Turn left, both of you.

2016
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:58,073
WHAT KIND OF PLACE DID JIMIN FIND?

2017
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,175
I wish this had a longer handle.

2018
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,645
IN A GREAT MOOD

2019
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:05,380
SUDDENLY SHOUTING OUT J-HOPE

2020
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:09,818
THEY WALK AS THEY HUM

2021
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:11,920
WHAT IS THIS?

2022
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:13,688
What is this place? It's so pretty.

2023
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:19,427
THEY FINALLY MEET THE NIGHT OF ZÜRICH

2024
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:26,668
THE STREETS ARE FILLED WITH RELAXED PEOPLE

2025
01:28:27,903 --> 01:28:32,174
EVERYTHING THEY SEE
IS LIKE A PAINTING

2026
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,709
They're taking pictures there.

2027
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:37,312
This must be a photo spot.
Jung Kook, stand there.

2028
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,548
In the middle.

2029
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,982
Here? All right.

2030
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,785
-Here?
-It's already nice.

2031
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,054
This looks cool. I like it.

2032
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:48,557
HOWEVER YOU TAKE A PICTURE IN ZÜRICH,
IT BECOMES ART

2033
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:49,758
Jung Kook, goodness.

2034
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:52,761
What if you fall for the pictures I took?

2035
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:53,829
What's the matter?

2036
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:55,931
Holy.

2037
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,465
Let me do it.

2038
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:58,700
Surprised, right?

2039
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:00,068
Let me.

2040
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:02,003
-I'll walk.
-Don't walk.

2041
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,172
-Don't?
-Don't.

2042
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,942
PASSIONATELY ON IT

2043
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,111
WAITING OBEDIENTLY

2044
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,346
Wait.

2045
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,415
Wait.

2046
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,883
Jimin, wait.

2047
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:17,719
HIS PASSION EXPLODES

2048
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:20,088
-Is this how it is?
-A car is coming.

2049
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:21,690
-Dang.
-Dang.

2050
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:25,894
How do you blur the background?
I changed to portrait mode.

2051
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:27,662
But it looks cool.

2052
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:31,199
A GREAT PICTURE EARNED THANKS TO WAITING

2053
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:33,668
FULL OF THE ZÜRICH VIBE

2054
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:34,803
Let's go.

2055
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,471
I got one nice picture for now.

2056
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:39,908
Jung Kook, this isn't the main street.
We have to go there.

2057
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:41,176
[Jung Kook] Do we?

2058
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:42,611
Do we have to walk down?

2059
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:43,879
Yes, all the way down.

2060
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:46,681
[Jung Kook] There are seven swans
down there.

2061
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:47,883
No, five swans.

2062
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:51,186
IS THIS THE SWAN LAKE...?

2063
01:29:51,253 --> 01:29:53,221
JUNG KOOK HAS OBTAINED SWAN FEED

2064
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:55,590
Can you raise your head a bit?

2065
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:58,426
JIMIN WANTS TO TAKE PICTURES OF JUNG KOOK

2066
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:01,930
HE'S TAKING PICTURES OF EVERY MOMENT

2067
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:05,133
THE SWANS ARE ENJOYING THE FEED
GIVEN BY JUNG KOOK

2068
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,503
JUNG KOOK IS INTO FEEDING THE SWANS

2069
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,840
JIMIN IS INTO TAKING PICTURES

2070
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,842
[Jimin] The pictures come out so well.

2071
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,510
HOLDING THE SWAN FEED TIGHTLY

2072
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:19,981
Maybe I'll just throw this
as a whole together.

2073
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:23,618
MAKING A BIG CHUNK

2074
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:25,253
Wait. I'll do it all at once.

2075
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:26,421
THE TASTE OF OVEREATING

2076
01:30:26,488 --> 01:30:28,189
It's delicious when you overeat.

2077
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,726
-Only this one hasn't gotten any.
-I'll make sure it's fed.

2078
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:33,428
It's delicious when you overeat.

2079
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:35,230
READY

2080
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:36,998
ACTION

2081
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:42,437
FOOD IS COMING DOWN FROM THE SKY,
THE OVEREATING PARTY BEGINS

2082
01:30:42,504 --> 01:30:45,907
The second one here isn't...

2083
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:47,509
-Right?
-...eating much.

2084
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:49,177
Should I throw some toward it?

2085
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:50,545
WHILE HE'S TRYING TO FEED IT

2086
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:51,846
You didn't eat, right?

2087
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,381
Hey, duck.

2088
01:30:53,515 --> 01:30:54,783

What the?

2090
01:30:56,718 --> 01:30:58,787
-It's strangely beautiful.
-Is it you?

2091
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,223
That guy is a bit slow.

2092
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:06,227
WHAT ARE YOU FILMING?

2093
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,163
[Jimin laughing]

2094
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:13,435
THE SKY IS BEAUTIFUL, SO WHY...

2095
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:14,769
You look so excited.

2096
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:18,373
A NEW ANGLE

2097
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:19,874
Eat up.

2098
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:21,343
THE SWAN DADDY GIVES THEM ALL

2099
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,512
-Let's go.
-Hey.

2100
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,247
The view is odd.

2101
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:28,817
-So pretty.
-Want me to take a photo?

2102
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:30,652
Oh, you told me to take it vertically.

2103
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,088
[sighs]

2104
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,622
Gosh, this is...

2105
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,257
The sky is amazing.

2106
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,227
-Look.
-Really?

2107
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,663
EVERY PHOTO THEY TAKE IS LIKE ART

2108
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:42,731
[Jung Kook] Let me.

2109
01:31:43,565 --> 01:31:45,300
-Jimin.
-Yes?

2110
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:48,703
A COOL POSE

2111
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:50,872
Let's go a little from one end.

2112
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:52,807
Almost there.

2113
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:54,209
A little less.

2114
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:55,276
IS HE DONE?

2115
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,778
OH, HE'S NOT

2116
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,646
Wait a bit.

2117
01:31:59,147 --> 01:32:01,282
-Look.
-What?

2118
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,984
How long until you take it?

2119
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:05,854
THE RESULT OF HIS WAITING IS COMING SOON

2120
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,190
SQUATTING FOR THE BEST PHOTO
OF JIMIN'S LIFE

2121
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:10,425
Jimin, it's over.

2122
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:13,428
A SENTIMENTAL PHOTO
EARNED THANKS TO SQUATTING

2123

HEADING TO THE ACTUAL DESTINATION

2124
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,399
-[Jimin] This vibe?
-Isn't it great?

2125
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:20,235
HE LOVES IT

2126
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:22,504
It's worth being on
my social media profile.

2127
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,772
Of course.

2128
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:27,475
Well taken, right?

2129
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:30,278
[Jimin] Goodness.

2130
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:31,413
It sure is beautiful.

2131
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:37,285
WHERE IS JIMIN?

2132
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:42,390
JIMIN IS TAKING PICTURES AGAIN

2133
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:46,061
JUNG KOOK IS PLAYING WITH A SWAN AGAIN

2134
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:49,030
[Jimin] Did it grow on you
after meeting it yesterday?

2135
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:50,498
No, it's a different one.

2136
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,300
-It followed us.
-Really?

2137
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:54,202
Because it didn't get your autograph.

2138
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:55,303
We walked quite a lot.

2139
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,905
We came pretty far.

2140
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,139
Let me check.

2141
01:32:59,007 --> 01:33:00,708
[Jung Kook] Where is the pretty spot?

2142
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:03,344
[Jimin] There's a place called Lindenhof.

2143
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,648
We have to walk toward the left
and go up somewhere.

2144
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:08,016
-Do we?
-Yes.

2145
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,217
Can you count on me?

2146
01:33:09,284 --> 01:33:10,285
Of course.

2147
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:15,990
I saw this beautiful river view
down from a stone wall.

SPEEDING UP

2150
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:21,296
We should slow down a little
for them to film easier.

2151
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:24,466
IN SELF SLOW MOTION

2152
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:26,134

THEY'RE EVEN GOOD AT THIS

2154
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,275
SLOWLY AND ELEGANTLY

2155
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,612

It's nice.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2162
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:07,208
A CLOSE-UP ATTACK

2163
01:34:07,275 --> 01:34:08,276
Is it their language?

2164
01:34:08,343 --> 01:34:10,378
SWITZERLAND HAS FOUR NATIONAL LANGUAGES

01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,418
-It reminds me of Malta.
-Yes.

2169
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,588
-The place we first went to.
-Right.

2170
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,023
I miss Malta.

2171
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:24,259
But we didn't even know its capital city.

2172
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:27,495
MALTA'S CAPITAL IS VALLETTA

2173
01:34:27,562 --> 01:34:28,563
A HILL SHOWS UP

2174
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:29,964
-[Jung Kook] Is this it?
-Yes.

2175
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:33,568
Beauty is bound to follow
after a huge pain.

2176
01:34:33,635 --> 01:34:34,736
Is there such a saying?

2177
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:37,839
HE'S NEVER HEARD OF IT

2178
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:38,940
Beauty after a pain?

2179
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:41,342
-Haven't you heard of it?
-After a BP...

2180
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,345
After a huge pain,
beauty is bound to follow.

2181
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:48,316
HOW MUCH OF A BEAUTY
WILL FOLLOW AFTER THIS PAIN...

2182
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:50,451
I don't find it tough.

2183
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,555
Do you hear me pant?

2184
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,722
You don't.

2185
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:57,759
You're not panting
because you're holding your breath.

2186
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,093
I'm not.

2187
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,429
I'm breathing and talking.

2188
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:03,331
If you run out of breath over this...

2189
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,767
A BIG SIGH AFTER JUST ONE SECOND

2190
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,001
-Is it tiring?
-No.

2191
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,170
-This is it.
-Because the air is fresh.

2192
01:35:09,237 --> 01:35:11,039
[Jimin] I think we have to go that way.

2193
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:12,574
-[Jung Kook] We do?
-Yes.

2194
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,410
-Nice.
-Please trust and follow me.

2195
01:35:16,344 --> 01:35:18,479
The fresh air makes me
want to take a breath.

2196
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,882
HE'S NOT TIRED, HE'S TAKING A BREATH

2197
01:35:20,949 --> 01:35:22,517
It's pretty.

2198
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:25,186
-Is it satisfying?
-After a pain...

2199
01:35:25,253 --> 01:35:28,323
-Beauty follows, I said. Trust me.
-beauty...

2200
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:29,424
WHERE THEY ARE

2201
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:31,859
THEY CAN HAVE A FULL VIEW OF THE OLD TOWN

2202
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:34,128
-It's much prettier here.
-It's prettier here.

2203
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,364
YOU CAN BE TRUELY RELAXED HERE

2204
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:38,633
It's not bad.

2205
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:43,137
The river and stuff
must've looked much prettier

2206
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,673
if we'd come when the sun set.

2207
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:48,876
TAKING PICTURES TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT

2208
01:35:49,544 --> 01:35:50,545
It's scary.

2209
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:51,613
ESCAPING RIGHT AWAY

2210
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,282
We should've come
around when the sun was setting.

2211
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:58,119
-But it's still so beautiful.
-It's nice.

2212
01:35:59,654 --> 01:36:03,625
ENJOYING THE NIGHT VIEW
SITTING ON THE STONE WALL SIDE BY SIDE

2213
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:07,996
THEY'RE MAKING ANOTHER PAGE OF MEMORIES

2214
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:15,036
ENJOYING THE NIGHT VIEW TOGETHER SILENTLY

2215
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,907
WE'LL COME AGAIN

2216
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:23,077
FORCING THEMSELVES TO RETURN

2217
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,246
Jung Kook, stay still already.

2218
01:36:25,313 --> 01:36:26,848
What?

2219
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:28,583
You should've told me.

2220
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:29,751
-I am now.
-Right?

2221
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,753
-Don't look here.
-Okay.

2222
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:36,524
-I'll walk slowly. Jeez.
-No, don't move at all.

2223
01:36:37,058 --> 01:36:39,827
There you go. Focus here, you brat.

2224
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,163
-[Jimin] How cool.
-What?

2225
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,398
[Jimin] Why am I so good?

2226
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:47,769
DANCING

2227
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:52,840
THE RHYTHM HAS TAKEN OVER JUNG KOOK

2228
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:55,376
THE STAFF SPOTS A WELL

2229
01:36:55,443 --> 01:36:57,111
A WELL?

2230
01:36:58,079 --> 01:36:59,447
Gosh, it's deep.

2231
01:36:59,514 --> 01:37:01,115
Does it have water down there?

2232
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:03,818
IT'S LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE OLD TOWN

2233
01:37:03,885 --> 01:37:07,922
UNDERGROUND WATER TAKES UP 80 PERCENT OF
DRINKING WATER AND THE REST IS FROM LAKES

2234
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:08,990
Junsoo.

2235
01:37:09,057 --> 01:37:10,058
[exclaims]

2236
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:11,693
[both laughing]

2237
01:37:11,759 --> 01:37:13,461
CAMERA: PLEASE SPARE ME

2238
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:16,230
HIS PRANKS ARE NEVER-ENDING

2239
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:18,466
STAFF: AT LEAST SPARE THE MEMORY CARD

2240
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:20,735
A fall warning popped up.

2241
01:37:20,802 --> 01:37:22,570
-A fall warning?
-Yes.

2242
01:37:22,637 --> 01:37:25,406
AND HIS ALONE TIME
WITH THE CAMERA BEGINS...

2243
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:28,576
EXPERIENCING ZERO GRAVITY

2244
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:31,379
STRETCHING

2245
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:33,348
A drone view.

2246
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:34,582
Jimin, a drone view.

2247
01:37:34,649 --> 01:37:35,850
LIKE A HUMAN CAMERA CRANE

2248
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,819
-Who are you filming?
-Just ahead of me.

2249
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,955
A view of our feet.

2250
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:44,459
EXPERIENCING HOW IT FEELS TO BE THEIR BAGS

2251
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:45,727
THEY ARRIVE AT THE SQUARE

2252
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:47,762
-We're back quickly.
-Right.

2253
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:49,831
[Jimin humming]

2254
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:53,768
It'll be nice if we have a few glasses
of beer since it's our last night.

2255
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:55,670
-All together?
-Yes.

2256
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:56,838
Then let's buy some.

2257
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:58,439
Our last night in Switzerland.

2258
01:37:58,506 --> 01:37:59,974
Let's have it by the hotel.

2259
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,709
That sounds nice too.

2260
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:05,246
Do we buy some beer?
The hotel must have beer.

2261
01:38:05,313 --> 01:38:07,215
-You're right.
-We have a veranda.

2262
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:08,282
[Jimin] Let's go in.

2263
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:11,819
-We can use the franc only here, right?
-Yes.

2264
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,323
I've pocketed and saved
quite a lot of francs.

2265
01:38:16,691 --> 01:38:18,659
I've saved them little by little

2266
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,795
-to feed you.
-What?

2267
01:38:22,797 --> 01:38:24,665
Do you get how an elder member feels?

2268
01:38:28,436 --> 01:38:29,804
BEEP

2269
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:36,411
[Jimin] I'll just have wine, then.

2270
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:37,478
No.

2271
01:38:38,346 --> 01:38:42,817
DRINKING WATER INSTEAD OF WINE

2272
01:38:42,884 --> 01:38:44,352
I want water too.

2273
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,753
I put my mouth to it.

2274
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:46,988
Do you want a new bottle?

2275
01:38:47,054 --> 01:38:48,556
-You have it?
-Yes.

2276
01:38:48,623 --> 01:38:50,525
Then I'd like one.

2277
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:55,029
NOT FOR FREE

2278
01:38:57,532 --> 01:38:58,699
-Jung Kook.
-What?

2279
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,234
Say, "Please."

2280
01:39:00,802 --> 01:39:01,936
Just give it to me.

2281
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:03,337
"Please."

2282
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:04,639
Are you kidding me?

2283
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:06,841
I'm 27.

2284
01:39:06,908 --> 01:39:08,376
JIMIN DOESN'T GIVE UP

2285
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,278
I'm too old for that.

2286
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,280
-"Please."
-[yells]

2287
01:39:12,346 --> 01:39:13,347
Do you see it?

2288
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:17,618
Please.

2289
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:19,287
Please.

2290
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:22,056
THRILLED

2291
01:39:24,592 --> 01:39:26,127
I didn't hear it.

2292
01:39:26,194 --> 01:39:28,663
You should've listened carefully.

2293
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:31,098
Come on. The water is with me.

2294
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:32,500
Once is enough.

2295
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:33,768
I didn't hear it!

2296
01:39:33,835 --> 01:39:34,969
Jeez!

2297
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:38,406
"Please."

2298
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:40,174
Goodness.

2299
01:39:40,241 --> 01:39:41,776
DEEPLY TORN

2300
01:39:41,843 --> 01:39:43,044
I'll hand it right away.

2301
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:45,112
Okay. Please.

2302
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:47,181
[Jimin laughs]

2303
01:39:47,248 --> 01:39:48,783
-That's not it.
-I did it.

2304
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,985
-"Please."
-Please.

2305
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:52,653
Isn't this it?

2306
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:54,889
HE'S AWARDED WITH WATER

2307
01:39:54,956 --> 01:39:56,023
I did it right!

2308
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,694
JIMIN LOVES IT THE MORE HE THINKS OF IT

2309
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,162
It's hilarious.

2310
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:03,030
Gosh, it's hilarious.

2311
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:06,701
That was a legendary scene.

2312
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:08,002
I better clap in advance.

2313
01:40:08,069 --> 01:40:09,203
MARKING HIS CUTE SCENE

2314
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:10,438
It's nice.

2315
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:13,107
THE CAMERA TURNED OFF AT THIS MOMENT...

2316
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:14,342
-It turned off.
-Really?

2317
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:16,010
I even clapped.

2318
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:19,780
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

2319
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:22,650
This is the last night in Switzerland.

2320
01:40:24,919 --> 01:40:25,920
How do you feel?

2321
01:40:26,287 --> 01:40:30,925
Uh, it was short, and even shorter.

2322
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:33,828
HE JUST MEANS HE'S SAD IT'S ENDING

2323
01:40:33,895 --> 01:40:35,463
It's a shame.

2324
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:36,531
"Please."

2325
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:39,967
But this isn't the end of this show.

2326
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,169
We don't know how things will be.

2327
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:43,638
If you think this show

2328
01:40:44,906 --> 01:40:46,207
will end with this,

2329
01:40:46,274 --> 01:40:47,909
that's a huge misunderstanding.

2330
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:49,277
Humongous.

2331
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:50,878
A humongous misunderstanding.

2332
01:40:50,945 --> 01:40:53,014
We could go to Busan.

2333
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,149
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA?

2334
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:56,684
We have to go to Busan, though.

2335
01:40:56,751 --> 01:40:57,818
Why?

2336
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,921
-It's our hometown.
-You don't know much.

2337
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:00,988
That's why I must go.

2338
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,089
I don't know either.

2339
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:03,157
Exactly.

2340
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:04,225
There are

2341
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,228
-many beautiful places in Busan.
-Right.

2342
01:41:07,295 --> 01:41:08,696
I don't know much about Busan.

2343
01:41:08,763 --> 01:41:09,997
I know less.

2344
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:14,001
I moved to Seoul when I was 15.
I didn't get to do anything there.

2345
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,671
You were a little kid.

2346
01:41:17,505 --> 01:41:19,774
Gosh, it was so nice in Switzerland.

2347
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,310
If only we could speak
better English, right?

2348
01:41:23,344 --> 01:41:25,212
Our trip would've been more pleasant.

2349
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,915
Anyway, the francs we have left,

2350
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:30,518
we can't spend it anymore, right?

2351
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:32,386
You can exchange them.

2352
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:34,789
That could actually be better, Jimin.

2353
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:36,357
-The exchange rate is high.
-Yes.

2354
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:39,360
-If we exchange it there, it's better.
-Right.

2355
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,128
THE NIGHT DEEPENS,

2356
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:43,664
ALONG WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS
FOR THE NEXT TRAVEL SPOT

2357
01:41:44,532 --> 01:41:46,200
-[Jimin] Will you film it?
-Me?

2358
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:47,335
[Jimin] Yes, it's nice.

2359
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:49,170
-Film it well.
-Okay.

2360
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:53,341
THEY'RE BEHIND THE WALL

2361
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:56,277
REHEARSING

HAVING A WORK MOMENT AFTER A WHILE
SINCE THE TRIP BEGAN

2364
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:04,719
[Jimin] What do you think?

2365
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:08,689
MONITORING THE REHEARSAL VIDEO

2366
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:10,825
Why don't we do it like this?

2367
01:42:10,925 --> 01:42:11,926
THE CLIENT LIKES IT

2368
01:42:12,026 --> 01:42:15,229
SETTING UP THE LIGHTING

2369
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,497
No, it was better before.

2370
01:42:16,564 --> 01:42:17,898
-[Jimin] This?
-Yes.

2371
01:42:17,999 --> 01:42:19,867
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

2372
01:42:19,934 --> 01:42:21,135
Let's film it.

2373
01:42:21,736 --> 01:42:24,205
THE DIRECTOR IS READY

2374
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,015

2375

LAUGHING

2376
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:39,487
A COOL ENDING

2377
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:42,723
-What? Did I make many mistakes?
-No.

2378
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:46,227

#JIMIN & JUNG KOOK'S JOINT WORK
#CHALLENGE_SUCCESS

2381
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:04,745
THANKS, JIMIN AND JUNG KOOK

2382
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:08,749
Gosh, I can't speak English.

2383
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:12,319
What is this?

2384
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,056
CHECKING THE PRODUCT NAME FIRST

2385
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:19,527
HIS SHOULDERS SHOW A LACK OF CONFIDENCE

2386
01:43:19,593 --> 01:43:21,462
Gosh, I feel pressured.

2387
01:43:22,396 --> 01:43:25,099
HE TAKES THE ROOM PHONE AFTER HESITATING

2388
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:28,002
JUNG KOOK ARRIVES JUST IN TIME

2389
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:29,070
What's that?

2390
01:43:29,603 --> 01:43:31,072
I'm going to order beer.

2391
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:35,276
-Jimin, do I wash up first?
-Yes.

2392
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:38,913
NERVOUS

[in English] Room number...

2395
01:43:49,123 --> 01:43:50,124
Yeah.

2396
01:43:50,858 --> 01:43:51,892
Yes.

2397
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,428
Thank you.

2398
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:57,732
HE SMOOTHLY MAKES AN ORDER

2399
01:43:58,332 --> 01:44:01,202
THANKS TO JIMIN,
THEY GET TO SOOTHE THEIR SADNESS...

2400
01:44:02,269 --> 01:44:05,039
THE DARK NIGHT IN ZÜRICH PASSES

2401
01:44:05,706 --> 01:44:08,743
AND THE LAST MORNING IN SWITZERLAND
FINALLY COMES

2402
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:12,279
THE SUNLIGHT SHINES DOWN
AS IF TO SOOTH THEIR SADNESS

2403
01:44:12,947 --> 01:44:14,882
[Jung Kook] Where is it?
Where could it be?

2404
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:18,352
THEY ARE UP EARLY TO PACK UP

2405
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:19,754
Where? I have no idea.

2406
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:21,956
I'm clueless.

2407
01:44:22,523 --> 01:44:25,426
I'LL GET GOING FIRST

2408
01:44:25,493 --> 01:44:28,696
I didn't know how long the flight will be,
so I slept really late.

2409
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:30,664
I didn't...

2410
01:44:31,465 --> 01:44:33,901
fall sleep until after 5 a.m.

2411
01:44:33,968 --> 01:44:34,969
5:30 a.m.?

2412
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:39,507
Then I couldn't resist...

2413
01:44:40,674 --> 01:44:42,443
and fell asleep. Hold on.

2414
01:44:43,144 --> 01:44:44,512
Is Jimin good on his own?

2415
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:49,517
KIND-HEARTED JUNG KOOK WAITED FOR HIM

2416
01:44:53,521 --> 01:44:55,523
I had so much fun in Switzerland.

2417
01:44:57,191 --> 01:44:58,959
[in Korean] It was fun, thankfully.

2418
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:02,096
[Jung Kook speaking indistinctly]

2419
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:05,499
I slept well by mistake.

2420
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:08,302
You slept well by mistake?

2421
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:11,138
I didn't want to sleep.
You saw me doze off and slept.

2422
01:45:11,205 --> 01:45:12,206
Yes.

2423
01:45:15,609 --> 01:45:17,511
"I can't sleep now..."

2424
01:45:17,578 --> 01:45:19,914
HE PASSED OUT

2425
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,416
GREETING WITH HIS EYES

2426
01:45:23,217 --> 01:45:24,618
Hello.

2427
01:45:26,287 --> 01:45:27,955
Will you drive? Or should I?

2428
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:30,257
-Why don't I do it this time?
-Okay.

2429
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:31,826
JIMIN IS TO DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT

2430
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:41,702
PUTTING THE LUGGAGE IN THE CAR

2431
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:43,337
Off we go.

2432
01:45:43,404 --> 01:45:47,608
OFF TO THE AIRPORT!

2433
01:45:50,144 --> 01:45:51,745
[Jung Kook] Which one is my camera?

2434
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,014
I'm waving my hand so hard.

2435
01:45:56,317 --> 01:45:59,253
HIS BODY SHAKES TOO

2436
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:03,624
[Jung Kook] The weather is so nice
with only a few clouds.

2437
01:46:03,691 --> 01:46:05,759
AS THEY TAKE IN THE STREETS
FOR THE LAST TIME

2438
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:07,461
We're almost there.

2439
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:09,730
THEY ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT

2440
01:46:09,797 --> 01:46:12,199
I had a good time in Switzerland.

2441
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:16,270
A camera popped up again.

2442
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:18,873
WAVING AUTOMATICALLY

2443
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:19,940
Can it capture this?

2444
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:21,442
Probably not.

2445
01:46:21,508 --> 01:46:23,377
IT DID CAPTURE IT

2446
01:46:23,444 --> 01:46:24,912
The last moment in Switzerland.

2447
01:46:24,979 --> 01:46:25,980
The last moment.

2448
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:29,884
THEY ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT

2449
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:32,653
WHERE COULD THEIR NEXT TRAVEL SPOT BE...?

2450
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,657
WAITING IN THE CAR FOR A BIT

2451
01:46:38,659 --> 01:46:43,664
Wait. What if some cute music
is played to this dancing scene?

2452
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:46,934
THEN HE'LL LOOK CUTE AND ADORABLE

2453
01:46:47,001 --> 01:46:50,437
SHOWING OFF HIS HIDDEN CHARM

2454
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:56,410
IT STRANGELY GOES WELL...

2455
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:03,150
ANYONE CAN TELL IT'S SUSPICIOUS

2456
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,020
They're here!

2457
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:08,055
THEY'RE GIVEN THEIR TICKETS

2458
01:47:08,122 --> 01:47:09,523
Let's see where we're going.

2459
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:14,728
LET'S SEE

2460
01:47:18,198 --> 01:47:19,400
What?

2461
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:20,467
It says Incheon.

2462
01:47:21,135 --> 01:47:23,170
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2463
01:47:23,237 --> 01:47:24,939
-You're right.
-Incheon?

2464
01:47:25,506 --> 01:47:26,740
Are we going to Korea?

2465
01:47:26,807 --> 01:47:27,908
And transfer there.

2466
01:47:27,975 --> 01:47:29,109
-For real?
-What?

2467
01:47:30,144 --> 01:47:31,512
Don't lie.

2468
01:47:31,578 --> 01:47:34,048
Why do we transfer in Korea?

2469
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:37,952
I mean, we'll go
all the way there to transfer?

2470
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:39,954
Can that be?

2471
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,488
It's a lie.

2472
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:43,724
Don't lie!

2473
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:45,759
What do you take us for?

2474
01:47:45,826 --> 01:47:47,027
-Jung Kook.
-Yes?

2475
01:47:47,094 --> 01:47:51,198
You had something scheduled on the 29th,
but you canceled it because of this.

2476
01:47:51,265 --> 01:47:56,470
I had a dance lesson scheduled
on the 28th and 29th,

2477
01:47:56,537 --> 01:47:59,306
but you said we'd still be abroad then.

2478
01:47:59,373 --> 01:48:00,908
It was a lie, I think.

2479
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:02,076
How confusing.

2480
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:04,645
They did it to confuse you.

2481
01:48:04,712 --> 01:48:07,314
[singing]

2482
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:10,250
I didn't even imagine it'd be Incheon.

2483
01:48:11,352 --> 01:48:13,520
Where in Korea, though?

2484
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,860
Let's go to Korea!

2485
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:25,432
WE'RE GOING TO KOREA!

2486
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:29,436
Let's go!

2487
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:33,941
WE'RE OFF TO OUR NEXT DESTINATION

2488
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:43,350
THEY'VE TAKEN THE FIRST CLASS SEATS

2489
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:47,021
Jimin, here I am.

2490
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:49,189
Ouch, my head.

2491
01:48:50,824 --> 01:48:53,260
IT'S ALWAYS EXCITING TO BE ON A FLIGHT

[Jung Kook singing]

2493
01:48:56,797 --> 01:49:01,402
THEY ONLY HAVE TO REST UP NOW

2494
01:49:01,468 --> 01:49:03,437
[in Korean] Jung Kook, my hands are dry.

2495
01:49:03,504 --> 01:49:04,638
Apply some hand cream.

2496
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:06,073
Oh, that will do.

2497
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,241
Let me apply some.

2498
01:49:09,443 --> 01:49:11,178
SMELLING

2499
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:16,216
Is this hand cream? It looks so pretty.

2500
01:49:16,283 --> 01:49:20,621
TAKING ENOUGH ON HIS HAND

2501
01:49:21,188 --> 01:49:23,157
CHECKING ITS SCENT

2502
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:28,162
APPLYING IT THOROUGHLY TO MAKE THEM MOIST

2503
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:34,768
LETTING HIM FEEL THE GOOD SCENT

2504
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:36,770
EMBARRASSED

2505
01:49:36,837 --> 01:49:38,005
Don't you smell anything?

2506
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:39,073
I did.

2507
01:49:40,474 --> 01:49:41,775
Oh, you had it near my nose?

2508
01:49:41,842 --> 01:49:44,144
-Yes.
-No wonder why.

2509
01:49:44,211 --> 01:49:46,013
I was like, "Something smells nice."

2510
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,549
JIMIN LOVES THIS HAND CREAM

2511
01:49:48,615 --> 01:49:52,653
THE PLANE TAKING OFF SMOOTHLY

2512
01:50:00,627 --> 01:50:02,963
SLEEPY...

2513
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:09,336
JIMIN IS FIGHTING SLEEP

2514
01:50:13,574 --> 01:50:17,377
FALLING ASLEEP FEELING MUCH MORE AT EASE

2515
01:50:18,312 --> 01:50:20,247
JUNG KOOK WAKES UP BRIEFLY

2516
01:50:20,314 --> 01:50:23,350
HE CHECKS ON JIMIN

2517
01:50:23,851 --> 01:50:26,320
AND FALLS ASLEEP AGAIN...

2518
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:31,825
THEY WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
EVEN IF SOMEONE KIDNAPS THEM

2519
01:50:31,892 --> 01:50:36,597
JIMIN WAKES UP

2520
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,801
Jung Kook.

2521
01:50:42,503 --> 01:50:48,575
JUNG KOOK'S SLEEP PROTECTOR

2522
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:51,145
LETTING HIM SLEEP AND ORDERING A MEAL

2523
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:53,180
-[in English] It's okay.
-Good? Perfect.

2524
01:50:53,247 --> 01:50:55,415
[in Korean] I finally get to have
Korean food.

2525
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:57,651
Kimchi.

2526
01:50:58,252 --> 01:50:59,253
Finally.

2527
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,088
A Korean food-eating video.

2528
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:05,192
GETTING READY TO DIG IN

2529
01:51:09,163 --> 01:51:10,397
SAVORING

2530
01:51:10,464 --> 01:51:17,471
BUSY ENJOYING LONG-AWAITED KOREAN FOOD

2531
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:23,010
Gosh, I'm full.

2532
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,078
I'm so full.

2533
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:29,349
SEE YOU IN A BIT

2534
01:51:30,984 --> 01:51:33,320
WHILE THE TWO ARE SOUND ASLEEP,

2535
01:51:33,387 --> 01:51:37,558
THEY'RE GETTING FARTHER AWAY
FROM SWITZERLAND

2536
01:51:37,624 --> 01:51:39,626
JUNG KOOK WAKES UP AGAIN

2537
01:51:40,394 --> 01:51:43,030
SNACKS ARE SERVED
TO PASSENGERS WHO ARE AWAKE

2538
01:51:44,097 --> 01:51:47,901
LET'S SEE...

2539
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:51,772
CHOOSING CHOCOLATE VERY CAREFULLY

2540
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:53,674
-[in English] This.
-You can take it.

2541
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:57,511
You can have more.

2542
01:51:57,578 --> 01:51:58,579
ONE MORE...?

2543
01:51:58,645 --> 01:52:00,380
IT'S SO HARD TO CHOOSE JUST ONE...

2544
01:52:01,348 --> 01:52:03,650
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT OFFERS
THE WHOLE BOX TO HIM

2545
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:04,718
Really?

2546
01:52:05,852 --> 01:52:07,054
AN UNEXPECTED GIFT

2547
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,255
Thank you.

2548
01:52:12,092 --> 01:52:14,061
[in Korean] She gave me all the chocolate.

2549
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:17,297
THANK YOU SO MUCH

2550
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:19,967
I love sweets.

2551
01:52:20,934 --> 01:52:22,102
And she gave me

2552
01:52:23,437 --> 01:52:24,538
all the chocolate.

2553
01:52:27,441 --> 01:52:28,809
It's good.

2554
01:52:29,676 --> 01:52:33,247
I should have just one more,
hide the rest...

2555
01:52:35,282 --> 01:52:36,717
and give it to the staff.

2556
01:52:38,652 --> 01:52:41,488
HE'S SO SWEET...

2557
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:47,861
[exclaiming softly in delight]

2558
01:52:50,564 --> 01:52:53,533
THE GIFT MADE HIM ALL HAPPY

2559
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,735
Chocolate.

2560
01:52:55,636 --> 01:52:57,404
Chocolate.

2561
01:52:57,471 --> 01:52:59,873
I got chocolate.

2562
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:02,943
Goodness.

2563
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,711
Stay in there.

2564
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:08,248
HE KEEPS IT SAFE

2565
01:53:08,315 --> 01:53:09,650
[groans]

2566
01:53:09,716 --> 01:53:10,817
Let's lie down.

2567
01:53:10,884 --> 01:53:13,787
LET'S LIE DOWN AGAIN

2568
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:21,094
This is what happiness is.

2569
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:28,468
OH, RIGHT

2570
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:31,538
Bye.

2571
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:33,840
Goodbye.

2572
01:53:35,108 --> 01:53:36,310
This is a mic.

2573
01:53:36,376 --> 01:53:38,045
HE REVEALS HIS SWEET GIFT SET

2574
01:53:38,111 --> 01:53:41,081
I had its battery fully charged.

2575
01:53:42,049 --> 01:53:43,350
Huh.

2576
01:53:43,417 --> 01:53:47,654
I recharged Jimin's camera and mine too.

2577
01:53:47,721 --> 01:53:50,157
I'm even recharging a portable battery.

2578
01:53:51,358 --> 01:53:52,893
SINCERE THANKS FROM THE STAFF...

2579
01:53:52,959 --> 01:53:54,094
Do you get it?

2580
01:53:54,161 --> 01:53:57,698
YOU REALLY ARE THE BEST

2581
01:53:58,432 --> 01:54:03,437
Anyway, we're arriving in Korea
in two hours and 20 minutes.

2582
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:06,907
Let me rest up until then.

2583
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:09,176
HE'S OFF TO RECHARGE HIMSELF FOR REAL NOW

2584
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:13,580
GETTING CLOSER TO THE NEXT DESTINATION
AFTER THE TRIP IN SWITZERLAND...

2585
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:18,151
WHAT KINDS OF PLACES AND MEMORIES
ARE WAITING FOR US?

2586
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:19,953
-[director] All right, guys.
-Yes?

2587
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,588
This show isn't over.

2588
01:54:21,655 --> 01:54:23,290
CONFUSED

2589
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:25,792
This is a kit for the next travel spot.

2590
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,229
Why don't I have it?

2591
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:31,665
THE NEXT DESTINATION MAKES HIM LAUGH

2592
01:54:31,732 --> 01:54:33,600
Our next travel spot is...

2593
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:38,405
-Right away.
-Is this right?

2594
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:40,307
We are. All right, then.

2595
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,842
WHERE'S THE NEXT TRAVEL SPOT?

2596
01:54:41,908 --> 01:54:43,210
IT WILL BE REVEALED NEXT WEEK

2597
01:54:43,276 --> 01:54:44,878
-There are so many people.
-It sure is different.

2598
