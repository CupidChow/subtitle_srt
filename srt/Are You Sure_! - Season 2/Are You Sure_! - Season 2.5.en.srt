is using my phone at night.

13
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,647
So annoying.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,048

18
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,188
MAKING WISHES TOGETHER

19
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,924

THE TWO DECIDE TO WALK TO THE HOT TUG SPOT

33
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,783
We should do this to make

34
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,385
ourselves more visible.

35
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,954
It gets darker this way.

36
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,392
It's so cute.

37

Whoa, hey.

43
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,406

00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,464
Why are you staring? You wanna go?

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,567
Go ahead then. I'm not afraid.

JIMIN TRIES STEERING THE BOAT

132
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,558
-Keep it like this.
-Yeah, that's the plan.

133
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,426
I kinda feel like a captain.

134
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,597
CHECKS THE FIREPIT TOO

135
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,132

Taking a bath in the middle of a lake.

139

A RARE AND SPECIAL MOMENT

140
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,651
Should we toast?

141
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,386
Sure. Is this beer?

00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,855
READY TO TOAST AT THIS MOMENT

143
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,592

[grunts]

152
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,250
By the way,

153
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,852
you think you can jump in the water?

154
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,921
I don't want to. It's cold.

155
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,189
[Jimin chuckles]

156
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,724
Your saliva's dripping.

157
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,858
Because it's cold.

158
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,460
It happens when it's cold.

159
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,362
I'm up for anything.

160
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,032
MAX CONFIDENCE

161
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,333
You're going in?

162
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,702
Jimin says he's going.

163
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,772
It'll look like I'm really going, right?

164
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,707
I was planning to float right here.

165
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,711
IT WAS FAKE

166
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,181
CHECKING THE LAKE TEMPERATURE,
JUST IN CASE (?)

167
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,383

-Right now?
-Yeah.

176
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,038
What pose?

177
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,839
Shout "Are You Sure?!" and jump.

178
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,274
[in English] Okay, okay.

180
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,812
Are You Sure?! What?

181
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,249

Hey, what the heck?

186

What the heck?

187
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,467
PURE JOY

188
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,668
REVENGE

189
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,137
[both laughing]

190
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,273
Ah, I'm scared.

191
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,809
[exclaims]

192
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,244
TRIED DIPPING HIS HAND IN

193
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,314
ENDS UP FALLING IN AGAIN HIMSELF

194
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,549
What happened?

195
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,817
I fell in.

196
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,553
Okay, let's go.

197
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,822
We're not leaving until you jump too.

198
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,290
SECOND ATTEMPT

199
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,925
It's freezing.

200
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,026
It's so cold.

201
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,296
[director] We'll give you some pork belly
if you do this.

202
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,364
Okay.

203
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,666
PERSUADED IN 1 SECOND

204
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,768
I'm really good at handling people.

205
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,471
Jung Kook agreed right away.

206
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,606
"We'll give you pork belly." "Okay!"

207
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,875
A MAN EASILY SWAYED BY FOOD

208
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,276
-Now's the time.
-Yeah.

209
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,344
READY TO JUMP IN

210
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,013
We have to shout "Are You Sure?!"

211
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,748
Like, "Are You Sure?!"

212
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,549
I'm ready.

213
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,185
One, two, three.

214
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,321
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

215
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,091
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

216
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,561
-Are You Sure?!
-Are You Sure?!

217
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,667
It's cold.

218
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,769
So cold.

219
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,971
Freezing.

220
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,073
It's so cold.

221
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,412
QUICKLY RETURNING TO THE HOT TUG

222
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,114
Wow, seriously.

223
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:09,816
Oh, man.

224
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,353
CHECKING HOW THEY LOOK
EVEN AFTER JUMPING IN THE WATER

225
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,955
Let's swim all the way over there.

226
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,490
It's going to be so cold.

227
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,593
It's beautiful, that's youth for you.

228
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,896
You know?

229
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,170
SWIM TOGETHER?

230
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,938
I don't think you'll join me.

231
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,940
-I'll go if you go.
-Really?

232
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,476
-Pre-heating.
-Pre-cooling.

233
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,710
Pre-cooling?

234
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,781
PRE-COOLING(?) BEFORE JUMPING IN

235
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,084
-I'm done pre-cooling.
-Let's go.

236
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,151
Let's go.

237
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,922
JIMIN JUMPS IN FIRST THIS TIME TOO

238
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,624
BUT IT'S SO COLD...

239
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,260
NOT AGAIN...?

240
00:09:55,795 --> 00:10:00,567
THIS TIME, A BOLD DIVE

241
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,273
SWIMMING IN A FAIRYTALE-LIKE LANDSCAPE

242
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,044
A MOMENT THAT WILL STAY
IN MEMORY LIKE A PAINTING

243
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,278
Jimin!

244
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,881
-Jimin.
-Why are you so fast?

245
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,283
SUDDENLY TURNS INTO A CHASE SCENE

246
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,918
This feels good.

247
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,123
Moving around makes it a bit better.

248
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,461
JIMIN LETS HIMSELF FLOAT
AND GETS LOST IN THE VIEW

249
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,164
SUDDENLY CHARGES TOWARD THE CAMERA (?)

250
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,166
Dog paddle.

251
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,704
[both laughing]

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,743
DOUBLE SPIN

253
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,011
HUH?

254
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,480
We're getting farther from the boat.

255
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,617
Like we're drifting away.

256
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,352
DRIFTING FARTHER AWAY...

257
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,822
HEADING BACK BEFORE THEY GET TOO FAR

258
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:57,957
Let's go.

259
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,659
-How do I even move?
-Just go.

260
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,861
I'll paddle with my feet.

261
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,263
I'll paddle with my hands.

262
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,934
A BRAND-NEW TWO-PERSON SWIMMING TECHNIQUE

263
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,204
It's not cold anymore.

264
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,207
You'll be freezing once you get in again.

265
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,710
TIME TO WARM THEMSELVES UP
BACK IN THE HOT TUG

266
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,845
What is this?

267
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,116
-Nice.
-Nice.

268
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,184
SPLASH

269
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,754
NEVER-ENDING PRANKS

270
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,790
-It reminds me of the army days.
-Yes, it's been a while.

271
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,192
It's been a while.

272
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,461
That wasn't it.

273
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,330
This is it.

274
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,205
COUNTERATTACK BEGINS

275
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,875
GETTING BACK TENFOLD FOR WHAT HE DID

276
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,779
FINAL SPLASH

277
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,915
REVENGE COMPLETE

278
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,884
That was pretty much my military life.

279
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,287
I hit first and get it back
seven times harder.

280
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:06,159
I think people would probably expect us
to have a conversation here.

281
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,561
It just turned into
a full-on variety show.

282
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,566
Do you want to go over there?

283
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,068
-All the way?
-Yeah.

284
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,903
Okay. Let's go all the way.

285
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,738
Let's go. Let's go for it.

286
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,139
HEADING TOWARDS THE OTHER END

287
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,008
ALL OF A SUDDEN

288
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:26,079
[Jimin & Jung Kook singing]

289
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:31,651
[continues singing]

290
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,090
LIKE IN CHILDREN'S CARTOONS

291
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,227
THEY GO ON AN ADVENTURE
TO THE END OF THE LAKE

292
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,664
THEY GO ON AN ADVENTURE
TO THE END OF THE LAKE

293
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:49,168
HE NEVER FORGETS TO BE ON CAMERA

294
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,705
SECURING A CAMERA SHOT
FOR JUNG KOOK, TOO

295
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,009
[Jung Kook singing]

296
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,911
Right here, swoosh.

297
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,047
Spin.

298
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,448
Whirlpool.

299
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,022
[humming theme
of "Pirates of the Caribbean"]

300
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:15,061
SUDDENLY TURNS INTO
"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"

301
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,129
Twice...

302
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,230
Twice already...

303
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,799
[together] Abandoned
on this wretched island.

304
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,335
AN INTRUDER(?) APPEARS

305
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,337
THE INTRUDER

306
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,406
-What's their problem?
-Those punks.

307
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,774
Let's go that way.

308
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,009
Set sail, full speed ahead.

309
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,113
THEIR VOYAGE BEGINS AGAIN

310
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,016
CAPTAIN JEON HOLDING THE HELM

311
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,952
AND NAVIGATOR PARK CHECKING THE ROUTE

312
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,855
-Captain, to the left.
-Yes.

313
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,490
To the left?

314
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,692
Isn't it to the right?

315
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,328
THE BOAT TURNING TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT

316
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,030
That's correct.

317
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,401
RECHECKING THE ROUTE

318
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,604
Let's go. Time to eat.

319
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,373
Carbonara.

320
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,275
Carbonara again.

321
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,579
-Chase them.
-Chase them.

322
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,915
Say hi. Wave your hand.

323
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,450
Get closer.

324
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,418
-Closer, closer.
-Closer.

325
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,220
Block the way.

326
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,255
Block the ferry's path.

327
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,992
HOT TUG BOAT SUDDENLY STARTS ROCKING

328
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,261
FACING CRISIS

329
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,897
Captain, the ship's about to sink.

330
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,165
Stay calm!

331
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,835
-Captain.
-Stay calm.

332
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,038
It's just waves made by that ship.

333
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,573
-Captain.
-Yeah?

334
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,175
When are we landing, Captain?

335
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,243
Just wait a bit.

336
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,645
THE CONFIDENT CAPTAIN'S SECRET

337
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,949
Isn't it over there? No? Is it that way?

338
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,118
Our boat went that way, right?

339
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,185
No?

340
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,587
Our boat wasn't there.

341
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,155
-It's there, right?
-Are you sure?

342
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,790
Isn't it that way?

343
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:51,891
I don't think so.

344
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,025
I don't know the way.

345
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,895
Where are we supposed to go?

346
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,097
Which way do we go to get home?

347
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,869
We don't have a radio.

348
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,573
-We do.
-Huh?

349
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,109
-[director over radio] Can you hear me?
-Yes.

350
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,711
Yes.

351
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,146
Here it is.

352
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,480
-This is it.
-Right.

353
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,049
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

354
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,086
Where the big ship
that looks like a ferry is,

355
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:24,123
we're supposed to land there,
I mean, dock there, right?

356
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,025
Yes. Come straight ahead.

357
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,226
[in English] Roger that.

358
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,262
Say "copy that."

359
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,332
-[in Korean] Copy that.
-Copy that.

360
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,968
Only real pros say that kind of stuff.

361
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,672
-Should we steer it toward that ship?
-Yeah.

362
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,607
-You can drive well, right?
-Yes.

363
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,909
Just ram it.

364
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,445
Those people are totally filming us.

365
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,614
HOT TUG DOESN'T OPERATE IN SUMMER
SO THEY MUST LOOK LIKE A RARE SIGHT

366
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,016
Let's go, speed up.

367
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,217
We can't go faster.

368
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,320
[Jimin] Is this max power?

369
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,788
RUNNING AT FULL SPEED

370
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,191
Informing we're being photographed.

371
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,160
TRYING TO RADIO THE CREW AGAIN

372
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,895
Using a really nice camera.

373
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,931
Even saw a flash earlier.

374
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,201
Someone's filming on their phone too.

375
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,502
We're doomed.

376
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,103
It's so embarrassing.

377
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,541
We're shaking in embarrassment.

378
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:21,147
SOMEHOW MAKING IT BACK TO THE DOCK

379
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,549
-[in English] Good driver.
-Yeah, he's the captain.

380
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,318
[in English] Yeah, captain.

381
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,752
Captain, you're doing good.

382
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,954
-Good.
-Yeah.

383
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,021
Very good, man.

384
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,356
GOOD DRIVER CAPTAIN JEON

385
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,858
-How was it?
-Good.

386
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,860
-Good experience? Nice.
-Yeah.

387
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,661
QUICKLY PUTTING ON THEIR BATHROBES

388
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,197
-It's so cold!
-It's so cold, yeah?

389
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,567
Come back home?

390
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,503
[both laughing]

391
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,439
-[in Korean] Thank you.
-[in Korean] Thank you.

392
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,307
-[in Korean] Thank you.
-Thank you.

393
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,675
We're going to play a game.

394
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,843
-A game?
-Yeah.

395
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,446
What did you guys eat just now?

396
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,415
SNACKS THEY HAPPILY ENJOYED IN THE HOT TUG

397
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,284
-[Jimin] This?
-We weren't to have this?

398
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,419
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Seriously.

399
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,221
You had some chips earlier too.

400
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,590
-No, we didn't.
-I saw it.

401
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,359
WE ALREADY SAW IT

402
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,595
-You guys went grocery shopping, right?
-Yes.

403
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:14,267
The price of the food
you ate inside the hot tug.

404
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,669
-We have to guess?
-Tell us the total price.

405
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:20,039
YOU ATE

406
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,241
AND DRANK

407
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,744
NOW GUESS THE TOTAL PRICE

408
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,379
MARGIN OF ERROR: ONLY 2 FRANCS

409
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,415
CORRECT: GET DOUBLE AMOUNT
WRONG: GET THE AMOUNT DEDUCTED

410
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,417
I think it's 7.9 francs.

411
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,420
-Okay, and the snacks?
-Snacks?

412
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,389
Two bags of snacks and this one.

413
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,457
-[Jung Kook] Yeah.
-This one's more pricey.

414
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,826
Maybe about 3.4.

415
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,361
And the rest is 2 francs?

416
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,429
Two...

417
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,231
2.4?

418
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,334
How about around 16 francs in total?

419
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,269
Maybe I underestimated... Wait, no.

420
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,972
-What is it?
-What's your gut feeling?

421
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,740
I think about the same.

422
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,742
Between 14 and 16?

423
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,210
Then should we go with 15?

424
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,913
But it might be a bit more.
Let's go with 16.

425
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,481
-How's that?
-Okay.

426
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,083
-Is 16 good?
-Yeah, fine.

427
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,151
-Not bad?
-Not bad.

428
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,886
-I have no idea for this.
-Yeah?

429
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,021
-Let's go with 16.
-One, two, three.

430
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
-16.
-16 francs.

431
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,892
We said a margin of error is 2 francs.

432
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,093
RECEIPT HANDED OVER

433
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,063
WHAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER?

434
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,898
We got it right.

435
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,267
I was right.

436
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,335
Awesome.

437
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,004
ONLY 1.6 FRANCS OFF
PERFECT SUCCESS!

438
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,606
We'll gratefully take it.

439
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,507
We nailed the price.

440
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,209
That's me.

441
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:35,648
You'll get double the total,
17.6 times 2 francs.

442
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,716
That's 34.

443
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,619
-That was good.
-That's me.

444
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,687
We have good teamwork lately, huh?

445
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,223
I expected it wasn't that expensive.

446
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,525
I was thinking 15.

447
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,761
Would've been wrong.

448
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,630
A VICTORY MADE POSSIBLE BY JUNG KOOK

449
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,732
-Exactly 16.
-15, 16, perfect guess.

450
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,133
Perfect.

451
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,568
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

-Thank you so much.

[in Korean] This is nice.
We got the allowance.

457

[in Korean] You jumped in the water,
so we got pork belly.

458

That's right.

459
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,051
-We got the meat.
-Free pork belly today.

460
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,688

It's not spicy at all.

531

00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,433
TIME TO DECIDE

547
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,501
Let's grill it.

548
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,569
-Grill?
-Yes.

549
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,870
-Okay.
-Yeah.

550
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,171
Two bags of noodles?

551
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,539
DECIDING HOW MANY NOODLES

552
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,841
Or three?

553
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:29,909
Let's do three.

554
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,378
JUST DECIDED TO HAVE THREE BAGS

555
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,979

556
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,148

[Jimin & Jung Kook singing]

558
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,787
That's true happiness. It is.

559
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,590
[Jimin] What should I do?

560
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,225
I'll boil the water.

561
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,728
A pot should be somewhere around here.

562
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,196
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

563
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,999
-Yes.
-Three bags. This pot should work, right?

564
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,135
Yeah, it doesn't need much water anyway.

565
00:23:56,702 --> 00:24:00,472
Just like it says on the back
of the package, clean and simple.

566
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,308
Exactly follow the directions?

567
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,375
Yeah, on the back.

568
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,811
-Without adding anything else?
-Right.

569
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,012
Simple is the best.

570
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,781
-Keeping it simple today.
-Yeah.

571
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,482
How do I... Like this?

572
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,284
TURNING ON THE INDUCTION STOVE

573
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,586
POWER OFF...

574
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,755
Wait, what are you doing?

575
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,823
Just being cute?

576
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,091
[beeping]

577
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,326
Not bad.

578
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,994
When I see machines...

579
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,897
-You're totally hopeless with machines.
-Yeah.

580
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,533
OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS TECH-DUMMY

581
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,402
-Jung Kook, I'll cook rice tomorrow.
-Sounds great.

582
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,905
-I'm going to make rice in this pot.
-Okay.

583
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,741
No, actually, since we're all
eating together...

584
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,277
-I'll use a big pot instead.
-Nice.

585
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,413
I watched like 40 minutes
of rice-cooking videos.

586
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,249
-There's skin on this.
-Yes.

587
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,317
Peel it?

588
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,618
CHECKING THE MEAT

589
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,253
-[Jimin] Start with the skin?
-Yes.

590
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,656
-Make it crispy?
-Yes.

591
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,625
All right. Then I'll set the dishes.

592
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:54,893
The edge...

593
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,765
-You can put the meat here.
-Okay.

594
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,066
SETTING THE TABLE

595
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:05,204
As for the veggies,
just rinse them lightly with water.

596
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,271
Okay.

597
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,440
Maybe a bit of olive oil?

598
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,143
-I'll go grab the camera.
-Sure.

599
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,946
You have to coat it with oil.

600
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,816
THE MAILLARD REACTION
OCCURS WHEN MEAT IS GRILLED

601
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,785
GIVES BROWNED FOOD ITS DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR

602
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,022
See that?

603
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,590
GOLDEN BROWN

00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,326

BEGINS COOKING MEAT IN EARNEST

606
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,967
Just a light sprinkle of salt.

607
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,805
AND A DASH OF PEPPER

608
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,341
No timer. No, I won't set it.

609
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,611
FLUSTERED FINGERS

610
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:50,249
I don't really like pork belly
cooked too crispy.

611
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,316
ALREADY?

612
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,419
Since we're eating it with ramyeon,

613
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,287
-I won't season it too much.
-Okay.

[chuckles] Leave it to me.

626
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,317
Cut this in half.

627
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,386
THE PERFECT ASSISTANT FINDS IT IN ONE GO

628
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,254

-Okay.

630
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,326
You can eat it now.

631
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:37,663
Do you like it crispy
or a bit undercooked?

632
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,731
-Medium. Yeah.
-Right? Good.

635
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,080
Should we grill two more strips?

FIRST BATCH DONE

637
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:57,983
Maybe three more?

638
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,153
-Three? Two?
-Two?

639
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,255
-Three.
-Okay.

640
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,357
THREE MORE STRIPS!

641
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,460
Jimin, should we start boiling
the noodles now?

642
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,561
Okay.

643
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,497
GETTING READY TO COOK THE RAMYEON

644
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,098
Sounds great.

2ND ATTACK TO THEIR SALIVARY GLANDS

652
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,149
It's so simple today.

653
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,717
What does it say on the back?

654
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,086
How are we supposed to cook it?

655
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,488
-Boil for five minutes.
-Okay.

656
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,858
Leave about eight spoonfuls
of water and mix.

657
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:44,096
Since it's three bags, 24 spoonfuls.

658
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,398
-We'll eyeball it.
-Okay.

659
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,267
I like it with a little water left.

660
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,170
-I'll put them in.
-Okay.

661

It's so glistening.

664
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,077
Just one more minute.

665
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,579
You can turn it off then.

666
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,548
-Sounds good.
-In one minute, I'll mix it.

667
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,216
While you're mixing, I'll cut.

668
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,651
-Okay.
-Next.

669
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,452
Wash the veggies.

670
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,221
I'll wash them nicely.

671
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,790
-It'd be perfect if I could do it now.
-You forgot?

672
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,593
No, I just knew I'd mess it up
if I looked away.

673
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,295
I don't trust myself.

674
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:22,701
CHECKING NOODLE QUALITY

675
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,503
-Perfect. Do it now.
-Now?

676
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,873
[Jimin] Need to eyeball exactly
24 spoonfuls of water.

677
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:32,177

679
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,248
Even the lid's hot now. Oh, no.

00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:41,954
TIME FOR PATIENCE

681
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:45,390
I DID IT

682
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,192
Okay, I think it's perfect.

683
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,627
Okay, let's go.

684
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,095
I trust you completely.

685
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,897
Pouring it all in.

686
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:52,998
Of course.

687
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,468
-What do we do?
-Is this a bone?

688
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,003
What should we do?

689
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,739
-What, it just looks too good?
-Mouthwatering.

690
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,442
I learned this from Jung Kook.

691
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,876
APPLYING JUNG KOOK'S TECHNIQUE

692
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,745
Not leaving a single drop behind.

693
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,347
He likes it that way.

694
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,882
-[Jung Kook] Super creamy.
-Creamy, creamy.

695
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,384
-Let's go.
-Shall we?

696
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,119
-Go?
-Veggies.

697

701
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,362
-I'll rinse the lettuce lightly.
-Okay.

00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,741
-[Jung Kook] Let's dig in.
-Let's eat.

707
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,643
I always start with a wrap.

708
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,710
IN A HURRY

709
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,679
-Let's get one more shot.
-Okay.

710
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,514
BUT THEY CAN'T WAIT

711
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,815
I should do that too.

712
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:49,121
I don't eat the wraps normally.
I put the noodles on top.

713
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,390
-Mmm!
-And eat it like that.

714
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,393
-Enjoy.
-Yeah.

715
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,994
-Jimin, let's enjoy.
-Okay.

So good.

720
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,175
BEER IS A MUST

721
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,145

-Cheers.
-Good work today.

723
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,120
The meat's insane.

724
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,589
The noodles are insane.

725
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:28,827
The noodles instead of rice.

726
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,631
PORK BELLY + CARBONARA RAMEN WRAP

727
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:36,535
LOVING IT

728
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,403
-This is it.
-The wrap.

729
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,843
TINGLING

730
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,911
So good.

731
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,615
Honestly, I like it this way,
thicker and creamier.

732
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,784
It goes perfectly with the meat.

733
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,655
CHOMP

734
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:04,096
THE TYPE TO STICK WITH ONE COMBO
ONCE HE FINDS HIS FAVORITE

735
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,164
EATS MEAT SEPARATELY

736
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,467
EATS NOODLES SEPARATELY

737
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,602
EVEN THE LETTUCE... JIMIN'S STYLE

738
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,070
[sighs contentedly]

739
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,806
This might be the best thing here.

740
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,876
The skin's chewy. It makes it even better.

741
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:18,944
Yeah.

742
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,946
-Mmm!
-This is true joy.

743
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,818
STRONGLY AGREES

744
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,888
I actually thought Bibimmen would

745
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,491
go best with the meat.

746
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,227
But this Carbonara one is something else.

747
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:39,498
-It really is.
-This could take first place in my heart.

748
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,033
-Seriously.
-When you eat it with this...

749
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,337
You know, we usually ate it
with regular ramen.

750
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,706
-I think this one is a bit better.
-Yeah.

751
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,275
It's something...

752
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,244
this one.

753
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,546
SCRAPING THE BOTTOM CLEAN

754
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,815
One-and-a-half packets
are perfect for a guy.

755
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,450
-You're not eating?
-I am.

756
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,520
THE REST IS ALL MINE

757
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,822
This gives it a kick.

758
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,326
Perfectly finished, just right.

759
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,561
LAST LETTUCE

760
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,931
SCRAPING IT AGAIN

761
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,666
We really finished it.

762
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,970
CLEARED EVERY LAST BITE

763
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,472
That was so good.

764
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,808
[sighs]

765
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,444
CHEERS

766
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,115
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MEAL

767
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,485
-Thank you for the meal.
-It was amazing.

768
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:38,690
I'm honestly shocked
at how perfectly full I am right now.

769
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,058
[Jimin] Before.

770
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,427
And after.

771
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:47,232
AFTER A MEAL THAT FILLED
BOTH STOMACH AND HEART...

772
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,000
You won the game earlier, right?

773
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,068
Huh?

774
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,203
ALLOWANCE TIME

775
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,270
Thank you.

776
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,672
Ah!

777
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,075
I'll keep it safe.

778
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,513
What kind of exciting things
await us tomorrow?

779
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,415
-Should we clean up first?
-Okay.

780
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,985
-Let's tidy up.
-Good work.

781
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,387
-Good work.
-Slate, please.

782
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,389
We should do it from afar.

783
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,592
One, two, three.

784
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,894
[Jung Kook] That was great.

785
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:16,995
[Jimin] So great.

786
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,063
A PERFECT DAY

787
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,800
There are no blind spots in here.
We should change in the bathroom.

788
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:22,868
No.

789
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,769
We'll just make one.

790
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,206
JIMIN SAYS, "IF IT DOESN'T EXIST,
MAKE IT YOURSELF."

791
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,210
TIME TO SAY BYE FOR NOW

792
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,213
Off to a cozy sleep.

793
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,350
-Do you want to do something?
-No.

794
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,684
Rock, paper, scissors?

795
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,986
Forehead flick?

796
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,220
Forehead flick?

797
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,523
-The real last round.
-Just one game.

798
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,891
Until someone gets hit.

799
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,492
-Just one round.
-Yup.

800
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,529
1-ON-1 ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS,
ZERO GAME, AND CHAM CHAM CHAM

801
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,197
Ooh.

802
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,867
Zero, zero, zero.

803
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,402
JUNG KOOK WINS ZERO GAME

804
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,503
Not this one.

805
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,338
Cham Cham Cham.

806
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,840
-A bit late, huh?
-Nope, nope.

807
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,142
I was only thinking of this side.

808
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,244
Rock, paper.

809
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,846
ROUND TWO BEGINS

810
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:08,914
Zero, zero, zero.

811
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,448
Rock, paper.

812
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,516
A CLOSE MATCH(?)

813
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,852
-Zero, zero, zero.
-Should've said "one."

814
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,254
SO CLOSE

815
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,224
[exhaling]

816
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,726
Rock, paper,

817
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,128
-scissors.
-Scissors.

818
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,296
Paper.

819
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,131
PERFECT SYNC

820
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,300
Shall we end the match here?

821
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,367
On a good note?

822
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,836
-You're not bad.
-You're not bad either.

823
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,904
-Okay.
-Okay.

824
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,539
ENDS WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE

825
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,276
-You're good.
-You're good.

826
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,711
Pretty good, huh?

827
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,813
I've always been.

828
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,715
You're something.

829
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:47,452
GAME OF PROS... OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED

830
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,825
TIME TO SLEEP FOR A FRESH TOMORROW

831
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:59,264
WHEN THE DARKNESS FADES
AND THE SUN RISES

832
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,867
A SPARKLING MORNING GREETS BRIENZ

833
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,571
GOOD MORNING

834
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:10,875
JUNG KOOK IS UP EARLY

835
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,044
Here's my morning face.

836
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,414
Feeling great.

837
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,718
WHILE JUNG KOOK ENJOYS
THE BRIENZ MORNING SUNLIGHT...

838
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:25,090
JIMIN IS STILL IN DREAMLAND

839
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,830
FIGHTING A BATTLE WITH HIMSELF

840
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,632
[singing]

841
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,033
It's so beautiful outside.

842
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,636
The director went for a walk

843
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,070
and said it's amazing.

844
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,438
-Where? Near here?
-Yeah.

845
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:47,045
HESITATES

846
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,015
STAFF ARE ALREADY SETTING THINGS UP
FOR THE SHOOT

847
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,683
Setting up cameras here too.

848
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,755
CAMERAS BEING INSTALLED ALL AROUND

849
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,823
Everyone's so hardworking.

850
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,993
I actually woke up early too.

851
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,397
-[Jimin] Let's start filming.
-Okay.

852
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,931
[director] Cameras are rolling.

853
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,167
FILMING BEGINS

854
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,739
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

855
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,075
I slept really well thanks to you.

856
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,510
What happened to your voice?

857
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,879
I lost my voice.

858
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,080
Really?

859
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,314
Yes.

860
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,918
I think I yelled too much
while swimming yesterday.

861
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,486
That's probably why.

862
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,322
SHOUTING WHEN HE SLIPPED ALONE

863
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,124
Are You Sure?! What?

864
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,325
EVEN WHEN HE JUMPED

865
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,430
-[Jung Kook laughing]
-What the heck?

866
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,265
What the heck?

867
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,736
JIMIN SCREAMED THE WHOLE TIME

868
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:50,475
[director] So now, we'll start
with a morning game.

869
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,143
Through this game,

870
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,047
we'll decide
whether you get a free day today

871
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,784
or stick to the schedule as we planned.

872
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,786
If we get a free day,

873
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,355
I think they'll take our phones.

874
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,727
I SAW RIGHT THROUGH YOU, DIDN'T I?

875
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,463
-Right, they haven't taken them yet.
-Yes, they will.

876
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,265
And we have to think about
what to do on camera.

877
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,868
Let's do forehead flicks.

878
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,503
We didn't do it last night.

879
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,040
[director] All right,
so today's game is...

880
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,508
Charades.

881
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,743
[Jung Kook] Mmm.

882
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,411
-You know it, right?
-Yeah.

883
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,246
That's good.

884
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,548
It's hard for me to talk right now.

885
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,950
EVEN BETTER

886
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,688
[director] So here we have categories:
proverbs, objects, animals,

887
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,923
-[Jung Kook] Emotions.
-and movies.

888
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,492
[director] These are the options.

889
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,127
Emotions sound good.

890
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,428
Should we go with that?

891
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:44,863
Okay, let's do emotions.

892
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,464
Let's get started.

893
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,367
You guess, I'll act it out.

894
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,936
The one acting stands there,

895
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,140
and the one guessing sits there.

896
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,242
HYPING IT UP

897
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,309
Excited.

898
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,379
I can't hide my excitement.

899
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,915
DANCING OUT THE EXCITEMENT(?)

900
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,151
-[director] I'll time you.
-Okay.

901
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,255
In two minutes,
if you get seven right, you win.

902
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,723
That's kinda tough.

903
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,491
[Jimin] Can we do a practice round?

904
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,893
Just one randomly.

905
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,227
[director] Randomly? Okay.

906
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,732
PRACTICE QUESTION IN PROGRESS

907
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,835
Regret? No?

908
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,171
I'm too tired to go there.

909
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,110

00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,381
Wow, that's crazy.

912
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,150
I got brain freeze.

913
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,820
How am I supposed to guess that?

914
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:45,690
-I'll make it super intuitive from now.
-It won't be like that.

915

Disgusted?

924
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,074
Unpleasant? Annoyed?

925
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,742
NO, THAT'S NOT IT

926
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,277
Frustrated? What is that?

927
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,980

928
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,082

940
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:32,837

958
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,672

They all look the same.

00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,926
They all look the same.

970
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,360
NO, THEY'RE DIFFERENT

971
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,461

BORED
THIS IS A NEW ME

977
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:40,738
Tired.

978
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,507
Dull.

979
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,642
Empty.

980
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,545
-[director] Ten seconds.
-Dull... No.

981
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,013
Sentimental?

982
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,515
UPSET

983
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,217
EXPRESSING BOREDOM WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

984
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,752
Bored?

985
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:55,820
Bored?

986
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,588
Correct. Time's up.

987
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,057
BUZZER-BEATER SUCCESS

00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,224
Correct. Time's up.

989
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,993
How many did we get?

990
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,228
You got six.

991
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,897
-Missed one?
-Yeah.

992
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,131
-That was tough.
-But...

993
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,000
What was this one?

994
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,501
-Joy.
-Oh, joy.

995
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,937
But honestly...

996
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,341
WHY DO ALL HIS EXPRESSIONS
LOOK THE SAME...?

997
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:20,645
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT EMOTIONS

998
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:24,949
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK CLOSELY...

999
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,951
How do you act out "shocked"?

1000
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,019
Shocked?

1001
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,254
No idea.

1002
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,324
HE DID HIS BEST TODAY AS ALWAYS

1003
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,592
We go six correct?

1004
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,760
You got six right.

1005
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,895
That was good practice, right?

1006
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,999
Right? You gotta warm up a bit.

1007
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,066
It's morning.

1008
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,635
LET'S CALL IT A PRACTICE ROUND

1009
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,703
PLEASE

1010
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,071
[director] A practice round?

1011
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,706
YES, YES

1012
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,109
EASILY(?) EARNED AN EXTRA GAME

1013
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,779
Proverbs, objects, animals, or movies.

1014
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,148
I don't really know many movies...

1015
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,083
-Animals?
-Should we try animals?

1016
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,518
Movies sound fun though.

1017
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:01,786
Movies?

1018
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,287
You sure about that?

1019
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,957
I'm okay with whatever you want.

1020
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,025
Animals?

1021
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,526
Animals? Okay.

1022
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:11,195
Then should I act and you guess?

1023
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,630
Should I do it?

1024
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,299
-Whatever you want.
-[director and Jung Kook chuckle]

1025
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,902
CAN'T MAKE DECISIONS LIKE THIS

1026
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,406
You want to guess, or should I?

1027
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,374
I'm not that good at giving hints.

1028
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,909
Then I'll act it out.

1029
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,077
-Animals?
-Yup.

1030
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,646
[director] Okay, once you're both ready,

1031
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,448
say "Go" and start.

1032
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:31,849
Didn't say "Go" earlier.

1033
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,984
One, two, three.

1034
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,052
-Go.
-Go.

1035
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,753
[director] Ready.

1036
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,821

00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,194
Skip.

1040
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:44,495
What? You don't know?

1041
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,963

Tiger.

1059
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,126
NO, NO, LION WAS RIGHT.

1060
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,227

JIMIN'S WAY OF EXPRESSING THE OCEAN

1071
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:38,316
What is that?

1072
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,450
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW?

1073

00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:22,727
Horse?

1097
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,762
Pony? Oh, zebra.

1098
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:25,963
Correct, time's up.

1099
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,031
TIME'S UP

1100
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,232
-Time's up.
-What was it?

1101
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,433
We got seven right?

1102
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,535
-Seven.
-We did.

1103
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:34,605
-An ostrich.
-Ostrich, oh, right.

1104
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,673
This was good.

1105
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,508
PROUD OF THE STRIPE DETAIL

1106
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:38,876
Zebra was good though.

1107
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,245
I thought it could fly.
Ostriches can't fly.

1108
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:42,480
REVIEWING WRONG ANSWERS

1109
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,515
-Sea lion.
-Oh, sea lion.

1110
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:47,718
-Right, I was saying "swimming lion."
-"Swimming lion"?

1111
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:48,953
Still, nice job.

1112
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,254
So we got seven right?

1113
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,024
[director] Yes, which means
you've earned free time.

1114
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,059
You can spend it however you want,

1115
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:57,862
or follow the plan we prepared,
a jet-boat ride.

1116
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,664
Which will you pick? Free time?

1117
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,731
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

1118
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:04,569
Maybe on the way to the first spot,
we'll search things up.

1119
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,003
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

1120
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,405
So, free time for now?

1121
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,140
-Free time for now.
-[director] Okay.

1122
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,875
[Jung Kook] Okay, good work.

There's a viewpoint here, apparently.

1136
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,383
A spot where you can see
all of Interlaken.

1137
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,919
It's called the "roof of Interlaken."

1138
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,654
There's even a flower garden.

1139
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,723
And souvenir shops.

1140
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,358

-Okay.

1159
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,052
TODAY'S DRIVER: JIMIN

1160
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,287
-So we're driving.
-Yeah.

1161
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,423
I'll connect the GPS with my phone.

1162
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:10,928
SOMETHING'S OFF

1163
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,264
Turn off Bluetooth? It's linked to yours.

1164
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,765
Should I disconnect mine?

1165
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,169
Or we can just use yours.

1166
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,471
-Really? It only has my songs.
-Yeah.

1167
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,540
-Send me the address.
-Okay.

00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,658
Then turn left.

1176
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,560
-Oh.
-You can mute that voice.

1177
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,962
I've actually never had
the sound on before.

00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:52,002
Turn right.

1181
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,372
Then turn right again.

1182
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,174
He talks so kindly and softly.

1183
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,944
Wait, is the address right?

1184
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,779
Did I set it to the Pizzeria? Oh...

1185
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:02,847
Pizzeria?

1186
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:03,914

1187
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,584

Jung Kook, that boat's crossing the lake.

1199
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,029
[Jung Kook] Isn't that the one we took?

1200
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,698
[Jimin] I think it is. It runs every day.

1201
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,034

00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,080
The color of the river here is
different, though.

1206
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,149
In Zermatt, it was kind of grayish.

1207
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,451
The river itself?

1208
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,686
Yeah, this one's emerald.

1209
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,154
This one's got a more...

1210
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,956
[Jimin] A bright, saturated tone.

1211
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:25,129
GLACIAL WATER FROM THE ALPS

Switzerland's really the perfect place
to drive.

1213
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,637
It makes you want to drive.

1214
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:35,906
It feels so good.

1215
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,641
It was great when I rode the bike.

1216
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,444
-[Jimin] Except for the heat?
-Yeah.

1217
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,012
[Jimin] I'd be too scared.

1218
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,317
I feel so drowsy today.

1219
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,551
[Jung Kook] Right?

1220
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:49,320
When it's sunny, you get drowsy.

1221
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,255
But rain doesn't drag you down.

1222
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,823
-It actually lifts you up.
-Yes.

1223
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,993
Yeah, I even thought earlier
I kinda wanted it to rain today.

1224
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,698
When it rains after being sunny,
it's so nice and refreshing.

1225
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,367
[Jung Kook] This city goes well with rain.

1226
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:04,435
[Jimin] I agree.

1227
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,670
A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEAUTY ON RAINY DAYS

1228
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,440
The slightly wet colors are
just beautiful.

1229
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,342
[Jung Kook] My aesthetic sense says so.

1230
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,777
Your aesthetic sense's rising.

1231
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,613
"Rising"?

1232
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,147
Rising, that sounds weird.

1233
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,250
-What?
-Like in "That's right."

1234
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,985
You can just say "right."

1235
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,553
Yeah, why did I say that?

1236
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,621
Two syllables.

1237
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,022

-Why?

-Check the menu? Okay.
-Can you check?

1249
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,154
They've got burgers and fries.

1250
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,389
BURGER SHOP

1251
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,425
-[Jimin] It must be famous.
-Yeah.

1252
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:05,863

THEY WALK RIGHT PAST THE ENTRANCE

1262
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,928
WHERE ARE YOU GOING...?

1263
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:39,063
It's here?

1264
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,531
Oh, this is the entrance.

1265
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,732

1266
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,667
Huh?

1267
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,135
Go in and sit there?

1268
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,171
[Jimin chuckles] Ah!

1269
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,606
I couldn't pick that up.

1270
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,040
[in English] Nice to meet you.

1271
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,976
[Jung Kook in English] Nice to meet you.

1272
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,045
FINALLY ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT

1273
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,280
Ah.

1274
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,352
[in Korean] They're filming diagonally.

1275
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,888
JIMIN CHECKS THE MENU FIRST

1276
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,758
Wait, we have to pay
with our allowance, right?

1277
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:09,259
[director] Lunch? Yes, correct.

1278
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,095
Let's see.

1279
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,264
[in Korean] We've got
almost 100 francs left.

1280
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,633
DON'T LET THE STAFF KNOW...

1281
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,372
Let's see what they have.

1282
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,643
CAREFULLY READING THE MENU

1283
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,980
Let's get this one, Crazy In Love.
Our special.

1284
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,583
BIG APPROVAL + DOUBLE THUMBS UP

1285
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,917
Let's get this one.

1286
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,819
ABOUT 47,000 WON

1287
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,221
Oh, it's pricey.

1288
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,090
-We can share one if it's big enough.
-Right.

1289
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,459
Let's get two singles and one side.

1290
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,527
Should we?

1291
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,363
HUMAN CALCULATOR MODE

1292
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,633
The combo's cheaper by 1 franc.

1293
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,635
ORDERING 1 COMBO + 1 SINGLE

1294
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,937
-Okay, perfect.
-[in English] And fries.

1295
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,707
WITH A SIDE OF FRENCH FRIES

1296
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,777
STRONG HAND GESTURE SAYING
"WE'LL SPLIT THE BILL"

1297
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,679
[in Korean] Shutting us down right away.

1298
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,081
-Thank you very much.
-[in English] Thank you.

1299
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,249
ANYWAY, ORDER COMPLETE

1300
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,417
Looks good.

1301
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:10,688
[Jung Kook in English] So many sparrows
around burger places.

1302
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,556
Because people feed them fries.

1303
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,892
I think I like burgers as a food.

1304
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,094
I never realized it before.

1305
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,762
I think I like them.

1306
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,598
I didn't know I liked pasta
this much either.

1307
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,968
JUNG KOOK, LOOK AT THIS

1308
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,804
Where'd you hide my photo?

1309
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,273
HE DID SOMETHING WITH JUNG KOOK'S PHOTO...

1310
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,642
I couldn't even find it.

1311
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,211
A PHOTO OF JUNG KOOK PHOTOSHOPPED BY JIMIN

1312
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,246
[Jimin] It's even funnier
when you zoom in.

1313
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,749
ZOOMED-IN: SOULFUL-EYED JUNG KOOK
FILLS THE FRAME

1314
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,150
It's all him down here.

1315
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,218
FULL OF JUNG KOOKS

1316
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:42,453
[Jung Kook] So annoying.

1317
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,090
Just wait, I'm editing right now.

1318
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,591
JUNG KOOK PLOTTING REVENGE

1319
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:48,992
-[English] Hello.
-We're fans.

1320
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,127
ARMY RECOGNIZED THE TWO

1321
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,062
-[in English] Really? Thank you.
-Jimin.

1322
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:56,366
LOL

1323
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,602
[in Korean] Nice one.

1324
00:53:58,669 --> 00:53:59,970
We have to show this.

1325
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,939
This one deserves to be revealed.

1326
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,208
-Gotta admit, it's well made.
-[in Korean] Right?

1327
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,143
This isn't a photo, it's art.

1328
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,211
ARTIST JEON

1329
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,880
Out there, do you see that duck?

1330
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,782
Zooming in.

1331
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,584
Closer, closer, closer.

1332
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,587
SELF-RELEASED PHOTO

1333
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,956
This is fun. Why is this so fun?

1334
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:25,095
THE ARTIST IS ALSO VERY PLEASED

1335
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:28,031
-While Junsoo is not here...
-Sweet potato.

1336
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,566
STAFF'S FOOD CAME OUT FIRST

1337
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,338
TWO FRIES THIEVES

1338
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:38,008
MEERKAT MODE

1339
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:41,011
MEERKAT MODE #2

1340
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,684
We couldn't spend much,

1341
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,454
so we just ordered one fries.

1342
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,955
RIGHT THEN, THEIR FOOD ARRIVES.

1343
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,023
-Hello, friends.
-Wow.

1344
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,391
[in Korean] This is no joke.

1345
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,926
That should make the single one.

1346
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,461
All good. Thank you very much.

1347
00:54:58,362 --> 00:54:59,963
-Jung Kook, let's share this.
-Yes.

1348
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,598
BEEF SHRIMP SINGLE BURGER

1349
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,467
[Jung Kook] Look at this, look at this.

1350
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:04,535
Perfect. Let's eat.

1351
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,303
Let's dig in, Jimin.

1352
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,538
[Jimin] That's huge.

1353
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,473
Put the fork in.

1354
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,542
PRECISE CHOREO AIMED AT THE BURGER

1355
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,609
I'm nervous.

1356
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:13,944
The juice...

1357
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,779
GIGANTIC SIZE

1358
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,047
Like this...

1359
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:20,851
CUT AND BITE RIGHT AWAY

1360
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:25,856
Is it good?

1361
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,792
JUNG KOOK TAKES A BITE TOO

1362
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:29,860
EXCLAIMING

1363
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,261
This is good.

1364
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,831
-So good.
-Yes.

1365
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,867
JIMIN EATS

1366
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:40,304
THEN JUNG KOOK EATS

1367
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,973
TRUE-TELLING EYEBROWS

1368
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,308
It's crazy good.

1369
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,912
WHAT'S WITH THAT FACE?

1370
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,648
IT'S SO DELICIOUS
AGREED

1371
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,351
A SHOUTOUT TO THE STAFF WHO RECOMMENDED IT

1372
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:55,853
I love coleslaw.

1373
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,422
UNEXPECTED BURGER CHOREO CONTINUES

1374
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,825
A BITE OF COLESLAW

1375
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,962
A BITE OF SWEET POTATO FRIES

1376
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,965
HOW TO MAKE YOUR BURGER
TASTE EVEN BETTER: ADD SAUCE

1377
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,902
JUNG KOOK LIKES TO TRY DIFFERENT COMBOS

1378
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,805
JIMIN USUALLY STICKS TO ONE THING

1379
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,574
THE BURGER PURIST

1380
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:24,348
HALF A BURGER GONE IN SECONDS

1381
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,183
NOW SIDE DISHES ONLY

1382
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,251
This is insane.

1383
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,785
-It's really good.
-So good.

1384
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:31,889
Dip this in ketchup...

1385
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,858
EXCLAIMING

1386
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:35,926
And...

1387
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,661
Together?

1388
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,730
SWEET POTATO FRIES
+ FRENCH FRIES + KETCHUP

1389
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,399
EXCLAIMING

1390
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:45,369
I don't think I can finish it.

1391
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,503
It's too much for me.

1392
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,305
I can.

1393
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:49,640
Maybe one more bite?

1394
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:53,076
I'LL FINISH IT ALL

1395
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,114
It's just so good.

1396
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,883
But yesterday's meal was touching.

1397
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,652
PORK BELLY & RAMEN

1398
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,121
-Yes.
-We each had one and a half servings.

1399
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,456
I thought it might be too much.

1400
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,226
-Nope. Yeah.
-But we finished everything.

1401
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:13,397
WE EAT PRETTY WELL, ACTUALLY

1402
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,066
-Huh?
-What?

1403
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,234
Gone already?

1404
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:18,335
ONE LAST BITE LEFT

1405
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:19,469
I told you.

1406
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:23,240
THE FINAL BITE

1407
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,842
THEY'RE FINISHED

1408
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,344
-I'm done too.

UTTER SATISFACTION

1410
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,380
That was perfect.

1411
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,916
-You have a present from us.

[in Korean] Can you see this?

1416
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:43,527
This is the cocoa spread.

1417
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,029
-I don't eat sweets.
-The famous one.

1418
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:47,731
That's crazy.

1419
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,167
EXCITEMENT OVERLOAD

1420
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,702
Should I cut it?

1421
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,105
ECSTASY

1422
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,308
EXTREME SWEETNESS

1423
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,743
You have a sweet tooth.

1424
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,313
SINCE IT'S SWEET LIKE CRAZY,
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER BITE

1425
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,083
TINGLING

1426
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,251
[Jung Kook] It's the peak of sweetness.

00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,022
CONQUERING THE CHOCOLATE

1428
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,525
Since it's sweet, I can still eat more.

1429
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,327
That was pure bliss.

1430
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:19,463
I'll recommend one to you.

1431
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,565
I think you'll like this one.

1432
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,666
-Raspberry?
-Yeah.

1433
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,801
I'm going crazy.

1434
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,738
Like checking the beef juices
after grilling.

1435
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,339
INSPECTING THE RASPBERRY JUICE

1436
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:30,974
Thank you, Jimin.

1437
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:32,809
[inaudible]

1438
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,046
TASTING RASPBERRY DONUT

1439
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,148
Mmm.

LASTLY, PISTACHIO DONUT

1441
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,358
SAVORING

1442
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,862
[Jimin] Is it good? Should I try one?

1443
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:55,365
JIMIN TASTES THE DONUT TOO

1444
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:57,100
I think I'm obsessed with sweets.

1445
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,168
TREMBLING

1446
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:01,605
LOSING HIS MIND IN ANOTHER WAY

1447
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:02,773
It's too sweet.

1448
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,308
I love it.

1449
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,843
How much do you think it is?

1450
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,712
Let's ask them to total it up.

1451
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,884
PAYMENT COMPLETE
58 FRANCS, ABOUT 100,000 WON

1452
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,018
This is nice.

1453
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,353
SUGAR SPIKE

1454
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,788
I need a nap now.

1455
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:21,625
CFO PARK CHECKING REMAINING ALLOWANCE

1456
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,127
OUR SMALL AND PRECIOUS REMAINING CASH

1457
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:27,497
EVEN CHECKING THE COINS

1458
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,632
Let's go, Jung Kook.

1459
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,167
-Yep.
-That was a good meal.

1460
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,301
It really was.

1461
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:32,736
Should we cross?

1462
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,071
GOING TO WALK IT OFF

1463
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:35,639
Where are we going?

1464
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:37,340
This tree right here.

1465
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:41,845
ARRIVED UNDER THE NEARBY TREE SHADE

1466
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,815
KOREAN TRAIT: ALWAYS GROAN
WHEN SITTING DOWN

1467
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,084
This is nice. Such a vibe.

1468
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,922
PEOPLE ARE OUT TO ENJOY THE AFTERNOON SUN

1469
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,390
AND THE DUCKS HAVE ARRIVED TOO

1470
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,458
What? There are ducks.

1471
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,293
Here they come.

1472
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,498
-Pretending to give food?
-Yeah.

1473
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:07,137
A DUCK SLOWLY APPROACHING

1474
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,638
Want some?

1475
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:09,706
EXPECTING

1476
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,375
DUCK JUST PASSES BY

1477
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,478
I guess they know?

1478
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,646
REAL DUCK FEED HANDED OVER

1479
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,981
They eat this?

1480
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,483
-Let me have some too.
-Okay.

1481
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,017
THIS TIME, FOR REAL

1482
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,086
I guess they know.

1483
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,423
[quacking]

1484
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:29,693
Is it good?

1485
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:31,928
Is it good?

1486
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,396
Good duck.

1487
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,664
Let's play a game.

1488
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:35,732
Sit.

1489
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,168
Sit.

1490
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,236
WHY ME...?

1491
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,004
Only this one eats.

1492
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,239
I want you to eat.

1493
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,175
Hey, pig. Why are you eating everything?

1494
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:46,510
Uh-oh!

1495
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,978
Do rock-paper-scissors.

1496
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,747
JUST GIVE IT TO ME!

1497
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,048
[Jimin] I got nothing.

1498
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,417
I'll just pretend.

1499
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,353
FOOLED

1500
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,256
FOOLED #2

1501
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,292
FOOLED #3

1502
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,095
So cute.

1503
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,997
Can I pet you?

1504
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:11,034
I'll feed them, try petting.

1505
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,537
FAILED

1506
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,339
What are you saying?

1507
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,041
"I wanna eat too."

1508
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:22,045
TRANSLATING DUCK LANGUAGE

1509
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:25,182
WORLD'S FIRST DUCK INNER-THOUGHTS DUBBING

1510
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,483
"It was tasty, though."

1511
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,151
"Thank you for the food."

1512
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:29,920
You want some?

1513
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,454
A HEALING TIME WITH THE DUCKS

1514
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,223
They don't eat the crumbs.

1515
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,892
That's it, nothing left now.

1516
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,662
LEAVING COOLLY

1517
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,830
-How do they know?
-Right?

1518
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,132
[Jung Kook] That's amazing.

1519
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,366
[Jimin] How do they know?

1520
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,668
WE'LL COME BACK AGAIN

1521
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,404
NEXT GUESTS: THE SPARROWS

1522
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,105
You heard the rumor, didn't you?

1523
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,307
WE HEARD THE RUMORS

1524
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,342
You don't want it?

1525
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:55,779
It's really good.

1526
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:56,846
SPARROW FEEDING

1527
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,215
NO CRUMBS, PLEASE!

1528
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:01,151
FEEDING JUNG KOOK THIS TIME(?)

1529
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,219
Come on.

1530
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:05,255
Let's go, let's go.

1531
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:06,323
TO THE NEXT SPOT

1532
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,092
Where to now?

1533
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,462
GOING ON THEIR WAY

1534
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,031
So cool in here.

1535
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:16,967
Ah!

1536
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:19,436
[singing] Let's go.

1537
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,870
-[Jimin] Good to go?
-Yeah.

1538
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:24,407
[Jung Kook] It'll be so much fun.

1539
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:25,842
What, the jumping one?

1540
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:26,943
Yeah.

1541
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,912
SHAKING HIS HEAD

1542
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,915
I wasn't that excited yesterday.

1543
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,150
-I got sleepy after the meal.
-Yeah.

1544
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,385
So, want to jump today?

1545
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:36,453
MAXIMUM ENERGY

1546
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:37,721
How can I make it funny?

1547
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,122
-In a funny way.
-No idea.

1548
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:40,323
Oh, funny?

1549
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,426
-Yeah.
-Want to fall funny?

1550
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:44,494
Yeah.

1551
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:47,264
AS EXPECTED FROM MY FEARLESS BROTHER...

1552
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:52,969
FILLING THEIR EYES WITH THE SCENERY

1553
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:58,008
DRIVING FORWARD, FULL OF EXCITEMENT

1554
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,312
ARRIVED AT THE GEAR STATION FIRST

1555
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,780
[Jimin] We can just park here?

1556
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:05,081
WHERE ARE THEY?

1557
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,716
They must be over there. There.

1558
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,754
A VERY, VERY TALL MOUNTAIN...

1559
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,255
Oh, it is.

1560
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,291
That's high. Nope, not for me.

1561
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,458
I'll wait here.

1562
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,760
I'll just come with you.

1563
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:18,628
I honestly can't do it.

1564
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:19,863
WHAT MAKES JIMIN TREMBLE?

1565
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,435
HEIGHT: 90 METERS

1566
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,805
MAX SPEED: 120 KM/H

1567
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:32,309
A THRILLING FREEFALL
BETWEEN THE CLIFFS OF GRINDELWALD

1568
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:39,349
SIMILAR TO BUNGEE JUMPING
BUT SWINGS LIKE A GIANT SWING

1569
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,185
HOLD UP!
A SPECIAL GAME FOR JIMIN

1570
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,054
RULE: JUNG KOOK JUMPS FIRST

1571
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,357
IF HE GETS THE KEYWORD RIGHT,
THE STAFF JUMPS INSTEAD

1572
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:49,759
PLEASE, JUNG KOOK...!

1573
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,330
JUNG KOOK PUTTING ON THE GEAR

1574
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,165
SAFELY

1575
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,966
CAREFULLY

1576
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,402
SAFETY EQUIPMENT: ALL SET

1577
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:00,570
[in English] Let's go.

1578
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,939
[in Korean] Should I take a big flight?

1579
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,075
-Jimin.
-Yes?

1580
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,577
-You see that car?
-Yes.

1581
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:08,878
-The one in front?
-Yes.

1582
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,080
Just follow that car.

1583
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,981
MUST DRIVE TO THE JUMPING POINT

1584
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,650
-Here we go.
-Okay.

1585
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:15,085
ON THE WAY TO DROP HIM OFF

1586
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:18,555
[Jung Kook in English] Let's go.
[in Korean] Time to ride that swing.

1587
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,956
[in English] Let's go.

1588
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,492
HEADING TO THE CANYON SWING

1589
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,594
Jimin doesn't want to.

1590
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,064
Jung Kook, you have to win the game

1591
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:29,766
-Yes.
-so I don't have to do it.

1592
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,434
I'm counting on you.

1593
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,470
What if I don't look?

1594
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,771
If you don't,

1595
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:36,473
I'll jump without a rope.

1596
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,574
AGGRESSIVE DUE TO FEAR

1597
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,942
As if you actually would.

1598
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:42,779
We could ride a bike here.

1599
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,281
The road up here's nice.

1600
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:47,550
FEELING NERVOUS,
BUT THE SCENERY IS A WORK OF ART

1601
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:51,087
It's so peaceful,
but it's the way to suffering, huh?

1602
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:52,155
Exactly.

1603
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,256
AT THE JUMP ZONE

1604
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:56,025
[Jimin] This must be it.
Looks like where they stop the car.

1605
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,294
[Jung Kook] Shall we go?

1606
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:02,065
PARTICIPANT, PLEASE STEP OUT

1607
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:06,836
Go.

1608
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:07,971
VERY EXCITED

1609
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,707
The air's great. And lots of bugs.

1610
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:13,209
The director looks hilarious wearing that.

1611
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,912
-Huh? Jung Kook, you're wearing it too.
-Yeah.

1612
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,215
Jung Kook has to win the game
so this doesn't end up on me.

1613
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,650
It doesn't even fit you.

1614
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:22,852
The director's wearing the big one.

1615
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,521
LOOK AT THIS GUY...

1616
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,257
Of course, I do believe

1617
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:30,427
-you will win the game for me,
-But...

1618
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,862
but my heart just won't stop pounding.

1619
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,664
I'm a man, after all.

1620
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,466
My heart's pounding.

1621
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:40,904
AS THEY WALK HEARING
THE SOUND OF THEIR HEARTBEAT...

1622
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,173
-We're almost here.
-It's over there.

1623
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,974
I just saw someone drop.

1624
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:48,244
WELCOME, FIRST TIME DOING CANYON SWING?

1625
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,547
You know what I think?

1626
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:55,985
You can just take it slow
and enjoy the view.

1627
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,487
Why fall so fast?

1628
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,024
Why do people do that?

1629
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,295
Why on earth do they enjoy speed?

1630
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:06,896
I'm getting nervous too now.

1631
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,698
NERVOUSNESS BUILDING IN REAL TIME

1632
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,200
I'm starting to feel it.

1633
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,671
I'm suddenly getting nervous too.

1634
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,272
So, you get nervous too?

1635
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,174
-Of course.
-Oh, really?

1636
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,276
If you don't get nervous for falling...

1637
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,678
I thought you had no fear.

1638
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,646
Nope, my heart's racing too.

1639
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,582
-Yours too?
-Yeah.

1640
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,816
That's surprising.

1641
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:30,753
EXCITEMENT + ANTICIPATION

1642
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,691
[continues humming]

1643
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,693
Jimin, please say hi.

1644
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:38,895
Me?

1645
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:41,898
Your nose...

1646
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:55,845
WARNING: OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS
MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL

1647
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,615
Why do people even do this?

1648
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,251
Why... who even invented this?

1649
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:05,788
If I'd joined the special forces
or something,

1650
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,024
maybe I'd do it easily.

1651
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:09,225
APPEALING TO HIS EMOTION

1652
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:13,630
HIS EYES ARE GETTING TEARY

1653
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,066
HOLDING TIGHTLY

1654
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,036
REALLY TERRIFIED...

1655
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:21,771
"I should watch Bon Voyage."

1656
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:22,906
This reminds me.

1657
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,542
"I should watch Bon Voyage."

1658
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,679
This time, please say
something to me before you jump.

1659
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:33,049
Jimin, did you eat?

1660
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:34,117
Nice.

1661
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,287
-Jung Kook, get ready.
-Okay.

1662
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:38,354
JUNG KOOK'S TURN

1663
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,623
I don't think I can even see the word.

1664
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,724
Where is it?

1665
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,694
They're holding it down there.

1666
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,932
CAN YOU SPOT WHERE THE KEYWORD IS...?

1667
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,900
I don't see anyone holding it.

1668
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:52,802
They're holding the paper there.

1669
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,504
-That one?
-Yeah.

1670
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,606
What if I don't get it right?

1671
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,608
Then I'm going back to Korea.

1672
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,543
Should we do a practice round?

1673
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,111
-Practice?
-You want?

1674
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,413
Rock, paper, scissors.

1675
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,480
Minus one.

1676
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,815
HE LOSES EVEN THIS ONE

1677
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,550
I can't do this.

1678
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,319
I haven't won a single round.

1679
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,123
JUNG KOOK, MY BROTHER, I'M COUNTING ON YOU

1680
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,159
CALMLY PREPARING FOR HIS FALL

1681
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,227
Wow.

1682
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,264
SO FAR DOWN BELOW

1683
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:22,732
Are you ready?

1684
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,133
-Jung Kook.
-Yeah?

1685
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,069
Say something to me before you go.

1686
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,203
[in English] I'm ready.

1687
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,905
-[in Korean] Are you filming?
-Yeah.

1688
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,708
-[in English] Ready. Yeah.
-Good?

1689
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,843
Three, two, one.

1690
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,678
-Jump!
-[in Korean] Jimin, did you eat?

1691
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:39,582
[whoops, exclaims]

1692
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:44,354
JEON JUNG KOOK TAKES OFF

1693
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:49,425
FRONT SHOT OF JUNG KOOK FREE-FALLING

1694
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:55,298
A PERFECT SWING

1695
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,335
[exclaiming softly]

1696
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:03,539
[exclaiming]

1697
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:06,509
I didn't even see that.

1698
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,111
SO THRILLED THAT HE FORGOT...

1699
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:12,749
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO SEE IT NOW

1700
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,918
Ilchi-woljang.

1701
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,220
Ilchi-woljang.

1702
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:21,658
LET'S CHECK THE CORRECT ANSWER

1703
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,961
THE KEYWORD
FOUR CLEAR LETTERS IN VIEW

1704
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:26,429
Ilchi-woljang.

1705
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,797
I got it.

1706
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:32,101
FEELING MIGHTY PROUD

1707
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:36,172
AFTER THAT ELECTRIFYING FULL SWING...

1708
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:37,774
That was fun.

1709
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,375
Can I go one more time?

1710
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,579
Ilchi-woljang.

1711
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:45,348
Ilchi-woljang.

1712
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:50,186
[cheering]

1713
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:57,160
MY BROTHER'S AWESOME

1714
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,461
Now you, huh?

1715
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,096
[in English] No.

1716
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:02,932
[in Korean] What do you mean?

1717
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,400
Let's go!

1718
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,805
JUNG KOOK GOES DOWN TO LAND

1719
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:10,640
[groaning]

1720
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:19,048
FEELING PROUD

1721
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:24,987
SAFELY BACK ON THE GROUND

1722
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,290
Ilchi-woljang.

1723
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:29,358
-Yeah, buddy, that was dope.
-[English] Yeah!

1724
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,426
GOOD JOB, BRO

1725
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:33,229
WHAT WAS THE KEYWORD?

1726
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:34,630
[in Korean] I saw it.

1727
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,766
-[crew member] What is it?
-Ilchi-woljang.

1728
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:37,834
-Right?
-Correct.

1729
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,901
Correct!

1730
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:41,003
I should've gotten it wrong.

1731
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,906
THE STAFF JUMPS INSTEAD

1732
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:47,577
THE ENDING: JUNG KOOK WINS

1733
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:49,212
I'm nervous.

1734
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,348
UNAWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING BELOW,
JIMIN RUNS OFF

1735
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:55,084
I want to do it again.

1736
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:56,219
Can I?

1737
01:10:56,853 --> 01:11:00,356
JIMIN GOES TO GREET(?) JUNG KOOK

1738
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:02,859
-[crew] He's coming back up?
-Yeah.

1739
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:05,995
I knew it.

1740
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:08,598
I knew this would happen.

1741
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:14,036
Well, I was the one who said
Jung Kook should do it, after all.

1742
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,674
Now, I'll look up where we should go
in Switzerland.

1743
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,679
[director] We booked the place
you looked up before, Jimin.

1744
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:28,251
I knew he'd get excited,
and he really did.

1745
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,186
That was fun, it really was.

1746
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,254
THE HERO APPEARS

1747
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,955
I knew I wouldn't end up jumping.

1748
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,024
I'm happy.

1749
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:39,028
Usually in shows like this,

1750
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,065
they say "I'm not jumping"
then jump anyway.

1751
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,534
That's so cliché, right?

1752
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,303
I say I'm not jumping, and I really don't.

1753
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,739
I'M REALLY NOT JUMPING

1754
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:50,807
Oh.

1755
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:53,743
The weather's great.

1756
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,645
Jung Kook's coming back up, right?

1757
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,182
Is he on his way now?

1758
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,185
Nice.

1759
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,352
-Huh?
-It feels good.

1760
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:07,623
WAITING FOR JUNG KOOK

1761
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:11,627
JUNG KOOK PASSES BY~

1762
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,630
WHY DOES HE JUST PASS BY...?

1763
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,599
-[crew member] They just passed by.
-What?

1764
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:21,671
LEFT ALONE

1765
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,372
Why did I wait?

1766
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,408
ANGRY

1767
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:26,642
I waited for him,

1768
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,713
and I came to tell him
I'd be at the finish line.

1769
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,215
But he went right past me?

1770
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,317
Seriously.

1771
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,821
If that's how it is,
I'm going home. Goodness.

1772
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,958
-What?
-Oh, Jimin was waiting?

1773
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,860
We should tell him to come back up.

1774
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:48,130
Let's go. Can someone guide me
to the landing spot?

1775
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:50,266
Where did you say?

1776
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:54,370
JIMIN'S LOCATION IS RELAYED TO JUNG KOOK

1777
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,673
I'll jump one more time

1778
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,442
and come down.

1779
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:01,911
This...

1780
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,547
You can't ride just once.

1781
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:10,386
THE CANYON SWING THAT
BRINGS SMILES ALL AROUND

1782
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:14,690
This is so fun. Let's hurry.

1783
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,026
LOOKS SO EXCITED EVEN FROM BEHIND

1784
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:19,896
So excited.

1785
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,831
So excited.

1786
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,201
Where, where?

1787
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:27,503
Where is it?

1788
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:32,508
QUICKLY ARRIVING AT THE JUMP PLATFORM

1789
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,314
[in English] ♪ One more time ♪

1790
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,720
Back again.

1791
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,158
-[man] You liked it?
-Yeah, really liked it, yeah.

1792
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,393
Best thing ever?

1793
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,061
Maybe?

1794
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:53,796
"Maybe." [laughs]

1795
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:59,902
THIS TIME, JIMIN WAITS AT THE LANDING SITE

1796
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,138
That breeze feels amazing.

1797
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,508
HE SEES JIMIN

1798
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,276
[in Korean] He's there now.

1799
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,516
JIMIN

1800
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,623
-[man] Are you okay?
-[in English] Yeah.

1801
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,392
-Are you ready again?
-Yes.

1802
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,561
PREPARING FOR THE SECOND CANYON SWING

1803
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,698
JIMIN'S ALSO READY TO FILM

1804
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,032
BACK ON THE JUMP PLATFORM

1805
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,301
Come to the edge.
You're gonna jump high, yeah?

1806
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:33,402
Uh-huh.

1807
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,438
FEELING A BIT SCARED ONCE HE'S UP THERE

1808
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,673
-So higher this way, yeah?
-Okay. Yeah.

1809
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,241
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready!

1810
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,012
-Three, two, one.
-Two, one.

1811
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:47,550
ANOTHER FLAWLESS JUMP

1812
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:51,721
[screaming]

1813
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:52,855
[man] Jump!

1814
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:56,459
DOPAMINE EXPLOSION

1815
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,795
THRILLING

1816
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:05,568
SWINGING THROUGH THE CANYON,
FEELING NATURE'S GRANDEUR ONCE AGAIN

1817
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,104
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL MEMORY MADE

1818
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:10,406
Whoa!

1819
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,476
[Jung Kook yelling in delight]

1820
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,247
[in Korean] That was fun.

1821
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:19,782
That was a fail.

1822
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,652
Jimin.

1823
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:32,995
[sighs]

1824
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:34,430
Fail.

1825
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:35,564
FAILED THE COOL LANDING

1826
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,099
Failed to make it look cool.

1827
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,502
There.

1828
01:15:41,437 --> 01:15:42,438
Ah.

1829
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,310
HEART

1830
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,212
CAPTURED JUNG KOOK'S HEART

1831
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,149
ZOOMING IN ON JUNG KOOK

1832
01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:01,490
LET'S HEAD DOWN NOW

1833
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,692
Jimin.

1834
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,365
HEAVE-HO, HEAVE-HO

1835
01:16:09,432 --> 01:16:13,102
HE COMES BACK SAFELY THIS TIME AS WELL

1836
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,339
A JOYFUL HIGH-FIVE

1837
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,142
-I'll show you a funny video later.
-What is it?

1838
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,911
-Want to see it now?
-Yeah.

1839
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:25,548
-I filmed a video of you, Jung Kook.
-Okay.

1840
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,117
[screaming]

1841
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,088
It switched to selfie mode.

1842
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:35,224
I didn't even notice that.

1843
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,893
I was like,
"What? Why'd it turn into a selfie?"

1844
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,730
You dummy.

1845
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:47,203
MY BRAVE LITTLE BROTHER WAS AMAZING...

1846
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,804
These two were recording.

1847
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,107
AFTER FINISHING THE CANYON SWING

1848
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,441
One, two, three.

1849
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:53,509
CAMERA FIRST

1850
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:54,710
Can we go?

1851
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,345
Yes, you may go.

1852
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,315
Let's go.

1853
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:00,382
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

1854
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,251
[Jimin] I knew you'd love this.

1855
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,221
Let's pull over here.

1856
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,624
STOPPING BRIEFLY ON THE NARROW ROAD
FOR ONCOMING CARS

1857
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:09,892
Oh!

1858
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:11,994
What a nice young man.

1859
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:16,232
[in English] Let's go.

1860
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,366
[Jung Kook] Great.

1861
01:17:17,433 --> 01:17:19,101
[in Korean] You want some music?

1862
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,570
-Sure.
-Got a song you want to hear?

1863
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,872
Me?

1864
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,540
AN UNEXPECTED CHOICE...

1865
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,041
EMOTIONAL

1866
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,515
GROANING

1867
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,416
It suddenly feels depressing.

1868
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:38,187
Doesn't it make you want to go home
and drink soju?

1869
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:44,326
PARK AND JEON FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE IN THE MOVIE, LUCKED OUT

1870
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:49,298
QUICKLY CHANGING THE MOOD

1871
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,366
HESITATES

1872
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:51,433
Listen.

1873
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,335
You know...

1874
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:55,838
Maybe a video message?

1875
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,106
Sure.

1876
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,842
-To whom?
-Me?

1877
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,110
To Bam?

1878
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,578
Bam?

1879
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:05,281
-To Bam.
-Bam, it's me.

1880
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,515
Oh!

1881
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,319
-How are you?
-This music makes it too sad.

1882
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,089
Since you've been sick so often lately,

1883
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:18,460
I haven't been able
to take care of you well.

1884
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,197
I'm sorry for being so lacking.

1885
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:24,166
ONLY WHAT HE COULDN'T DO FOR HIM
COMES TO MIND

1886
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,568
It breaks my heart.

1887
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,005
Seeing that you're doing well there,

1888
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,107
I feel relieved,

1889
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,611
and I just hope you're happy.

1890
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:40,115
I'll go see you
as soon as I'm back in Korea.

1891
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,250
I WILL GO VISIT BAM

1892
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,354
I'll say a few words to Ddosun.

1893
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:47,623
Hope you're doing well. Ddosun?

1894
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,260
Ddosun, how's life up there
in puppy heaven?

1895
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:55,998
I really...

1896
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:59,868
[singing]

1897
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:07,109
DDOSUN STILL HAS A PLACE DEEP IN HIS HEART

1898
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,180
I loved you.

1899
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,615
I miss you, Ddosun.

1900
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:17,219
-My family raised her when I was five.
-I see.

1901
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,287
[clicks tongue]

1902
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,323
I cried so much when she left.

1903
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,092
Kind of like Gureum.

1904
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:24,693
HE CRIED A LOT THAT DAY

1905
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,630
[singing]

1906
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:36,305
BEING IN SUCH A PEACEFUL PLACE MAKES THEM
THINK OF THEIR FURRY FRIENDS EVEN MORE

1907
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:43,646
THEY WISH ONLY HEALTH
AND HAPPINESS FOR THEM

1908
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:50,819
MAY THEIR HEARTS REACH
THEIR BELOVED FRIENDS...

1909
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,388
[Jung Kook] Let's park.

1910
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,455
NEAR THE LODGE

1911
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,258
Nice, right?

1912
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:57,459
Awesome.

1913
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,194
-Thank you for the ride.
-Sure.

1914
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,363
There's no place to pull over.

1915
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:04,199
No, no, on the way here.

1916
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,501
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

1917
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:06,935
On your way,

1918
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,138
-if you see a pretty spot,
-Yeah.

1919
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,040
-you can just pull over.
-Okay.

1920
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,243
Let's see if there's a nice place
on the way.

1921
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,311
Okay.

1922
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,413
Somewhere totally random?

1923
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,415
READY TO PARK IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

1924
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,849
Here? In the middle?

1925
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,051
Here?

1926
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:26,221
We really think the same way.

1927
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,289
Here?

1928
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:29,325
Great. Here?

1929
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,693
Circling the roundabout?

1930
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:34,930
We're doomed. Let's go.

1931
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,131
Nowhere to stop.

1932
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,533
What a shame.

1933
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,535
[director] Shall we go
grab some ice cream?

1934
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,036
Sounds good. On foot?

1935
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,173
My bag.

1936
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,374
Is it in the back?

1937
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:46,809
Down there? My bag.

1938
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,444
-In front.
-Front?

1939
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,845
Ice cream.

1940
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,013
WALKING TO GET ICE CREAM

1941
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,548
[sighs]

1942
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:57,019
If the sunlight were a little less strong,

1943
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,221
that'd be perfect.

1944
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,223
It's so hot.

1945
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,658
HE FEELS AS HOT

1946
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:04,159
The light's coming from behind.

1947
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,496
-That kid...
-He's using a stick.

1948
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:09,531
[Jung Kook] He probably
thinks he's rowing.

1949
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:11,166
So cute.

1950
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,702
HI

1951
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:15,904
HI #2

1952
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:18,841
The kid's mom waved hello.

1953
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,914
A PEACEFUL TOWN
THAT NATURALLY BRINGS SMILES

1954
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:26,982
So cute.

1955
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:31,153
Oh, wait.

1956
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,221
What?

1957
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:33,522
What's with the sun?

1958
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:34,790
THE SUNLIGHT'S TOO STRONG

1959
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:36,358
It hurts so much.

1960
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:37,626
My outfit makes it hotter.

1961
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:42,164
But I don't want to wear short sleeves.

1962
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,967
I just want to dive into some cool water.

1963
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,568
-Into the water?
-Yeah.

1964
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,604
You'd get the worst sunburn ever.

1965
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,671
Totally.

1966
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,373
My goodness.

1967
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,509
JUST AS THE HEAT
STARTS TO WEAR THEM OUT...

1968
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,177
Where is it? Here?

1969
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,612
ARRIVED AT THE SHOP

1970
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:00,783
ORDERING ICE CREAM WITHOUT HESITATION

1971
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,151
[in English] Cone ice cream.

1972
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,685
Cone? Yes.

1973
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,053
Chocolate and vanilla.

1974
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,722
JIMIN ORDERS CHOCOLATE & VANILLA

1975
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:07,856
How much?

1976
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,559
LARGE SIZE ICE CREAM: 4.70 FRANCS

1977
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,194
70 FRANCS?

1978
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,729
Oh, 4.70 francs.

1979
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:14,897
[in Korean] Getting one?

1980
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,098
-Yeah.
-Different one?

1981
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:18,901
Mango?

1982
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:20,436
Oh.

1983
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,570
[in English] Thank you.

1984
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:23,972
[man] Mango, in the cone?

1985
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,341
[in English] Mango and strawberry.

1986
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,510
JUNG KOOK ORDERS
MANGO & STRAWBERRY IN A CUP

1987
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,779
-[in Korean] Is it good?
-Wow.

1988
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:34,283
SHARING MAKES IT TASTE EVEN BETTER

1989
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:36,485
PURE BLISS

1990
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:37,553
Here you go.

1991
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,687
[in English] Thank you.

1992
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,956
-Pay with cash or card? Cash.
-[English] Cash.

1993
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:43,559
-How much?
-12.70.

1994
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,327
A TOTAL OF 12.70 FRANCS FOR ICE CREAM

1995
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:48,163
JUNG KOOK TASTES
MANGO & STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM

1996
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,231
THUMBS UP

1997
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:52,067
-Here.
-Thank you very much.

1998
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:53,836
ICE CREAM PURCHASE COMPLETE

1999
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,972
TIME TO DIG IN

2000
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,607
ONE BITE OF STRAWBERRY

2001
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,776
ONE BITE OF MANGO

2002
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:03,612
-[in Korean] Ah! Want to try?
-[in Korean] Is it good?

2003
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,414
No, I'm good.

2004
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,549
Do you see it melting already?

2005
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:10,018
Look, it started melting
the moment we bought it.

2006
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,453
That's how hot it is.

2007
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,655
But once it hits dawn, it gets freezing.

2008
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:15,324
NOM

2009
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,360
ADVANCED SKILL: EATING FROM THE BOTTOM

2010
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:21,396
Won't it fall?

2011
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:23,398
CALLED IT

2012
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:24,666
[sighs]

2013
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,335
It's melting too fast.

2014
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:30,072
PROBLEM SOLVED BY EATING

2015
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,673
FINISHING IT UP ON A BENCH

2016
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,208
It never disappoints.

2017
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:34,810
Strawberry-mango.

2018
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:36,778
Is that even a usual combo?

2019
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,881
It could be. I bet it is.

2020
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,249
They go so well.

2021
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,984
JUNG KOOK CLEARS HIS TOO

2022
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,919
Strawberry and mango, unbeatable.

2023
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:48,657
TAKING A SHORT BREAK

2024
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:50,459
[crew member] I'm wiped.

2025
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,494
You should jump in the water.

2026
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:55,230
You've got everything ready?

2027
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,332
All the conditions are met now.

2028
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,569
It'd feel amazing to jump in right now.

2029
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:03,305
If I had a rash guard and slippers,
I'd go in.

2030
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,275
I don't have slippers. I'm in socks
and shoes, how would I?

2031
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,910
MAKING EXCUSES NOT TO GO IN

2032
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:09,645
So all you need is slippers?

2033
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,113
Oh, boy.

2034
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:12,548
WHY BOTHER

2035
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:15,450
Well, sure.

2036
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:16,652
IF YOU WISH...

2037
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,253
AWKWARD LAUGH

2038
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,089
No pants? Oh, there they are.

2039
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,824
Let's go and jump in.

2040
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,459
Huh? Not me.

2041
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,895
I didn't ask for this.

2042
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:28,130
A DISASTER HE MADE...

2043
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,698
Hold on.

2044
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:30,766
Oh, come on.

2045
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,467
GETTING READY TO WEAR SLIPPERS

2046
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:36,305
Why did you even bother bringing these?

2047
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:38,807
Seriously.

2048
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,008
OFF TO GET CHANGED

2049
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,209
Oh boy...

2050
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:45,681
WAITING PATIENTLY...

2051
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,517
JUNG KOOK COMES OUT IN A RASH GUARD

2052
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:49,918
This is why...

2053
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,754
people should watch

2054
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,823
what they say.

2055
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,293
You gotta think before you talk.

2056
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,666
Why did you have to bring it up?

2057
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:07,636
Are you sure?!

2058
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:11,673
Are you sure?

2059
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,609
[groans]

2060
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,611
Check the water temperature first.

2061
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:16,778
[Jimin] Jung Kook again.

2062
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:19,448
Why me? How did I end up like this?

2063
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,317
I didn't think
they'd actually go get them.

2064
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:25,053
-They really ran to get it.
-How did this start again?

2065
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,922
Oh, I said it'd be nice to go in.

2066
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,825
-Yeah, you did.
-Well, that was from earlier.

2067
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:34,196
A GRACEFUL SWAN APPEARS,
GLIDING ACROSS THE LAKE

2068
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,531
Jung Kook, can you catch it?
Dinner's that swan.

2069
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:38,000
-Swan meat?
-Swan meat.

2070
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:39,067
Swan meat!

2071
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,969
[Jimin chuckles]

2072
01:25:41,036 --> 01:25:43,672
AT THE WORD "SWAN MEAT,"
THE BIRD CHANGE COURSE

2073
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:45,607
-Go catch it.
-Okay, I'm going.

2074
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:47,109
-Yeah.
-Here I go.

2075
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:48,410
But I think it's strong.

2076
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:51,613
If it pecks you,
it might crack your head open.

2077
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,982
I'll just grab its beak
and twist its neck.

2078
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:58,420
THE SWAN SUDDENLY CHARGES
RIGHT AFTER HE SAYS THAT

2079
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,022
[Jimin] It came so close.

2080
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,824
-Why did you come?
-[Jung Kook] Why?

2081
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,259
[Jimin] It's really come.

2082
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,262
SWAN RUSHES TOWARD JUNG KOOK

2083
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:11,099
PANICKING

2084
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,001
TRIES TO MAKE PEACE

2085
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:14,136
PEACE REJECTED

2086
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:16,938
[all laughing]

2087
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,106
A FACE-OFF WITH IT

2088
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,975
This is absolutely absurd.

2089
01:26:21,043 --> 01:26:22,377
What, what do you want?

2090
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:24,780
I think it's asking for food.

2091
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:27,983
THE SWAN KEEPS APPROACHING

2092
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:32,354
BACKING AWAY AFTER ALL THAT BRAVADO...

2093
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:33,422
Wait...

2094
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:37,559
ATTACK INITIATED

2095
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,128
AH!
(=GO AWAY!)

2096
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:42,564
-Go.
-It wants your autograph.

2097
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:43,632
GO ON, SHOO!

2098
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,467
A STRANGE STANDOFF

2099
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,002
[Jimin] Asking for an autograph.

2100
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:48,837
What's your name?

2101
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:50,305
[in English] What's your name?

2102
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:53,341
[in Korean] What? There's no food.

2103
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,543
Stop it.

2104
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:55,811
Hey, hey, hey.

2105
01:26:55,911 --> 01:26:58,413
[Jimin laughing] This is ridiculous.

2106
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,282
THE SWAN LEAVES EMPTY-HANDED

2107
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,750
It's walking away like that.

2108
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:03,051
Looks kind of upset.

2109
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:04,386
Yeah, totally.

2110
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:05,921
[Jung Kook] Bye.

2111
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,490
[Jimin] That's hilarious. So funny.

2112
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,560
It was way over there
and suddenly came straight at me.

2113
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:12,661
COMEDY GODS ADORE HIM

2114
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:13,962
It must've been terrified.

2115
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:17,099
Hey, it's because you mentioned swan meat.

2116
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:18,900
Hey, I spared your life.

2117
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:22,504
If it had come a bit closer,
I would've taken it on.

2118
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:23,805
A BLUFFING COWARD

2119
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:25,340
[Jimin] Now the swan's sulking.

2120
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,676
Look, it's pouting all the way over there.

2121
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,578
-Hey, come back.
-[Jimin chuckles]

2122
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,247
When it came charging at me,
I freaked out.

2123
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,484
Hey, hey, hey.

2124
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,085
ATTRACTED BY GOOD REACTIONS

2125
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:38,620
[Jimin] These ones are fine.

2126
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,490
Hey, these guys are okay.

2127
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:43,158
[Jung Kook] Man, today I've...

2128
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:44,326
eaten well,

2129
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:47,095
hit the sauna, done everything.

2130
01:27:47,162 --> 01:27:50,532
COME ON, LET'S GO

2131
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:54,002
The way you backpedaled was hilarious.

2132
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:55,904
I'm telling you, that was scary.

2133
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:57,873
I couldn't help it.

2134
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,875
We got the perfect shot.

2135
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,712
NOW JIMIN'S GETTING READY TO SWIM TOO

2136
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:05,814
CHANGED INTO HIS RASH GUARD

2137
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:07,983
That swan was so funny.

2138
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,050
There it is again.

2139
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,486
THE SCENE-STEALER STILL HOVERING NEARBY

2140
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:14,055
Maybe I should precool a little here.

2141
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:15,423
[groaning]

2142
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,195
No wonder I lost my voice.

2143
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,165
I want to get good at swimming.

2144
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:26,434
I need to learn survival swimming,
like breaststroke.

2145
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,103
SPOTS A PAIR OF SLIPPERS

2146
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,437
Think these will float?

2147
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:32,307
Maybe?

2148
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:38,680
USING SLIPPERS INSTEAD OF KICKBOARDS

2149
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:45,353
JIMIN TRIES SWIMMING ALONE IN THE LAKE

2150
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:49,324
[exclaims] There's a rock.

2151
01:28:49,391 --> 01:28:50,392
THANK GOD

2152
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,927
Go back.

2153
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:56,064
SAFELY RETURNS TO SHORE

2154
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:58,466
I think this actually helps, Jung Kook.

2155
01:28:58,533 --> 01:28:59,968
Really? Does it float?

2156
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:04,873
I'll follow you. These help.

2157
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:08,910
JUNG KOOK HEADS INTO THE LAKE

2158
01:29:08,977 --> 01:29:10,145
You can float?

2159
01:29:10,212 --> 01:29:11,546
You can even just walk.

2160
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:13,315
There are rocks.

2161
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,518
JIMIN WALKS AFTER HIM

2162
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:19,120
I can't touch the ground.

2163
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,857
STRETCHING HIS LEGS TO THE MAX

2164
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,959
Okay, okay.

2165
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,827
[Jung Kook] There's a higher rock here.

2166
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:27,429
Why are we so far apart?

2167
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:28,496
FEELS FARTHER

2168
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:30,131
Can two people stand there?

2169
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,533
-No.
-No?

2170
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,437
If you hold half a breath in your lungs...

2171
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:39,774
SPLASHING

2172
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,376
How does he float so well?

2173
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:42,444
NATURAL FLOATERS

2174
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,246
We look like we're floating.

2175
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:45,947
Like this...

2176
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:47,515
Look like we're swimming?

2177
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,517
Looks like we're good?

2178
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:51,052
Like we're swimming?

2179
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,220
LOOKS CONVINCING

2180
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:54,890
Without these,
we really look like swimming.

2181
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:56,424
I can't do this without them.

2182
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:57,759
They really work.

2183
01:29:57,826 --> 01:29:58,960
SLIPPER-KICKBOARD

2184
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,028
They work great.

2185
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:05,634
-Not bad, huh?
-Huh?

2186
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:08,603
You're kidding.

2187
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,907
DID JUNG KOOK JUST FALL IN?

2188
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:15,744
FLAILING

2189
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,913
-No?
-No, it's just...

2190
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,581
I am swimming fine, but...

2191
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:22,517
DUN-DUN

2192
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:23,585
FOR THIS SHOT

2193
01:30:23,652 --> 01:30:25,320
[Jimin] You liar.

2194
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,256
Wait a sec.

2195
01:30:28,323 --> 01:30:30,091
-There's the big one.
-Jung Kook.

2196
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,861
Jung Kook.

2197
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:36,798
SLIPPER SEPARATION

2198
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:38,633
Jung Kook, my slipper.

2199
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,268
[exclaims]

2200
01:30:40,335 --> 01:30:45,473
SWIFT RESCUE OPERATION

2201
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:50,445
MISSION: SAVE THE SLIPPER

2202
01:30:50,512 --> 01:30:52,647
Okay, I'll show you my way out.

2203
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:53,782
Going in one go.

2204
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:02,824
REACHES SHORE IN ONE GO
THANKS TO THE SLIPPER KICKBOARD

2205
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:10,165
Anyone who can't swim,
get one of these. It's the best.

2206
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,533
Can really swim with it.

2207
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,702
JUNG KOOK RETURNS

2208
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:14,769
Shall we go?

2209
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,005
Why did we even start this?

2210
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:18,373
Nah, I had fun.

2211
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,075
Me too. I'm just freezing.

2212
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:21,609
-It's cold.
-Wait.

2213
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:22,744
Let's grab our stuff.

2214
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,312
Wait, we have stuff?

2215
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:26,381
NEVER FORGETS TO TAKE HIS STUFF

2216
01:31:26,448 --> 01:31:27,983
HEADING BACK TO THE LODGE

2217
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,384
LAUGHING

2218
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,654
SUDDENLY HIT BY A LAUGHTER VIRUS

2219
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:40,128
ONE LAUGH, AND THEY CAN'T STOP...

2220
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:41,229
Doctor Strange.

2221
01:31:41,296 --> 01:31:42,330
Blue cape.

2222
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,033
NOW THEY'RE PLAYING DOCTOR STRANGE

2223
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:49,804
Dormammu...

2224
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:53,408
RANDOM ATTACK TO HIS CHIN

2225
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:59,781
THE DOCTOR STRANGE BIT IS STILL GOING...

2226
01:32:00,382 --> 01:32:02,751
I think we passed our lodge.

2227
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,586
[crew member] You passed it.

2228
01:32:06,054 --> 01:32:07,122
Where is it?

2229
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,424
WAIT... WHERE IS OUR HOUSE AGAIN?

2230
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:11,659
THE REAL LODGE ENTRANCE

2231
01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:19,868
END OF THE WILD, CHAOTIC FREE TIME!

2232
01:32:21,336 --> 01:32:23,438
[Jimin] Today, I'll do all the cooking.

2233
01:32:23,505 --> 01:32:25,473
BUT IT'S ALREADY LOOKING SHAKY...

2234
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,375
I don't know how to cut a zucchini.

2235
01:32:28,777 --> 01:32:30,578
It doesn't seem cooked at all.

2236
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,580
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN'T DO

2237
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:34,015
Okay, go on in.

2238
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:35,884
I'll brown it nicely.

2239
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:38,720
STEPS SLOWLY APPROACHING

2240
01:32:38,787 --> 01:32:40,789
-Get back in there.
-Can I taste it?

2241
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:43,291
I don't think I have any talent
for cooking.

2242
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:44,592
My first time ever cooking.
