I really want to show this.

183
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,460
PRETTY THINGS ARE MEANT TO BE SHARED

184
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,699
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT, THEY ARRIVED

185
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,100
[Jimin] Shall we go down?

186
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,469
This is insane.

187
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,604
Seriously.

188
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,307
The color is incredible.

189
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,875
EVEN MORE SURREAL UP CLOSE

190
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,744
I should take a pic with my phone.

191
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,613
That drone's ours, right?

192
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,848
Yeah, it is.

193
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,683
TIME FOR SOME PHOTOS

194
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,918
You don't need to look.

195
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,721
[both laugh]

196
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,556
Perfect right now.

197
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,191
It looks natural.

198
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,726
Perfect. My gosh.

199
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,027
-Take one for me.
-Okay.

200
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,095
The same way.

201
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,196
-Okay.
-Look.

202
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,330
And then...

203
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,166
[chuckles]

204
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,070
I saw this on YouTube.

205
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,539
You take it like this,
it comes out naturally.

206
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,841
Hold on.

207
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,942
Naturally?

208
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,544
This gives you a natural shot,
YouTube says.

209
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,448
[Jimin] That's nice.

210
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
[Jung Kook] Let's go grab
something to drink.

211
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,585
[Jimin] Okay.

212
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,653
[producer] Should we buy you something?

213
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,722
-Sure.
-[producer] What do you want?

214
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,258
Do they have tea? Like mint? Herb mint?

215
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,559
Just water for me.

216
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,061
-[producer] Water?
-Yes.

217
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,496
They're really good.

218
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:51,898
Now that's skill.

219
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,500
[Jimin] Right.

220
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,135
If I try to go that slow?

221
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,103
I end up sinking like this.

222
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,105
[muttering]

223
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,441
PASSING BY

224
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,243
[in English] Bless you.

225
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,978
[in Korean] So cute.

226
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,746
Adorable.

227
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,114
You can't stay still there.

228
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,483
-It wasn't salty when I tasted it.
-Thank you.

229
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,651
Pour this in...

230
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,953
Isn't the ice gonna melt?

231
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,689
AS THE ICE MELTS, THE DRINK SPILLS TOO

232
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,924
Hey, quiet.

233
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,161
It's nice and cool.

234
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,763
Uh-huh.

235
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,864
It's good.

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,203
A PEACEFUL HEALING MOMENT
BETWEEN GREEN AND BLUE

237
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,839
[Jung Kook] It's really nice.
You feel more relaxed here.

238
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,975
[Jimin] I want to try that.

239
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,277
Doesn't look too hard.

240
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,345
The water's calm, maybe it's doable.

241
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,082
-Since you came all the way here...
-Yes.

242
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,149
RANDOM DRAW

243
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,651
[Jimin] I'm fine with anything.

244
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,019
[producer] One, two, three.

245
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,555
We'll go by the order
of the KakaoTalk messages.

246
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,756
We won't change it.

247
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,258
Then psychologically,
number two seems the safest.

248
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,793
-Psychologically...
-[Jimin] Two.

249
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,564
I think they probably sent
something unusual for number three.

250
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,334
But I think number two would
be neutral and safe.

251
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,969
Yeah, something average.

252
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,171
-You're good.
-[producer] PD Hana.

253
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,140
Show us the messages in order.

254
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,043
-Either one or three must be the best.
-Right.

255
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,911
-It's a 50-50.
-Right, right.

256
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,213
Number two's not bad.

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,747
-Number two's the safest.
-Yes.

258
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,549
We'll go with number two.

259
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,650
One, two, three.

260
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,718
-Number 2.
-Number 2.

261
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,920
Okay, I'll show you.
I swear I'm not lying.

262
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,555
Number two.

263
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,657
Number three.

264
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,227
Hey, number two is the worst one.

265
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,328
Let's go.

266
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,430
HEADING INTO THE BLUE LAKE

267
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,765
MAKING A GRAND ENTRANCE

268
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,734
Where is it? Here?

269
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,902
Where is it?

270
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,037
We just go down?

271
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,173
We ended up really going.

272
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,176
DIFFERENT FROM THE PHOTO

273
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,444
[Jung Kook] It's smaller.

274
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,617
Whoa, that's cold.

275
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,418
SUDDENLY GOES IN THE WATER

276
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,853
[Jung Kook] Why did you go in?

277
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,826
All right, let's go.

278
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,127
All right, let's go.

279
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,499
RUSHES BACK FOR FEAR OF BEING LEFT BEHIND

280
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,035
Once you're in, you really feel it.

281
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,670
-Cold?
-Your body won't float.

282
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,576
JIMIN GETS ON BOARD FIRST

283
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:20,513
BOARDED SAFELY UNDER EXPERT GUIDANCE

284
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,650
CAREFULLY SETS OFF

285
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,784
Let's go.

286
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,919
WOBBLY WOBBLE

287
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,021
Whoa, this is tricky. It's tricky.

288
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,658
Relax, Jimin. Just relax.

289
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,395
RELAXED AND SLOWLY FINDING HIS BALANCE

290
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,863
It's better now.

291
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,634
QUICKLY GOT THE HANG OF IT

292
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,469
Seriously, it's so beautiful.

293
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,443
Let's try going to that island.

294
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,778
I really wanna go there.

295
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,646
JIMIN ENJOYING THE SCENERY

296
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,750
A STRANGE NOISE IS HEARD FROM BEHIND

297
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,818
[exclaims]

298
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,255
JUNG KOOK MAKING A LOUD, DRAMATIC START

299
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:07,794
POPPIN' PADDLING BEGINS

300
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,995
Where are you going?

301
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,863
Where am I going?

302
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,998
Why won't this turn?

303
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,369
Jung Kook, come here.

304
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,605
BLAZING A NEW TRAIL

305
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,073
I can't change directions.

306
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,475
Let's go forward.

307
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,881
IN THE END, HE HAS A ONE-ON-ONE LESSON

308
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,185
FOCUSED MODE ON

309
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,021
BORN ATHLETE LEARNS INSTANTLY

310
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,889
Okay.

311
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,291
BACK ON TRACK

312
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,359
Jimin.

313
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,761
Jimin, wait for me.

314
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,963
Jimin.

315
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,902
-Jimin.
-Yes, come on.

316
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,304
[Jimin] This is so much fun.

317
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,405
I'm loving this.

318
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,874
-Hello.
-Hello.

319
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,410
-Here for a getaway?
-Oh, nothing fancy.

320
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,412
-I see.
-Yeah.

321
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,247
-It's fun.
-Right?

322
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,549
A PEACEFUL TRIP ACROSS THE EMERALD LAKE

323
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,954
[exclaiming]

324
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,024
SMOOTH PARKING

325
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,727
ARRIVED AT THE DIVING SPOT

326
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,862
So then...

327
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,929
TYING IT UP

328
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,298
Like this.

329
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,733
What, are you tying it? You are?

330
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,135
Yeah.

331
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,269
Tying it where?

332
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,238
I'm tying it to the front.

333
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,407
But it's a bit short.

334
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,742
Mine's all tied up.

335
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,344
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'LL WORK

336
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,181
FIX IT WITH MUSCLES

337
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,316
Just lift it up.

338
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,951
Oh, right, that works too.

339
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,522
It's nothing, really, Jimin.

340
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,490
That's good. All right.

341
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,260
[whoops]

342
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,695
All right.

343
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,699
SPLASHING INTO THE LAKE
THAT LOOKS SO REFRESHING

344
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,766
Jimin.

345
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:55,802
That was awesome.

346
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:01,140
POV: FROM THE LAKE ITSELF

347
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,510
You filthy little rascal.

348
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,412
UNTYING THE PADDLEBOARD

349
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,282
You filthy little rascal.

350
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,552
Damn it.

351
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,488
LOST THE PADDLEBOARD RIGHT BEFORE HIS EYES

352
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:19,392
QUICK GETAWAY

353
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,228
-He's just leaving like that?
-[producer] It seems so.

354
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,697
-Goodbye, then!
-[Jimin all laughing]

355
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,270
CASUALLY ENJOYING THE MOMENT

356
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,507
Is this a declaration of war?

357
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,210
DANGER DETECTED

358
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:41,581
JIMIN CLOSING IN FAST

359
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,785
SUDDEN CHASE BEGINS

360
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,257
[Jimin] Oh, you're fast as expected.

361
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,194
GAP BETWEEN THEM KEEPS GROWING

362
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,498
JIMIN, KO

363
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,468
-Jimin.
-Yes.

364
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,771
Why were you chasing me?

365
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,039
I wasn't even chasing that hard.

366
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,808
I went after you once.

367
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,410
You're mistaken.

368
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:19,552
MISCHIEF MODE ON

369
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,021
Such dirty tricks you play.

370
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,892
I could totally push you in the water
with full force.

371
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,361
GETS PUSHED JUST LIKE THAT

372
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,464
A BITTER ENDING

373
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,132
[Jimin] That was fun.

374
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,301
It was so relaxing and peaceful.

375
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,003
[in English] Let's get in the car.

376
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,871
[laughing]

377
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,379
[Jung Kook] Let's go to eat some burgers.

378
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,447
[Jimin] Let's go.

379
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,921
[in Korean] It's amazing that there's
a whole village up in the mountains.

380
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,256
-Like something out of a fairy tale.
-Yeah.

381
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,692
[Jimin] I feel like
I'm inside a storybook.

382
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,695
So far away from modern life.

383
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,132
Honestly, I want to live
somewhere like this when I get old.

384
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,268
I remember feeling something
similar once before.

385
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,370
Remember when we went to Sweden?

386
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,040
I really loved that trip.

387
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,275
I've always wanted to go back there.

388
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,110
But this place isn't losing either.

389
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,178
GREAT START

390
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,081
-[Jung Kook] If you're happy, that's good.
-I love it here.

391
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,118
A DAY IN SWITZERLAND THAT WE WILL

392
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,588
SUDDENLY REMEMBER SOMEDAY

393
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,358
[Jimin] It's over there.

394
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,227
-[Jung Kook] Right.
-Barger's.

395
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,628
Perfect. We can eat outside.

396
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,762
-Yeah.
-Good find.

397
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,265
This place looks really good.

398
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,399
This burger shop?

399
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,536
They say it's so good,
it's worth coming back here.

400
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,804
It's close, right?

401
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,038
Closest one from here.

402
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,206
-Let's go here.
-Here?

403
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,274
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

404
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,642
-20 mins from here?
-Yeah.

405
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,077
That's close.

406
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,311
Excuse me.

407
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,379
WITH EXCITEMENT

408
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,114
It's the same menu we saw.

409
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,850
I think this must be the original.

410
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,318
And they have chicken.

411
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,553
And ham.

412
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,954
This one's the classic.

413
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,856
-Barger's burgers.
-We should get

414
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,858
-the top one. Let's get this.
-Yeah.

415
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,727
I'll take the cheese one. Wait.

416
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,895
I'll go with the same.

417
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,163
-[Jung Kook in English] Can I order?
-Order? Yes.

418
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,899
BURGER ORDER: COMPLETE

419
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,667
-Okay.
-[Jimin in English] Thank you.

420
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,168
[in Korean] Let's grab a seat.

421
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,937
This is nice.

422
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,972
[in Korean] I can't wait to eat
that burger.

423
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,107
I'm starving.

424
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,643
When's it coming? I'm hungry.

425
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,381
THE LONG-AWAITED BURGERS HAVE ARRIVED

426
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,218
MOUTHWATERING PRESENTATION

427
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,686
[Jimin humming]

428
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,691
I'm digging in.

429
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,965
Go ahead.

430
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,533
Why is it so good?

431
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,368
Let me try.

432
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,737
THRILL OF THE FIRST BITE

433
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,805
I'm excited.

434
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,375
Why are the buns so thick?

435
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,211
FURROWED BROWS OF TRUTH

436
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,250
[both] Mmm!

437
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,953
THUMBS UP

438
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,220
-It's good.
-Yeah.

439
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,956
Way too good.

440
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,691
Mmm!

441
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,758
BURGER

442
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,926
TRULY

443
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,161
DELICIOUS

444
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,863
SO GOOD, HE WANTS TO TELL EVERY CAMERA

445
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,166
This is so good.

446
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,101
What a great find.

447
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm coming back here just for this burger.

448
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,740
Hey, here.

449
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:28,841
OFFERING FRIES

450
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,812
Here, you're not eating?

451
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,980
I'm taking it, then.

452
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,950
You see,
it's because you're not one with nature.

453
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,520
GENTLY IN SYNC WITH NATURE

454
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,255
TAKING THE FRIES

455
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,323
The bird took it.

456
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,525
You're not supposed
to come off as threatening.

457
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,593
ANOTHER ONE ARRIVES

458
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,661
Again?

459
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,063
Succeed this time.

460
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,467
FLIES OFF RIGHT BEFORE HIM

461
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,668
Wow, how rude.

462
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,671
It flew right over us.

463
00:18:58,738 --> 00:18:59,972
ANGRY AT THE SPARROW

464
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,308
You...

465
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,945
Don't fly over people
while they're eating, okay?

466
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,246
-Success.
-[Jimin] Success?

467
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,814
-Success.
-That one's clever.

468
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,250
THERE WAS A BURGER...

469
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,518
NOW IT'S GONE

470
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,021
I'll just pay with mine first.

471
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,522
-Oh, for mine too?
-Yeah.

472
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,623
Or with your money?

473
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,724
SNEAKY SMILE

474
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,792
What the heck?

475
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,229
Why is there yours and mine?

476
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,930
-There isn't.
-Yeah.

477
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,501
My money is your money,
and your money is mine.

478
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,536
What's with that suspicious grin?

479
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,038
Just trust me.

480
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,741
A SMILE THAT INSPIRES ZERO TRUST

481
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,909
Let's go pay.

482
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,912
44 FRANCS PAID

483
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,147
Thank you very much.

484
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,516
[in English] Really delicious.

485
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,583
WET WIPES

486
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,985
-Thank you.
-Come again.

487
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,388
-[in English] Thank you. It was good.
-Thank you.

488
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,191
[in Korean] Wait, what? For hands?
I thought it was a snack.

489
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,060
What should we do now?

490
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,063
[Jimin in Korean] Jung Kook, make pasta.

491
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,131
-Is it three minutes away?
-Yeah.

492
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,968
Oh, very smooth.

493
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,104
[Jimin] We need oil?

494
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,007
[Jung Kook] Yeah, olive oil and garlic.

495
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,309
And something spicy, like chili pepper.

496
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,045
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

497
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,483
We're buying groceries for dinner tonight.

498
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,618
[Jung Kook] Canned whole tomatoes.

499
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,121
There's basil... Yeah, it's this one.

500
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,189
It's pricey.

501
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,257
-We can spend three for that.
-We can.

502
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,892
We still have enough.

503
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,895
This one's perfect. Good.

504
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,564
Can you add that spicy pepper?

505
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,998
-Peperoncino?
-Yeah.

506
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,800
It'd be great to have that.

507
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,736
A small one probably would be enough.

508
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,771
My gosh.

509
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,706
It'll work, right?

510
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,375
Where did Jimin go?

511
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,046
ON A QUEST TO FIND PEPERONCINO

512
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,882
Not sure, but I want to find it
and get a compliment.

513
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,017
Huh? Oh, this doesn't look right.

514
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,954
[in English] Excuse me.

515
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,790
-[woman] Hello.
-Where is the red pepper?

516
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,126
ASKING STAFF FOR HELP

517
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,095
FOUND IT WITH STAFF'S HELP

518
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,698
-Very kind.
-Have a nice trip.

519
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,299
Oh, thank you.

520
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,235
SHOWS IT OFF IMMEDIATELY

521
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,270
Oh, this one looks good.

522
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,906
I think this will work.

523
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,674
[in Korean] I tried hard to find it.

524
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,343
PROUD MOMENT

525
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,578
Do they not sell milk here?

526
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,413
Well, I don't work here, so...

527
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,149
Garlic, veggies...

528
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,818
-Right, we'll need those too.
-Yeah.

529
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,053
I'll go find them.

530
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,055
JIMIN SETS OFF AGAIN

531
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,024
That's too much. Way too much.

532
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,226
Small one. We don't need that much.

533
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,662
SOMETHING SMALLER?

534
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,831
OR MAYBE THIS ONE?

535
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:39,899
Let's go with this.

536
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,271
We need to get garlic and onions.
Or shallots.

537
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,506
Jung Kook said we need shallots.

538
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,775
Why are there so many types of garlic?

539
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,244
A single bulb?
But we don't need that much.

540
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,013
Actually, we might need a lot.

541
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,614
-Jung Kook?
-Yes.

542
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,782
Take a look at this.

543
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,250
Is this it?

544
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,785
Shallots? Yep, that's it.

SWEEPING UP MORE INGREDIENTS

547
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,392
Just random stuff?

548
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,459
We gotta eat.

549
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,461
Just go for it. Confidence is key.

550
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,363
But if this exceeds 50 francs...

551
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,332
It won't.

552
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,234
I kept track of all items.

553
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,869
TIME TO CHECK OUT

554
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,308
INGREDIENTS JUST KEEP COMING OUT

555
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,543
Oh, I forgot to include the pasta.

556
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,145
Huh?

557
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,947
Pasta isn't that expensive.

558
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,717
Hold on.
Let's put in the essentials first.

559
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,988
WILL IT STAY UNDER 50 FRANCS?

560
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,756
[Jimin] Wow, it's spot on.

561
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,091
[Jung Kook] Perfect.

562
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,426
[Jimin] It's perfect.

563
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,228
This is adulting.

564
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,863
A TRUE DISPLAY OF ADULTING

565
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,532
-Thank you very much. Bye!
-[in English] Thank you.

566
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,367
[in Korean] No shopping bag for us?

567
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,504
I grabbed this from the veggie section.
Let's use it.

568
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,441
A MOMENT AGO

569
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,809
I pulled out three...

570
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,177

571
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,112
-Oh, this works.
-Let's use it.

572
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,615
Let's fit what we can. The squishy stuff.

573
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,084
It's gonna rip.

574
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,685
-We've got one more.
-One more.

575
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,687
Frugal. So frugal.

576
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:13,759
[Jung Kook] Oh, 49 francs.
Nailed it. We did great.

577
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,861
-Let's carry them from here.
-Yeah.

578
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,230
We really saved a lot.

579
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,132
We even have change.

580
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,002

582
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,472
-[Jimin] Takes 20 minutes?
-Yeah, looks like it.

583
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,674
Man, I just wanna shower and lie down.

584
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,975
I actually have to.

585
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,244
But the lake water was so clean.

586
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,380
-It doesn't feel gross. Yeah.
-Right?

587
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,615
If it were seawater, it would.

588
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,183
-Definitely.
-Right.

589
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,052
I'd have salt powder on my body.

590

PICKING SONGS FOR THE DRIVE

591
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,325

-Right?
-Nope.

595
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,533
What? Isn't it "FAKE LOVE"?

596
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,734
Correct.

597
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,138

600
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:05,978
Correct.

601
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,085
It's not our song.

602
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,420
Then I can't guess it.

603
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,722
I'm sorry.

604
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,024
I'm sorry.

605
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,492
It's not our song.

606
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,694
A BITTERSWEET MOMENT

607
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,562
Sorry about that, Jung Kook.

608
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,832
Sorry about that.

609
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,668
We're here.

610
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:30,903
ARRIVED AT THE LODGE

611
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,005
[Jung Kook] We should put this
in the fridge.

612
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,406
[Jimin] I'll put it away.

617
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,947
This is kind of a loophole.

618
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,451
Free stuff.

622
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,128
[Jung Kook] Shall we go? Another round?

623
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,832
-[Jimin] Gotta start with ping pong.
-Never thought we'd be playing that here.

624
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,935
Haven't played it for a while.
I'm getting fired up again.

642
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,243
What do you say?

643
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,978
[producer] Let's bet your allowance.

644
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,713
We can go up to 6 francs.

645
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,482
[producer] If you lose, you have
to give back the 6 francs.

646
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,051
But if you win,

647

He's going to panic.
We've used lots of rackets.

728
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,176
-Go.
-Good.

729
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,345
-[Jung Kook] Let's begin.

730
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,115
STAFF TEAM WINS IT

731

-[Jung Kook] Okay.
-Okay. You serve first.

732
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,519
Let's begin. Go...

733
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,890
SNEAKY SERVE

734
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,458
GIVES UP A POINT

735
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,493
-[Jung Kook] One-love.
-One-love.

736
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,697
[Jung Kook] Okay.

737
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,798
CHECKS THE BALL

738
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,234
AND HITS A POWERFUL SMASH

739
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,469
Nice. 1 to 1 now.

740
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,672
SCORING BACK-TO-BACK

741
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,841
Okay, three to one.

742
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,776

SELF-INITIATED SWAP

744
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,913
[Jimin] You came in

00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,385
[Jung Kook] Three to two.

747
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,387
It's three to three now.

748
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,756
JIMIN STARTS TO FALTER

749
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:18,890
That didn't go in?

750
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,959
GIVES UP 5 POINTS IN A FLASH

751
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,594
Don't lose your cool.

752
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,862
Why would I lose it?

753
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,498
-I'll get to six points. Don't worry.
-Okay.

754
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,301
LOSING BOTH HIS COOL AND POINTS

755
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,503
OOF, THAT HURTS

756
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,739
-Jimin.
-Wait, let me show you.

757
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,809
BALL HITS THE TABLE BEFORE THE NET

758
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,011
ANOTHER POINT LOST

759
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,713
-Okay, seven to five.
-Yes. It's easy, Jung Kook.

760
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,417
Okay, now it's 7-6.

761
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,419
You're on a roll. Keep going.

762
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,221
SCORES AGAIN RIDING THE WAVE

763
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,289
Okay, 7-7.

764
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,923
-[Jimin] 7-7.
-You caught up.

765
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,725
-Jung Kook, you're up.

766
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,826
SUBSTITUTION

767
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,961
[Jung Kook] Here we go.

768
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,065
LOSES 1 POINT

769
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,933
LOSES ANOTHER POINT INSTANTLY

770
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,001
Is it my turn now?

771
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,336
-The score?
-Switch?

772
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,271
Is it 9-7?

773
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,806
It's Jung Kook Time.

774
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:08,974
BORN IN 1997

775
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,477

778
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,382
[Jung Kook] Jimin.

779
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,517
Should we switch?

780
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,851
Are you confident?

781
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,553
Yeah, I'll try.

782
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,755
-Going for the comeback.
-[Jimin] Okay.

783
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,458
That's the spirit.
Ping pong's all about that.

784
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,695
ONE LAST POINT TO END IT ALL

785
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,564
FULL-POWER SMASH

786
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,733
GAME OVER

787
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,169
[man] I'm sorry.

788
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,770
I'll go get the ball.

789
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,405
6 FRANCS

790
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,473
6 FRANCS FLY AWAY

791
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,041
[Jimin] There'll be another game.

792
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,209
-[Jung Kook] Jimin.
-Yes?

793
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,877
Four-love was a bit... [laughs]

794
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,212
Want to play a game?

795
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,247
-I won, remember?
-Want to bet 10 francs?

796
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,449
Thank you.

797
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,017
BOW TO THE DIRECTOR

798
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,887
-Congrats.
-[Jung Kook] A match is a match.

799
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,189
You're really good.

800
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,326
-[Jimin] When are we eating?
-Let's just eat now.

801
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,528
If you don't want to cook, don't have to.

802
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,064
No, I like my own cooking.

803
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,199
Oh?

804
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,567
Same here.

805
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,402
I like your cooking too.

806
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,570
Thanks, man.

807
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,805
-[Jimin] How many do we peel?
-A lot.

808
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,906
Shallots too. A lot.

809
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,709
Huh? This one peeled so well.

810
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:18,877
Just do it roughly.

811
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,216
Stop inspecting everything.

812
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,084
Here, I'll prep the shallots.

813
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,620
Here, you do one.
I'll take the smallest one.

814
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,589
Okay, cut it in half first.

815
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,195
CHEF JUNG KOOK'S PROFESSIONAL CHOPPING

816
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,563
Slicing straight down?

817
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,965
Where? Here?

818
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,600
Your hand position is wrong.

819
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,669
Jimin, stop shaking and just go.

820
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,506
Why are you standing next to me trembling?

821
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,607
How about garlic?

822
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,076
Garlic's actually dangerous. Please go.

823
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,244
Bring it on.

824
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,046
FLASHY KNIFE SKILLS

825
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,681

THE BEGINNER STRIKES BACK

827
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,354
Just go.

828
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,055
That looked pretty good, huh?

829
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,926
It must've looked impressive from behind.

830
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,364
Stop trying to match the rhythm.

831
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,606
Jimin, you're funny.

832
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,343
[Jung Kook laughing]

833
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,448
REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE

834
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,716
Jimin, just cut the garlic
however you want.

835
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

836
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,620
[Jimin] Darn it.

837
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,922
[Jung Kook laughs]

838
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,958
[Jimin] It's embarrassing.

839
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,161
BUT GIVING UP ISN'T MY THING

840
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,698
STARTS INTENSE GARLIC SLICING PRACTICE

841
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,501
BECOMING A SLICING MASTER

842
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,506
That persistence is impressive, Jimin.

843
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,575
I've gotten this far on persistence.

844
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,376
GARLIC SLICING COMPLETE

845
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,213
All right, I'm leaving now.
My work here is done.

846
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,416
Yep, great job.
I'll make you a delicious dish.

847
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,017
EARNED HIS ONE SERVING

848
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,085
Exit.

849
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,788
PASTA-MAKING BEGINS

850
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,524
HEATS OLIVE OIL

851
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,292
ADDS GARLIC SLICED BY JIMIN

852
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,527
He cut it nicely.

853
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,164
Let the garlic cook slowly on low heat.

854
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,067
DROPS A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF PASTA

855
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,169
You need to stir it in the beginning.

856
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,004
Or it'll stick to the bottom.

857
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,475
EYES ON THE REMAINING PASTA

858
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:31,943
Should I just use it all?

859
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,111
Would it be too much?

860
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,846
Is it too late?

861
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,350
Whatever.

862
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,952
DUMPS IT ALL IN

863
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,854
Whatever. It'll work out.

864
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,725
It'll be half al dente, half fully cooked.

865
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,159
Loads of shallots.

866
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,595
SPRINKLES SALT & PEPPER

867
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,930
FOR EVEN COOKING

868
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,565
Bring out the sweetness.

869
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,201
ADDS CREAMY MILK

870
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,671
That's a lot of noodles.

871
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,206
I'll eat it all for you.

872
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,008
FINISHING TOUCH: BASIL

873
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,243

JUNG KOOK'S BASIL CREAM PASTA COMPLETE

878
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,685
It's truly an honor, Jung Kook.

879
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:14,786
Let me try it.

880
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:15,854
TAKES A BITE

881
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,759
THIS IS...!

882
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,527
EYES POP WIDE OPEN

883
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,629
Doesn't it make you crave beer?

884
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,865
You seriously cook so fast now.

885
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,870
Wow.

886
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,138
Hey, what is this?

887
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,940
-[producer] This is delicious.
-Right.

888
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,541
It's so good. The pizza is good.

889
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,877
GOOD FOOD IS MEANT TO BE SHARED

890
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,613
After tasting Jung Kook's cooking,
I can't eat this.

891
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,248
-What is it?
-Tomato pasta.

892
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:47,886
TRYING THE LOCAL TOMATO PASTA

893
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,854
Yeah, mine is better.

894
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,856
There's a 100,000 won difference.

895
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,793
I'll take this one.

896
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,728
TAKES THE LAST NOODLE STRAND

897
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,430
It's just too good.

898
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,764
Seriously.

899
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,000
Wow, I got two pieces of garlic.

900
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,268
That's your doing.

901
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:04,536
Yep, I'll eat them all.

902
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,673
STRAIGHT INTO THE MOUTH

903
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,741
[exclaims]

904
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,111
JUNG KOOK SUDDENLY DEEP IN THOUGHT

905
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,180
Should I try making this pasta better?

906
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,414
[Jimin] Can you?

907
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,216
Now I'm curious.

908
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,652
[Jung Kook] Should I just try it?

909
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,389
What did it taste like?

910
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,626
ASSESSING THE PASTA'S CONDITION

911
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,728
DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

912
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,631
STARTS BOILING PASTA BROTH AGAIN

913
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,833
FULL RESUSCITATION BEGINS

914
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,668
Can you toss this in too?

915
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,536
-Yep.
-A little spicier?

916
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,840
ACCEPTS THE ASSISTANT'S SUGGESTION

917
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,808
PASTA REGAINING ITS SPIRIT

918
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,909
It looks tasty.

919
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:49,581
This was us in the army.
Jung Kook cooked, I did the dishes.

920
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,250
[Jung Kook] Pasta is all about cheese.

921
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,220
If you make it better, it'll be legendary.

922
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,355
It must be better than before, right?

923
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,525
JUNG KOOK'S TOMATO PASTA, REBORN

924
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,427
Let's see if it worked.

925
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,230
-Jung Kook. If it did,
-It might not have worked.

926
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,800
I'll brag about it wherever I go.

927
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,069
"Have you ever revived
a convenience meal?"

928
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,171
I just added cheese.

929
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,339
"My bro did it."

930
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,207
Just beat some cheese into it.

931
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,143
Dump in a ton of cheese, and boom.

932
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,513
DID THE FLAVOR COME BACK TO LIFE?

933
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,448
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

934
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,150
The flavor came back to life.

935
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,052
I can't believe it worked.

936
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,653
PASTA REVIVED BY A MASTER

937
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,322
This is wild. It actually worked?

938
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,527
DEVOURING IT LIKE IT'S HIS FIRST TIME

939
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,628
Mmm.

940
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,329
Seriously, this is good.

941
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,098
It was a good meal.

942
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,033
LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS MORE

943
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,069
SUDDENLY OPENS THE FRIDGE

944
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,137
Hey, save this one too.

945
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,205
FROM CONVENIENCE STORE

946
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,575
Save it for me.

947
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,411
-You want to eat more?
-Make it better.

948
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,247
What is this? Meat?

949
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,550
That thing looks like a rock.

950
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,685
WHAT USED TO BE PASTA

951
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,153
Really going to eat it?

952
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,089
If you make it better, I will.

953
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,924
DESPERATE PUPPY EYES

954
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,928
THE PASTA DOCTOR RISES AGAIN

955
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,963
WILL HE BE ABLE TO

956
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,998
REVIVE THE PASTA AGAIN?

957
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,668
Gosh, because of Jung Kook,
I can't even diet.

958
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,836
What?

959
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,107
I keep breaking my promise to ARMY.

960
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,344
I just had coffee for breakfast to diet,

961
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,113
then binge at night.

962
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,248
WHILE JUNG KOOK ENJOYS BREAKFAST

963
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,483
JUST SIPPING COFFEE

964
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,550
BUT THEN...

965
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:37,188
BINGE LIST
1. BURGER & FRIES

966
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,992
2. BASIL CREAM PASTA

967
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,362
3. TOMATO PASTA

968
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,298
What a foodie, Jimin.

969
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,502
A little less delicious,
and I wouldn't have kept eating.

970
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,171
But how am I supposed to resist
when it's this good?

971
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,273
HEHE

972
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,443
BACON, CPR KICKSTARTER

973
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,612
SAUTÉ IT

974
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,780
ADD THE PASTA

975
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,715
ADD MILK

976
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,816
[Jung Kook] Done.

977
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,017
Thank you, Jung Kook.

978
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,619
Much appreciated.

979
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,920
Whoa, that's creamy.

980
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,789
All the water's gone.

981
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,892
HE ADDS AS MUCH CHEESE AS HE LIKES

982
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,727
CHEESE POURING LIKE A WATERFALL

983
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,395
-[Jung Kook] Stop right there.
-Oh!

984
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,832
FINISHED WITH A DASH OF PEPPER

985
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,033
Oh, even pepper?

986
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,535
It might not taste good though.

987
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,037
-Right.
-Let me see if it's also good.

988
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,006
-Honestly...
-I'll be the judge.

989
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,841
I'm nervous too. Why am I?

990
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,442
HEART SUDDENLY POUNDING

991
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,979
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THIS FIRST BITE

992
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,684
A MEANINGFUL LOOK

993
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,954
GETTING NERVOUS TOO

994
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,294
YUP, IT'S DELICIOUS

995
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,296
SO GOOD, NO WORDS NEEDED

996
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,931
Give me some, I want a bite.

997
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,205
I shouldn't eat this with that.

998
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,040
Mmm!

999
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,741
-Good, right?
-It's good.

1000
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,377
So the bacon does work.

1001
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,445
Yeah.

1002
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,448
It tastes different from the previous one.

1003
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,083
Like being at a restaurant

1004
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,587
and ordering three different pastas.

1005
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,824
FINAL BITE

1006
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,293
You're eating a lot.
Because you skipped breakfast?

1007
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,529
Back in the army, I used to feed Jimin.

1008
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,831
He suggests we go on a diet.

1009
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,667
So I plan to just have lunch
and skip dinner,

1010
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,537
but then he asks me if I want to eat.

1011
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,405
And I'm like, "Aren't we on a diet?"

1012
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,074
Then he goes, "But I'm hungry."

1013
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,111
So he ends up taking me to eat together.

1014
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,813
Then since I'm full,

1015
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,782
I lie on my bunk like this,
and I don't see him.

1016
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,551
Turns out he went to work out.

1017
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm like, "How dare you go alone!"

1018
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,322
And he's like, "We just ate."

1019
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,690
NOTHING TO SAY

1020
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,859
-You should've gone with me.
-Why only me...

1021
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,062
I did that many times.
You should've come to work out.

1022
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,899
While you did that,
our military service ended.

1023
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,801
This was all
right before we were discharged.

1024
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,036
Still, thanks, man.

1025
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,906
It's thanks to the garlic you chopped.

1026
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,274
WARM AND FUZZY WRAP-UP

1027
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,910
That was seriously good. Goodness.

1028
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:16,147
A MEAL FILLED WITH HAPPINESS

1029
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:20,652
Seriously, today I feel like
I was treated to a special meal.

1030
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,054
[producer] You need money
to spend tomorrow.

1031
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,622
-[Jimin] Yes.
-[Jung Kook] Right.

1032
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,024
[producer] Let's play
yutnori.

1033
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,325
-[Jung Kook] Yutnori?
-Yes.

1034
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,027
We'll bet allowance money on it.

1035
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,996
This time, 50 francs are on the line.

1036
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,831
-50 francs?
-How does that sound?

1037
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,400
EYES TREMBLING WILDLY

1038
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,368
You mean 50 francs for the whole day?

1039
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,304
Fifty each?

1040
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,673
We spent 90 today, though.

1041
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,541
A single burger cost 20 francs.

1042
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,948
-Then, 100 francs in total.
-100 francs in total?

1043
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,549
-Thank you.
-50 each.

1044
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,650
-Sounds good.
-Yes.

1045
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,152
-50 each.
-Okay.

1046
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,487
But I'm a god. A Yut God.

1047
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,190
-Exactly.
-Call me the Yut God.

1048
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,060
Please call me "Yut God the Best Of Me."

1049
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,161
For this?

1050
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,228
Yeah.

1051
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,165
TRAP YUTNORI WITH YUT GOD

1052
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,266
BASIC TERMS

1053
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,234
PIGGYBACK: PIGGYBACK THE TEAM'S TOKEN

1054
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,104
CAPTURE: CATCH OPPONENT
AND GET ONE MORE THROW

1055
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,572
BACK-DO: MOVE BACK 1 SPACE

1056
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,140
Let's each set just one trap.

1057
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,376
We created such a fun game.

1058
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,912
TRAP RULE: LAND ON A TRAP, GO BACK TO "DO"

1059
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,514
GENTLE SPOILER:
THE TRAPS WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE

1060
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,284
It's my first time
playing with traps, actually.

1061
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:30,121
So the Yut God might just turn human...

1062
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,557
-Let's just do it.
-[producer] Who's going first?

1063
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,624
-Me first?
-Okay.

1064
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,726
Okay, me first?

1065
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,860
-No.
-Why not?

1066
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,428
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Second.

1067
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,496
No, be confident.

1068
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,098
Our spirit's kind of low.

1069
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,433
Come on, let's raise it.

1070
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,736
TRYING TO RAISE IT WITH HIS FACE

1071
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,872
We lost at ping pong.

1072
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,574
Yeah, we're really off today.

1073
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,776
YELLOW: STAFF
GREEN: JIMIN & JUNG KOOK

1074
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:52,910
Here we go.

1075
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,345
STAFF GOES FIRST

1076
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:55,413
Back-Do.

1077
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,481
Is it Back-Do?

1078
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:59,550
NO MOVES WHEN THERE'S
NO TOKEN ON THE BOARD

1079
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,285
What do I need to get again?

1080
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,754
Yut or Mo, right?

1081
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,623
Honestly, anything's fine.
It's just the start.

1082
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,892
UNIQUE POSTURE

1083
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,093
Is it not coming out?

1084
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,595
GETS YUT ON THE FIRST TRY

1085
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,662
Yut.

1086
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:15,967
FALLS INTO HIS OWN TRAP

1087
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,103
-You get another throw.
-Do, Gae.

1088
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,972
If you get Geol, that'd be funny.

1089
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,442
REFOCUS

1090
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,077
What if I get another Yut now?

1091
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,478
That'd be perfect.

1092
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,447
Do.

1093
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:31,449
That's Gae in the end.

1094
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:32,750
PRODUCTION TEAM

1095
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,085
-Do.
-Do.

1096
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,953
YUT GOD'S FIRST TRY

1097
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,121
We should catch it.

1098
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,289
We should catch it.

1099
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,058
GETS MO, SO 1 EXTRA THROW

1100
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,192
Do, Gae, Geol, Yut, Mo.

1101
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,527
-Just throw again...
-Okay.

1102
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,795
You can't place the token.

1103
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,029
-No, no.
-You already did.

1104
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,097
It's already placed.

1105
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,499
IS NO ONE ON OUR SIDE?

1106
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,600
Aside from that...

1107
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,569
Wow, did you see that?

1108
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,938
So strict.

1109
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,640
We weren't supposed to place it.

1110
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,576
If I get Do again, I could catch
and start from there.

1111
00:42:58,643 --> 00:42:59,677
Really?

1112
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,345
-Gae.
-Gae.

1113
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,580
Move forward?

1114
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,048
Go forward and throw again.

1115
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,451
Caught it. One more throw.

1116
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,685
Extra for catching?

1117
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,953
-Extra throw.
-Good.

1118
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,688
I told you I'm the Yut God.

1119
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,023
-Geol.
-Geol.

1120
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,192
Go this way...

1121
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,361
Piggyback? No, no.

1122
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,730
Hold on. Do, Gae, Geol.

1123
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,567
-[Jimin] This is iffy. Very iffy.
-No, but...

1124
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,036
Just leave it. Go back and...

1125
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,737
-Go? Okay.
-Yeah.

1126
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,974
This setup is hilarious.

1127
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,778
-Mo.
-Whoa, this is...

1128
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,314
-I figured it out now.
-Roll it, and...

1129
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,182
-So sneaky.
-[Jung Kook] Wow.

1130
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,219
PRODUCTION TEAM: 2 MO

1131
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,588
-I just threw it.
-Yeah, I saw it.

1132
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,656
WHAT THE HECK?

1133
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,526
2 MO, THEN DO

1134
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:49,594
Caught it.

1135
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,329
[Jung Kook] Wait. Did you piggyback?

1136
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,764
DISPIRITED

1137
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,066
Gotta roll fast.

1138
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,435
Mo.

1139
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,904
-One more time?
-We caught it.

1140
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,172
No, don't move it.

1141
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,673
Just roll fast.

1142
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,610
-Maybe not?
-Gae.

1143
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,811
PROCEED THIS WAY

1144
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,513
-[Jung Kook] Catch it.
-Catch it.

1145
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,981
-Gae.
-There you go.

1146
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,184
-That's good. This one's tricky.
-Good.

1147
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,719
No way he catches that.

1148
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,287
-Mo.
-Mo.

1149
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:18,022
-They throw Mo a lot.
-I know.

1150
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,157
What the heck?

1151
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,159
[producer] Geol.

1152
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:22,994
The new one.

1153
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,562
-Jung Kook.
-So many to catch.

1154
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:26,364
That one's in a trap.

1155
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:28,533
YUT

1156
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,767
DO

1157
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:30,868
-Do.
-Catch with Do.

1158
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:31,936
Catch it with Do.

1159
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,070
-One more.
-Yeah.

1160
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,639
-One more.
-Yut works too.

1161
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,307
-[Jimin] Catch with Yut?
-Do, Gae...

1162
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,375
Yeah, catch it.

1163
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,476
-And...
-And...

1164
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,846
-If we get a bad cast, go with a new one.
-Okay.

1165
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,048
-Gae?
-Gae.

1166
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,383
Maybe this one... Huh?

1167
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,884
-Piggyback?
-Yeah.

1168
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:47,952
Trust me.

1169
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,053
Yeah? Okay.

1170
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,689
I'm Yut God The Best of Me.

1171
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,694
GAME HEATS UP WITH YUT GOD

1172
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,030
ONLY 1 SPACE BETWEEN US

1173
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,832
YUT GOD IN DANGER

1174
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,701
-Mo.
-Mo.

1175
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,671
Do-Gae-Geol-Yut-Mo lands there.

1176
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:07,772
Mo can catch it.

1177
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:08,839
2 MO.

1178
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,107
Should we catch it?

1179
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,909
Hold on. Two Mo.

1180
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:13,844
2 MO, GEOL

1181
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,112
[Jung Kook] Mo, Mo, Geol?

1182
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,447
CAUGHT WITH 2 MO

1183
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,549
-Two Mo.
-Two Mo, then Geol.

1184
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,418
Do-Gae-Geol, then out.

1185
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,586
-[Jimin] This one.
-Yeah.

1186
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,487
-Do-Gae-Geol. Good.
-Yes.

1187
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,158
PRODUCTION TEAM LANDS ON DO

1188
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,260
That doesn't matter for this one.

1189
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,196
Back-Do.

1190
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,165
Back-Do.

1191
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:39,737
ALL MOVES LEAD TO THE TRAPS

1192
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,772
-[crew laughing]
-This is better?

1193
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,474
This is better.

1194
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,009
-[Jung Kook] Catch it.
-Catch it.

1195
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,978
-[Jimin] One more, one more.
-One more.

1196
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,113
Do-Gae-Geol. Just need a Yut.

1197
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,948
You're making it fun.

1198
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,283
-Mo.
-Mo.

1199
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,517
Told you, no catch.

1200
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,752
[Jung Kook] Mo, Do.

1201
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,622
-Let's move this here.
-Is that better?

1202
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,627
NOT GOING WELL FOR PRODUCTION TEAM

1203
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,795
-What now?
-Keep it simple.

1204
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,431
As long as it's not Back-Do.

1205
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,766
That'd make things wild.

1206
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,701
Yeah, unless it's Back-Do.

1207
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,236
A RAIN CHECK ON DOPAMINE

1208
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:13,337
-Safe here.
-Yeah.

1209
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,805
-This one?
-Yeah.

1210
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,974
-Let's escape.
-Yeah, let's run away.

1211
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,744
EACH SIDE TAKES A TURN

1212
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,245
BUT THERE'S NO TWIST

1213
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:24,415
This might end fast... No, no.

1214
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:25,516
MO

1215
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,684
Would've been caught.

1216
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:27,752
You're right.

1217
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,721
IF PRODUCTION TEAM ROLLS GAE,
THEY WILL CATCH THEM

1218
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,326
BET THEY WON'T

1219
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,795
-Geol and?
-You're chasing us?

1220
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:38,929
[exclaims]

1221
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,398
We just need to escape.

1222
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,999
Do-Gae-Geol-Yut-Mo.

1223
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,402
-[Jung Kook] Oh? It's okay.
-Run.

1224
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:48,172
SO EXCITED

1225
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,307
RUNNING FASTER

1226
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,176
Do-Gae-Geol-Yut, then Do.

1227
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:57,415
BOTH TEAMS GOING FORWARD FAST

1228
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,517
They're right behind us.

1229
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,485
Let's go, let's go.

1230
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,889
CASTS GAE

1231
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,023
If it's Gae...

1232
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,792
-Let's move this one out.
-Yeah.

1233
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,360
TWO ESCAPE UNDER YUT GOD'S LEAD

1234
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:12,963
JIMIN & JUNG KOOK 2-0 PRODUCTION TEAM

1235
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,399
Just don't cast Do.

1236
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,034
-It's...
-She's got good luck.

1237
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,202
Really good stats.

1238
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,371
Accidentally cast Mo, please.

1239
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,472
Mo.

1240
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,908
DO

1241
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,476
Oh, no...

1242
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,412
GOTCHA

1243
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,582
HOPE TURNS INTO DESPAIR

1244
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,017
YOU'RE THAT HAPPY?

1245
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,219
They're so happy.

1246
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,287
Hold up.

1247
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,590
Good thing
we brought that one home earlier.

1248
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,559
COMFORT THAT DOESN'T REACH

1249
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,660
I...

1250
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,362
EXTRA CAST
PRODUCTION GETS GAE

1251
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,429
[Jimin] Want a Do?

1252
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,831
Yeah, go for Do.

1253
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:47,932
YUT GOD GETS DO

1254
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,034
Catch it, one more cast.
No, just leave it?

1255
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,135
Catch it, right?

1256
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,937
-Hold on.
-You must decide.

1257
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,004
You're right.

1258
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,440
-You can only go again if you catch.
-Back-Do?

1259
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:58,943
BACK-DO FLEW BY A SECOND AGO

1260
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,512
It was Back-Do. Catch and Back-Do.

1261
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,248
-No, no, no.
-Let go, let go.

1262
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:05,583
WON'T LET GO

1263
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:06,717
It was Back-Do.

1264
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,753
-It was Back-Do just now...
-That's it.

1265
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,488
Then that's a win.

1266
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,822
Wait, if it's Geol...

1267
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,558
GEOL = OUT

1268
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,694
Do-Gae-Geol? Darn it.

1269
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,662
FINALLY REALIZING IT

1270
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,065
FATE LEAVES THEIR HANDS

1271
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:25,703
PLEASE, ANYTHING BUT GEOL

1272
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,105
NOT GEOL, IT'S MO

1273
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:30,241
-One more throw.
-One more.

1274
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:33,110
-If it's Geol, we're done.
-So serious.

1275
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:34,578
Geol cannot happen.

1276
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,714
BACK-DO

1277
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,750
JIMIN & JUNG KOOK 2-2 PRODUCTION TEAM

1278
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,886
-We bring this home, and we win.
-Yeah.

1279
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,821
No way we'll get that.

1280
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:46,123
-Yut.
-Yut. One more.

1281
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:47,892
GAE

1282
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,694
DEEP IN THOUGHT

1283
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,466
Let's move with Yut, and then here.
Use Gae for this, then cast Back-Do.

1284
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,034
Go for Back-Do.

1285
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,569
You want Back-Do from me?

1286
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,670
-Yes.
-Let's do this.

1287
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,806
Out, then Back-Do.

1288
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,007
Then this goes...

1289
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,208
-Yeah.
-This goes out.

1290
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,876
JIMIN & JUNG KOOK 3-2 CREW

1291
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,178
Only one token left.

1292
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,446
Back-Do time.

1293
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:11,248
NO CHANCE

1294
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,051
CAUGHT IMMEDIATELY

1295
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,954
LAUGHTER DISAPPEARS

1296
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,924
GAE

1297
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,125
Want Geol?

1298
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,562
[sighs]

1299
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:25,830
QUIETLY PLACING DO

1300
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,731
Do gets caught easily.

1301
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,702
TRAP TRIGGERED WITH YUT

1302
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:33,304
Caught.

1303
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,906
Ugh!

1304
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,376
But we're the ones who set the trap.

1305
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,779
Exactly. Just regretting it.

1306
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,481
MO

1307
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,549
All right. His luck's back.

1308
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,518
We need to keep it in mind now.

1309
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:48,986
We can get lucky too.

1310
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,890
PRODUCTION'S YUT CAST ROUTINE

1311
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:55,493
I guess hitting the ground helps?

1312
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,096
PRODUCTION TEAM SPEEDING AT 200KM/H

1313
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,065
Oh, this is bad.

1314
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,901
As long as it's not Back-Do.

1315
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:05,436
Wait, Back-Do...

1316
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,704
Let me see first.

1317
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,405
-It's on the left.
-On the left.

1318
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,107
I'll do some calculations.

1319
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,709
CALCULATED HAND MOVEMENTS

1320
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,544
SNEAKY MODE FOR BACK-DO

1321
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,613
HOW FAR UP ARE YOU PLACING IT?

1322
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,847
What?

1323
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:18,582
I'll still cast them properly.

1324
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,620
Back-Do.

1325
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,622
IT'S BACK-DO ALRIGHT!

1326
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,757
Back-Do.

1327
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:28,926
JOY EXPRESSED WITH THE WHOLE BODY

1328
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:31,462
JOY EXPRESSED WITH THE HANDS

1329
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,163
PURE DELIGHT

1330
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,399
YOU DID SO GOOD. SO GOOD.

1331
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:36,667
You gotta admit it.

1332
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:37,768
Did you shout "Go"?

1333
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:39,236
Come on.

1334
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,107
A LEGENDARY PLAY

1335
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,775
-Legendary.
-Truly legendary.

1336
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,544
How are you going to catch ours?

1337
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,445
How?

1338
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,747
MAXIMUM LEVEL OF SMUG

1339
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,416
How are you going to catch ours?

1340
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,585
As long as it's not Mo or Yut.

1341
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,487
[producer] We need Mo and Geol.

1342
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,589
Please no Yut or Mo.

1343
00:50:58,656 --> 00:50:59,657
Mo, Geol.

1344
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,759
Mo, Geol.

1345
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:02,826
GEOL

1346
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:04,862
Geol.

1347
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:06,630
It's over.

1348
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,198
What do you want now?

1349
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,900
What? Back-Do?

1350
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,135
No Back-Do, okay?

1351
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,105
WILL YUT GOD DODGE BACK-DO?

1352
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,640
ENDS WITH GAE

1353
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,310
JIMIN & JUNG KOOK WIN

1354
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,511
[exclaims]

1355
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:24,381
-I was awesome. I got a Back-Do.
-[Jimin] But seriously.

1356
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,985
What hurts is, out of all shoots
with the director, this is the worst

1357
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:29,887
expression he's ever made.

1358
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,190
THE COLOR OF PD'S FACE
IS THE SAME AS HIS SHIRT

1359
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,292
I can't believe I got a Back-Do there.

1360
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,463
[producer] Anyway, we'll give you
100 francs as we promised.

1361
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,631
[all cheering]

1362
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:41,966
Thank you.

1363
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,801
-Great.
-Great.

1364
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,169
-[producer] Great job.
-Yeah.

1365
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,505
[producer] Now, for your wake-up time.

1366
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,741
INSTANTLY FROZEN JOY

1367
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,042
From 7:00 a.m.

1368
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,478
-We get more sleep time?
-That depends on your cast.

+120 MIN -30 MIN

1370
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,684
-Let's hope for a Yut.
-We're rooting for you for this.

1371
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,653
-Same here.
-Me too.

1372
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,088
We need Yut.

1373
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,990
[Jimin] But Yut is hard to get.

1374
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,891
Do you trust my hands?

1375
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,494
I get very unlucky at times like this.

1376
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,629
Yut?

1377
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,065
Since it's from 7 a.m.,
even a Geol can make it 8:30.

1378
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,334
How should I throw it for good luck?

1379
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,504
Yut is good, right?

1380
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,672
Just not Mo, please.

1381
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,442
EVERYONE'S WAKE-UP TIME
IS IN JUNG KOOK'S HANDS

1382
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,510
Here we go.

1383
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,246
GATHERING COSMIC ENERGY

1384
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,787
GAE

1385
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,223
-[producer] That means...
-[Jimin] 8:00, then.

1386
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,758
-Who'll do it?
-Huh?

1387
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,892
That was practice?

1388
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:42,993
Yes, who's going?

1389
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,128
-You should go.
-Why?

1390
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,496
Say "Go" and throw.

1391
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,563
-Oh, say "Go"?
-Yeah.

1392
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,465
-[producer] You didn't say it.
-Practice.

1393
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,833
[producer] This is practice.

1394
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,936
-Nagging us to wake up at 8:00.
-Exactly.

1395
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,171
The Yut God says so.

1396
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,240
IF 8:00 IS TOO LATE, WAKE UP AT 7:30

1397
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,941
Wait, let me try once.

1398
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,310
DO, GAE

1399
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,412
DO

1400
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,479
This is it.

1401
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,481
CLUELESS DO

1402
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,150
You need to just go for it.

1403
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,485
-No way we'd get Back-Do, right?
-Go?

1404
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,654
-Yes, I should.
-One, two, three.

1405
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:11,722
-Go.
-Go.

1406
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,856
Here we go.

1407
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,692
[♪ intense music playing]

1408
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,627

YUT GOD

1410
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,799
PLEASE

1411
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,735
SEND US A "YUT"

1412
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,539
IT'S GAE ANYWAY

1413
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,240
[groans]

1414
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,242
-It was meant to be 8:00.
-8:00 it is.

1415
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,245
We kept casting Gae.
I got chills seeing this Back-Do stick.

1416
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,082
I was seriously shocked.

1417
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,850
-So, 8:00?
-8:00.

1418
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:43,153
-It's not bad, eight o'clock.
-Yeah, early's good for you.

1419
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,755
At least we earned 100 francs.

1420
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:45,823
-Yeah.
-Yup.

1421
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,924
That was wild.

1422
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,058
[producer] You're good.

1423
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:49,293
Kind of impressive.

1424
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,562
YUT GOD FINALLY SHOWED HIS POWER

1425
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,697
-[producer] Let's keep it here
-Okay.

1426
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:54,798
and play again later.

1427
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,166

-[Jung Kook] 8:00 a.m., right?
-[Jimin] Yeah.

1431
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:07,511
[Jung Kook] That Back-Do earlier was wild.

1432
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,680
How did that even happen?

1433
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,683
-[Jimin chuckles]
-If not for that, we wouldn't have won.

1434
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,952
[Jimin] We both cast it once, right?

1435
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,887
[Jung Kook] Yeah, it was perfect.

1436
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,891

-I saw it.
-You did?

1438
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:25,963
-[Jung Kook] Namjoon's kind of...
-Sentimental.

1439
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,831
[Jung Kook] He's a really warm person.

1440
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:33,003
FYI: THE VIDEO NAMJOON SENT WAS
AN ANIMATION REMINISCING MILITARY LIFE

1441
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,706
-[Jimin] He enlisted alone, you know.
-Right.

1442
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,508
But for me,

1443
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:41,678
when I think of the military days,
I think of you and me together.

1444
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:46,483
But for him,
it's probably his squad mates.

1445
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,419
-[Jung Kook] Makes sense.
-Yeah.

1446
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:53,257
-He had fellow soldiers beside him.
-Right.

1447
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,392
-But for us, we had each other.
-Yes.

1448
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,461
That must be a big difference.

1449
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,565
I think he really misses his army buddies.

1450
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,001
[Jung Kook] It suddenly hit me.

1451
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,237
I'm so happy
I don't have to return to base.

1452
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,007
[Jimin] I actually
thought the same yesterday.

1453
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:13,744
Not having to give back this phone?
It felt incredible last night.

1454
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:17,614
So I forced myself to stay awake
just to keep using it.

1455
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,818
-[Jung Kook] Our soldier DNA fully active.
-Right.

1456
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:24,154
[Jimin] I even sleep with it
under my pillow.

1457
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,289
[laughing]

1458
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,291
So I won't lose it.

1459
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:32,696
It feels so good,
it makes me not want to go to sleep.

1460
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:36,033
[Jung Kook] I just want to record soon.

1461
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,101
[Jimin] Yeah, I want to try recording too.

1462
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,938
AFTER A SOFT, SENTIMENTAL NIGHT

1463
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,174
MORNING LIGHT WARMS
THE RED ROOFTOPS IN SWITZERLAND

1464
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:48,478
AMONG THOSE STARTING A PEACEFUL DAY

1465
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,348
THIS PLACE AWAITS
A PERFECTLY SCHEDULED LIFE

1466
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,517
CURRENT TIME
08:00 A.M.

1467
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,018
[producer] Sergeant Park Jimin.

1468
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,553
You're gonna get in trouble.

1469
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:02,025
[producer] Now, the one to get
to the couch first

1470
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,329
gets a 1-hour sleep extension.

1471
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,965
It's first come, first served.

1472
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,667
[Jimin] How about neither of us goes?

1473
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,937
I want to sleep another hour.

1474
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,873
Yeah? Then you go and get it.

1475
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,276
JUNG KOOK RESISTS TEMPTATION

1476
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:21,445
EYES WON'T OPEN...

1477
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,550
[producer] Jung Kook, are you up?

1478
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:27,618
Yeah.

1479
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,754
All right. It's the Capital Quiz.

1480
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,290
-It's the Capital Quiz.
-Come on.

1481
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:35,826
I don't know any capitals.

1482
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,028
The capital of the US?

1483
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,529
Washington DC.

1484
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,198
Correct. Go back to sleep.

1485
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:43,467
What? That's it? Nice.

1486
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,669
[producer] Jimin,
let's head to the cafeteria.

1487
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,104
Okay.

1488
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,606
AUTOMATICALLY, JIMIN HAS TO HAVE BREAKFAST

1489
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:51,475
[producer] Want to try too, Jimin?

1490
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,910
-Capitals?
-Yes.

1491
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:56,146
I better study for this too.

1492
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:58,782
BUT LET'S SLEEP FIRST

1493
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,417
What is it?

1494
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,353
Here we go. The capital of Switzerland?

1495
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,656
-The capital of Switzerland?
-Bern?

1496
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,357
Oh, correct.

1497
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,458
Belgium?

1498
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,559
WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA

1499
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,694
What? Where?

1500
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,729
-Bern.
-Bern?

1501
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,097
How'd you know?

1502
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:17,467
How could you not know
the capital of Switzerland?

1503
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:21,271
BOTH GET AN EXTRA HOUR OF SLEEP

1504
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:28,478
SEE YOU IN AN HOUR

1505
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:40,657
Jung Kook.

1506
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:41,825
CURRENT TIME
09:00 A.M.

1507
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,060
What?

1508
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,162
What is it?

1509
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,905
THEY LEAVE FOR ANOTHER PLACE TODAY

1510
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,544
[humming softly]

1511
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:08,418
PACKING UP FAST

1512
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:16,927
[Jung Kook] Let's go.

1513
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,096
[Jimin] Time to leave.

1514
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,698
FURKA PASS RIDING
TAKING A TRAIN (TO ZERMATT)

1515
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,834
NEW LODGING
DINNER

1516
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,338
Oh, my.

1517
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,107
[Jimin] Can you sit on it?

1518
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,174
IT'S BIKE DAY

1519
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,544
[♪ upbeat music playing]

1520
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,784
It sure looks cool.

1521
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,054
[engine starts]

1522
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:47,190
GEAR ON AND READY

1523
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,726
JIMIN TRAVELS BY CAR

1524
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,528
Total potato head look.

1525
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:56,233
IT'S ME, JUNG KOOK

1526
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:08,412
[Jung Kook] Off we go.

1527
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:19,189
JIMIN SETS OFF TOO

1528
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,165
I'm starting to get used to the bike now.

1529
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,399
Yeah.

1530
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,567
Loving this.

1531
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,475
A GLANCE AT SIDE MIRROR

1532
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:44,214
TO. JIMIN

1533
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:46,817
[Jimin] That's the vibe.

1534
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:53,790
Bikers coming from the opposite lane
would think Jung Kook looks cool too.

1535
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:56,927
With such a bike and outfit,

1536
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,029
I bet he looks awesome.

1537
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:03,200
I'm driving a car and riding a bike for
the first time here since my discharge.

1538
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,969
I feel insanely good.

1539
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,537
-[Jimin] Insanely?
-Yup.

1540
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,910
Whoa, that was cool.

1541
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:19,783
Whoa! Whoa!

1542
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:24,788
BIKER WAVE RELAY BEGINS

1543
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,656
Whoa!

1544
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,425
FEELING AMAZING

1545
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:29,960
[laughs heartily]

1546
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,928
Is that the joy of it?

1547
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:35,899
I feel so happy.
And I love there are more riders here.

1548
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,368
I want to ride with a group too.

1549
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:39,469
Not alone, huh?

1550
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,638
[Jung Kook over speaker]
Jimin, get a license.

1551
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:43,140
No, I'm good.

1552
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,243
I don't really want to.
I prefer driving cars.

1553
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,311
I'm telling you, it's fun.

1554
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:49,913
Nope.

1555
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:54,050
But the waving part was pretty cool.

1556
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,554
OBVIOUSLY SMILING

1557
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,656
[in English] Oh, yeah.

1558
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,526
[in Korean] Wow.

1559
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,427
This is crazy.

1560
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,962
It feels like a fairytale.

1561
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,466
Meadows and buildings together.

1562
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:11,101
Wow.

1563
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,803
I can't stop looking.

1564
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,873
Jung Kook.

1565
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,678
I know I should focus on driving,
but this view's unreal.

1566
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:26,283
[Jung Kook] This is so beautiful.

1567
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,152
Whoa, what is that?

1568
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:33,390
SPOTS COWS GRAZING PEACEFULLY

1569
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,425
Wow.

1570
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:37,827
ENDLESS AWE

1571
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:38,895
What is that?

1572
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,364
Wow.

1573
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,700
Snowy mountains over there.

1574
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:48,772
MAJESTIC, GLACIER-CAPPED PEAKS

1575
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,041
What's with that water color?

1576
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,945
It kind of looks gray.

1577
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,313
-[Jimin] Like blue...
-Right?

1578
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,450
[Jimin] It looks like blue
mixed with a bit of gray. It's so...

1579
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,018
Did they add something to it?

1580
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,087
[Jimin laughs] Why is it so pretty?

1581
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,325
Oh...

1582
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,595
This makes driving feel worth it.

1583
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,996
It's not boring at all.

1584
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,633
ZERO BOREDOM ALLOWED HERE

1585
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,603
Every corner makes you go wow.

1586
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:24,841
DIFFERENT SCENERY ON EVERY SIDE

1587
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,850
It's not dramatic or crazy,

1588
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,685
but it keeps impressing you.

1589
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:38,521
That's the charm here.

1590
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,624
A whole new kind of joy.

1591
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:45,195
You know, earning and saving up money

1592
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,964
and going on a trip,

1593
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,867
I think it's a big part of life.

1594
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:55,472
Of course, we're not living our life
only for this,

1595
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,441
but trips like this make me think
for a moment,

1596
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,244
"Oh, this is why I live."

1597
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,546
Yeah.

1598
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:07,150
It'd be nice
if he and I can share this feeling.

1599
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:10,887
If not,
I just hope he gets to feel this too.

1600
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,089
That's how I feel.

1601
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:22,799
And so it begins.

1602
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,436
SPOTS A TWISTY ROAD AHEAD ON GPS

1603
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,939

about the taste first though.

-My bad.
-[Jung Kook] It's wagyu.

-[Jimin] Wagyu is black cow? I see.
-It's wagyu.

1646
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:49,212
I shouldn't think about
how they'd taste first. I'm terrible.

1647

I should've been like, "Wow, cows."
But I thought what they'd taste like.

-Yeah.

01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:16,972
[in English] Thank you.

1966
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,708
ARRIVES AT A PLACE FOR DINNER

1967
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,010
-[in Korean] You ate a lot? Oh, the tacos?
-Yes.

1968
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:25,681
It's fine. Once the food comes,
you'll eat just like yesterday.

1969
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:28,217
Whoa, look at that. It's so fancy.

1970
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,352
Whoa, what is this place?

1971
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:31,420
OLD-WORLD CHARM

1972
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,155
-Look at those stairs.
-[Jimin] Hey.

1973
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,557
-What?
-Just gonna walk down like it's nothing?

1974
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,993
-Just filming.
-It's a nobleman's entrance.

1975
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,363
-How does a nobleman enter?
-The camera's rolling. Just walk in.

1976
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,432
Oh, you weren't filming there?

1977
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:46,402
STRIKING A POSE AS HE WALKS IN

1978
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:48,837
Why go in like that? Just walk normally.

1979
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,773
PREFERS THE SIMPLE ROUTE

1980
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:54,510
I made it.

1981
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,046
-I was seriously...
-Thank you.

1982
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:00,115
In a royal robe and all...

1983
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:02,718
With a fake beard on... Oh, thank you.

1984
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:04,586
GETS THE MENU RIGHT AWAY

1985
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,390
[Jimin] What is this again?

1986
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,793
Help me, translation apps.

1987
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:15,998
USING A TRANSLATOR APP

1988
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,168
I need to lose weight.

1989
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:20,302
NOT GOING WELL

1990
01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:25,307
I'm too shy to talk to them.

1991
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,443
I can. What do you want to ask?

1992
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:30,979
Ask for their most popular dish.

1993
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:32,714
[in English] Excuse me.

1994
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:34,483

1998
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,657
-All grilled?
-Yeah.

1999
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,426
-This is Chateaubriand.
-Chateaubriand?

2000
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,497
-Tomahawk is for two people.
-[both exclaim]

2001
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:50,098

2002
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:52,100
-For the two of us?
-[in Korean] Yeah.

2003
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,268
Tomahawk?

2004
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:54,570
[in Korean] Let's share it.

2005
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,038
Honestly, I can't eat much.

2006
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,105
[in English] Lamb.

2007
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,307
1 TOMAHAWK, 1 LAMB

2008
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,708

-Yeah.

2009
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:05,113

-Really?
-Yeah, really.

2016
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,026
Seriously.

2017
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:22,998
[in Korean] It's good.

2018
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:24,466
[in English] Amazing.

2019

2020
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:28,971
Oh, thank you.

2022
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,108
-Thank you so much.
-You're impressed, no?

2023
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:36,211
[in Korean] And there you go,
charming someone again.

2024
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:39,381
[producer] They say "Santé"
for cheers here.

2025
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,316
"SANTÉ" MEANS "HEALTH" IN FRENCH

2026
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,151
USED IN CASUAL CONVOS OR AT MEALS

2027
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,920
MAKE EYE CONTACT WHEN YOU CLINK

2028
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:46,555
-Just...
-[producer] Eye contact is

2029
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:50,292
to see if the other person's
deceiving you.

2030
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,060
Oh, I'll close my eyes.

2031
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,630
I totally trust you.

2032
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,331
"Santé" with my eyes closed.

2033
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,135
[in Korean] But we can't see our glasses.

2034
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,203
Okay, cheers.

2035
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:03,405
That worked.

2036
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:06,208
FINALLY NAILED THE SANTÉ!

2037
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:11,213
That was pure trust in a "Santé."

2038
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,849
[producer] I'm 27 now.

2039
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,083
Santé.

2040
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,419
Santé, director.

2041
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:18,754
Eyes closed.

2042
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,532
MAIN DISHES ARE HERE

2043
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,501
-It's okay?
-[Jimin in English] Yeah.

2044
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,042
[Jung Kook exclaims]

2045
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:43,779
TOMAHAWK & LAMB

2046
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,248
[in Korean] I'll start
slicing the Tomahawk.

2047
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:47,549
This isn't the Tomahawk?

2048
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:48,617
That's the lamb.

2049
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:50,485
The sauce...

2050
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:53,488
FOODIE ALWAYS HAS A PLAN

2051
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:58,360
Mmm!

2052
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,028
Let me try lamb.

2053
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,598
TAKES A BIG BITE

2054
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:06,068
SO GOOD

2055
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,636
How should I show this?

2056
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,204
Jung Kook taught me.

2057
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:12,107
TRYING JUNG KOOK'S RECIPE

2058
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:24,219
THE BURRITO'S LONG FORGOTTEN

2059
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,921
Jung Kook, can I eat this?

2060
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:27,823
-Yes.
-Thanks.

2061
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,258
EVERY BITE FEELS LIKE THE FIRST

2062
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:32,094
You...

2063
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,163
You look full but still eat so well.

2064
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,635
I don't know why it keeps going in.

2065
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,770
You ate about the same as I did.

2066
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:43,639
Can I have one bite?

2067
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:44,706
MIGHT AS WELL...

2068
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:46,742
Looks so good, right?

2069
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,343
I'll give you.

2070
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:51,113
Doesn't it look good?
I'll give you a little.

2071
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,549
It's greasy, but since they put wine
in it, so it's delicious.

2072
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:01,590
This is so good.

2073
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,092
Jimin really enjoyed that.

2074
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,161
I'm going to burst.

2075
01:26:06,228 --> 01:26:07,596
DAY 1 IN ZERMATT: COMPLETE

2076
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,098
-Ready to fly?
-[in English] Yeah, I am ready.

2077
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,967
SO NOT READY

2078
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:16,371
SHOWING HOW EXCITED HE IS
WITH HIS WHOLE BODY

2079
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:18,306
FEARLESS YOUNGEST

2080
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,642
Scaredy-cat(?) JIMIN

2081
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:22,310
I'm a bit nervous.

2082
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:27,849
JIMIN'S SKY-HIGH SURVIVAL STORY
IS REVEALED NEXT WEEK!

2083
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,252
ARE YOU SURE?!
