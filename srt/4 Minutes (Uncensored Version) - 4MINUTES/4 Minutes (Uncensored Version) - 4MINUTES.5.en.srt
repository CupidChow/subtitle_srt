5
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,800
Can I get you another drink?

6
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,199
Yes please.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,479
But let me use the bathroom first.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,439
Okay.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,880
I'll be right back.

10
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,264
You picked a good spot.

11
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,001
Yeah right?

12
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,769
And for choosing a random spot.

13
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:13,691
Looks beautiful.

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,680
I wanna stay here forever.

15
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,240
But we probably can't.

16
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,479
Then let's stay here.

17
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
Right here together for now.

18
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,639
If we happen to meet

19
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,239
Again.

20
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,959
My heart

21
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Will still give it

22
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
To you,

23
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,840
For you.

24
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,680
I'll remember this day.

25
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,679
Those memories.

26
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Forever.

27
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,879
To meet in the land of twilight's veil.

28
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,479
In a world where time stands still.

29
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,279
Hold onto those words.

30
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,279
Reveal in our heart.

31
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
So beautiful.

32
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
Thank you.

33
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,758
If my parents didn't pass away.

34
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,639
I'd probably be a musician somewhere.

35
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,600
I might be playing right now.

36
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,920
I don't know why I wanted to be a doctor.

37
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,198
Besides not being rich,

38
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,680
I'm also not happy.

39
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,479
I want to know why you're so sure -

40
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,319
and believe it was my parents doing.

41
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,360
To the point of having to revenge.

42
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,079
My mom had a diary.

43
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,439
My parents invested their money with Sriwatsombat.

44
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,119
(Dairy: I shouldn't have trusted the Sriwatsombat family.)

45
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,680
Unaware it was for their gambling operations.

46
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,560
Once they got my parents' money.

47
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,160
Your dad sent people to harass my parents.

48
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,079
In the end, my parents were shot killed.

49
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,198
I can't believe my parents would do that.

50
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,800
It's because no one believes it.

51
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,759
I have to find the evidence myself.

52
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,319
Also...

53
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,839
what's your relationship with Nan?

54
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,519
I met Nan at the hospital.

55
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,680
What brings you in today?

56
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,519
Stomach ache.

57
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,120
How many days?

58
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,000
This morning.

59
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,600
It's probably appendicitis.

60
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,160
Who are you?

61
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,639
You can diagnose instead of a doctor?

62
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,519
Whoa, hey.

63
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
Why are you running your mouth like that?

64
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,120
Sriwat Cargo.

65
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,920
Hey, Bee?

66
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,319
Come here please.

67
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, Dr. Tyme?

68
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,680
Can you ask the family member to step outside?

69
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
I'm going to perform an internal exam.

70
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,838
Please go wait up front.

71
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,439
There's plenty of seats.

72
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,000
Let the doctor and myself work.

73
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
Please step outside.

74
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,679
Please wait up front.

75
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,319
Step outside, thank you.

76
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Right now, thank you.

77
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
Could you please lift your shirt?

78
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,759
Sorry.

79
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,960
Feeling any pain?

80
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,320
Any vaginal bleeding?

81
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,320
Don't be afraid.

82
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,759
You can talk to me.

83
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,639
Yes.

84
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,720
Are you going to perform an internal exam?

85
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,879
No.

86
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360
I needed a reason to get that man out of here.

87
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
I'd like to submit for a UPT.

88
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,360
And get the ultrasound machine for me please.

89
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,840
Yes, doctor.

90
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,320
What did those people do to you? You can tell me.

91
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,919
What?

92
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,440
I saw his shirt.

93
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
If you don't want to stay there anymore,

94
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,480
you can contact me.

95
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,559
I checked on Nan because maybe she had appendicitis.

96
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,600
But actually, Nan had an ectopic pregnancy.

97
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,039
Mon.

98
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,799
Nan.

99
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,119
Why are you out of the hospital already?

100
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,519
Didn't you just have surgery?

101
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,879
The doctor said I'm all better now.

102
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,200
So Sa-Marn rushed the doctor so I could leave earlier.

103
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,159
Oh.

104
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,719
He should have let you stay another day or two.

105
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,480
How can you work like this?

106
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,080
It's fine. I can manage.

107
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

108
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,399
So you had appendicitis, right?

109
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,320
He got me pregnant, and it was ectopic.

110
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,840
I don't want to be here anymore, Mon.

111
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,879
I feel like I'm in hell.

112
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,799
I shouldn't have brought you to work here.

113
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Don't blame yourself Nan.

114
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,440
If we didn't work,

115
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,679
we wouldn't have any money to send home.

116
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,399
Hey Tor,

117
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,399
have you seen Mon?

118
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I haven't.

119
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,399
Mr. Sa-Marn, where did my friend go?

120
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,519
Wait.

121
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,000
Mon bled to death.

122
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,919
Yes sir.

123
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,159
I'll get rid of the body.

124
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,399
Mon.

125
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Mon.

126
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,720
Mon.

127
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,039
Mon.

128
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,000
Mon!

129
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,518
Mon, who did this to you?!

130
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,240
Hey, out of the way!

131
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,639
Mon!

132
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,200
Out of the way!

133
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,279
Mon!

134
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,320
Talk to me!

135
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,360
What are you going to do now?

136
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm going to use the info from Nan.

137
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,840
And share it all over social media.

138
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,879
And then send it to the media.

139
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,279
Can you not do that?

140
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,759
Then what do you want me to do?

141
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,519
Give me time to think.

142
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
I can give you time.

143
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,840
If you can say to me, very clearly -

144
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
that you'll tell your parents to confess everything.

145
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,519
And take responsibility in prison.

146
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
You see?

147
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,319
You support your parents, after all.

148
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,720
Who the hell can do that?

149
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,600
They're my parents.

150
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,879
If you can't.

151
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,679
Then don't ask me for time.

152
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,398
People who live comfortably off of others' deaths.

153
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,799
How can they understand?

154
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,120
And what if the next death is you?

155
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,638
You've seen what my parents can do.

156
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,679
They can try.

157
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,559
Just try it.

158
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
I don't have anything to lose.

159
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,039
And your grandma?

160
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm worried about you.

161
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,759
And your grandma.

162
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,200
Please.

163
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,799
Give me some time.

164
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Are you sure it was Great?

165
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm sure Mr. Korn.

166
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
Why the hell would Great do that?

167
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,320
We should report this to the chairman.

168
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,799
No, wait.

169
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,039
Let me talk to my brother first.

170
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm sure he has his reasons.

171
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,919
But what Mr. Great did,

172
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,518
could damage our business.

173
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,720
I told you I want to speak to my brother first!

174
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,320
Get out!

175
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,279
Mr. Korn told me not to tell you.

176
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,480
But I think you need to know about this.

177
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,440
Nothing has leaked out yet, right?

178
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm not sure.

179
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,080
Where is that woman right now?

180
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,919
At the hospital.

181
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,360
I still can't see her.

182
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,679
But when she comes out.

183
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,440
I won't let her off the hook.

184
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,039
And the other person that helped Nan out.

185
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,200
Who is it?

186
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,320
I can remember his face.

187
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't think it'll be long.

188
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,360
Until I find out who he is.

189
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,919
Find him quickly.

190
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,480
Yes sir.

191
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,200
Where is Great?

192
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,118
His phone is off. I can't reach him.

193
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,479
Contact him.

194
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,079
And get that son of yours.

195
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,920
Great isn't just my son.

196
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,799
Where are you gonna go?

197
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm going to get stuff from my room.

198
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,599
And find a hotel to stay.

199
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,559
Give me a day or two.

200
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Then I'll talk to my parents at the company.

201
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,200
And you're going alone?

202
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,359
Are you sure that's safe?

203
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,119
That guy had the guts to point a gun at you.

204
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,039
No one would dare kill me.

205
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Don't worry.

206
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,640
In any case, be careful.

207
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,720
You too.

208
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,000
See you later.

209
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,519
Shit Den!

210
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,720
Where the hell have you been?

211
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,319
Won't pick up my calls.

212
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,759
Everyone is looking for you.

213
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,039
I almost filed a report.

214
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,799
I had an urgent matter.

215
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:38,720
What urgent matter?

216
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,839
Do I need to answer your every question?

217
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,839
I saw the person who dropped you off.

218
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,119
Who was it?

219
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,640
New boyfriend?

220
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,119
You're being suspicious.

221
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,440
Will you tell me, or should I investigate myself?

222
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,599
Don't investigate. There's nothing.

223
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,240
Stay out of it.

224
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll find out.

225
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,519
Where are you going?

226
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,759
The hospital.

227
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:05,880
Where are you going?

228
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,558
I forgot where I was going.

229
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,400
See you.

230
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,920
Great.

231
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,119
Get in. We have something to talk about.

232
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,519
Great.

233
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,519
Tell me.

234
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,799
Who's the guy from last night?

235
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
Tell me and I'll take care of it.

236
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,160
I don’t want you getting involved in this.

237
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,480
It's dangerous, you understand?

238
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
Danger from whom?

239
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,519
From you?

240
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,519
Or from mom and dad?

241
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,839
Who gave you information? Why are you like this?

242
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,720
You never mentioned the online gambling department.

243
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,680
Great.

244
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,519
I didn't mean to not tell you.

245
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,839
But it wasn't the right time yet.

246
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,559
Once you finish college and come work, you’ll see.

247
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,279
And do you know who its already harmed?

248
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,599
This business.

249
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
Will help our family survive.

250
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,759
You should stop thinking so much.

251
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,119
If you don't like it Great.

252
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,720
You don't have to do it.

253
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,839
Close your eyes and live your life.

254
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll do it.

255
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
I can't do that.

256
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
Step aside and don't get in my way.

257
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
If you don't stop.

258
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,039
I'm going to tell dad about this.

259
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,960
I can't guarantee what will happen.

260
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,039
You wouldn't hurt me, would you?

261
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,400
Great.

262
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,799
Great.

263
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,240
Great!

264
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,119
This is fitting.

265
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,479
What you said, Pakorn,

266
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,839
about your braised pork with fish sauce,

267
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,920
being the most delicious in all three realms.

268
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,200
How did you get here?

269
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,599
Time sure flies.

270
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,079
The last time I saw you, Tyme.

271
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,039
You were just a little kid.

272
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,119
Come sit down and talk.

273
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,039
You're talented Tyme.

274
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,160
Graduated from medical school.

275
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,920
About to be a surgeon.

276
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,318
But do you know.

277
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,200
That right now, you’re doing something unwise.

278
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,839
How about this.

279
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,680
How much do you want? Give me a number.

280
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,640
I don't want money.

281
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:20,484
5 million.

282
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,359
And stay away from Great.

283
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,559
And also my company.

284
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,480
Take it.

285
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,759
Grandma.

286
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,119
Grandma, I -

287
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,000
Nan, you still have the info I asked you to find?

288
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Yes I do.

289
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,720
I’ve uploaded and backed up everything.

290
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,759
I want you to delete all the files.

291
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,318
From now on, I want you to stay put.

292
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,720
Don't do anything.

293
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,440
Why?

294
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,960
Just do what I say.

295
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,759
But didn’t you promise me you'd take them down?

296
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,359
I have nothing left to lose.

297
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,838
I want to see those people in jail.

298
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,000
That's enough Nan.

299
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,960
Consider it a request from me.

300
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,400
They paid you off, didn't they?

301
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,759
You're fucking selfish.

302
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,039
If you're still in pain,

303
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,000
you can request more pain meds in 4 hours.

304
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,039
Excuse me?

305
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,039
Yes?

306
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,838
I need a small favor.

307
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,799
Yes?

308
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,119
Can I borrow your phone?

309
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,559
My phone has been confiscated.

310
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I'd like to contact my relatives.

311
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,680
Hello.

312
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,559
My name is Nan.

313
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,079
I need to expose a shipping company called -

314
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,319
Sriwat Cargo Service.

315
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,000
I have evidence that this company,

316
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,519
is running an illegal online gambling business.

317
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,039
And I was physically harmed by someone there.

318
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,758
On to our next story.

319
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,598
One facebook user -

320
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,519
has come forward and expose a well-known logistics company.

321
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,479
Claiming they’re operating an illegal online gambling site.

322
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,200
And has provided evidence.

323
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,999
Including a list of workers.

324
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,799
And names of several major clients.

325
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:07,000
Initially, the police have received the report.

326
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,640
And are currently investigating further.

327
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,959
- Is the news report true?
- Excuse me.

328
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,400
What about the allegations of physical assault?

329
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,599
All the allegations are false.

330
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,279
My company is not involved in that kind of business.

331
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,920
Whether it was done without my knowledge.

332
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,119
I'll investigate promptly and update you soon.

333
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,640
Thank you.

334
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,519
I'm sorry.

335
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,480
Because of your sheer negligence.

336
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,559
Everything turned out like this.

337
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,200
All your father's trust just wasted.

338
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,119
Great was the one who helped her out.

339
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,839
And why didn't you stop him?

340
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,119
Let your brother do -

341
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,640
Are you trying to blame me for everything?!

342
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,079
Everyone is wrong.

343
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,119
Except your son!

344
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,359
Korn.

345
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,880
Please excuse me.

346
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
I saw the news.

347
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,880
Are you okay?

348
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,039
I'm not.

349
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,759
Nothing is okay.

350
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm turning into rotten trash.

351
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,480
Everyone is just throwing shit at me.

352
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
Let's calm down. Have a seat.

353
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,519
There's still a way.

354
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,039
My dad can help you.

355
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,200
It might be tough since Dad’s name has leaked as a shareholder.

356
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,319
But I believe with Dad's power,

357
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,799
it will definitely help you get out of this case.

358
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,000
But.

359
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,880
But what?

360
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,759
Are you ready to trade?

361
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,079
What do you mean?

362
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,920
Marry me.

363
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,200
And stop seeing that boy.

364
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,480
The reason I’ve let you have all that fun.

365
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,559
Is because I know.

366
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,640
That you’ll think of me first when something goes wrong.

367
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,599
And that boy is just -

368
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,000
a toy.

369
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,400
Right?

370
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,799
You don't have a choice.

371
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,759
This is what you must trade.

372
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,000
The fuck.

373
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,680
Did my brother block me?

374
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,239
(House for rent.)

375
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,199
I brought the money I've saved my whole life.

376
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,079
Here for you.

377
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,960
Are you sure?

378
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,920
I'm sure.

379
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,400
This one is good.

380
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,559
Someone's probably going to die.

381
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,159
(The 4th card foretells separation.
Parted from your beloved and taken away. )

382
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,919
What did you do to Tyme?

383
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,880
Great, where have you been?

384
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,840
Answer me first, dad.

385
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,319
You answer me first.

386
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,518
Why did you team up with them?

387
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,639
Because I know what you did.

388
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,919
Can you answer me now?

389
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,000
Where is Tyme?

390
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,319
You still don't realize?

391
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
That you are being used.

392
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,679
Being used?

393
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,718
You don't know anything.

394
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,199
Great Great Great.

395
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,960
Come talk to me outside.

396
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,760
If you've killed people.

397
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,519
And ruined their lives.

398
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,879
Then you have to take responsibility!

399
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,519
How do you expect me to take responsibility?

400
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:50,960
What I did,

401
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,679
was for the survival of the company.

402
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,280
So that you can live comfortably.

403
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,360
Why don't you appreciate what I've done?!

404
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,960
Appreciate?

405
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,000
Appreciate your vile actions?!

406
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,719
I will never step foot here again.

407
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,000
Great.

408
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,440
Great.

409
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,280
Great!

410
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,678
Come back and apologize right now!

411
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,920
Are you even my child?!

412
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,400
Great, stop.

413
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:24,920
Great.

414
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,760
Great Great Great.

415
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,440
Great.

416
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,518
Go back and apologize to dad right now.

417
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,000
You just order me around.

418
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,760
You never ask me if I want to.

419
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,239
I'm not ordering.

420
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm just telling you what you should do.

421
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm just telling you what's best for you.

422
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,480
Best for whom?

423
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,719
For you?

424
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,079
For dad?

425
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,480
For the company?

426
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,599
For the family's reputation?

427
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,360
And how about me?

428
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,639
In the end, it's always what's best for you.

429
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,199
Why can't you see it this way?

430
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,840
Just getting angry.

431
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,559
And frustrated.

432
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,840
And distancing yourself from me.

433
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,518
It took me a long time to get to this point.

434
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,239
I had to fight.

435
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,679
If I didn't,

436
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,199
we would have lived in hiding.

437
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
In a tiny house by your dad.

438
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,519
You'll end up being the mistress's child.

439
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,320
I've done all of this.

440
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,159
Why can't you understand me? This is all for you.

441
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,480
I beg you.

442
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,639
Believe me, Great.

443
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,440
Go up and apologize to dad.

444
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,079
Let's go.

445
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:39,960
Come.

446
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,280
Go up and apologize to him.

447
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:44,960
Great.

448
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:45,679
Great.

449
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,000
Great.

450
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:48,880
Great!

451
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,079
No, Great!

452
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,000
Open the door right now Great.

453
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,039
Great!

454
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:53,960
Great!

455
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,920
Great!

456
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:55,920
Great!

457
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
Don't do this.

458
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,000
Don't, Great.

459
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,800
Great.

460
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,310
Come back, Great.

461
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
Great.

462
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,599
Great, come back.

463
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,840
Great.

464
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,800
Great.

465
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,320
Go back and apologize to dad right now.

466
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:46,960
Watch out!

467
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,159
Great!

468
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,239
Great!

469
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,400
Great!

470
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,480
Mom.

471
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,639
Run away.

472
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:05,840
Run away.

473
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,519
No.

474
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,320
No.

475
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,360
I'm not going anywhere.

476
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,000
I love you mom.

477
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,159
The brain is an organ that requires a constant flow of oxygen.

478
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:28,440
This is how long the brain can survive without oxygen.

479
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,719
What happens to our consciousness during this time?

480
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,559
Current research findings conclude that,

481
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,519
in the event of a cardiac arrest,

482
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,719
the brain doesn't stop functioning right away.

483
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,199
During this time,

484
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,159
patients' perceptions vary based on their experiences.

485
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,559
Some relive past experiences.

486
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,440
Some have supernatural powers.

487
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,239
Some go back to fix past mistakes.

488
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,199
Some get a fresh start with those they love.

489
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,199
Patients' experiences feel real
but aren't entirely accurate.

490
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,039
Patients can see memories.

491
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,599
Sounds.

492
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,880
Or feel brief sensations of pain.

493
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,280
Even if it is unrelated to what else is going on.

494
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,279
Seeing 4 minutes into the future.

495
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,320
Might be linked to facts not yet uncovered by this study.

496
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,679
But what is clear.

497
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,119
In the real world.

498
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,760
The brain can survive without oxygen for only 4 minutes.

499
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,119
Bee.

500
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,239
- What?
- What are you eating?

501
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,440
Cantalope, it's good.

502
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:06,999
- Want some?
- C'mon share, is it sweet?

503
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,238
Very sweet.

504
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:08,880
Want some?

505
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Can I have the rest?

506
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:10,800
Um, of course.

507
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:12,360
- Can I eat the rest for you?
- Sure, buy me a new one tomorrow.

508
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,079
Ten boxes.

509
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,198
I'll buy all of them.

510
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,360
I just ate one piece.

511
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:16,320
I'll get ten boxes back.

512
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,840
Out of the way please.

513
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:20,280
Hey.

514
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,400
Oh.

515
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:22,920
That's that guy.

516
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:25,719
Grandma.

517
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,000
Lift your foot a bit.

518
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,039
All done.

519
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,119
We can't go home, can we?

520
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,119
Not yet, Grandma.

521
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
It's dangerous.

522
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,679
Stay at Aunt Ging's place for now.

523
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,760
Until everything is safe.

524
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,159
When will it be safe?

525
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:55,880
Tyme.

526
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,679
What exactly are you doing?

527
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,039
One sec, Grandma.

528
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:27,639
Hello?

529
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,000
(You son of a bitch.)

530
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,239
(Finally picking up.)

531
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,039
What is it?

532
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,919
(The guy who came to find you that day.)

533
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,480
(Did you know he was wheeled into the OR?)

534
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,000
(Looks like trauma too.)

535
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,558
(I saw blood everywhere.)

536
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,198
(Hey Tyme, I'm going to check on him real quick)

537
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,320
What did you say?

538
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:45,880
Grandma.

539
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,599
I have to go.

540
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:49,360
Tyme.

541
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,000
Good luck my dear.
