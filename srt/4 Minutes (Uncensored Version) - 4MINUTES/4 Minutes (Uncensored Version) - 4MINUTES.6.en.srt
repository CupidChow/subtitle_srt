5

Inspector.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,840
Mr. Anuwat seems to have already fled.

7
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,120
Here.

8
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,158
Today, the police -

9
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,919
received a tip from a concerned citizen,

10
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,799
about finding the body of a middle-aged woman.

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Aged approximately 40 to 50 years old.

12
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,960
Believed to have been hit by a car that then fled.

13
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,120
CCTV footage is currently being reviewed.

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,840
Shit.

15
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,198
Where the hell did you come from?

16
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,680
I came from the ER.

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
Just finished my shift.

18
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,240
This shift was a total shitshow.

19
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,639
Do you think they'll catch the driver?

20
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,638
It'll depend on the driver.

21
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,960
How rich they are.

22
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,158
You answered with great social insight, Tyme.

23
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,439
Hey, Tyme.

24
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,520
I have something exciting to tell you.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,919
What?

26
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,039
I've never told anyone outside the department before.

27
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,479
But I'm telling you first.

28
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,800
I kept information -

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
on patient experiences that had a cardiac arrest before.

30
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,479
Wicked right?

31
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,520
That's interesting.

32
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,800
Of course it is.

33
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,199
I'll use a larger sample size than in past research.

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,158
I guarantee.

35
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,039
My research will be published internationally.

36
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,759
(Nutcha)

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,319
Better leave you with your girlfriend.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,560
Later man.

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,319
Hello?

40
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,560
What's going on?

41
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,839
You've been busy lately.

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,879
Yeah, very busy.

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
You've changed a lot in the past two years.

44
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,560
What, Nut?

45
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:42,319
I've always been like this.

46
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,319
I've always supported you.

47
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,920
Help take care of your grandmother's diabetes.

48
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,360
Did everything you wanted me to do.

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,519
Why don’t you care about my feelings?

50
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,240
Okay.

51
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,079
I understand.

52
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,279
Then we have nothing else to discuss.

53
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,480
I ordered them to delete all the CCTV footage.

54
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,279
Great.

55
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,319
And?

56
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,639
You hit and killed someone with your car.

57
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,639
Still not realizing how serious this is?

58
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,279
If I weren't close with the police,

59
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,720
you would've been in jail by now.

60
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
You just don’t want it in the news.

61
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,399
For your company’s reputation, right?

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Great.

63
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,160
Great, thank your dad.

64
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,160
For taking care of everything.

65
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,480
Thank you.

66
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,560
You ungrateful son.

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
I almost had to grovel to the police.

68
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,399
And this is how you act?!

69
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,560
Wait, wait.

70
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,959
Hello?

71
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,079
Tle.

72
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,600
What the hell is this clip?

73
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,600
How did Dome record you and View?

74
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,480
Yea let's put that aside for now.

75
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,879
I'm almost at your condo.

76
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,319
Why are you coming?

77
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,639
Oh, you'll find out soon.

78
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,160
I have something fun for you to help with.

79
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,439
Hey!

80
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,360
Hey.

81
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,639
Who told you to get out?

82
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,120
Hey, Tle.

83
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,279
Hey, Tle don't!

84
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,600
So, what’s the deal, Great?

85
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
Are you gonna help me or not?

86
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
Great.

87
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,159
Hey, Great.

88
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,720
Why didn't you,

89
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,879
why didn’t you call your dad’s men for this?

90
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,240
No way.

91
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,039
I don't want him to know.

92
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,399
He's so annoying.

93
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,200
Come help me carry him.

94
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,320
C'mon.

95
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,080
Okay.

96
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,159
Carry his legs.

97
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,120
Shit.

98
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,600
Do you think the police will catch us?

99
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,600
Catch who?

100
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
Dome was stressed.

101
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,000
Jumped in the water and killed himself.

102
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,559
Don't worry, my dear friend.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,480
If the police were to arrest someone,

104
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,200
they wouldn't come after us.

105
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,759
Let's go.

106
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
Let's go drink.

107
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,879
Drinks on me tonight.

108
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,399
C'mon.

109
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,039
Where shall we drink?

110
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey.

111
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,840
You're still stressed?

112
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Of course.

113
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,000
Someone died, you know?

114
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,919
Hey, Tle don't!

115
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Hm.

116
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,399
Today I have 3 cases.

117
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,879
I'm at the hospital. I’ll go in right away.

118
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay.

119
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,240
Doctor?

120
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
A document for you to sign.

121
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,399
Oh.

122
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,919
What is your name?

123
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,440
Pacharawit Sriwatsombat.

124
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,039
Any drug allergies?

125
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
No.

126
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,759
The doctor prescribed sleeping medication
and a stress reliever.

127
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,519
And also paracetamol for pain relief.

128
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,440
You can take every 4 to 6 hours as needed.

129
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,000
You're all set.

130
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,480
Careful bumping into anyone else with all that drinking.

131
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,799
I'm the doctor you bumped into at the hospital.

132
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,399
You followed me?

133
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,720
Nope.

134
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,200
I was coming here anyway.

135
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,120
Can I sit next to you?

136
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,159
I'm Tyme.

137
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,159
Great.

138
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
Do you come here often?

139
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,519
Pretty often.

140
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,759
This is my first time.

141
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,960
What's good here?

142
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,919
Liquor.

143
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,759
I think there's something else more interesting.

144
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,759
What?

145
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,799
You're so drunk, can you do it?

146
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,160
Wanna give it a go?

147
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,799
Let me use the bathroom real quick.

148
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,400
Sir, sir, have you seen this?

149
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,039
Sup dad?

150
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,720
I never thought you’d be like this.

151
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,519
Who's the guy in the clip?!

152
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,759
The guy in the clip?

153
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,160
Who was it?

154
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,319
I don't remember.

155
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,839
Get out of my face right now.

156
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,240
Go!

157
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,680
I have to go now?

158
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,119
Go stay with Aunt Ging for now, Grandma.

159
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,319
And also,

160
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,720
if it's not urgent, don't go out. Understand?

161
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,079
You have something, but aren't telling me, right?

162
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,160
No, Grandma.

163
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,079
It's just -

164
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,279
I've had busy shifts, and hardly been home.

165
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,000
You’re old now and need someone with you.

166
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,838
I was gone for just a bit,

167
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,960
and you forgot your meds again.

168
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,839
Stay with Aunt Ging so she can care for you.

169
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,400
And I can work with peace of mind.

170
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,039
It's not just that.

171
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,240
There's nothing Grandma. C'mon, let's go.

172
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,559
Tyme.

173
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,400
Grandma.

174
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,880
Consider doing it for your grandson.

175
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,519
You know right, Tyme?

176
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,480
That I love you very much.

177
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,680
I know, Grandma.

178
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,960
I love you very much too.

179
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,960
Come, get in the car.

180
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,000
It's getting late.

181
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,960
Let's go.

182
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,039
Let me know when you get there.

183
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
Okay.

184
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,400
Bye bye.

185
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
You found me pretty fast.

186
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,440
Quite bold of you to do that.

187
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,039
What do you want?

188
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,599
Pakorn and Amornrat.

189
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,440
Sound familiar?

190
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,839
When I met you then,

191
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,920
you were just a little child,

192
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,720
Tyme.

193
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Good.

194
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,039
No need for reintroductions.

195
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
Take this money and use it as you like.

196
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,880
Take Grandma out of that rat hole.

197
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,119
And buy a nice condo.

198
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,038
Or take her to a good private hospital for diabetes.

199
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,440
If you mess with my grandma, I'll expose everything.

200
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,119
I won't.

201
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,839
If you take the money.

202
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,240
And back off from my family.

203
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,359
I won't back off.

204
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,759
Until you admit you killed my parents.

205
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,599
And quit your vile business.

206
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,440
You don't know.

207
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,039
What else I can do.

208
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,759
I didn't kill your parents.

209
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,559
And another thing.

210
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,599
If you're thinking about exposing my vile business.

211
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,680
In the end, it’ll lead back to the source.

212
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,880
That the truth is,

213
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,279
the owner who started this gambling business,

214
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,359
was your parents.

215
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,640
You're lying!

216
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,480
If you don't stop.

217
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,880
You will face the truth that...

218
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,400
is better left unknown.

219
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,920
Your Grandma will be so heartbroken,

220
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,640
if she knew the house she's lived in,

221
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,000
came from that vile money as well.

222
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,640
Another warning.

223
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,000
The other partners aren't as nice as me.

224
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,440
If I were you,

225
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,079
I'd do nothing.

226
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,720
Great.

227
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,799
What are you doing here?

228
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,680
Picking up my meds.

229
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
Why haven't you answered my texts?

230
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,839
Step aside.

231
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,400
Let's have dinner tonight.

232
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,000
No way.

233
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,680
We can go to your favorite spot.

234
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,759
It's nothing.

235
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,880
Can you eat this?

236
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,240
If you can't, then leave.

237
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,239
Of course I can.

238
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,439
Why can't I?

239
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,319
Order 2.

240
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,480
Excuse me,

241
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:44,440
2 orders of chicken noodle soup with extra chili
and lots of crispy garlic, please.

242
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,759
Um, excuse me.

243
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,318
I can't eat spicy.

244
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,839
And I don't like garlic.

245
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,559
And can I get it without pork blood?

246
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,359
- Come, come, come, sit.
- And no innards.

247
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,400
You gonna eat it or not?

248
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,240
Hey, hey.

249
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,039
You really don't know?

250
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,039
Don't know what?

251
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,920
About the clip.

252
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,680
I was about to ask.

253
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,000
Why haven't you posted it on OnlyFans?

254
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,799
So you could make money.

255
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,359
Hey, aren't you embarrassed?

256
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,119
The one who's embarrassed is Dad, not me.

257
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,880
Did you do it to get famous?

258
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,359
Oh, but I forgot.

259
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,119
The clip doesn't show your face.

260
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,000
So why did you do it?

261
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,359
Because your family's business is shit.

262
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,839
Huh?

263
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,799
Go tell you dad, take the money back.

264
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,519
I don't want to use dirty money.

265
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,119
Are you fighting with my dad?

266
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,599
Wow, wicked.

267
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,319
Did you come up with the plan all by yourself?

268
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,160
Wow, impressive.

269
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,000
I can't believe it.

270
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,000
Why are you walking?

271
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,519
Why won't you let me drive you?

272
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Why, when the train's so close.

273
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,039
You can go home, Great.

274
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,920
You're still afraid of dogs?

275
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,199
I'm not afraid of dogs.

276
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,239
Who said I was afraid of dogs?

277
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,320
Hmhmm.

278
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,719
Ah.

279
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,519
And you say you're not afraid.

280
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,279
And the reason I know,

281
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,599
is because I did my research.

282
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,719
Wow.

283
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,280
No need to be a doctor if you're this nosy.

284
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,800
Go be a detective.

285
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,519
Stop talking.

286
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,599
Let's go.

287
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,239
There shouldn’t be any dogs around here.

288
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,039
I'm gonna go.

289
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,920
Where are you going?

290
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,079
Home.

291
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,719
Wanna hook up?

292
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,280
Didn't you jerk off before leaving the house?

293
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,760
Weren't you dying for me that day?

294
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Great.

295
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm being serious.

296
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,079
We shouldn't see each other again.

297
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,719
Let's part ways here.

298
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,320
Hello.

299
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,880
Where are you Korn?

300
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,079
Can we meet at the same place?

301
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,840
C'mon.

302
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,079
Okay, see you soon.

303
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,679
I'm being captured. Help me.

304
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,000
Help me!

305
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,159
Ow!

306
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,719
Finish up here.

307
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,239
Yes sir.

308
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,320
Go.

309
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,119
Agh!

310
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,000
Where is Nan?

311
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,599
Who the hell are you?

312
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,000
I said where is Nan?

313
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,280
Where is Nan!

314
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,360
I asked...

315
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,239
Answer!

316
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,280
Hey!

317
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,000
Great!

318
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,239
Don't let him escape!

319
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,400
Where is Nan?

320
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,639
Who is Nan?

321
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,199
The person your brother captured, where is she?

322
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,679
What are you talking about?

323
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,280
If you want to tell the police, then do it.

324
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,999
If you don't tell me where Nan is,

325
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,440
then get out of my face!

326
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,840
Tyme,

327
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm going in.

328
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,239
You've got some guts.

329
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,000
To mess with me.

330
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,559
You guys killed my friend.

331
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,319
You gonna tell me or not?

332
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,199
No.

333
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,119
Who did you send the info to?

334
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,400
Tell me!

335
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,558
- No!
- You wanna get hurt?!

336
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:53,360
I won't speak.

337
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,119
Tell me.

338
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,639
Who did you send the info to?!

339
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,559
Kill me then.

340
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,440
Kill me now!

341
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
You fucking scumbags!

342
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,519
I'm giving you one last chance.

343
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,760
You're daring me?

344
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,360
You're daring me?

345
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,679
Better off dead!

346
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,360
Hey.

347
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:27,840
Get up.

348
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,359
It was you, right?

349
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,679
Who Nan sent the info to?

350
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,599
Where did you save it?

351
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,199
Who did you send it to?

352
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,119
Scum.

353
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:56,679
Utterly useless.

354
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,519
Just go die with Nan, then.

355
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,840
Hey! Hey, stop!

356
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,719
Want to get your wound treated?

357
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,039
No.

358
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,440
Excuse me for telling a doctor what to do,

359
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,079
but you should get your wound treated.

360
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:37,320
How can you wait till morning looking like this?

361
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:40,960
Huh?

362
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,000
Hey, where are you going?

363
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:46,760
Oh.

364
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:47,960
I forgot.

365
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,679
Thank you so much for helping me.

366
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,360
But not for helping Nan.

367
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:55,079
How could I have helped her?

368
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,919
They had guns.

369
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,320
You sure you couldn't?

370
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,320
When you came and stopped them.

371
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,400
Everyone stopped and listened to you.

372
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:04,880
And if I got shot, what then?

373
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,000
So you just let someone die -

374
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:09,119
because of your cowardice?

375
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:12,440
People like you...

376
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,320
all deserve to fucking rot in hell, you bastard!

377
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:18,320
Hey, wait.

378
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
Don't follow me!

379
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,840
Then go die like the other one, you fucker!

380
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:32,000
What did you say?

381
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,440
What did you say?

382
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,480
What did you say?!

383
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:43,800
Motherfucker!

384
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,960
Just moments ago,

385
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,399
we received information from someone collecting evidence -

386
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,599
to expose a well-known logistics company.

387
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,800
Involved in illegal gambling and online betting operations.

388
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:50,598
Additionally, there are shareholders who are politicians.

389
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,440
And many high-ranking police officers as well.

390
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,199
Mr. Korn.

391
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,719
How long can General Warit delay things for us?

392
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,118
Not long.

393
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,119
You must get everything done by tonight.

394
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,440
Do you know who exposed us?

395
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,760
Probably the person Nan sent the info to.

396
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,039
I saw him last night.

397
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:38,960
But Mr. Great, your brother,

398
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,400
helped him escape.

399
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:41,559
Great?

400
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,440
Why would he do that?

401
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,719
You should go ask your brother.

402
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,920
Still not done? Hurry up!

403
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Get everything off the wall.

404
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,760
What are we going to do now?

405
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:04,440
It'll be okay.

406
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:05,599
A team is already on standby.

407
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,440
I'll have them hurry up and go there.

408
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,199
Anything you want to tell me?

409
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:22,079
Nothing to tell me?

410
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,159
I can't believe it.

411
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,199
That you would do something like this.

412
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,199
It's because of something like this.

413
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:44,920
So we could have a company.

414
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:46,719
A home.

415
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,199
And money.

416
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,960
For you to waste like it's nothing!

417
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:51,559
We have to do this Great.

418
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,519
We've almost gone bankrupt before.

419
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,119
- So you saved the company by killing people?!
- Great.

420
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,159
Then you both take responsibility for it then.

421
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm leaving.

422
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,519
Great.

423
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,679
Great.

424
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,480
Great.

425
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,519
Wait, Great.

426
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:23,000
Great.

427
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,599
Great! Stop, stop.

428
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,760
Great.

429
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:27,399
I beg you.

430
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,360
Go back and apologize to dad right now.

431
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,159
You just order me around.

432
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,440
You never ask me if I want to.

433
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,920
I'm not ordering.

434
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,759
I'm just telling you what you should do.

435
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,440
I'm just telling you what's best for you.

436
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:41,800
Best for whom?

437
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,280
For you?

438
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,000
For dad?

439
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:46,599
For the company?

440
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,719
For the family's reputation?

441
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,518
And how about me?

442
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:53,559
In the end, it's always what's best for you.

443
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,039
Why can't you see it this way?

444
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,599
Just getting angry.

445
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,360
And frustrated.

446
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,519
And distancing yourself from me.

447
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,118
It took me a long time to get to this point.

448
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,039
I had to fight.

449
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,360
If I didn't,

450
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,280
You and me,

451
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,000
we would have to live in hiding.

452
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,920
In a tiny house by your dad.

453
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,280
You'll end up being the mistress's child.

454
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,960
I've done all of this.

455
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,760
Why can't you understand me? This is all for you.

456
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,199
I beg you.

457
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,400
Great, believe me.

458
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,800
Go up and apologize to dad.

459
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:37,719
Let's go.

460
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,239
Great, Great.

461
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:45,480
Great.

462
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,239
Great!

463
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
No, Great!

464
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,280
Great, open the door right now.

465
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:51,199
Great

466
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,239
Great

467
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:53,440
Great!

468
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:55,280
Don't do this.

469
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,639
Don't, Great!

470
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,679
Great.
