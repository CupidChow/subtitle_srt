4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,559
Just like the last body, Inspector.

5
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,799
Found at the same place.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
Also has an open wound on the head.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
If it's not a case of serial murder, then...

8
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,679
the victim must've been targeted for revenge.

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,200
- Hello sir.
- Chief.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,520
What's the status of the case?

11
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,119
We are waiting for the forensic results, sir.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,000
Can't we get the results any faster?

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,599
The higher-ups are pushing us already.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,399
We must catch this criminal ASAP.

15
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,280
I'll rush them.

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,759
Get it done, Inspector Win.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Yes sir.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,639
How's the case with Mr. Chang going?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,880
It's in progress, sir.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Get on it!

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,200
Hey, c'mon, stop chit chatting with me.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,560
Hello.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,719
Do you have the DNA results?

24
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,680
I was just about to call you, Inspector.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,959
I have the results.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,679
The bloodstain on the rock,

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,359
matches the bloodstain of the victim.

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,000
As for the fingerprints on the rock,

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,120
matches the fingerprints in our database -

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,599
of the person named,

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,280
Mr. Anuwat Warindej.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,480
Inspector, excuse me. I need to check a new case.

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
(Ton Kla.)

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
Great.

35
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,800
Where did he go?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He escaped.

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Korn.

38
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,560
You're bleeding a lot.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,199
Let's go to the hospital.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,159
Um... excuse me.

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,359
Do you know Dr. Tyme?

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,399
Oh, yes I do.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,199
He's my friend.

44
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,360
Do you know where he is?

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,520
Tyme.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
Right now he's probably in the operating room.

47
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,360
Which way?

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,479
Just go straight that way, you'll find it.

49
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,479
Thank you.

50
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,639
The room over there.

51
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,800
You can't come in.

52
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,000
Please wait outside.

53
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,159
Is Dr. Tyme inside?

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,478
Dr. Tyme is currently in surgery.

55
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,280
You can't go in.

56
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:15,759
- Well... well, I-
- Please. Please wait outside.

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,120
Please wait outside.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
- I'm asking you.
- But...

59
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,240
Please.

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,040
You can't go in.

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Is there something you want to tell me?

62
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,240
I could call the police to arrest you now.

63
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,439
But I'm giving you a chance.

64
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,639
Why did you do that?

65
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,920
Not going to answer?

66
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,199
You really don't know?

67
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,480
Know what?

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
That your parents screwed people over.

69
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,839
And caused my parents to die.

70
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,160
Huh?

71
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
Where is Nan?

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,359
Who is Nan?

73
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
The person your brother captured, where is she?

74
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,639
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,360
If you want to tell the police, then do it.

76
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,119
If you don't tell me where Nan is,

77
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,879
then get out of my face!

78
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,879
Nan, right?

79
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,439
Huh?

80
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,079
The woman my brother captured.

81
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,839
I'll help get Nan out for you.

82
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,758
(Student Association.)

83
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,720
(With love and condolences from your fellow students.)

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,879
Thank you so much.

85
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,399
I'll take my leave.

86
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Yes, goodbye.

87
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
Thanks for helping out today.

88
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
It's nothing.

89
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,720
I didn't have a shift anyway.

90
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,240
I don't have any family left.

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,399
I don't have any parents.

92
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,559
I lost my little brother.

93
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,799
I feel completely lost.

94
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
But you still have me.

95
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,039
Is something wrong?

96
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,720
I've been followed for a while now.

97
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,159
Who?

98
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,840
It’s probably...

99
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Those who don’t want me on your brother’s case.

100
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,279
But didn't your boss order you to stop already?

101
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,039
I'm still looking for evidence.

102
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,719
I think the person who did it,

103
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
is definitely not an ordinary person.

104
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,039
Probably an heir to a powerful family.

105
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,159
You should also be careful.

106
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,320
How should I be careful?

107
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,799
Right now, I'm living alone too.

108
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,679
I should move in with you and keep you company -

109
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,279
until the case is resolved; it might be best.

110
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
At the very least, I can protect you.

111
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
I thought you’d bring more stuff.

112
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Cops don't carry much.

113
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,279
Don't have any money.

114
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,960
Don't know how to cheat.

115
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,159
Stupid, right?

116
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,679
Oh, don't you want my stuff upstairs?

117
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,679
Up me first.

118
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,159
Take off.

119
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,799
Who is it?

120
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,879
Go and hide.

121
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,120
Go hide.

122
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Sorry I've been gone for so long.

123
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,480
I had something urgent to take care of.

124
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,000
Urgent enough to be gone for weeks.

125
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
You couldn't even call me?

126
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,799
I didn't have any time to call.

127
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,159
How about I fill you in -

128
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,919
on what happened, okay?

129
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,320
Hey, what happened to you Korn?

130
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,720
Korn.

131
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,279
Do you know -

132
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,519
what I've been through?

133
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,200
My brother was killed.

134
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,080
We just cremated the body yesterday.

135
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,519
Who did it Ton Kla?

136
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,000
Haven't caught them yet.

137
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,240
How about this.

138
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
I'll talk to my police friend about it.

139
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,320
And have him handle it, okay?

140
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
You don't have to.

141
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,320
There's someone helping me already.

142
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,879
Ton Kla.

143
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,879
Just leave, go.

144
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,080
Just go.

145
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,799
You dare kick me out?

146
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,200
Yes!

147
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
And that was...

148
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,480
So...

149
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,879
what should I do now?

150
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,159
It'll get better.

151
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Harder.

152
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,759
There you are.

153
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,839
It's time to head back to cheer practice.

154
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,039
Can I skip today?

155
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,039
My cat just died.

156
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,839
Why did you bury it here?

157
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,359
I don't want it to be at the house.

158
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Close to the person who killed it.

159
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,960
Who?

160
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,359
You should keep its collar.

161
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,480
As a momento.

162
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,960
When you miss it.

163
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
C'mere.

164
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,079
Excuse me.

165
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,519
With this, no one will mess with you.

166
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,559
Okay.

167
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,680
(Senior Chief.)

168
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,119
I'll take it off for you.

169
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,920
What do I do now?

170
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,880
Try touching me.

171
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,720
Take it off for me.

172
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,359
Don't know how to kiss?

173
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,640
Don't be nervous.

174
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,160
I'll teach you.

175
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,440
You heart is beating so fast.

176
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,319
Try putting your tongue in my mouth.

177
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,480
Are you scared?

178
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,559
I don't want to cause you pain.

179
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,799
It's okay.

180
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,559
I love you so much Korn.

181
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Was that okay?

182
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,319
Nodding you head means?

183
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
Was it really okay?

184
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,358
How about me?

185
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,039
Hm?

186
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,079
Was I okay?

187
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,880
What are you talking about?

188
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,000
Are you being cheeky?

189
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,559
The same thing you were talking about.

190
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I think,

191
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,160
another round sounds good.

192
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,720
Another round, really?

193
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,559
Okay.

194
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,039
Very much okay.

195
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,039
Did you move everything from that house yet?

196
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,519
Not yet.

197
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,279
Some clothes and a few things are left.

198
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,119
But I talked to my brother already.

199
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,680
We're not going back.

200
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,920
And recently my dad...

201
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,839
always drunk, causing a ruckus.

202
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,480
Then,

203
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,920
just buy all new stuff.

204
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,759
I'll send you more money.

205
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
You don't need to give me anymore.

206
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,799
I feel bad.

207
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,279
Don't feel bad.

208
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,119
I'm happy to.

209
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,519
And it's not a problem for me.

210
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,440
When I graduate,

211
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,720
and take over the family business from my dad.

212
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,160
I'll tell everyone,

213
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,759
that you are my boyfriend, Ton Kla.

214
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,240
You said it.

215
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,079
Hmhmm.

216
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,039
I promise.

217
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:16,920
Promise.

218
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,559
Right here.

219
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,519
My promise.

220
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,559
Korndanai Sriwatsombat.

221
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,880
Promise.

222
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,920
I love you so much, Ton Kla.

223
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,519
I love you more than anything in the world, Korn.

224
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,960
Oh.

225
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,200
Lukwa.

226
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,440
Um, hi there.

227
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Hi.

228
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,798
I'm meeting a cardiologist today.

229
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,920
So I thought I’d drop by and say hello.

230
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,518
I brought some snacks for you.

231
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,318
This place is my favorite spot.

232
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,558
I want you to try it.

233
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,400
Wow.

234
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,240
You shouldn't have.

235
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,680
I'm not your doctor, so why am I getting snacks?

236
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,118
True, you're not my doctor.

237
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,239
But you're the only doctor,

238
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,439
that let me share what’s going on in my head -

239
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,680
when my heart stopped.

240
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,278
When I told other people,

241
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,240
no one listened to me the way you did.

242
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,559
Thank you so much.

243
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,240
Thank you.

244
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,359
Um, doctor.

245
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,480
What you said,

246
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,000
about how the last moments of our lives -

247
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,279
might depend on our beliefs, religion,

248
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,599
and life experience.

249
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,759
Yes.

250
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,119
And then you asked,

251
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,319
about me seeing 4 minutes into the future,

252
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,880
which aspect of life is it from?

253
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,200
You have an answer Ms. Lukwa?

254
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,920
I thought about it.

255
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,200
I think I've been to this place before.

256
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,519
The brain is an organ that requires a constant flow of oxygen.

257
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,079
This is how long the brain can survive without oxygen.

258
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,279
What happens to our consciousness during this time?

259
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,118
Is it possible,

260
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,759
that I might've remembered that number?

261
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,399
Yes, it's possible.

262
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,680
It's possible.

263
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,279
Ms. Lukwa.

264
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,799
When did you go into that room?

265
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,318
I can't remember the details clearly.

266
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,598
About when I went in.

267
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,039
And how I went in.

268
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,640
My memories from that time are very vague.

269
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,319
And I wasn't the only person in the room.

270
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,959
I haven't told you yet, have I?

271
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,720
I found another patient similar to you.

272
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Really?

273
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,318
If it's okay with you,

274
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,838
and you’d like to meet him, let me know.

275
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,720
In case we get more answers.

276
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,399
I'd be happy to.

277
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,319
If you can arrange it,

278
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,759
please let me know.

279
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,039
Okay.

280
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,359
Can you tell me now.

281
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,359
Who did you send the information to?

282
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,240
Sa-Marn!

283
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,759
Has she said anything yet?

284
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,480
Not yet sir.

285
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,240
Can you please tell me.

286
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,799
Who did you send the information to?

287
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,599
Please tell me.

288
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,039
I promise.

289
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,079
I won't let anyone.

290
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,759
Hurt you anymore.

291
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,000
I'll give you money.

292
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
And let you go.

293
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,799
Okay?

294
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,640
Could you please take better care of her?

295
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,519
And if she says anything,

296
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,480
let me know immediately.

297
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,480
Yes sir.

298
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,319
I’ll let you know once I have any updates.

299
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,039
You dare kick me out?

300
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
Yes!

301
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,000
Hey, you're drunk already?

302
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,039
Took you long enough.

303
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Well, the traffic was insane.

304
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,240
I came as fast as I could.

305
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,400
Did they catch who did this yet?

306
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,319
You look stressed.

307
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,000
I feel like such a fucking failure.

308
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,720
Dad gave me an important job to do.

309
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,839
I don't even know if I'll ruin it or not.

310
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,799
Hey.

311
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,720
And is it ruined?

312
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,720
Not yet.

313
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,000
But just one mistake.

314
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,119
It'll all be ruined.

315
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
You don't understand Great.

316
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,519
How important this company is -

317
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,240
to me.

318
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,400
And this job you're doing right now.

319
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,680
What kind of job is it?

320
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,239
If you can't say, then don't.

321
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,119
Tonight,

322
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,760
you can let go.

323
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,880
I'll carry you back.

324
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,839
You're old enough to take care of me?

325
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,800
Yes, here.

326
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,559
Down it.

327
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,400
- Cheers, let's go!
- Cheers.

328
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,679
Can I do half?

329
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,960
Finish it, finish it.

330
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,039
Come, come.

331
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,119
Finish it!

332
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,000
You're awesome, man.

333
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,599
Just straight up.

334
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,840
Cheers!

335
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,440
What's up? Feeling less stressed now?

336
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,079
I love you bro.

337
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,000
The taste is like hmm...

338
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,239
Throat burner.

339
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey.

340
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,480
Hm?

341
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,159
- Hey.
- Hm?

342
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,440
Come, let's do a selfie.

343
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:11,559
Korn.

344
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,039
Huh?

345
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,280
I'm going to use the bathroom.

346
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,320
Oh, uh huh.

347
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,559
(Take Nan here.)

348
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,760
That's dad's old warehouse.

349
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,199
Huh?

350
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,559
Wait.

351
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,760
Answer me.

352
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,440
You gonna tell me or not?

353
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,440
No!

354
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,559
You wanna get hurt?

355
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,440
If you're gonna kill me, do it.

356
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,238
Tell me.

357
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,920
No.

358
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,519
You gonna tell me or not?

359
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,599
No.

360
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,079
You wanna get hurt?

361
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,719
You've got some guts.

362
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,760
To mess with me.

363
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,559
You guys killed my friend.

364
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,840
You gonna tell me or not?

365
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,000
No.

366
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,079
Who did you send the info to?

367
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,000
Tell me!

368
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,239
- No!
- You wanna get hurt!

369
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,320
I won't speak.

370
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,840
Tell me!

371
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,760
Who did you send the info to!

372
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,159
Kill me then!

373
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,239
Kill me now!

374
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,440
You fucking scumbags!

375
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,039
I'm giving you one last chance.

376
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,599
You're daring me?

377
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,159
You're daring me?

378
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,280
Better off dead!

379
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,000
You gonna tell me or not?

380
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,000
No!

381
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,320
You wanna get hurt?

382
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,239
If you're gonna kill me, do it.

383
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,440
Tell me!

384
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,800
- You gonna tell me or not?
- No.

385
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,719
Who did you send the info to?

386
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,039
Tell me!

387
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,280
- No!
- You wanna get hurt?

388
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,360
I can't!

389
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,480
Who did you send the info to?

390
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,960
Kill me then.

391
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,840
Kill me now.

392
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,119
You fucking scumbags!

393
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,960
I'm giving you one last chance.

394
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,760
You're daring me?

395
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
You're daring me?

396
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,360
Stop!

397
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,000
Mr. Great.

398
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,880
What are you doing?

399
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
You can't do this Mr. Great.

400
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,959
Korn told me to get her out of here.

401
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,719
But Mr. Korn hasn't ordered me anything.

402
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,760
You dare get in my way?

403
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,800
You dare get in my way?

404
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,360
Son of a bitch!

405
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:33,760
Hey.

406
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,239
Don't let Mr. Great take her out of here.

407
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,000
I don't know.

408
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,400
What you want.

409
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,440
But I cannot let you take Nan out of here.

410
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,679
Why can't I?

411
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,840
Mr. Great.

412
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,760
I think you should wait inside.

413
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,239
I'll call a van to take you home.

414
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
I won't go.

415
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,719
If I go, you'll definitely kill Nan.

416
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,360
Hey.

417
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,559
Let me go!

418
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,000
Let me go!

419
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,079
Let me go!

420
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,000
Hey!

421
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:32,800
Great.

422
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,559
Take Nan away from here.

423
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:47,639
So it was you.

424
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,760
Who Nan sent the info to.

425
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,480
Okay then.

426
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,480
I'll find you no matter what.

427
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:58,719
Won't be long.

428
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,239
Move her to the red zone now.

429
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,960
Did any relatives come with her?

430
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,199
Someone dropped her off, but they're gone now.

431
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,719
Oh, where did they go?

432
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,119
I don't know.

433
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,679
Great.

434
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,239
Hey, Great.

435
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
What are you doing?

436
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,079
Great.

437
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,159
What's going on Great?

438
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,360
Hey.

439
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,719
Holy shit.

440
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,639
Whoo! Yeah!

441
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,199
Thank you so much for getting Nan out.

442
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,920
I had to help.

443
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,039
If I didn't.

444
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,519
She would've been shot dead.

445
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,159
I saw the future.

446
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:24,159
I don't think you need treatment anymore.

447
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,960
If you have magical powers like -

448
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,400
the X-Men, amirite?

449
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,960
Right?

450
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:32,599
Huh?

451
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,480
Even though it might be useful.

452
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,719
I still want answers.

453
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,159
On what exactly caused it.

454
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,760
By the way, where are we going?

455
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,920
Anywhere far from here.

456
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,760
Let's go

457
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:24,400
You can drop me here. I got it.

458
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:25,440
Yes sir.

459
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,239
Thank you.

460
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,079
Ah.

461
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,039
You're sure no one will find us?

462
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,000
They won't.

463
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,400
I don't even know where we are.

464
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,880
Huh?

465
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,239
Really?

466
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,519
Shit... what the hell.

467
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:04,239
My heart hasn't stopped beating.

468
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
Is that abnormal?

469
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,239
Abnormal?

470
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,599
Probably because of the adrenaline rushing.

471
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,760
Really?

472
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,559
Yea.

473
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,119
Any better?

474
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,440
Nope.

475
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,400
Messy hair.

476
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,119
Why not take it off?

477
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:26,880
Huh?

478
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,880
Your legs are in the way.

479
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:30,719
Oh.

480
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
Are you okay?

481
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,239
Okay.

482
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,960
Here's the doctor's note and your appointment slip.

483
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,480
Okay.

484
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:07,558
You're all set.

485
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,678
You can go home now.

486
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:10,558
Thank you so much for taking care of me.

487
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,360
My pleasure.

488
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,760
I hope everything with the case gets sorted out.

489
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,880
Thank you.

490
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,840
Well then, I'll head out now.

491
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,559
Okay.

492
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,000
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

493
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,159
Hello?

494
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,519
I'm here already.

495
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:47,320
I'm almost there.

496
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,400
Sorry I didn’t ask you to pick me up at the hospital.

497
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,039
Stop nagging so much.

498
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,119
I'm all better now so I left.

499
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,280
Okay.

500
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,719
I'll see you at home.

501
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,800
Okay, okay.

502
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,199
Ton Kla, I'm home now.

503
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,679
Ton Kla.
