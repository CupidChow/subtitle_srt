5

Yes, Anne?

6
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,120
I'll come now.

7
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
The patient refuses to sleep.

8
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,560
Are you feeling any pain?

9
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,759
Not anymore.

10
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
I'll prescribe you some sleep medication.

11
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,159
My son.

12
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
Committed suicide.

13
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,000
Last month.

14
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,039
I lived with my son.

15
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,039
We didn't have much money.

16
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,319
My son tried to make money.

17
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,439
But in the end, he lost everything.

18
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,639
Being hounded for debt everyday.

19
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
I never thought...

20
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,719
that my son would leave me like this.

21
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know...

22
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,120
why I should continue living,

23
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,120
doctor.

24
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Tonight, please take the sleeping pills as prescribed.

25
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,680
And tomorrow, I'll bring a psychiatrist.

26
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,800
Suicidal precaution please.

27
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,840
Yes doctor.

28
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:12,879
Um...

30
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,319
I can do it.

31
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,079
Thank you.

32
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,600
Hey Anne?

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,639
Yes?

34
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,600
Was that the patient's relative?

35
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,439
Oh.

36
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,519
Yes.

37
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,199
He just asked me to take these flowers to room four.

38
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,639
I was confused why he didn't just take it himself.

39
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Hey Anne, hey.

40
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,920
Hm?

41
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,759
Are Dr. Tyme and Dr. Natcha still together?

42
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,639
I heard they broke up.

43
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,680
And then Dr. Natcha quit.

44
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,240
Dropping out of her specialty?

45
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm not surprised.

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,519
Dr. Tyme is so intimidating.

47
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
So true.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,240
I get goosebumps.

49
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,838
I'm going to prepare medication for a patient.

50
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,959
Sure, go.

51
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,518
Why are you doing this to me?

52
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,160
I've had enough don't you get it?

53
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,560
I'm not breaking up!

54
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,279
But I'm breaking up!

55
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,519
I've done everything for you.

56
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
I've had enough. Listen to me.

57
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,839
What did I do to you?

58
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm saying, I can't do this anymore.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,160
I can't do this anymore Tle!

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Stop being so stupid!

61
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
We're going home!

62
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,839
No I'm not going. No!

63
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,519
C'mon.

64
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,199
- Hey!
- Tle, let go!

65
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:02,759
Hey!

66
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,319
What are you doing?

67
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,680
Don't be nosy!

68
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,439
C'mon, we're going home!

69
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,079
Tle...

70
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,639
- Let go
- Come!

71
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,120
I think I'm gonna do art,

72
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,639
but not economy.

73
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,879
I don't know

74
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,360
(text: seeing into the future four minutes)

75
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,399
Is View still coming?

76
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,879
Hey, how's your car?

77
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,279
A little scratch on the bumper.

78
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,879
Getting it fixed.

79
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,279
And about the exam? What are you going to do?

80
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,639
I told the professor I couldn't come -

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,399
because of an accident.

82
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,040
He's going to reschedule me for a make-up exam.

83
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay. Well, think of it as washing away bad luck.

84
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,160
But if there's anything my dad can help with,

85
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,800
let me know anytime.

86
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,120
Mod, is anyone sitting here?

87
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,638
Oh, I was saving it for View.

88
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,879
But... she's probably not coming.

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,079
So you can sit here Dome.

90
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,839
And View...

91
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,199
Where did she go?

92
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,920
I don't know.

93
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,800
I've been calling her since last night
but she hasn't picked up.

94
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Last night I saw View and Title argue by the dorms.

95
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,000
And then after that,

96
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,519
View went into the car with Title.

97
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,720
Oh Title?

98
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,879
He might know where View went.

99
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,800
Okay. I'll go ask him.

100
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,399
Title.

101
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,839
I can't reach View.

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,759
And Dome said she was with you.

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,759
Right?

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,959
He's blowing smoke.

105
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
Really?

106
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,879
Hello?

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,039
I ate already.

109
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,399
I'll see you at your place tonight.

110
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,879
Okay, see you soon.

111
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,240
Ok.

112
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,320
What do you want?

113
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,039
I'm here to fix our little misunderstanding.

114
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,039
Fix what?

115
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,399
After you saw me and View last night.

116
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,600
Me and View left separately.

117
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,559
If anyone else asks you -

118
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,639
about where View went,

119
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,639
Never say you saw us together.

120
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm just saying based on what I saw.

121
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,399
But you just saw a split second didn't you?

122
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,120
Don't act like you know it all.

123
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,919
Then why are you so heated?

124
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,440
Or do you know where View went.

125
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,039
Fuck you, Dome.

126
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,679
You've been testing my patience for a while.

127
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
If you don't want to get fucked.

128
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,399
Shut your mouth about last night.

129
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,720
You know right?

130
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,159
Who I am?

131
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,879
What I can do to you.

132
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,599
Where am I supposed to buy one Tle?

133
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,519
I'm not going to make it on time.

134
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,759
Holy fuck!

135
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:55,879
Shit!

136
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,879
Are you okay, ma'am?

137
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,960
Hey! Don't you know how to say sorry?

138
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,119
(Chat message: Where is did you last see her?)
(Chat message: I saw her at lunch.)

139
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
(Chat message: Let’s wait. If we don’t find her,
then we’ll see. Let’s not panic.)

140
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,080
(Chat message: Can anyone contact her?
It’s almost been 24 hours. )

141
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:36,199
(Chat message: Called many times.
No answer. Never answered Line.)

142
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,320
(Chat message: Should we post something?)

143
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,679
Stop being so stupid!

144
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,519
We're going home!

145
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,600
No, I'm not going.

146
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,440
Come!

147
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
No!

148
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,319
Hello?

149
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,200
Hey Tle.

150
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,720
What the hell is this clip?

151
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,759
How did Dome record you and View?

152
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,638
Yeah, let's put that aside for now.

153
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm almost at your condo.

154
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Why?

155
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,999
Well

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
You'll find out soon.

157
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,320
I have something fun for you to help with.

158
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,080
Shit what happened to you?

159
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,799
Who the fuck cares.

160
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,080
So you know about View missing?

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,639
Yeah.

162
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,720
She's with me.

163
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
I locked her up so she doesn't go anywhere.

164
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,279
Until she wants me back.

165
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh, you dickhead.

166
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,360
Then why won't you let her respond to her messages?

167
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,639
Everyone is panicking.

168
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
Shit, someone might file a missing person's report.

169
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,759
Yeah, who the fuck cares.

170
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,679
I have something even more important.

171
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
What about?

172
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,480
Shit, What the fu...

173
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,399
I'm just teaching him a lesson.

174
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,960
Just hitting this nosy fucker...

175
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,200
Damn, it felt so good.

176
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,720
But I didn't think it would knock him out this long.

177
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,360
Shit, Dome...

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,919
Dome.

179
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,480
Shit, we have to take him to the hospital.

180
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,559
Take him there would be stupid, you idiot.

181
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,879
And what if he dies at the hospital?

182
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,159
Then what are you going to do?

183
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,320
Just help me finish this up, will you?

184
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,039
Finish what up?

185
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,039
Drown him.

186
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,919
No. I won't.

187
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
Hey Great.

188
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,159
Hey Great!

189
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,799
When you got into a fight at the bar, didn't I help you?

190
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,399
- And now that I need your help -
- Oh, fuck you!

191
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
But this is really serious.

192
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,159
If you want to do it.

193
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,159
Do it yourself.

194
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
What the fuck are you doing?

195
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:44,960
Great.

196
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,960
Fuck you Great. You wanna die or something?

197
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,679
Hey

198
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,200
Hey!

199
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,919
Who told you to get out?

200
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,440
Hey Tle, what are you doing?

201
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:05,960
Hey Tle,

202
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,279
Tle don't!

203
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Great

204
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,879
Hey Great.

205
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,559
Cut the dazed look.

206
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,159
Come help me lift him.

207
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,240
What the hell Great.

208
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,799
What the hell is wrong with you?

209
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,519
Wow doctor,

210
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,039
you're so strong.

211
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,160
After a workout, you still have energy to work a shift.

212
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,680
When do you sleep?

213
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,720
I sleep when I'm free.

214
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:10,960
And how many hours..

215
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,559
ahh.

216
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,039
Don't forget to bring your mom for a check up.

217
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,680
Yess

218
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:28,920
Hey, wait.

219
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,759
Did you hit your head?

220
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,519
Did you go through screening yet?

221
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,680
Not yet.

222
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,359
Then go through screening first over there, then come back.

223
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
Admit the patient to surgical ward

224
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll write the order.

225
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes doctor.

226
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,559
Dr. Tyme?

227
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,759
Is the order finished, Dr. Tyme?

228
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,359
Oh, one second.

229
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,480
Okay.

230
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,519
Uh.

231
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,359
Did anyone see that case yet?

232
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,880
Oh, everyone is tied up with urgent cases right now.

233
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,039
And the interns are still finishing up the red cases.

234
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,839
Whoa!

235
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,799
Can I get his chart, Bee...

236
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,279
that case over there please.

237
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,679
Oh, that's okay.

238
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,559
Just a head injury, I'll have the interns look at it.

239
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,039
Is it that one?

240
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,960
I'll take it.

241
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
It's fine, Dr. Tyme.

242
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,599
I'll have an intern look at it.

243
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,519
Whoa, Dr. Tyme.

244
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,960
What happened?

245
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,160
I'm just bringing my friend.

246
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,240
You didn't answer the question.

247
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,400
I got punched.

248
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,119
And your friend also got hurt?

249
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,759
Yes.

250
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,279
Have you been drinking?

251
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
No, we haven't.

252
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,518
Experiencing loss of consciousness, double vision -

253
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,559
nausea, or vomiting?

254
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,880
No.

255
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Alright, let me see the wound.

256
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,279
Does it hurt?

257
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,559
Um...

258
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,480
No.

259
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,400
It's pretty deep.

260
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,839
All the doctors in the ER are busy.

261
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,440
I'll stitch it up for you.

262
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Aren't you an ER doctor?

263
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,599
I'm a surgeon.

264
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,400
Get me a suture set for wound closure.

265
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,920
Yes doctor.

266
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,079
Why so tense?

267
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,720
All finished.

268
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,680
I've met you before.

269
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,680
You bumped into me in the ward.

270
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,119
Oh, I'm sorry.

271
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,279
You said sorry already.

272
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,000
What's your name?

273
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm Tyme.

274
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
- I'm -
- Pacharawit Sriwatsombat

275
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,518
I saw your name on the vase -

276
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,039
that you brought for a patient.

277
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,799
You have good memory.

278
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
Come for wound cleaning everyday.

279
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,799
Stitches can be removed in a week.

280
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,599
I can remove them for you.

281
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,680
Hm?

282
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,680
Because I'm the one who did the stitching.

283
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,799
Ah, yes.

284
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,559
Um, doctor?

285
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,200
Can I ask you one more thing?

286
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,480
Have you ever met a patient...

287
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,480
that could see the future?

288
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,559
A few, in the psych ward.

289
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,759
Or a patient that's confused, or delirious.

290
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,079
Why?

291
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,359
Nothing.

292
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,680
Thank you for treating my wound.

293
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,039
- Hello sir
- Hello

294
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,319
You haven't found the deceased's phone around here?

295
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,640
We haven't, inspector.

296
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,319
And you've contacted the deceased's relatives?

297
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,559
Yes, we have.

298
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,200
I've sent them to the forensic department already.

299
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,160
Okay, thank you.

300
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,480
Yes sir.

301
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,839
- Hello sir!
- Thank you.

302
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,719
Officer Somkuan.

303
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,599
Yes sir.

304
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,039
Look around.

305
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,279
Maybe there is other evidence around here.

306
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,759
My brother.

307
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,839
Where is my brother?

308
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,920
Are you the brother of the deceased?

309
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,759
I want to see my brother.

310
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,279
Take me to him please.

311
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Can you confirm -

312
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,440
that this is your brother?

313
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm sorry for your loss.

314
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,680
Why?

315
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,039
Why did it have to be you?

316
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,118
(Chat message: I parked your car at the dorms already.)

317
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,919
(Chat message: I’m sorry about last night.)

318
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,879
(Chat message: But I couldn’t leave Dome like that.)

319
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
(Chat message: Answer me please.)

320
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,920
View told me,

321
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,839
that you're the one who helped her.

322
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,599
Thank you so much Great.

323
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,400
It was nothing.

324
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,119
I was also worried about her.

325
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
By the way,

326
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,200
how did you find her?

327
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,599
Tle told me he locked her in his room.

328
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,680
I managed to snatch his car keys.

329
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,599
And the keycard to his condo was in the car.

330
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,319
Did Title hurt you?

331
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,519
A little.

332
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,400
By the way,

333
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,759
Title has disappeared.

334
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,359
View is filing a complaint for assault
and unlawful detention.

335
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:49,559
I think...

336
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,640
he's trying to evade the charges.

337
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,640
I don't know where Title went.

338
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,920
If you contact him,

339
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,720
Don't forget to tell him to go and acknowledge the charges.

340
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,480
Hm.

341
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,359
Thank you so much Great.

342
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,359
Tle

343
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,720
Great.

344
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,799
How dare you betray me?

345
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,839
I didn't betray you.

346
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,119
You were about to kill Dome.
Shouldn't I stop you?

347
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,279
Who told you,

348
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,799
that I was going to kill him?

349
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,200
Who puts an unconscious friend in the back of a car?

350
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,640
You were about to kill him.

351
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,479
Stop accusing me you bastard!

352
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,759
Hey Tle, let me go.

353
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,000
You bastard.

354
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,359
Hey Tle.

355
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,039
Let me go!

356
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,759
Hey!

357
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,759
Who the hell are you?

358
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,359
Get the hell out of here.

359
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,359
Go!

360
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,680
You'll see me around you fucker!

361
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Doctor.

362
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:27,920
Are you okay?

363
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,000
Don't you have to be at the hospital?

364
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:44,000
Being a doctor doesn't mean
staying at the hospital all the time.

365
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,640
It's just that I was seeing a friend around here.

366
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,319
Oh.

367
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,519
Who was that?

368
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,680
You don't need to know.

369
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,599
I'm sorry I asked.

370
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,079
I was just worried.

371
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,200
You should go see your friend.

372
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,759
I'm fine now.

373
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,160
You sure you don't want a friend around?

374
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,359
What if that guy comes back?

375
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:48,960
You don't have to stay.

376
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,039
My building is right here.

377
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,119
It's just a short walk.

378
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,119
Then we should exchange Line IDs.

379
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,160
In case you...

380
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,679
ever need help.

381
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,000
If not, that's fine.

382
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,320
I'm gonna go.

383
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,760
Wait.

384
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,119
Fuck!

385
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,760
Hey, mine too.

386
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,119
How did the system crash?

387
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,760
The system crashed.

388
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,519
Hey what's going on.

389
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,638
Hey, what happened?

390
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,079
The system crashed suddenly.

391
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,280
Hey!

392
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Shut up!

393
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,280
If the system crashed, get IT to come fix it!

394
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:49,719
You!

395
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,960
Go, check the other buildings.

396
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,559
Yes sir.

397
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,719
Korn.

398
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,480
Have you found out who hacked the gambling site?

399
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,480
We haven't found the hacker yet. We're still investigating.

400
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,559
How did this happen?

401
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,159
You used the profits to expand the server without informing the shareholders.

402
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,000
I've warned you about this before.

403
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,000
I need to inform the chairman.

404
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,039
No!

405
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,559
I'll take care of it.

406
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,639
I'll call you back when I'm free!

407
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,118
The director is ready to see you now.

408
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,119
Welcome.

409
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,880
Welcome.

410
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,519
A little too impatient, Korn.

411
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,280
Just started a new position from your father,

412
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,079
and already you've tanked the shares.

413
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,519
I did some investigating.

414
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,320
I know who the shareholder is that hired the hacker.

415
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,199
Who, uncle?

416
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,719
Mr. Wanchai.

417
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,800
So how should I proceed?

418
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,039
If you want to do it right,

419
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,320
you're going to have to talk to him.

420
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,639
About what the issue is.

421
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,039
And find an agreement.

422
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
But Wanchai has been causing trouble since who knows when.

423
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,480
So I found an easier solution for you.

424
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
What do you mean?

425
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,360
You have a lot to learn Korn.

426
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,360
No need to worry anymore.

427
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,639
Fah, do you know,

428
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,840
how your father took care of that shareholder?

429
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
I don't know.

430
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,320
And I don't want to know.

431
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,239
Don't think about it too much.

432
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,559
And if there's any other problems, you can call me.

433
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,400
Thank you.

434
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,199
I'm sorry to bother you.

435
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,760
I was in the area, and thought
I'd check and see how you're doing.

436
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,920
Do the police normally do house check-ins?

437
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,880
Well, not everyone.

438
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,880
I'm fine.

439
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,679
You don't have to worry.

440
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,280
And also, I want to assure you.

441
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,880
That I will find the person who killed your brother.

442
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,480
And then what?

443
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,079
He'll go through the judicial process
and sentenced to prison.

444
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,920
For intentional homicide.

445
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,320
I've seen murders before.

446
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,440
Most get just ten years.

447
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
In the end...

448
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,519
all get released.

449
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,880
This judicial process of yours.

450
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,480
Is there really justice?

451
00:44:59,079 --> 00:44:59,880
Well anyway,

452
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,039
thank you for the check up.
