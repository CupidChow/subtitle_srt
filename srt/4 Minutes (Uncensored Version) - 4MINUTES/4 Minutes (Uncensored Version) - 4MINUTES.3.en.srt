and created for entertainment purposes only. They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,679
Exactly like the previous corpse, Inspector.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,879
Found at the same place.

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,359
Also has an open wound on the head.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,399
If it's not a case of serial murder, then...

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,280
the victim must've been targeted for revenge.

9
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,680
How are you feeling?

10
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,878
I'm not your attending physician.

11
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,040
Great asked me to come and check on you.

12
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,719
What happened to me?

13
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,120
Great, your friend, said you were attacked
by another friend.

14
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,439
So he brought you to the ER.

15
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,360
Great...

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Great said that?

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
And when did Great show up?

18
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,759
From what I remember...

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
I was talking to Title.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,719
And...

21
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,479
Get some rest.

22
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,400
Let's think about that later, when you're feeling better.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Okay.

24
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,439
Hey, Bee.

25
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,159
Yes?

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,719
This is the chart for this bed.

27
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,120
Give me the chart for bed number 4.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,919
Chart...

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,599
Dr. Den has it.

30
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,919
Huh?

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,159
Did you intubate Ms. Nongnuch?

32
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,960
Yes.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,438
This morning, she had difficulty breathing.

34
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,758
And her oxygen levels dropped.

35
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,159
So I intubated her.

36
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,799
We talked about this before.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,438
That she didn't want to be intubated anymore.

38
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,679
It's painful.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,840
Oh, then what did you want me to do?

40
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,199
Let my patient die?

41
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,240
Tyme,

42
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,080
you're doing it again.

43
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,080
You see?

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,879
Even with the tube, she's still breathing like this.

45
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,759
This is the condition of someone who is about to die.

46
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,438
What you're doing isn't treatment.

47
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,360
But it’s just prolonging the inevitable.

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
I ordered the morphine already.

49
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,359
If she's still experiencing dyspnea,
you can administer the injection in doses.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
And most important,

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,719
this patient has a name.

52
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Her name is Ms. Nongnuch.

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,519
Text: Missed call.
Ton Kla.

54
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,919
Hey, what's up?

55
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,479
Hey, what time is it?

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,559
09:30.

57
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,719
Why the hell are you asking?

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,199
Look at your own watch.

59
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,319
Hello?

60
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
Hello Great?

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,519
Great?

62
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,240
It's nothing. Later.

63
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,920
Your assignment must be a minimum of 5 pages.

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,079
And when is it due?

65
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,399
Make sure to hand in your assignment by this Friday.

66
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,399
Class is dismissed for today.

67
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,160
Great?

68
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Oh, what's up Mod?

69
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,480
Someone asked me to give this to you.

70
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,958
Who?

71
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,519
Pale guy, very handsome.

72
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,240
Kinda brooding.

73
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,759
(Don't forget to treat your wound at the hospital.)

74
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,720
(Can you forgive me Great?)

75
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,120
(Don't forget to treat your wound at the hospital.)

76
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,519
Doctor.

77
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,040
Why didn't you call me first before coming?

78
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,879
I saw you were in class, so I didn't want to interrupt.

79
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,759
Then,

80
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,079
did you need anything?

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,518
I don't need anything.

82
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,839
Just reminding you to go get your wound treated.

83
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,160
So you came all the way to tell me?

84
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
And how did you know I liked Thai Tea?

85
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,360
I... asked your friends around here.

86
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,439
Which friend?

87
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,039
I don't know.

88
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,399
Some random person.

89
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,839
Doctor, you're...

90
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,839
kinda strange.

91
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
I just want to get to know you better.

92
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,240
If I'm being too strange...

93
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,199
Are you free this evening?

95
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,679
If you are, want to have dinner with me?

96
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
Let's do it another day.

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,279
I have an assignment due.

98
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,679
Okay.

99
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
Another day then.

100
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
Then,

101
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
I'm gonna go.

102
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,600
And also,

103
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,519
thank you for the Thai Tea.

104
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,039
Great.

105
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
I don't need anything.

106
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,360
Just reminding you to go get your wound treated.

107
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,720
Here we go again.

108
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,200
Huh?

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,240
Are you okay?

110
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,639
Remember when I asked you about seeing the future?

111
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,879
I remember.

112
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,559
It isn’t some psychiatric patient,

113
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,320
It's me.

114
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,519
I...

115
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,519
can see 4 minutes into the future.

116
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,399
What are the symptoms?

117
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,360
You know I like thai tea because
you asked my friend from Uni.

118
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,759
And you want to invite me to dinner.

119
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,200
I see images that never happened, flashing in my mind.

120
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,720
The times I see on a clock are also strange.

121
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,039
When I'm alone,

122
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,960
I'll see the time stuck at 11:01.

123
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,240
But when I'm with other people,

124
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
I see the time normally.

125
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,879
What kind of condition is this?

126
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm a surgeon.

127
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,120
I don’t diagnose conditions like this very often.

128
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,840
I’ll ask some of my expert, doctor friends about it.

129
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,399
I'll let you know if I get an answer.

130
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,199
For now, go get your wound treated and...

131
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,840
go home and rest.

132
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,639
I'll stop bothering you.

133
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
Thank you doctor.

134
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
You can call me Tyme.

135
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,440
That way, we can get closer.

136
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,120
If you need anything, call me anytime.

137
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Doctor.

138
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,799
Tyme.

139
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,399
After I get my wound treated,
let’s go grab something to eat.

140
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,159
Hey.

141
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,919
You want me to talk to the back of your head?

142
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,559
What the hell is wrong with you?

143
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,080
Ah, you're mad at me.

144
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,720
For intubating your patient, right?

145
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,879
Uh huh.

146
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,720
So what now? I have to make it up to you?

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,480
Whatever you want.

148
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,559
Den.

149
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
Am I your husband or what?

150
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,519
Do I have to guess what you want?

151
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,240
Don't need to be my husband to make it up to me.

152
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,320
Tell me.

153
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,200
That you're not going to do that anymore.

154
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm not going to do that anymore.

155
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,759
You're being a pain in the ass.

156
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Uh huh

157
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,480
Dr. Tyme.

158
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,679
What the hell do you want?

159
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,799
I'm not close with anyone in psych,
so I wanted to ask you first.

160
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,720
Have you ever met a patient that
can see the future, like accurately?

161
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,360
A fortune teller?

162
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,639
No, a regular person.

163
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,000
He sees distorted times on a clock, and also...

164
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,758
frequently sees images that didn't happen.

165
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,719
Head straight and then turn left
to the psych department, buddy.

166
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,960
It's not just that, damn it.

167
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
The future that he sees is very clear.

168
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,480
And he sees into the future...

169
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,080
4 minutes ahead.

170
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,759
What was that?

171
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,919
Sees 4 minutes into the future?

172
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,559
Uh huh, that's what he said.

173
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
Tyme.

174
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,120
Why are his symptoms just like the patient in my research?

175
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,559
But these symptoms happen in her brain when...

176
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,000
her heart stops.

177
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,960
Not exactly.

178
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,399
He's still normal.

179
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,039
Oh really?

180
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,360
Hey Tyme,

181
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,120
set up a meeting for your patient to talk to my patient.

182
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,000
Sounds good.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,879
Thanks so much.

184
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,720
Oh,

185
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,278
I have another question.

186
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,240
Yes?

187
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,120
You said that your patient...

188
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,360
only sees 4 minutes into the future
when their heart stops beating?

189
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,799
Yes.

190
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,799
Why 4 minutes?

191
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
Great.

192
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,120
Great.

193
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,679
Great.

194
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Are you okay?

195
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,120
You kinda spaced out just now.

196
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,278
Uh, I'm not hungry anymore.

197
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,439
Let's go over there.

198
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,080
Hey, go where?

199
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,360
Huh.

200
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,519
Here.

201
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,639
You wanna play?

202
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Uh huh.

203
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,759
And you're not hungry anymore?

204
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,159
Not that much.

205
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,200
Do you know how to play?

206
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,240
You need to get coins first.

207
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
I'll go get some.

208
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,320
Hm.

209
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,120
Okay.

210
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,080
Let's try.

211
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,679
Ah.

212
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,080
Listen to me.

213
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,118
Don't aim at the head, aim at the body.

214
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,839
And let the claw grip the neck.

215
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,240
Try again.

216
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,799
How do you know, are you good?

217
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,400
Nope.

218
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,759
I used to wonder how people could pick up so many.

219
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,680
So I looked up on how to do it.

220
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,680
Well, that’s fitting for a doctor.

221
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,000
Aim at -

222
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,799
I told you to aim for the body.

223
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,960
Here, let me show you.

224
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,960
Let me show you, and make sure to remember it. C'mon.

225
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,680
This one here.

226
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,319
Okay.

227
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,319
Hey.

228
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:46,720
Hey.

229
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,720
Hey!

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,640
Hey!

231
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Here it is.

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,079
You see?

233
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,559
I told you I looked it up on how to do it, and it worked.

234
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay, my turn.

235
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,359
Hey, put in the coin.

236
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,960
About here, should work.

237
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,640
Oh.

238
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,920
Hey, isn't it my turn?

239
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,720
No no no.

240
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,160
Oh.

241
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,039
Here's my house.

242
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,039
You live with just your grandma?

243
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,319
My mom and dad passed away when I was young.

244
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,279
Just us left.

245
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
Sounds like a tough situation.

246
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
It is tough.

247
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,880
Very tough.

248
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,039
So, I have to focus on passing the exams
and becoming a doctor.

249
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,319
I think being a doctor will make
my grandma and me wealthier.

250
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,359
For you, Great...

251
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,400
you probably can't understand my situation.

252
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,720
You see,

253
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,480
I do have money.

254
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,440
But I've never been happy.

255
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,319
How come?

256
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Before,

257
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,960
it was just my mom and me.

258
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,960
My dad's first wife committed suicide.

259
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,960
So, I moved into the main house
with my dad and older brother.

260
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,680
My parents kept getting wealthier and wealthier.

261
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,079
The time they had for me became less and less.

262
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,200
When I was a kid, I once asked to play the claw machine.

263
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,440
They told me.

264
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,759
It's a waste of time.

265
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
So they...

266
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,440
grabbed a toy worth thousands
from around there for me instead.

267
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,799
Now, I don't even know where I left it.

268
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,160
If you want to play the claw machine again,
just let me know.

269
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,279
I'll go with you.

270
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,440
Oh, I asked my colleague for you.

271
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,680
He said there's a patient with symptoms similar to you.

272
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,680
Really?

273
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,359
Uh huh.

274
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,240
Next time, I’ll arrange for my colleague
and his patient to meet you.

275
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,720
Okay!

276
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,000
Alright, I'm gonna go.

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,880
Oh, wait.

278
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
Take this with you.

279
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,880
I had a lot of fun today.

280
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,720
Thank you.

281
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,440
Thank you.

282
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,480
I'm going.

283
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,839
See you soon.

284
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,480
Text: Lt. Gen. Warit Wiriyachaidej, Bongkoch Artitarpronchai, Lt. Gen. Warit Wiriyachaidej

285
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,079
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,559
I'll kill you!

287
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm being captured. Help me!

288
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,119
Sir.

289
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,480
The phone won't turn on.

290
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,119
Go get it fixed so we can turn it on.

291
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,200
Yes sir.

292
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,160
I sent you the location.

293
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,759
Take Nan there.

294
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,479
We need to know.

295
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,799
Who did Nan send the information to.

296
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes sir.

297
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,240
Next time come with me.
I guarantee it’ll be delicious. For sure.

298
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,799
Right guys?

299
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,759
Chief.

300
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
What’s the status of the case in the swamp?

301
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,920
We are waiting for the forensic results, sir.

302
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,119
You don't need to handle this case anymore.

303
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll handle it from now on.

304
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,880
What do you mean, sir?

305
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,799
Send me everything you have by the end of today.

306
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,640
- But the case -
- No more!

307
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,759
This is an order.

308
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,159
Step away from this case.

309
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,839
And work on other cases.

310
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,720
Yes sir.

311
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,920
Chief.

312
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,640
Do I have to tell you?

313
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,319
Why do I put up with this shit.

314
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,798
Is there something wrong?

315
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,359
Um.

316
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm no longer handling your brother’s case.

317
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,759
Who will be handling it?

318
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
The chief will be handling it himself.

319
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,879
I don't know why all of a sudden -

320
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
I was ordered to stop.

321
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,240
I'm afraid you won't get an answer -

322
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,119
on who murdered your brother.

323
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
Is the chief not good?

324
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,720
I can't say it here.

325
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,839
You're okay, right?

326
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Yea.

327
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,680
Does anyone else live with you?

328
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,519
Relatives?

329
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,960
Or... partner?

330
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,440
No one.

331
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,680
Okay, here's the thing.

332
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,159
Chief Naret has a history of accepting bribes.

333
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,079
To manipulate the case to favor
the guilty party in the past.

334
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
And?

335
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,599
Have you checked your brother’s socials?

336
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,160
No, I haven't.

337
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,240
Why?

338
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,720
So I -

339
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,599
read every post and comment.

340
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,119
There's one comment from your brother's friend.

341
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,159
She said "Deep down -

342
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
everyone knows who did it."

343
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,640
I wanted to tell you that...

344
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,960
I won't give up on finding who killed your brother.

345
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,799
For you to help me this much.

346
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,119
What do you really want?

347
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,038
Because I want you to know,

348
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,480
- there are still cops -
- You like me?

349
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,558
I shouldn't be doing this.

350
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,920
You must still be grieving.

351
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,759
Fuck me raw?

352
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm on prep.

353
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,799
Let's use a condom, it'll be safer.

354
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,599
Lick my nipples.

355
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,519
Suck me.

356
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,159
I'm close.

357
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm close!

358
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,679
I'll go wash up.

359
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,400
Huh?

360
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,679
I didn't think you were like this.

361
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,159
Like what?

362
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,679
Like this.

363
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,079
Why?

364
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,719
You're gonna arrest me?

365
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,159
On what charges?

366
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,039
Sucking an official.

367
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,320
Can you,

368
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,679
stop by and keep me company more often?

369
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,880
Of course.

370
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,960
If I'm not tied up with work.

371
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,480
And when you need me, Ton Kla.

372
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,159
You can call me anytime.

373
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,519
Really?

374
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,320
Really.

375
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
And about your case...

376
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,719
I'm not going to give up that easily.

377
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,239
Excuse me.

378
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,760
Yes?

379
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,800
I’m the inspector working on
the case of the death of your friend.

380
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,279
I sent you a message.

381
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,119
But you never replied. So I came to see you.

382
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,800
I saw your comment and wanted to know
who you were referring to.

383
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
Oh.

384
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,360
I wasn't referring to anyone.

385
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,800
Did that person make you afraid to speak?

386
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,519
I don't know, really.

387
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,039
Please excuse me.

388
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,880
(If you don't stop prying, I'll kill you!)

389
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,559
(Exam day 11:00.)

390
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,480
(Saw an image before hitting her.)

391
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,320
(Bumped into Tyme and saw us having sex?)

392
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,920
(Saw an image of Tle hitting Dome.)

393
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,480
(Saw an image of Tle hitting Dome.)
- Tle, don't!

394
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,319
(Met Tyme at the condo at 11:01.)

395
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Then we should exchange Line IDs.

396
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,440
In case you... ever need help.

397
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,359
Hey, what time is it?

398
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,320
Why the hell are you asking?

399
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,880
Look at your own watch.

400
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,559
It's nothing. Later.

401
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,518
(Don't forget to treat your wound at the hospital.)

402
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,519
(Can you forgive me Great?)

403
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,440
(At a gallery, saw weird images and a woman.)

404
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
Tyme.

405
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,119
I want to meet the doctor who has a patient similar to me.

406
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,440
When can I come?

407
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,559
Ton Kla.

408
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,719
Sa-Marn.

409
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,840
What is it?

410
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,519
Nan's phone still hasn’t been repaired, Mr. Korn.

411
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,519
And she still won't talk.

412
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
Then I'll go talk to her myself.

413
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,559
Do not hurt her under any circumstances.

414
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,159
Understand?

415
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,320
Hm.

416
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,000
That's all.

417
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,039
Hey, thanks for coming man.

418
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,800
What's going on Great?

419
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,239
I can't stay long. I have to take care of something.

420
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,840
Remember what I told you about my strange symptoms?

421
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,360
You mean how you can see the future?

422
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
So right now,

423
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,519
the clock that I see when I'm alone,

424
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,639
is stuck.

425
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,199
At 11:02.

426
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,440
So go see a doctor.

427
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,480
It's not good to leave your symptoms untreated.

428
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,359
I've consulted with a doctor already.

429
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
He'll arrange a meeting with someone
who has similar symptoms.

430
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,319
But right now he's not responding.

431
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,879
- Won't pick up my call.
- Then change doctors.

432
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,800
Want me to find someone?

433
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,400
Ah.

434
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,199
- But.
- No but.

435
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,400
I'll make an appointment with a doctor I know.

436
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,960
Thank you.

437
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,719
Start without me.

438
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm going to use the bathroom real quick.

439
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,119
Where's Nan?

440
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,719
Who the hell are you?

441
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,639
I asked you where is Nan?

442
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,518
Where is Nan!

443
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:43,558
I asked...

444
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,639
Answer!

445
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,280
Hey!

446
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,440
Great!

447
00:44:57,441 --> 00:44:58,840
Don't let him escape!
