What the hell is the fuss about?

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,320
Damn it!

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,880
You wanna make all this noise, huh?

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,479
You’re making such a racket.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,479
Making all this noise.

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,920
Dad.

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,159
Dad!

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,438
Don't hurt it, Dad!

13
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,640
Mind your fucking business!

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,439
- Dad don't!
- You piece of shit!

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,119
Stay out of it.

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,119
- Don't!
- Dad.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Dad!

18
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,759
You dare stop me?!

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Hm, you bastered!

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,079
That's enough, Dad!

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,359
Let's go.

22
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,799
Let's go.

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,520
Come here.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
You fuck! Come here.

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,840
You ganging up on me?

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,120
Shit.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,959
I'm so sick of it.

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,319
Reporting to the police did fuck all.

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,239
They said to mediate since it’s a family matter.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,319
What fucking family?

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,719
How many times have you been hit?

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,319
How about this,

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,239
let's go file a police report again.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,400
But this time,

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,079
add animal cruelty charges too.

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,319
Filing a report...

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,599
won't do anything.

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,919
Shit!

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Dad?

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,199
Dad?

41
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,199
What happened, Ton Kla?

42
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,479
Dad got drunk and fell down the stairs.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,919
Ambulance.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
We have to call an ambulance.

45
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,039
You have to be patient.

46
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,400
Catch it slowly.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,800
Did you get it?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
I didn't, Dad.

49
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,439
Try again, try again.

50
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,560
Dad.

51
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,600
We're done here, you can go.

52
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,920
And about that clip,

53
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,680
is it the one who-

54
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,360
Do not tell anyone you found this clip.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,959
If you do,

56
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,000
I will consider you obstructing the officer's work.

57
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,399
Let's go, son.

58
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,279
We'll take our leave.

59
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,399
C'mon. Let's go.

60
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,959
- Is it ready?
- Thank you.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,600
It's ready.

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,319
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

63
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,959
Oh, Won.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,639
Oh, Inspector.

65
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
What's up, just finished work?

66
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:15,720
Ugh.

67
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,040
Not yet.

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,719
Work is like a wife.

69
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,039
You want to quit, but you can't.

70
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
Because you love it.

71
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,959
Some water?

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,199
Oh, thankyou, I'm parched.

73
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Refreshing.

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,758
I want to know the DNA results -

75
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,160
from the fingerprints on the rock.

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,480
Hey, hey, wait a sec.

77
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
You're not working on this case anymore.

78
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
But since I found it, I should get to know.

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,079
The bloodstains match the body.

80
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,799
And the fingerprints on the rock match Mr. Title's.

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
The chief's son.

82
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,639
A classmate of the deceased.

83
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,000
We’re being pressured to alter the test results.

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,879
So Title is the one who killed Dome, right?

85
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,120
I think you should look into other surrounding evidence.

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,439
But you have to be careful, Inspector.

87
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,639
Don't worry about me.

88
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
Thank you so much for the info.

89
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,240
Let's catch a football game soon.

90
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,800
Anytime, Inspector.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,839
I'll bring the beer.

92
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,959
See you.

93
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,959
Here it is.

94
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,240
The clip from the night of March 18th.

95
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Okay.

96
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,360
Then I'd like the video file.

97
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Yes sir.

98
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,240
Wait.

99
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,080
Did you show me an edited clip?

100
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,759
Not edited sir.

101
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,879
Then what's that? A ghost?

102
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,519
You do know, right?

103
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,559
That presenting false evidence to the police like this...

104
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,279
can land you in jail.

105
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm sorry sir.

106
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,480
I'll show you the original clip right now.

107
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,840
You fucking smartass.

108
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,440
Bastard.

109
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,919
C'mere Dome, you little shit.

110
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Think you're so smart, huh?

111
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,399
Think you're so smart, huh?!

112
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,919
Go to hell you fucking bastard!

113
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,959
Give me this file.

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,080
Yes sir.

115
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,559
Here.

116
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,399
(Win)

117
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,759
Hello?

118
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,480
I have the forensic evidence from the CCTV footage.

119
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,559
I know who the killer is.

120
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,080
Who?

121
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,559
A guy named Title.

122
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,960
A classmate of Dome's.

123
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,999
Knowing this much,

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,679
can't we just issue an arrest warrant?

125
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,440
If we can't use the law,

126
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,799
we'll use the media and social media to apply pressure.

127
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,600
I’ve already scheduled a journalist I know.

128
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,480
Believe me, Ton Kla.

129
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,679
Dome will get his justice.

130
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,399
Go!

131
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,440
Go.

132
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,159
Please go wait outside.

133
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,200
Can I talk to him for a moment?

134
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,840
Just a quick moment.

135
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,120
Okay.

136
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,120
What happened?

137
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,960
Someone took the evidence.

138
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,079
I got shot a little.

139
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
Just a graze, nothing serious.

140
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,600
By who?

141
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,639
It could be...

142
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,440
Title's Dad's guys.

143
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,759
Did you back up the files?

144
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,840
I didn't get a chance to back anything up.

145
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,799
Ton Kla, don't give up just yet.

146
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,559
After I'm finished here,

147
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,399
I'll go find new evidence.

148
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,359
How many have you caught?

149
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,400
About 10, Dad.

150
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,920
Try counting them.

151
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,559
Look like there are more then 10.

152
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,639
A lot of money right here.

153
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,519
Look at these crabs.

154
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:53,960
Hello.

155
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,279
Hi, hello there.

156
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,240
Are you from around here?

157
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,319
Yes.

158
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,759
My house is right across from here.

159
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,119
Oh.

160
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,000
That's good.

161
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,960
Do you know about the murder here?

162
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,640
Yes, I know.

163
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
My son and I had nightmares for weeks.

164
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,160
It happened very close to our house.

165
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm the brother of the person who was killed.

166
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,200
Police haven't found any evidence or the killer yet.

167
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,079
So I came to gather more info.

168
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,359
Did you notice anything unusual that night?

169
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,440
Um, I didn't see anything at all.

170
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,839
My house is close,

171
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,960
but it was quiet, just like it usually is.

172
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,000
Dad, he should know.

173
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,039
Know what?

174
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,079
Don't start trouble.

175
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,039
(Title, Rapheephat Thiyaamornchai)

176
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,240
Have you been able to reach Great?

177
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,759
Not yet, but I think he's at the condo.

178
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,119
We need to go now, Chairman.

179
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,839
Or we won't make it across the border.

180
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,839
Korn, come here.

181
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,119
At the investment department,

182
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,039
there's a hidden room behind the wooden cabinet.

183
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,680
In there, there's cash.

184
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,680
And a phone with all our partners' contacts on it.

185
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,079
Find Great.

186
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,640
Destroy the phone.

187
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,960
Get the money, find Great, and follow us.

188
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,599
Okay.

189
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,680
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

190
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,039
- Sure, Officer.
- Okay.

191
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,799
Excuse me?

192
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,799
What happened here?

193
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,240
Someone's been shot.

194
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,240
Who?

195
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,200
The young man, who's the owner.

196
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,440
All set. Thanks for your time in today’s interview.

197
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,839
Thank you.

198
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,680
- Oh.
- Hello.

199
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,440
Ms. Lukwa.

200
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,759
Hello.

201
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,480
Are you here for a heart check-up today?

202
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,240
Not really.

203
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,079
I came specifically to see you today.

204
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,880
Are you free right now?

205
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,839
Oh.

206
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,640
I am.

207
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,359
I just finished interviewing the last patient.

208
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,160
Some snacks.

209
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,440
Wow.

210
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,000
You brought more snacks.

211
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,920
I've gotten so fat, my coat is tight now.

212
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
Aw, you don't look fat at all.

213
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,279
You look great right now.

214
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,160
Very cute.

215
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,240
Okay, let's eat some snacks.

216
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,399
The real reason I came today,

217
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
is because I just thought of another thing.

218
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,440
Um, I'm sorry for only remembering a few things at a time.

219
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
I understand.

220
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,799
Memories from that time probably felt more like a dream.

221
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,440
It's not unusual to remember some things but not others.

222
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,160
I've been thinking,

223
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,559
about how I came out of seeing 4 minutes in the future.

224
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,920
Because if I didn't come to my senses,

225
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,400
I would've been stuck there forever.

226
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,839
And in the real world,

227
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,279
I would probably be dead.

228
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,880
So,

229
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,039
what brought you back, then?

230
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,200
My boyfriend's voice.

231
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,960
Oh,

232
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,279
I see.

233
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,559
Your boyfriend's voice.

234
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,440
Ah.

235
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,160
Yes.

236
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,240
Because,

237
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,599
hearing is the last sense that...

238
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,079
we experience before death.

239
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,078
Especially if it's the voice of a loved one,

240
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,960
it would have an even greater impact.

241
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,440
Is that so?

242
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,519
Luckily my partner and I hadn't broken up then.

243
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,440
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here right now.

244
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,599
Is it good?

245
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,200
Hmhmm.

246
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:48,240
Let me try.

247
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,720
Is it good?

248
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,720
Hmhmm.

249
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,640
Bee,

250
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,759
- What?
- What are you eating?

251
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,039
Cantalope, it's good.

252
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,440
- Want some?
- C'mon share, is it sweet?

253
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,880
Very sweet.

254
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,359
Want some?

255
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,519
Can I have the rest?

256
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,559
Um, of course.

257
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,119
- Can I eat the rest?
- Sure, buy me a new one tomorrow.

258
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,839
Ten boxes.

259
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,839
I'll buy all of them.

260
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,119
I just ate one piece.

261
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,079
I'll get ten boxes back.

262
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,799
Please clear the way.

263
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,359
Hey.

264
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,480
Huh?

265
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,720
That's that guy.

266
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,559
Uh.

267
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,480
Patient's blood pressure is dropping.

268
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:43,519
Check inotrope, stat.

269
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,519
- Yes doctor.
- Get the blood bags.

270
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,640
Load the IV and start inotrope.

271
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,440
Go get Dr. Somsak.

272
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,440
People like you...

273
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,640
all deserve to fucking rot in hell, you bastard!

274
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,318
From what you said about Great getting shot,

275
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,960
It's not your fault at all, man.

276
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,960
But I treated him so badly.

277
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,559
I feel awful seeing him like that. You get it?

278
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,319
I wanna say...

279
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,880
don't blame yourself, man.

280
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:33,399
Some things are beyond our control.

281
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,839
It's not that.

282
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,759
Every decision was under my control.

283
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:41,838
And after I've made a decision,

284
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,480
I can't go back and fix it.

285
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,880
And it’ll haunt me until the day I die.

286
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,000
Dude,

287
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,680
but sometimes,

288
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,240
we might have a chance,

289
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,799
to resolve any lingering feelings.

290
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,119
What do you mean?

291
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm gonna go grab something.

292
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,759
I'll be right back.

293
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,440
While you wait, you can read through my research.

294
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,400
Be right back.

295
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,519
Can you forgive me, Great?

296
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,279
When you're all better,

297
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,200
let's go out for a meal together.

298
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,960
Okay, Great?

299
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,960
Hello?

300
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Grandma, you're still at Aunt Ging’s house?

301
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,359
Yes.

302
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,799
There's nothing wrong, right, Grandma?

303
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,480
I don't think so.

304
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,599
Okay, so...

305
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,480
It's here.

306
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:14,559
- It's here.
- I'm coming to see you.

307
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,440
Ah.

308
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,039
Braised pork with fish sauce.

309
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,680
Aunt Ging's cooking looks delicious, doesn't it?

310
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,119
Hmhmm.

311
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,799
She also made an omlete.

312
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,519
Grandma, if you're hungry,

313
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,799
just start eating.

314
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,279
No, we have to wait for you.

315
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,000
Grandma,

316
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,440
don't forget to lock the doors.

317
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:56,185
Hello, Dr. Tyme.

318
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,880
We've never met before, have we?

319
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,720
Although I don't think there's any need to.

320
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,680
Because,

321
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm going to kill you like I did with your grandma.

322
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,480
And your mom and dad.

323
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,559
I'll tell you, for some good karma.

324
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,240
So you won't come back as a ghost and haunt me.

325
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,920
I was the one who ordered to kill your parents.

326
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,960
Should've had you killed as well.

327
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,439
Shouldn’t have let you grow up and damage -

328
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,960
my business this much.

329
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,599
If there's nothing else,

330
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,000
that's it for now, Dr. Tyme.

331
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
Looks like you have a guest.

332
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,559
Oh, it has legs too?

333
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,559
I didn’t know you could split the legs out like that.

334
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,719
I've known for a long time.

335
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,118
Wow,

336
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,039
I didn't know at all.

337
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,480
How do you play?

338
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,239
Fight each other.

339
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,480
Go ahead.

340
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,079
Oh, hi.

341
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,720
Daddy.

342
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Let me weigh you.

343
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,559
One kiss on the cheek.

344
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,119
Let me talk to mom real quick, Great.

345
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,359
- Okay.
- Okay.

346
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,359
Go, go play in your room.

347
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,480
Oh, be careful.

348
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,240
I missed you.

349
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,799
Are you tired?

350
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,200
You must be tired.

351
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,360
Is something wrong?

352
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,960
The business is having issues.

353
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,280
I need money to restore the business.

354
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,519
But Korn's mom,

355
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,000
couldn't help me at all.

356
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,840
I really want to sign the divorce papers.

357
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,519
Let's take it easy.

358
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,239
I think I can help you.

359
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,840
How can you help me?

360
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,840
Um, it's that...

361
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,480
I know a few investors.

362
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,000
I’ll arrange for them to meet with you.

363
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,639
Let's try.

364
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,679
Hm.

365
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,320
Hello.

366
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,320
This is Mr. Pakorn. And this is Mrs. Amornrat.

367
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,639
They own several gambling dens at the border.

368
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,800
This is Mr. Chanin.

369
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,599
Have you found an office yet?

370
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:57,960
Yes, we have.

371
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,840
Let’s go inside and discuss the details.

372
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,440
- Please come in.
- Please.

373
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,159
Tyme.

374
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,920
Come.

375
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,440
This is Tyme.

376
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,239
My son.

377
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,400
- Hello, hello.
- Hello there.

378
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,760
He's adorable.

379
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,679
Please come in.

380
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,719
Come.

381
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,880
This way.

382
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,719
Want some?

383
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,480
No, no, no.

384
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,480
Playing a game?

385
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,360
Come sit, so you can see.

386
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,559
I died.

387
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,920
You lost.

388
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,800
Oh, what's the matter?

389
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,679
Let's go back and wait for our parents.

390
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,440
It's okay. Let's go.

391
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,360
Come, come.

392
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,440
This one.

393
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,679
And this one, and this one.

394
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,880
- Just like that.
- I can't see.

395
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Having fun?

396
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,360
My sources say the gambling dens they own are being investigated.

397
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,559
There’s a chance it could lead to us.

398
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,519
What are you going to do?

399
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,920
Leave it up to me.

400
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,480
You're not going to kill them, are you?

401
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,599
Warit, don't do it.

402
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,320
Mom.

403
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,639
Let me leave Tyme here with you.

404
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,480
Right now I'm not safe.

405
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,719
Mom, where are you going?

406
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,000
Tyme.

407
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,760
Stay here with Grandma.

408
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,679
I'll come back and get you soon.

409
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,639
Who's doing this to you?

410
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,199
Tyme.

411
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,719
Mom!

412
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,679
Patient is experiencing stiffness and blood pressure has dropped.

413
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,118
What were his vital signs?

414
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,759
His vital signs were normal.

415
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,480
Load the IV and start inotrope now.

416
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,119
The patient’s EKG shows VF.

417
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,238
I need 200 joules of defibrillation, stat.

418
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:27,960
Yes doctor.

419
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:41,840
Charge.

420
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,039
Clear.

421
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,760
Clear.

422
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,599
Everyone clear.

423
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,679
Shock!

424
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:50,880
Tyme, are you back?

425
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,519
I'm back.

426
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,198
Hmm.

427
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:03,039
Braised pork with fish sauce again?

428
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,879
Again?

429
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,920
Tired? Don't want it?

430
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,038
No, I can eat it.

431
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:11,639
Okay, very good.

432
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,559
Oh.

433
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,239
Tyme go grab -

434
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,159
the measuring cup for me, it’s on the top shelf.

435
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,440
I can't reach it.

436
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,039
Shelf? Shelf where?

437
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,000
That shelf.

438
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:25,319
- Oh, right here?
- Uh huh.

439
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,558
Use your height to your advantage.

440
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:27,559
Okay, okay.

441
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,880
(Tyme, mom and dad are sorry)

442
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:55,840
Tyme.

443
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,559
Grandma.

444
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,719
What is this?

445
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,119
Your mom's diary.

446
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,000
Why haven't you showed them to me?

447
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,199
Because I know,

448
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,199
that it won't change anything.

449
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,039
But this is my mom, Grandma.

450
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,639
I'll give you a choice.

451
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,480
Put the diary back where you found it,

452
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,880
or keep it.
