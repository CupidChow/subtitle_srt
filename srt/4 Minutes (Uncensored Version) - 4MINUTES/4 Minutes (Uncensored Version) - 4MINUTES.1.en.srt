1
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,399
Patient is experiencing stiffness and blood pressure has dropped doctor.

2
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,999
What were his vital signs?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,480
His vital signs were normal.

4
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,478
Load the IV and start inotrope.

5
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,479
Yes doctor.

6
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,519
Vital signs are stable doctor.

7
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,079
I'm going to order a blood test.

8
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,840
Get me his chart.

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,560
Yes doctor.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,280
The patient is coding.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,319
I need a 200 joules cardiac shock, quickly.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,879
Machine's here.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,959
Ready doctor.

14
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,200
Charge

15
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,280
Clear

16
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,120
Clear

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,959
Everyone clear.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,640
Yes doctor.

19
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,639
Why the hell are you calling me?

20
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,599
You told me to call and wake you up for the exam.

21
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,840
I did?

22
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,680
Well, yeah.

23
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,439
Last night, you really went overboard Great.

24
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,800
Get your ass up and come help me.

25
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,159
Shit, I can't go. I have a headache.

26
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,800
If you have a headache, just take some damn paracetamol.

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,160
If you miss another exam, we won't graduate together.

28
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,759
See you at 1pm at Uni, that's it.

29
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
Shit, why can't I fucking breathe?

30
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,839
I'm here dad.

31
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,040
You're five minutes late.

32
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,279
I'm sorry.

33
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
I was busy talking to a client.

34
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,680
Sit down.

35
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
I have something important to talk to you about.

36
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,200
If it's about the latest shipment of goods,

37
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,440
and the weight problem,

38
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,038
I already cleared it with transport.

39
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,919
It's not about that.

40
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,120
I want you to take over our investment department.

41
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Investment department?

42
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,679
Our company has that?

43
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,240
I've never seen it in the company's structure before.

44
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,120
Investment department?

45
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,639
It's the backbone of our company.

46
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Revenue from logistics is part of it.

47
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,519
But the reason why we've so successful...

48
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,440
is because of this department.

49
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,279
Its become our primary revenue generator.

50
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,080
What about the transportation department that I'm doing?

51
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll find someone else to take over.

52
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,639
Today,

53
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,279
I want you to start working at the office.

54
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,679
If you have any questions ask someone named Sa-Marn.

55
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,480
Sa-Marn has managed the invesment department since day one.

56
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,080
Because I see your potential,

57
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,960
it has to be you,

58
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,720
who will take over this department after me.

59
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,639
I will not disappoint you.

60
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,559
Okay

61
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,960
Get going.

62
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Korn

63
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,279
Have you talked to your dad about the invesment department?

64
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,759
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,439
Work hard.

66
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,759
This department is very important to the company.

67
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,240
If you do well, your dad will be relieved.

68
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,159
Yes

69
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,559
Excuse me, I need to get back to work.

70
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,159
Okay

71
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,240
I made the right decision, right?

72
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,759
To have him take over our secret operations?

73
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,399
You made the right decision.

74
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,679
It has to be someone like Korn, to be able to handle it.

75
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,000
As to the position he was in,

76
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,440
I'll have Great take over.

77
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,960
Once he finishes the exam,

78
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,279
I'll have him start.

79
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,279
It'll depend if you'll have any issues bringing him.

80
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,559
Hm

81
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,919
He doesn't even like to come home.

82
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,799
Why the hell are you calling? I'm on my way.

83
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm just calling to ask you something.

84
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,879
Do you have an extra calculator?

85
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,200
I forgot to bring mine.

86
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,558
What the hell! Of all the days to forget, you forget today?

87
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,720
Stop yelling at me.

88
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,519
I know you have two calculators.

89
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,798
I don't know if I brought my backup.

90
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,600
Let me look.

91
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,080
I didn't bring it.

92
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,120
Fuck

93
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,639
Who can I borrow from?

94
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,840
I don't know dumbass, I'm going to be late.

95
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,679
What now?

96
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,360
No one will let me borrow theirs.

97
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,080
Can you buy one for me?

98
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,638
Where am I supposed to buy one Tle?

99
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm not going to make it on time.

100
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,559
Holy fuck!

101
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,840
Shit! What was that noise?

102
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,320
Car accident?

103
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,639
Great?

104
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,960
Hello? Great?

105
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,600
Hey, hello??

106
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,000
Hello?

107
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,119
What did you say Great?

108
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,440
So you have an extra calculator or what?

109
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,119
Hello? Do you hear me?

110
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,960
Hello?

111
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,159
Hello Great?

112
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,600
Hey

113
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Hey ma'am.

114
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,519
Are you okay?

115
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,798
I'll call an ambulance for you.

116
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,720
Don't.

117
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,120
Leave... leave me here.

118
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
How can I leave you here?

119
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,159
Hello?

120
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,879
I'd like to report a car accident where someone got hit.

121
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,240
Hello

122
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
Were you the driver?

123
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,360
Peek-a-boo, Bee!

124
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh! Dr. Den!

125
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,759
You scared me.

126
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,200
Yes?

127
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,919
How can I help you?

128
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,480
I'm free.

129
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,038
So I thought I'd come here and gossip.

130
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,960
Dr. Den!

131
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,119
Never say...(free)...

132
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,600
in my ER.

133
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,878
It's a forbidden word. It'll jinx our shift.

134
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,759
Whoa Bee.

135
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
I think we should stop being so superstitious.

136
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,720
This kind of thing isn't about science at all.

137
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,399
Like what's an auspicious shirt color,

138
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,279
or not eating fried chicken in the ward.

139
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,440
It makes life...

140
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,720
so difficult.

141
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,599
Doctor Den.

142
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,519
Don't disrespect it even if you don't believe it.

143
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,759
There you go.

144
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,079
What case?

145
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,239
Accident.

146
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,039
Go

147
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,679
Hello Doctor Tyme, my dear friend.

148
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,879
Did you bother Bee again?

149
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,319
Well, Isn't fem-med doctor suppose to be everywhere?

150
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,598
It's so messed up when I was at the ER shift.

151
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,480
What's the case?

152
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,879
Patient is female 53 years old.

153
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,119
Got hit by a car 15 minutes ago.

154
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,720
Nothing significant found in the primary survey.

155
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,799
Abdominal tenderness with generalized guarding.

156
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,480
Ultrasound revealed intra-abdominal bleeding.

157
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,839
I think we need to...

158
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,720
huh?

159
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
Get the ultrasound machine.

160
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,079
Huh?

161
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,039
I told you I...

162
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,079
Get it.

163
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,680
Here

164
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,039
Take it.

165
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,200
Take this.

166
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,960
Okay

167
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,758
Probably need to set up the OR Emergency.

168
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,359
Let me call Dr. Komson first.

169
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,720
Doctor

170
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,240
I don't have money to pay for treatment.

171
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,240
You need emergency surgery.

172
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,680
I can use emergency benefits.

173
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,079
Actually

174
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,680
I intentionally...

175
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,599
walked in front of the car.

176
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,279
Why did you do that?

177
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,200
I don't want to live anymore.

178
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,558
You have intra-abdominal bleeding.

179
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,119
If we don't operate now, it might get worse.

180
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
That's fine.

181
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,960
I want to die anyway.

182
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,079
You can die wherever you want...

183
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,799
but not here.

184
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,799
Do you understand?

185
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
Mrs. Manee, do you have any relatives?

186
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,240
Yes

187
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes

188
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,880
I have one son

189
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,000
But...

190
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,400
he doesn't live with me anymore.

191
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,720
I understand your problem is probably quite serious.

192
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,799
But if your son found out you refused any help.

193
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,880
He would probably be very sad.

194
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,359
Give us an opportunity to help you.

195
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,839
Let's try to overcome this together.

196
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,039
Doctor

197
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
There's a case from the ER. Please prepare the OR now.

198
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,240
Today I'm going to let you operate.

199
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,880
Are you ready?

200
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,240
Ready

201
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,720
Scalpel

202
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,039
Clamps

203
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,240
You've really improved, Tyme.

204
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,599
Thank you.

205
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,640
You can suture.

206
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,719
The next patient isn't here yet.

207
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,960
Go eat first.

208
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,200
Let me go finish writing off-note first doctor.

209
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,999
Oh, by the way.

210
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,358
Do you have any plans -

211
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,838
after your surgical training,

212
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,119
where you're going to work?

213
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,200
Not yet.

214
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,200
Would you be interested in becoming
a medical instructor here?

215
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,838
I think after I finish training,

216
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm going to work at a private hospital.

217
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,119
Being a medical instructor here,

218
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,839
doesn't prohibit you from also
working at a private hospital.

219
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,400
Many doctors do that.

220
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,118
Thank you for asking me.

221
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,279
But I probably won't change my mind.

222
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,119
Excuse me.

223
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,559
Hello doctor.

224
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,960
Hey, Tyme!

225
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,599
You just came out of the OR?

226
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,599
Uh huh.

227
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,799
And Manee? How is she?

228
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,319
Who?

229
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,599
The woman who got hit and didn't want your help.

230
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,880
Aren't we on the same case?

231
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,359
The surgery is done. Went well.

232
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,839
You should try to remember your patients' names, Tyme.

233
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
Hm

234
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,599
What are you carrying?

235
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,599
My secret research.

236
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,880
I've never told anyone outside the department before.

237
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,799
But I'm telling you first.

238
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,480
Really?

239
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,759
Oh, what is it?

240
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,880
What the hell are you doing?

241
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,319
I -

242
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,279
kept -

243
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,358
information on patient experiences -

244
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,599
that had a cardiac arrest before.

245
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,039
Cool right?

246
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,599
That's interesting.

247
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,680
Of course it is.

248
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,200
I'll use a larger sample size than in past research.

249
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,680
I guarantee.

250
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,319
My research.

251
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,319
Will definitely be published internationally.

252
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,119
Wicked right?

253
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,119
What?

254
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,400
I'll leave you alone. Got your hands full with the girlfriend.

255
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,960
Later buddy.

256
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,680
Hello

257
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
Hello Mr. Korn.

258
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
You are...

259
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,039
Sa-Marn?

260
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,160
Yes sir.

261
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,200
Come with way please.

262
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,799
Locked from the outside?

263
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,079
Yes sir.

264
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,680
You don't have to worry Mr. Korn.

265
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,519
I made a spare key for you.

266
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Here

267
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,359
Sir

268
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:34,799
This is it?

269
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,359
That my father said is the backbone of the company?

270
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes sir.

271
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,839
This is where we can make millions in minutes.

272
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,239
From where?

273
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,038
Right here. Online gambling.

274
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,839
We have three casinos at the border.

275
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm sure you'll get to visit.

276
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
This way.

277
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,519
Hey, you.

278
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,839
What's the total so far this month?

279
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,640
Almost there.

280
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,039
You better make it happen.

281
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
This way.

282
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,400
Here is our shareholder information.

283
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
And all of our earnings and expenses.

284
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,119
You should find time to take a look at them.

285
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,240
Who let you in?

286
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,400
Sorry

287
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,640
Get out!

288
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,919
Yes

289
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,079
Yes I can.

290
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,279
I'll fix it and get it back to you right away.

291
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,039
When do you need it?

292
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,039
By tomorrow?

293
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,078
Okay

294
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,319
Alright, sir. Goodbye.

295
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,599
Korn

296
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,880
You didn't tell me you were coming.

297
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,759
I miss you.

298
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,720
I'm all wet.

299
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,400
Some water.

300
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm...

301
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,359
going to get back to work.

302
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,799
You don't have to work.

303
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,599
Is the money I gave you not enough?

304
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,160
It's not like that.

305
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,440
I have to work too.

306
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Why so stressed?

307
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,319
You look so grumpy.

308
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Hm?

309
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,519
My dad asked me to take over
an important part of the company.

310
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,640
But it's a department that I didn't even know existed.

311
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,799
So I felt a little bad.

312
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,680
Because it's like I don't know anything about the company.

313
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,239
But I'm glad.

314
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,559
That my dad trusts me.

315
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,680
So I want to make sure it goes well.

316
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,359
But it's very challening.

317
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,400
And... risky.

318
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,279
This job...

319
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,839
What kind of job?

320
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,519
Hm

321
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,960
It'll be alright, Korn.

322
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,680
When you start something new.

323
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,319
It'll always be challenging.

324
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Just stay strong and keep going.

325
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:20,960
You'll get good at it.

326
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,920
When you get good at it, It'll be easy.

327
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,440
Right? Ha.

328
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,079
You're so good, Ton Kla.

329
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,759
Hearing you talk always makes me feel better.

330
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,640
I'm not only good at talking.

331
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,720
Can you fuck me raw?

332
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,119
I really want to feel it.

333
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,079
Does it hurt?

334
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,480
It's fine. Keep going.

335
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
Did you finish?

336
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,800
I'll help you.

337
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,960
It's okay.

338
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:21,719
I can't be the only one who finishes.

339
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,039
Fuck.

340
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,320
I'm close.

341
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,119
I'm close!

342
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Thank you.

343
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,880
Another round?

344
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,599
Hello

345
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,239
Yes

346
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:32,960
I'm sorry sir.

347
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm with Fasai.

348
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh, yes dad.

349
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,519
Tonight Fasai is having dinner with uncle Warit.

350
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,440
Yes sir. I'll leave now.

351
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,760
I'll leave now.

352
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,679
Yes sir.

353
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,840
I'm sorry.

354
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,639
My dad wants me to go home now.

355
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,280
For dinner.

356
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,559
It's alright.

357
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,440
You go ahead.

358
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
I'll see you next time.

359
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,119
I cleared it with the police.

360
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,199
Luckily she didn't die.

361
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,719
When will you stop screwing up
and force me to clean up your mess.

362
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Great

363
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Huh?

364
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,239
It was just an accident.

365
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:09,719
We're lucky Great isn't hurt.

366
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,519
Tomorrow I'm going to order flowers
and have you bring them to her.

367
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,760
And don't forget to take a picture.

368
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,239
I don't think we need to take a picture.

369
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
No.

370
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,559
Take a picture for evidence.

371
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,840
So other people can't say we're not taking
any responsibility.

372
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,239
Bon Appetit.

373
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Drop me here.

374
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,198
I can walk to the building myself.

375
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,159
Are you sure?

376
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,598
Yes. See you later.

377
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,400
Okay.

378
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,000
How can it be 11 o'clock already?

379
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,199
Wait

380
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,119
Huh?

381
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,519
I'm sorry.

382
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,800
It's nothing.

383
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,480
How many times have I told you to stop.

384
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
I don't like it.

385
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
I'm not smoking it in your face.

386
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,760
I know. But you know it's not good for you.

387
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,000
It's a bad habit.

388
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:32,840
Are you okay?

389
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,760
The clock on my phone was acting strange.

390
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,119
But it's fine now.

391
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,679
So many times today.

392
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,119
Looks fine to me.

393
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,159
Why is everything so weird today.

394
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,840
When I crashed my car,

395
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,079
I saw the future that I was going to hit someone.

396
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,039
The clock I saw looked all strange and distorted.

397
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,440
What do you mean you saw the future?

398
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,400
I...

399
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,480
saw a vision that I was going to hit someone.

400
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:18,880
Are you on drugs?

401
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,519
No!

402
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,639
Nevermind.

403
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:26,480
I think...

404
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,039
you should get some rest.

405
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,000
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.

406
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,079
And...

407
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,679
stop drinking for a bit.

408
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,320
Then let's see how you feel.

409
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,119
Are you trying to say I'm hallucinating?

410
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,960
Not like that.

411
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,039
Maybe you're stressed.

412
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,400
Not enough sleep.

413
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:53,639
I'm sorry.

414
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,400
That I haven't had enough time for you lately.

415
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,239
But I'm worried about you.

416
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,480
Just one more year left of school.

417
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,039
I want you to take life a bit more seriously.

418
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,599
What's so funny?

419
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,840
You're sounding more like dad everyday.

420
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:14,480
No I'm not.

421
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,679
It is more than enough to have one person like father.

422
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,239
And one mother too.

423
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,800
True.

424
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,559
Do you miss your mom?

425
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,159
I do.

426
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:38,760
But it was a long time ago.

427
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,880
I see.

428
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,679
Because you're old now.

429
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,119
Who's old?

430
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,199
We're only a few years apart.

431
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:53,759
Hey hey.

432
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Well, I didn't finish the other cigarette.

433
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:56,880
Just one puff.

434
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:58,280
Unbelievable! Right in front of me.

435
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:02,239
Give it to me.

436
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:03,599
Okay okay.

437
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:40,800
Grandma!

438
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,879
Tyme!

439
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,598
Don't sneak up on me like that.
I almost had a heart attack.

440
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:48,639
Oh grandma don't have one yet.

441
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,800
Of course

442
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,960
Now that you're here...

443
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:53,000
let's crochet.

444
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:54,440
Coachella?

445
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:55,678
No wait.

446
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:56,360
Knitting

447
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:56,760
Knitting

448
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:57,840
- Knitting
- Coachella what?

449
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,679
It's ready.

450
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,280
Did you take your diabetes medication yet?

451
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:22,760
Oh I forgot. I haven't yet.

452
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,079
Don't forget grandma.

453
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,719
Your blood sugar has been high lately.

454
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,119
The diabetic ulcer on your foot still hasn't healed.

455
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,078
You'll have your foot cut off.

456
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,440
That's fine by me.

457
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,960
I'm overweight anyway.

458
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,320
I'm going to book an operating room for you. So stubborn.

459
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,280
You like to taste the desserts.

460
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,480
Well,

461
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,359
I make desserts. I have to taste them.

462
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,480
If I don't and they don't taste good
I won't have any customers.

463
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,960
It'll ruin my reputation.

464
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:52,800
Hm

465
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,320
Right? You like them too?

466
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:56,320
Uh huh

467
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,239
Just wait a little longer grandma.

468
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,079
I'm about to become a surgeon.

469
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,599
I'll become a rich doctor and
work shifts to earn a lot of money.

470
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,480
And make our lives better.

471
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:15,199
I want you to be happy.

472
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,079
Like before...

473
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:19,880
Don't complain.

474
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,199
I won't listen.

475
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,320
It'll raise your blood pressure.

476
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,440
Hm

477
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Hard

478
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,159
Let's eat.

479
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,719
Not eating grandma's food? Not tasty?

480
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,880
When did I say that?

481
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
At the time, I didn't feel anything.

482
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,639
Everything was black.

483
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,199
I didn't see or hear anything.

484
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:54,840
The next thing I knew, I woke up in the ICU.

485
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:57,440
I was intubated already.

486
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,159
I saw a bright light from above.

487
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,480
Heard medical instruments around me.

488
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,759
And then I felt like I -

489
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,360
floated to the ceiling.

490
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,920
When I looked back down.

491
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:17,000
I saw myself on the operating table.

492
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,879
I felt like I fell into a temple or a market.

493
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,639
But the people there -

494
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,920
were all wearing white.

495
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,280
The white outfit wasn't a nurse's uniform?

496
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,399
No

497
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,719
They were like Brahmin nuns.

498
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,480
And you practice religion regularly, Mrs. Nuan?

499
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,079
Yes doctor.

500
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,280
The elevator door is closing.

501
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,360
The elevator door is closing.

502
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,039
Why didn't anything happen to me?

503
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,280
Excuse me,

504
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,959
What room is Manee Temalai in?

505
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,199
One moment.

506
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:41,880
Mrs. Manee is in room four.

507
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,239
Thank you.

508
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,559
Um...

509
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:19,119
hello ma'am.

510
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,159
Hello

511
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:26,639
I brought flowers.

512
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,960
I'll put them here.

513
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,159
Just a moment, please.

514
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,440
Sweetie

515
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,159
How old are you?

516
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,119
21 ma'am.

517
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,840
You're about the same age as my son.

518
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,360
I see.

519
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,599
Young man with a bright future.

520
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,039
You shouldn't be worried.

521
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,039
Because of the problems I caused.

522
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,159
Sweetie

523
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:29,800
Don't worry.

524
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,960
I'll tell the police myself.

525
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:37,440
That I...

526
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,400
intentionally walked in front of the car.

527
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,159
Ow

528
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,199
Hey! Don't you know how to say sorry?

529
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,400
Mrs. Manee is in room four.

530
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,039
Sir?

531
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Are you okay?

532
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,400
I'd like to leave these flowers for the patient in room 4.

533
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:11,119
Oh,

534
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,999
relatives can go in and visit the patient.

535
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,840
I shouldn't.

536
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,679
Please give them to her, thank you.

537
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,199
Sir... sir.

538
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,159
Ms. Arinya,

539
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,199
is that correct?

540
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,880
You can call me Lukwa

541
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,199
Okay, Ms. Lukwa

542
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,279
From your medical records,

543
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,158
your heart has stop beating due to severe
myocarditis before, correct?

544
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,159
Yes

545
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,118
Can you remember how it felt when your...

546
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,559
heart stopped beating?

547
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:17,800
I didn't know what happened to me.

548
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,119
I just lived life normally.

549
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,840
But it was my life in the past.

550
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,118
Like events in the past were playing again in my mind.

551
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,159
- Are you feeling any pain?
- Yes I am.

552
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,880
On my left.

553
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,159
That feeling...

554
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,960
did it feel real?

555
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,920
Very real.

556
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,000
But there was one thing that didn't feel real.

557
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:54,960
I could see four minutes into the future.
