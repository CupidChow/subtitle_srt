Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,600
It's not cancer, right, Doctor?

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,799
The lump is soft.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,118
Isn’t painful when pressed, and quite small.

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,719
This makes cancer less likely.

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,759
However, I’ll still send the biopsy for confirmation.

10
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,240
That's a relief.

11
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,320
Because last month,

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,640
my husband passed away from cancer.

13
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,000
So I got scared.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
I'm sorry for your loss.

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,640
I understand why you’re worried, Mrs. Soontaree.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,560
Thank you, Doctor.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
You're very kind.

18
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,399
Take this form to the nurse right up front.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Then wait for your surgery appointment slip.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,840
Thank you so much, Doctor.

21
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,359
Next patient, please.

22
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,560
It's getting late, any patients left?

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,518
Tyme,

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,079
can I talk to you for a second?

25
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,079
Sure.

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
- Here.
- Thank you, Doctor.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,999
I've talked with several other medical professors.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,759
And everyone is in agreement,

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,639
to have you be a surgical professor here.

30
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,319
But I’m not sure if I’m suitable being a professor here.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,478
If you're not suitable,

32
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,599
your name wouldn't be first on the list.

33
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,520
Okay then, Doctor.

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,639
I'll be a professor here.

35
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,240
Great.

36
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:30,120
Then I'll let the department head know.

37
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,599
In the meantime, you can think about research topics.

38
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,759
Oh,

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,199
and congratulations on the offer.

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
Thank you so much.

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,439
(Nutcha)

42
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,280
Sorry I haven’t been around much lately.

43
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah, I understand.

44
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,239
You're in surgical residency.

45
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,319
So you're probably busy.

46
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,480
Thank you so much, Nut,

47
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,839
for always helping with my Grandma's diabetes.

48
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,759
And...

49
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,680
sorry for not taking care of you more.

50
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,680
I admit that recently, my feelings for you...

51
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,199
haven't been the same as before.

52
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,839
Are you okay, Nut?

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm not okay.

54
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,959
Truthfully, I've known for a long time.

55
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,399
But thank you, for being honest with me.

56
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,759
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,120
It's fine.

58
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,639
Even though we're breaking up,

59
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,120
still bring your Grandma in for her check-ups with me.

60
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,680
Okay?

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,399
Okay.

62
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
Grandma prefers the same doctor,

63
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,759
she won't want to change.

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,839
Thank you so much.

65
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,160
My pleasure.

66
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,959
Um, excuse me?

67
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,758
Is Dr. Tyme still working here?

68
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,639
Yes.

69
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,000
Can I request an appointment with him?

70
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,279
If you don't have an appointment, you'll have to wait.

71
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,599
There's a long queue.

72
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
That's okay, I can wait.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,438
In that case, please take a seat.

74
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,639
- I'll check for you.
- Thank you.

75
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,639
Thank you.

76
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,399
Next patient, please.

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,759
Doctor?

78
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,079
Um.

79
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,000
You are Mr. Pacharawit Sriwatsombat?

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,399
Yes.

81
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,799
What brings you in today?

82
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,480
Stomach aches, and lack of sleep.

83
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,399
How many days have you been in pain?

84
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,040
For about a week now but,

85
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,279
it got worse yesterday.

86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Um.

87
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,079
Is the pain sharp, or more burning?

88
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,680
Both.

89
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,079
It gets worse after eating.

90
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,438
Have you been eating at irregular times,

91
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,639
or experiencing any stress?

92
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,639
Sometimes.

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,399
Please go to the examination bed.

94
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,000
Could you please lift your shirt for me?

95
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh, you don't need to remove it completely.

96
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,199
You can just lift your shirt a bit.

97
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,839
You can lie down.

98
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,439
Let me know if you feel any pain.

99
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,360
Does it hurt here?

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,160
A little bit.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,079
Sorry about that.

102
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,240
All done.

103
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,559
Please have a seat at the table.

104
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,720
I'll prescribe an antacid for you, and also -

105
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,919
avoid spicy foods, and eat on a regular schedule.

106
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,119
If it doesn't improve in two weeks,

107
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,439
I recommend coming back for a follow-up.

108
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,559
Okay.

109
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,159
Please hand this form to the nurse right up front.

110
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,200
Are we finished here?

111
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,919
We're finished.

112
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay.

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Phung, do I have any patients left?

114
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
All done for now. Next patients are this afternoon.

115
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,840
Okay, I'll go have lunch. I have an OR shift this afternoon.

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,039
Okay, Doctor.

117
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,720
Are you free this evening?

118
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,279
I can sit by myself just fine when I’m alone.

119
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,158
Are you feeling sore?

120
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,559
Yes.

121
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,360
Can I give you a massage?

122
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,919
Actually, I'm not that sore, I just want a massage.

123
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,599
- Your skills are still great.
- Not too hard?

124
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
No no, it's good, it's good.

125
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,959
- Oh wow, it splashed on my face.
- Oh, careful, careful.

126
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Be careful, be careful.

127
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,759
It's really splashing.

128
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,240
Akira.

129
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,240
Hey.

130
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,799
Are you hungry?

131
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,639
It's time to eat.

132
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Is it?

133
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,000
Every story that has passed.

134
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,679
Every night that goes by.

135
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,959
Circling like this endlessly.

136
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,879
Without any value.

137
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,679
When you came into my life.

138
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,360
I began to understand.

139
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,480
The time that has passed.

140
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,360
Was to wait to meet you, wasn’t it?

141
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,960
If tonight we -

142
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,200
look into each other’s eyes for a time.

143
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,278
If today we -

144
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,879
still hold hands like this.

145
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,518
If the whole world.

146
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,639
Were to collapse and be destroyed.

147
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,600
It'll be okay.

148
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
I don't want to work my shift.

149
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,960
Easy.

150
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
Then don't go.

151
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,240
Hey,

152
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,840
as my boyfriend, you'll have to understand my job's demands.

153
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,759
I'm just kidding.

154
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,960
No need to be all serious.

155
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,399
- I'm going to use the bathroom.
- Okay.

156
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,879
Tyme!

157
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,720
Tyme!

158
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,519
Tyme!

159
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,039
- Den?
- Come back now!

160
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,960
It's not real.

161
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
If you don't get out, you're going to die.

162
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Don’t let the 4 minutes run out.

163
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,960
This isn't real?

164
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,320
Tyme!

165
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,159
Can you hear me?!

166
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,039
Hey, Tyme!

167
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,559
Great.

168
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Great!

169
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,360
Great.

170
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Great, Great, can you hear me, Great?

171
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,559
Great.

172
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,159
Great, Great, can you hear me, Great?!

173
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,720
Great, come out, Great!

174
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,960
Great, come out, Great.

175
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,639
Great!

176
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,759
Great, come out, Great!

177
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,799
Great!

178
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,399
Great!

179
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,639
Hurry, Great, hurry.

180
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,480
Great.

181
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,600
Come out, Great, hurry.

182
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,279
Great.

183
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,039
Great.

184
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,640
Great.

185
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,039
Can you hear me?

186
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,480
Tyme.

187
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,440
Tyme.

188
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,799
Great.

189
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,279
ROSC, quickly get him in the ambulance.

190
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,680
Three.

191
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,039
Two.

192
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,119
One.

193
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,119
Fah,

194
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,920
Have you talked to your dad for me yet?

195
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,200
My dad said there's nothing to talk about.

196
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,920
Your dad should be able to sort this out.

197
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,119
He could just say that the evidence is fake.

198
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,680
The business is damaged beyond repair.

199
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,440
My dad can only manage to clean up the mess.

200
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,279
Actually, you should probably escape like your parents did.

201
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,039
How can I go?

202
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,079
My brother got shot.

203
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,119
The killer still hasn't been caught.

204
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,160
Right now, I'm working to restore everything back to normal.

205
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,839
Things can't go back to normal.

206
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
Don't you love me?

207
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,000
And how about you?

208
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
Have you ever loved me?

209
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,079
At this point, you're no use to me anymore.

210
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,880
Being together will only make things worse for me and dad.

211
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,359
You can leave now.

212
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,799
Fah.

213
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,000
Leave now.

214
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
If you don't leave,

215
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,559
I'll have my guards take you out.

216
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,640
Please.

217
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,799
Hello.

218
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,880
Who is this?

219
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,838
Mr. Wanchai's daughter.

220
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,720
My father passed away, is there something you need?

221
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,799
I know.

222
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,000
Who killed your father.

223
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,440
I believe the motive is likely driven by revenge.

224
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,399
Mr. Ton Kla probably knew that Mr. Title killed Dome.

225
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,798
So, he went out to hunt him down himself.

226
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,440
And then staged the murder to look like his own brother's.

227
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,039
I'm not sure how Mr. Ton Kla learned these details.

228
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,720
This case is major and very important.

229
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,640
I want all of us,

230
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,440
to quickly plan and make the arrest as soon as possible.

231
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,599
Yes sir.

232
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,039
(Ton Kla)

233
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,999
(Text: Where are you, Ton Kla?)

234
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,959
(Text: Can we meet up today?)

235
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,599
Updates on the murder case involving
the General’s son by the lake.

236
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,279
Latest, police have obtained DNA evidence
and fingerprints from the rock.

237
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,839
Which is believed to be the murder weapon.

238
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,278
Which matches the fingerprints of Mr. Anuwat Warindej.

239
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:30,759
Or Mr. Ton Kla.

240
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,000
Korn!

241
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,119
Have you seen the news?

242
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Yes.

243
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,920
I killed someone.

244
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,039
Revenge for Dome, right?

245
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,720
I'm sorry, Ton Kla.

246
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,039
I'm sorry.

247
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
For not being there when Dome died.

248
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,440
You don't need to be afraid.

249
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,880
I'll help you escape.

250
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,039
Excuse me, Inspector.

251
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,399
Someone reported -

252
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,240
seeing Mr. Ton Kla at a store in the market.

253
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,518
I reviewed the store's CCTV footage.

254
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,880
There was another man helping Mr. Ton Kla escape.

255
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,559
Here.

256
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,400
Inspector?

257
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,038
Copy that, 29.

258
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,759
Yes sir.

259
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,039
Base to unit 2.

260
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,079
Area 15 in front of the station, copy that, 28.

261
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,160
Just a little longer, Ton Kla.

262
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,680
My guys are coming.

263
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,720
And then we'll be safe.

264
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,599
No need to be afraid.

265
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,959
Get your things, the police are here.

266
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,119
Ton Kla! Get up. Get your things.

267
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,680
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

268
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,720
No, no, Ton Kla.

269
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,920
This way, fire escape.

270
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,160
Inspector.

271
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,279
The mission failed.

272
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,720
Mr. Korn and Mr. Ton Kla escaped
towards the bridge behind the dorms.

273
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,359
Copy. I’ll take the other route.

274
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,480
C'mon.

275
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,960
Go, go, Ton Kla, Go!

276
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
Go, go.

277
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,079
Hey!

278
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,519
Hey, stop!

279
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,920
It's the police.

280
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,240
Pfft.

281
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,559
Ton Kla, surrender now.

282
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,160
Are you disappointed in me? Is that why you did this?

283
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,240
You didn't keep your promise to me.

284
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,400
I'm sorry.

285
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,920
It's not easy, you know.

286
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,400
It is easy.

287
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,400
I did it.

288
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,880
And faster than you.

289
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,680
Those two fuckers... have finally paid for it.

290
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,680
What do you mean, Ton Kla?

291
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,480
Those two?

292
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,400
The other guy who killed Dome,

293
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,720
was Great.

294
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,319
And the person who shot Great,

295
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,480
was me.

296
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,000
And while you were gone, I cheated on you.

297
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,400
Korn, don't!

298
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,079
Let's run away together.

299
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,720
You mean,

300
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,279
right now?

301
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:17,920
Yes.

302
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,680
Right now.

303
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,480
I'm not afraid anymore.

304
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,839
I want to be with you forever.

305
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,639
Thank you for your merit.

306
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,400
Great.

307
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,679
I'll take care of it.

308
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,800
Take it.

309
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,199
I quit for you.

310
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,039
Don't worry about me.

311
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,760
Be happy with the one you love.

312
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,360
Dr. Tyme!

313
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,760
Welcome back!

314
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,719
What, you're still not finished?

315
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,999
Well, I’m waiting to interview you, and Great.

316
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,159
So the sample group will increase.

317
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,760
Hello, Great.

318
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,360
My name is Dr. Den.

319
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,440
Hello, Dr. Den.

320
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,639
Don't spoonerize.

321
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,840
Den, as in Dentist.

322
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,639
My parents wanted me to be a dentist.

323
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,559
Oh, okay.

324
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,239
You're just talking nonsense.

325
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,039
Oh.

326
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,440
Excuse me.

327
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,039
I thought Den finished already.

328
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,559
It's okay.

329
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,360
It's fine.

330
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,320
C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.

331
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,000
Go sit, sit, sit.

332
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,199
Go sit.

333
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,719
Um.

334
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,400
Everyone,

335
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
this is Lukwa.

336
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,519
Or her full name... my darling Lukwa.

337
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,440
I was gone 2 months and you already have a girlfriend?

338
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,480
Well, I'm hot shit.

339
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,198
Wa, let me interview my friends.

340
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,079
Then, let's go grab something to eat.

341
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,280
Okay.

342
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,159
Have you met before?

343
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,039
At...

344
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,880
the art exhibition.

345
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,000
Yes.

346
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,599
The brain is an organ that
requires a constant flow of oxygen.

347
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
Okay, I'm on the way up.

348
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,199
Where the hell is this bar?

349
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,400
I'm going up.

350
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,079
Keep going?

351
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,800
Shit, Tle.

352
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,199
What kinda bar has this many stairs, damn it.

353
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,280
This is how long the brain can survive without oxygen.

354
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,079
Just turn through the door, right?

355
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,880
Oh, I see it.

356
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,079
Okay, later.

357
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,360
What happens to our consciousness during this time?

358
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,280
We might go back and see feelings of guilt or bad decisions.

359
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,719
We might want to make new decisions to fix old mistakes.

360
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,679
For a final, peaceful mind.

361
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,999
I will grant the ability to see the future,

362
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
for 4 minutes, to you.

363
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,360
The next round starts in half an hour.

364
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,880
How was it?

365
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:10,519
Did you like it?

366
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,039
Um.

367
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,639
I got lost and ended up here.

368
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,639
The presentation was amazing.

369
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm so glad you liked it.

370
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,719
Well then, please excuse me.

371
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,159
I can’t find it. What secret fucking bar?

372
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,079
Then come out and get me, you shit.

373
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,639
Don't be lazy, you fucker.

374
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,519
Tle.

375
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm gonna go, I'm serious.

376
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:02,840
Ma'am?

377
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,000
Are you okay?

378
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,719
Somebody call an ambulance!

379
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,000
Hey!

380
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,559
Okay!

381
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,719
Yeah, come out and get me.

382
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,400
Please let me serve you.

383
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,480
Enjoy your meal.

384
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,679
- Excuse me, order please.
- Okay.

385
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,159
Can I get one piece of this, and also this.

386
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,440
Hi Mom.

387
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,639
Hey, see you later. I'll lock up the restaurant.

388
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,480
Great, how are you?

389
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,199
It's going okay.

390
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,719
How about you?

391
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,360
Its been a bit difficult because I have to keep moving.

392
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,440
Did you get the money from the warehouse?

393
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,679
Not yet.

394
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,639
Oh, why not? Just use it so you don't have to struggle.

395
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,400
Also, I'm worried the police might
find the money before you.

396
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,000
When I have time, I'll go get it.

397
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,800
Take care of yourself, Mom.

398
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,199
Oh Great, I need your help with something.

399
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Help with what?

400
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:51,359
I contacted the minister to get Dad and me back to Thailand.

401
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,799
He said he'll help us.

402
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,960
But I want to ask you to give some of the cash to him.

403
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,879
You want me to go by myself?

404
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,000
Yes. If he helps us, Dad and I will
definitely win this case.

405
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,119
And we'll go back to having everything we used to have.

406
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,079
Okay.

407
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,880
I’m finding evidence that Warit killed my Grandma.

408
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,519
And if possible,

409
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,840
I’ll trace back to when he ordered my parents' killing.

410
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,960
But this time, I’ll stay calm.

411
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,679
Not impulsive, and making assumptions like last time.

412
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Are you okay, Great?

413
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,480
My mother asked me to bring this for you.

414
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,519
Your parents are really good at hiding cash.

415
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,239
When will they be able to return to Thailand?

416
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,480
Give me some time. I’m currently clearing the way.

417
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,440
Shouldn't take more than a week.

418
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:33,880
And about the case?

419
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:35,639
Don't worry.

420
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,760
I can clear Chanin and Wiriya's names easily.

421
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,519
Thank you so much. Then, I'll take my leave.

422
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,400
You mean you won’t let your parents return to Thailand?

423
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,719
Right.

424
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,519
If they return,

425
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:00,920
they'll do anything to survive.

426
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,000
End up doing the same business. They can't escape it.

427
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,320
Causing trouble for others.

428
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:11,760
And about the money?

429
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:13,719
Let the police take it.

430
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,000
I don't want it.

431
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,440
Illegal money.

432
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,920
Aren't you worried about getting into trouble, or any issues?

433
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:31,400
Since I had the 4 minutes experience,

434
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,000
you know what I'm afraid of the most?

435
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,880
What?

436
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,400
Unresolved feelings when you approach death.

437
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,359
Sir, how long have you been involved with Sriwatsombat online gambling?

438
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,518
Are there any other politicians involved?

439
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:56,280
That's right, are there?

440
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:57,599
Are there, sir?

441
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,639
Can you please answer?

442
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,039
Sir.

443
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,760
This way.

444
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,280
Sir, is it true? Can we get an interview, Sir?

445
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,400
Sir?

446
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,159
Excuse me.

447
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,000
Inspector, we've located General Warit.

448
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,719
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

449
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:53,719
He went missing for over a month because he was held here?

450
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
I think so, sir.

451
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,038
Earlier, someone reported -

452
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:00,440
loud wailing screams coming from this area.

453
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,598
The patrol came in to check the building.

454
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,000
And found the General lying on the floor.

455
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,360
Do we have the person responsible?

456
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,960
Not yet, sir.

457
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,079
It seems the suspect escaped before we arrived.

458
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:15,239
But this company has been closed since Mr. Wanchai's death.

459
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,559
We suspect a former employee accessed the building.

460
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,039
Or possibly someone from Mr. Wanchai's family.

461
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:23,840
Possibly.

462
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,879
We still haven't caught the person who killed Mr. Wanchai?

463
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,760
Not yet, sir.

464
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,079
Okay.

465
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,440
Excuse me, sir.

466
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,719
The patient is in the red zone, Doctor.

467
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,239
Hello, Dr. Tyme.

468
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,280
And if you came across Warit again,

469
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,719
what will you do?

470
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,880
I will kill him.

471
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,159
Revenge my Grandma.

472
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:22,960
Is revenge really a good idea?

473
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:27,360
Just hypothetically speaking.

474
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,159
If you found Warit dying,

475
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,039
would you help him?

476
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,880
Wait.

477
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,280
Is this a medical ethics exam?

478
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,320
Yes.

479
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,559
So are you gonna help?

480
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,199
I don't know.

481
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,239
Please set up the OR.

482
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
And get me the order form.

483
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,719
Yes, Dr. Tyme.

484
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,559
You don't have to worry.

485
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,719
I’ve assessed, and you will survive.

486
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,400
But you'll be disabled and need others
to clean your shit and piss for life.

487
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,119
Dad.

488
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,039
What happened?

489
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,320
Who did this to you?

490
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,239
Are you hurt?

491
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,280
Sir.

492
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,519
You are Korndanai's younger brother,

493
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,159
that got shot by Ton Kla?

494
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,599
Yes.

495
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,960
What are you doing here?

496
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,840
I want to take responsibility for what I've done.

497
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:02,079
That night.

498
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,159
When Dome was killed.

499
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,880
I was there as well.

500
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,079
It's beautiful here.

501
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,559
I don’t know how much longer we’ll be together like this.

502
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,719
Great.

503
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,360
Believe me.

504
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,199
The courts will be lenient with you.

505
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,440
They granted bail because you're a good person.

506
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:51,639
And also, none of this is your fault.

507
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:57,440
You're really strong, Great.

508
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:09,960
Oh, Great.

509
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,079
What we saw in those 4 minutes,

510
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,639
reflected the experiences we've had.

511
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,000
That means in the real world,

512
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,519
you knew this place already, right?

513
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:25,960
I didn't.

514
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,880
In those 4 minutes, I just drove here randomly.

515
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:39,840
But this place actually exists.

516
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,159
How could I know this place during the 4 minutes?

517
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,320
Oh man.

518
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,280
Hey, Great!

519
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,360
Great.

520
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:32,679
I thought we haven't come out yet.

521
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,440
What?

522
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,000
Just you.

523
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,800
Just having you.

524
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,480
No matter if we face.

525
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:08,799
A world without stars.

526
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,920
But the two of us will move on.

527
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:17,920
For as long.

528
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:24,199
Hold me tight tonight, just the two of us.
