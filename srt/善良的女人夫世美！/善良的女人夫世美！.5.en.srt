00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,658
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL,
AND ANY RESEMBLANCE

00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,533
TO REAL PEOPLE OR EVENTS
IS COINCIDENTAL

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,467
{\an8}EPISODE 5

4
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,517
{\an8}Oh, my.

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,850
{\an8}Your skin is so fair.

6
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,000
{\an8}Oh my goodness.

7
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,150
It's been so long.

8
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,000
My friend.

9
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,317
My friend, what's going on here?

10
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,100
Friend?

11
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,900
This is Baek Hye Ji.

12
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:50,684
My friend!

13
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,900
You're still the same.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,450
Uh, I have something
to talk about with my friend.

15
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,067
Oh, okay, go ahead.

16
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,850
Excuse me.

17
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,567
Yes?

18
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,884
You dropped something.

19
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,833
Something important.

20
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,284
Oh! You're right.

21
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:35,817
How could you drop something so important?

22
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,233
- People must be waiting.
- Yes.

23
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,467
Hurry up and go.

24
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,867
See you later.

25
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,533
Muchang Strawberries?

26
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,217
How did you know I was here?

27
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,584
Did Ga Seon Yeong send you?

28
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,784
Yeong Ran,
there are no secrets in this world.

29
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,250
And you're being so cold-hearted.

30
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,784
What's with Ga Seon Yeong?

31
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,733
She's your daughter.

32
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,117
Just kidding.

33
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,617
But if the professor finds out you're here,

34
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,667
she said she'd reward me handsomely.

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,300
That part is true.

36
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,784
What do you really want, Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

37
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,450
Why should I care?

38
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:43,433
The reward is what the giver decides.

39
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:48,284
Miss, all is ready!

40
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,684
Friend, what day is it today?

41
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,450
I couldn't even eat a meal
coming all the way here.

42
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,167
Great!

43
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,117
Let's finish our talk before leaving.

44
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,184
What talk?

45
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,050
How much do you want?

46
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,933
How much will it take for you
to shut up and leave quietly?

47
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,984
Our Yeong Ran

48
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:14,150
has become a chaebol wife,
but you haven't changed at all.

49
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,050
No,

50
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,984
should I call you Ms. Bu Se Mi now?

51
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,084
Answer me first.

52
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,100
Tell me what you want.

53
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,884
A billion won?

54
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,484
Are you serious?

55
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,550
No.

56
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,233
Ten billion won?

57
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,233
You want to die, huh?

58
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,217
Yeong Ran.

59
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,217
You're being awfully casual with me now.

60
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,150
Yeong Ran, I told you.

61
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,017
Let's eat, drink coffee,
and watch movies together.

62
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,217
That's all I want.

63
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,950
Of course, you'll pay for everything.

64
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,867
Now, we're really friends from today,
right?

65
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:05,200
Or should I have a serious talk
with the Muchang strawberry guy?

66
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,533
I've made a friend now too.

67
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm leaving now. I'm hungry.

68
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,600
Please don't do anything foolish.

69
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,967
I'm asking you, friend.

70
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,267
Okay.

71
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,500
How in the world did Baek Hye Ji find me?

72
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,284
Get ready, folks.

73
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,717
She's out!

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,484
She's here. Get ready.

75
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,317
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

76
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,933
Welcome!

77
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,650
Well, you are treating us.

78
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,350
WELCOME, MS. BU SE MI
We couldn't just stand by.

79
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,217
Meals and gifts under 50,000 won
don't violate ethics laws.

80
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,284
So this banner

81
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,717
cost 40,000 won from
our regular vendor for village events,

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,917
and these fireworks were delivered
in the early morning for 9,800 won.

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Total 49,800 won. A safe solution.

84
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:39,717
Ms. Bu Se Mi,
this is our heartfelt gesture.

85
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,000
We love you.

86
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,888
Fireworks!

87
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,350
Everyone, let's eat.

88
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,084
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

89
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,584
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

90
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,584
Please have your meal
before the noodles get soggy.

91
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,450
Sit here.

92
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,950
Miss, look at that bounce house over there.

93
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,050
The kids love it.

94
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,684
You should check it out.

95
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,084
Come this way.

96
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,950
- Friend.
- Wait, Ms. Bu's friend.

97
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,267
Join us for a meal.

98
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,533
Wait, did you come all the way
from Seoul to Muchang just to see her?

99
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,817
Everyone, having fun?

100
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

101
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:26,984
Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!

102
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,300
- Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!
- Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!

103
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,617
The best!

104
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,950
Miss, today feels like my birthday.

105
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,067
This is so much fun.

106
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,733
This is for you.

107
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:49,421
I'm back, guys!

108
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:51,309
Are you ready?

109
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:54,153
Come on, climb up.

110
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,684
What?

111
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,567
Why is the light on?

112
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,784
No.

113
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,884
Baek Hye Ji!

114
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,250
NOT ON MY SIDE: IT'S GOING WELL, RIGHT?

115
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,200
<i>It's going well, right?</i>

116
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,867
Oh, it looks delicious.

117
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,300
Wow,
you've worked so hard preparing for today.

118
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,717
- Ju Won's father.
- Yes.

119
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,233
We're not just here to eat today, right?

120
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Shouldn't we verify her?

121
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,767
Wait a second.

122
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,533
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't we verify her?

123
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,117
Speaking from a police perspective,
people aren't always trustworthy.

124
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,917
Do we really need to verify her?

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,617
She seems fine to me.

126
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,684
Hey, Jeong Hwa.

127
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,817
You know you're bad at judging people,
right?

128
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,250
Isn't that right, PTA President?

129
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,100
But she's kind.

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Is she?

131
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,050
By the way, Miss.
Do you prefer jjamppong or jajangmyeon?

132
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,550
I enjoy both equally.

133
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,317
That's hard to choose.

134
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Mixed noodles. Just choose mixed noodles.

135
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,533
Enjoy your meal.

136
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,967
Miss.

137
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,650
This tastes great.

138
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:39,950
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

139
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:44,050
Well, my younger sister graduated from
Iseon Women's University's business school.

140
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,817
When I went to her graduation,
the building was really cool.

141
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,017
Oh.

142
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,550
The business school building?

143
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:52,584
Yeah.

144
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,717
The windows there are really big, right?

145
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,017
When I used to attend classes there,
the sunlight would pour in,

146
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,284
and I would get really sleepy.

147
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,617
That's right.

148
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,750
I think my younger sister, Seung Hee,
also mentioned something like that.

149
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,917
Wait, do you know Pyo Seung Hee?

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,433
She's a reporter at GNA now.

151
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,867
Pyo Seung Hee.

152
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,117
I only know her face.

153
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,184
Seung Hee had such pretty eyes, remember?

154
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,950
Yeah, that's right.

155
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, Lord.

156
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,517
Please finish your meal quickly.

157
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,850
Did Seung Hee have beautiful eyes?

158
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,750
She suddenly became prettier.

159
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,384
During the summer vacation of 3rd grade.

160
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,217
Oh right.

161
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,384
Miss, then Seung Hee...

162
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,784
Right, right. Jeong Woo.

163
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,017
Everyone.

164
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,917
I have some good news to share today.

165
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,584
The rumor that Ms. Bu Se Mi has come to

166
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:58,184
our Muchang Iseon Kindergarten has spread
throughout the whole town of Muchang,

167
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:02,167
and we plan to have more students
starting next week.

168
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,467
Miss, please say a few words.

169
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,184
Although this is a welcome party for me,

170
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:19,184
I'm so grateful for the wholehearted
welcome you've all given me.

171
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,117
I actually heard some bad things

172
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,800
about the previous teachers
from Ju Won's father.

173
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:31,484
I understand you couldn't open up to me
because the children were hurt by them.

174
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,417
But I'm definitely different from them.

175
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,933
I always keep my promises.

176
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,217
Please watch and see.

177
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,617
Alright, let's watch.

178
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,684
- Bu Se Mi!
- Bu Se Mi!

179
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,017
Now, shall we all have a drink?

180
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,450
- Yes.
- Let's drink.

181
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,333
- Fill the glasses.
- Okay.

182
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:00,950
Ms. Bu's friend?

183
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,833
- Ms. Bu's friend?
- Huh?

184
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,150
Wait, so you two are alumni
from Iseon Women's University?

185
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,984
The early childhood education department?

186
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,050
Ah...

187
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,817
- We...
- I majored in ballet.

188
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,350
- Wow.
- Ballet?

189
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:16,750
Should I show you?

190
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,500
Right now?

191
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,067
Oh my, oh my.

192
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,133
Wow.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,984
Wow.

194
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:31,984
Wait, that... That...

195
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,484
Are you really taking off socks
at the dinner table...

196
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,750
What are you doing?

197
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,550
Goodness, how eccentric.

198
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,000
- Seriously.
- What's that?

199
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,700
1473.

200
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,750
1473? What's that?

201
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,484
Press 1473.

202
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,967
Should I... Should I press it?

203
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,817
Keep the phone steady and film properly.

204
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,533
A video?

205
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:31,284

00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:36,284

218
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:47,850
Yes, Attorney Lee.

219
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,017
Madam.

220
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,000
Is Baek Hye Ji there?

221
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,167
How on earth did Ms. Baek
Hye Ji know I'm here?

222
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,184
Where did the information leak from?

223
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:06,117
<i>I'll first check if the information
leaked to Ga Seon Yeong.</i>

225
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,384
Understood.

226
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,617
Now most people in
Muchang seem to trust me.

227
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,317
Let's gradually start our plan.

228
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,417
Alright.

229
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,117
Then I'll...

230
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800
Hello?

231
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,867
She's not just a Madam anymore,
almost a Chairman now.

232
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,867
They are not just a couple,
they're twins, twins.

233
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,500
<i>Start with the Ga Seon Woo video.</i>

234
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,017

Jeon Dong Min.

236
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,433

I think you have something

248
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,717
Pardon?

249
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,850
I have nothing to discuss.

250
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,984
But you should have.

251
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,417
About what?

252
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,017
Well... About earlier.

253
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,067
Oh, that? It's nothing special.

254
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:53,100
Hey!

255
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,750
Hey!

256
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,900
Turn off the music!

257
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,284
Hello.

258
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,133
Ya, ya, ya.

259
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,384
You never invite me.

260
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,617
Give me the mic, sis.

261
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,950
This punk, who did...

262
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:22,333
Why? Let's hang out.

263
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,333
Why do you always leave me out?

264
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,317
Ah, mic test.

265
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,550
Yes.

266
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,584
As a way to welcome

267
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:39,784
our new teacher, Ms. Bu Se Mi,

268
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:45,250
to Iseon Kindergarten,
the only one in Muchang,

269
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,733
I'll sing a song.

270
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:50,950
Jeez, he's ruining my appetite.

271
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,633
Play the music.

272
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,350
Hello.

273
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,617
As a native of Muchang,

274
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,950
I, Kang Seong Tae, of Muchang
Development Committee, greet you all.

275
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,784
I am

276
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,800

288
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,617
Hey, plug this fast! Who turned it off?

289
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,750
I have something to say.
There's something I need to say tonight.

290
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,984
Who turned it off?
My emotions are at their peak right now.

291
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,684
- Who turned this off?
- Kang Seong Tae, you're drunk.

292
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,950
I can't understand anything you're saying.

293
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,600
None of us can understand you either.

294
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,000
Do you hate me that much?

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,633
Do you hate my singing that much?

296
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,650
You there, Dongwaru.

297
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,550
Don't you know our
contract renews next year?

298
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,950
What are you talking about?

299
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,184
I was just about to dance.

300
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,633
Why are you playing
tambourine for a ballad?

301
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,684
Ms. Kim Hye Jeong, Lee Jun's mom.

302
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:44,650
Do you know how much meat I buy
from that butcher shop monthly?

303
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,250
- Know or not?
- I don't know.

304
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,700
Jeez, you don't know?

305
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,550
Everyone lives off me,

306
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,450
yet why do you ignore me?

307
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,350
Why are you ignoring me?

308
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:59,017
What did I do so wrong?

309
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,850
Ugh, seriously, he's...

310
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:02,800
Mr. Kang Seong Tae!

311
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,733
Why, Ms. Bu Se Mi?

312
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,567
Miss.

313
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,584
The Commercial Lease Act changed. You
have to guarantee the lease for 10 years.

314
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,284
And during those 10 years, you can
only raise the rent by 5% annually.

315
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,684
You didn't know that?

316
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,684
Is that true, Miss?

317
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,467
We've only been here for 4 years.

318
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,717
So what?

319
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,684
Don't you think it's too low to threaten

320
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,150
people in business using their sales?

321
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,517
Too low?

322
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,317
When did I threaten anyone?

323
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,684
When did I threaten?
I never threatened anyone.

324
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,817
Seems like your memory's failing.

325
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,150
You offered me just 3 million won
to leave the kindergarten.

326
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:50,367
- You darn...
- I told you I refused.

327
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,784
What are you looking at?

328
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:55,284
What's with the glare, huh?

329
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,817
What's with the glare?

330
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,784
Did you offer money again to make her quit?

331
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,850
No, she didn't take it.

332
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,684
So I didn't give it, right?

333
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,117
And Miss.

334
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,484
Are you that rich?

335
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,850
I don't know how much money you have.

336
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:14,050
But in Muchang, follow Muchang's rules!

337
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,450
- Stop this.
- Hey.

338
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:17,917
Jeon Dong Min grabbed my hand again.

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,450
Huh? Saw that? Hey, you saw that!

340
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,084
Arrest him. Arrest him.

341
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,400
Hey, the drunk's disturbance comes first.

342
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,384
Why are you picking on only me, huh?

343
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,917
Why are you singling me out?

344
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,850
Why are you ostracizing just me?

345
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,117
What did I do wrong, huh?

346
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,250
Seong Tae.

347
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,317
- Why do you hate and ignore only me?
- Don't get upset.

348
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,017
- Ugh, fine.
- Was I that wrong?

349
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,084
If your father saw you like this,
he'd rise from his grave.

350
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:50,150
Village Chief, why suddenly bring up
my hardworking father?

351
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,050
- My father...
- Everyone out! Take him away!

352
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,250
What did my father do that's so terrible?

353
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,133
Why are you grabbing my leg?

354
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,384
By the way,

355
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:04,567
why don't you use your
real name at the factory?

356
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,467
Only you know it.

357
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,617
This is my original name.

358
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,917
I legally changed it.

359
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,117
Ah, Kim Hye Ja?

360
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,784
Yeah.

361
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,684
It didn't suit me at all.

362
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:22,050
It's a 'nation's mom' name,
but that's not me.

363
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,800
So you do have a conscience, huh.

364
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,850
You have a talent for twisting words.

365
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,884
Ah, unnie...

366
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,267
Should I get you some coffee?

367
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,917
Yes!

368
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,350
And keep calling me So Yeong unnie.

369
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,584
When someone changes their name,
you should call them by it a lot.

370
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,350
Okay, I will!

371
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,167
So Yeong unnie!

372
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,217
- Oh my, what's wrong?
- What are you doing?

373
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,967
What?

374
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
What is it?

375
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,600
I don't recognize who's who here, jeez.

376
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,333
Excuse me.

377
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:19,584
Me?

378
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,300
Don't you know you can't enter
without proper hygiene gear?

379
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,900
I'm the exception.

380
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:35,733
Are you the company president or something?

381
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,067
Not president...

382
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,400
Vice president.

383
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,184
KIM HYE JA

384
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,084
Ms. Kim Hye Ja.

385
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:53,333
So Yeong unnie, your coffee.

386
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,150
So Yeong left earlier.

387
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:59,484
But, you said to use the name often.

388
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:00,684
My, you're peculiar.

389
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:01,717
So Yeong unnie.

390
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
I said So Yeong left already.

391
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,267
Ms. Kim So Yeong?

392
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,567
Your face looks unfamiliar.

393
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,167
Have I...

394
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,467
ever borrowed money from you?

395
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:26,850
Or bought vinyl flooring?

396
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,100
Flooring...

397
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,984
If neither...

398
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,217
Then you're worse.

399
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,250
Oh, my.

400
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,317
Unnie.

401
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,717
You got a sharp tongue, huh?

402
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,567
Walk slowly!

403
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,467
You'll hurt your joints.

404
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,717
- Kids, let's go.
- I made this myself. Share it with Dong Min.

405
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,550
Miss, Miss.

406
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,217
We'll head in first now.

407
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,550
- Going home?
- Yes.

408
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:21,784
Ah, okay.

409
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,267
- Did you have fun?
- Let's go.

410
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,484
Miss.

411
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,133
You know how grateful we are that you came,
right?

412
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,550
Miss.

413
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,384
Please take good care
of our kids from now on.

414
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,384
Please look after our Jenny
and Seo Hyeon too, Miss.

415
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,250
Thank you for the meal today.

416
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,317
We'll head back now.

417
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,717
Yes, go home quickly.

418
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,717
- We'll be going in.
- Okay.

419
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,384
- Thank you.
- Go on inside.

420
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,817
- Goodbye.
- I'll go in now.

421
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,600
- Please go in.
- Goodbye.

422
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:52,317
Jeon Dong Min.

423
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,117
Seems like you've got competition now?

424
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,933
What do you mean?

425
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:02,617
Who in Muchang could stand up
to Seong Tae so confidently?

426
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,717
Actually, everyone here is tied to
Seong Tae through interests,

427
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,333
so they say 'yes' even when they hate it.

428
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,767
She's truly an unpredictable person.

429
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,267
Look at this.

430
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,650
The village chief gave
me this before leaving.

431
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:22,817
Let's have one more drink.

432
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,184
Sis, you should drink with us too.

433
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,017
You guys drink among yourselves.

434
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,717
I have to close up the shop.

435
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,750
Oh my, Hae Na.

436
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,417
Mom drank too much,
so I can't carry you home.

437
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,284
Alright, let's go home and sleep.

438
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,150
My daughter, can you walk?

439
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,650
- Go carefully, sis.
- Yeah, I'm going.

440
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:41,917
Goodnight, Uncle.

441
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,817
- Goodbye, Hae Na.
- Bye.

442
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,450
Oh, Miss, goodbye.

443
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,133
Let's go.

444
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,467
Ms. Hye Ji.

445
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,284
What?

446
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:03,850
How about we share a glass
of ginseng liquor together?

447
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,050
Speaking of this ginseng liquor,

448
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,450
since it's made with
six-year-old ginseng roots,

449
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,450
just one sip will make
your body temperature...

450
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:12,917
This, it's really good.

451
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,667
Your temperature spikes?

452
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,984
Can't do that.

453
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:19,984
Huh?

454
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:24,117
Because if I get cute,

455
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,817
it'll be a big problem.

456
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,984
Can't do that.

457
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,384
No, I can't...

458
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,417
That would be dangerous.

459
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,817
- That's really dangerous.
- I'm in danger.

460
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,584
I can't resist cute things.

461
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,584
I can't handle cute stuff at all.

462
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,150
You're already cute enough.
What's with making it worse?

463
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,750
- You're dangerous.
- Dangerous things are bad.

464
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,884
Shall we open it?

465
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,184
- Shall we open it?
- Shall we?

466
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:44,900
Wait.

467
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,917
- Why? Please.
- Wait a second, friend.

468
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,417
You seem way too drunk right now.

469
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,050
- No.
- We'll go in first.

470
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,384
We're too tired.

471
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,717
It seems like she's in good condition.

472
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,867
No, Yeong Ran.

473
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,684
- Feeling sick?
- I'm just...

474
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,967
Today, I'm just going to...

475
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,167
I'll try being cute.

476
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,250
You are gonna get all cute.

477
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,167
You are gonna get all cute.

478
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,717
You are gonna get all cute.

479
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,284
- Like it?
- Like it.

480
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,317
I like it.

481
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,650
- You're really...
- Me?

482
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,984
- You're dead.
- I'm dead, really?

483
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:26,150
Her friend's so cute. She's my ideal type.

484
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,117
She's cute?

485
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,684
Go home and sleep.

486
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,867
I'm going to put Ju Won to sleep.

487
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,817
And take care of her when you come in.

488
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,850
Her mouth's going numb.

489
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,217
Why?

490
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,184
Her mouth is already going numb.

491
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,250
Take off your wig before sleeping.

492
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,433
Not taking it off to sleep?

493
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,450
By the way, my friend!

494
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:52,750
What's the Muchang strawberry guy like?

495
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,917
Back in Seoul I couldn't even speak to him.

496
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,367
He's the most dangerous person in Muchang.

497
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:02,300
So you should be careful too, Baek Hye Ji.

498
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:09,867
I knew he was dangerous.

499
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,167
He's super lethal.

500
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:23,433
Berry, berry, strawberry pie.

501
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:51,100
I've never used this before.

502
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,067
But this thing

503
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,984
can pierce someone's skull.

504
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,900
Right, Ms. Kim So Yeong?

505
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:04,950
I don't know about that.

506
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,233
What exactly do you want, Vice President?

507
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,584
I keep asking you, right?

508
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,184
Who got you two jobs?

509
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,184
At our factory.

510
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,050
How many times do I have to tell you?

511
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,484
A lawyer came and told me
to do this or go to prison.

512
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:26,200
Wasn't it Kim Yeong Ran?

513
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,950
Do you like Yeong Ran?

514
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:34,350
Why keep looking for Yeong
Ran since earlier?

515
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:37,917
You two aren't involved, are you?

516
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,300
Not me, but with my father.

517
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:42,884
If it's your father...

518
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,517
Darn it.

519
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,917
Are you genuinely asking
because you don't know?

520
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,384
I'm asking because I don't know!

521
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:52,633
Your darn daughter Kim Yeong Ran
married Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

522
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,850
Haven't you seen the news?

523
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,517
Oh my.

524
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,850
Was this my lottery jackpot?

525
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:01,617
That's insane!

526
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,850
That gold digger?

527
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:04,084
Oh goodness.

528
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,984
How can a mother call her
daughter a gold digger?

529
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,984
Ugh, seriously...

530
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,850
Everyone calls her that. Why shouldn't I?

531
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:15,533
But if my daughter's
Chairman Ga Sung Ho's wife,

532
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,533
then you and I are now...

533
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,850
In-laws?

534
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,150
In-laws?

535
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,384
If Yeong Ran's his mother,

536
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,484
you and him aren't in-laws.

537
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,917
It's grandson and grandmother.

538
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,600
Legally speaking.

539
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,017
Oh.

540
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,767
Right.

541
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,000
In-laws, yep.

542
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:43,850
In-laws.

543
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,950
You really don't know
where your daughter is?

544
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:48,984
- Grandmother.
- Darn it.

545
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,117
Didn't you chaebols even investigate that?

546
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,100
I cut ties with Yeong Ran long ago.

547
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,584
How is it that these things are the same
for both wealthy and poor families?

548
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,367
Right, in-law?

549
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:05,667
Exactly.

550
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,350
In-law buddy.

551
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:13,684
I might find out where Yeong Ran is.

552
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,150
You know how?

553
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,000
If there's a way?

554
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,433
Then what will you do for me?

555
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,584
Wait, in-law.

556
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,917
Trying to profit by selling your daughter?

557
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,667
Since family's asking to find her,

558
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:34,550
I might help a little.

559
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,867
Right? Between us?

560
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,084
That's right.

561
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,000
That much is possible between us.

562
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,850
But, in-law.

563
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,150
Huh?

564
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,167
Why are you suddenly

565
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:55,867
using informal language and causing a fuss?

566
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:01,000
You really make me want to kill you.

567
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:10,133
Hey, get someone to follow Lee Don.

568
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,217
Hey.

569
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,967
You watch him.

570
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,200
What are you doing now?

571
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:51,750
We still haven't
finished our talk yesterday, right?

572
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,533
What about?

573
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,450
We talked about everything yesterday.

574
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,850
What exactly did we talk about?

575
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,884
You know, when I pushed you.

576
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,984
You want to discuss that now?

577
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,350
You're heading to the greenhouse, right?

578
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,084
Let's finish talking there.

579
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,550
What?

580
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,400
Not leaving?

581
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,233
Miss.

582
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:34,467
Please listen and don't misunderstand.

583
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,617
I genuinely have no interest in you.

584
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,650
That's why I said it meant nothing.

585
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:43,584
But I'm actually interested in you.

586
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,250
What?

587
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,650
Is that truly the reason?

588
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,817
Yes.

589
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,333
Because you doubt me too much.

590
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,450
So you tried to kiss me?

591
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,084
Kiss? When did I?

592
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,984
You were trying to use money
to win people's hearts,

593
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,717
and since money doesn't work on me,

594
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,684
you tried to use your looks

595
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,367
and approached me yesterday.

596
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,017
I see how you might think that way.

597
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,184
Well, Ju Won's father,

598
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,817
you seem deeply mistaken about something.

599
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,017
Since you kept blocking my path,

600
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,584
I instinctively pushed you in panic.

601
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,050
You should've just said that.

602
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:35,117
I didn't know you would
misunderstand it this much.

603
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,450
You have a kid,
and yet you're surprisingly naive.

604
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:43,200
Not naive, just honest.

605
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,233
So, all misunderstandings are cleared?

606
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,567
We're at the greenhouse.

607
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,084
Wow.

608
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,084
MUCHANG RESIDENTS' RELATIONSHIP CHART

609
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,000
What's this?

610
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:13,233
But why is Berry Boy an 'extra'?

611
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,433
He's the main character.

612
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,833
Huh?

613
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,200
She locked all of this too?

614
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,400
000.

615
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,833
No.

616
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,467
Oh, come on.

617
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Wow!

618
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,167
What is it?

619
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,267
Jeez.

620
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,950
Ah, be careful when picking them.

621
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,650
They wilt fast if the stems fall off.

622
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:34,533
And it lowers their market value.

623
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,633
Oh, this.

624
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,700
You owe me 10,000 won.

625
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:44,784
Then I'll pay you back now.

626
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,884
I hate owing people more than
anything in this world.

627
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,433
Oh, you're not letting me speak.

628
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,917
Isn't it hard for you
to raise Ju Won alone?

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,633
Me?

630
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:06,784
Well, I...

631
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:10,167
I want to be like a greenhouse for Ju Won.

632
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,984
What do you mean by that?

633
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:17,884
Strawberries are sensitive
to temperature and humidity.

634
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,784
But this greenhouse stands firm,

635
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:22,984
blocking rain, wind, and cold.

636
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:24,917
It protects them from all that.

637
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,833
Feels secure, doesn't it?

638
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,333
Ju Won's lucky

639
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:34,967
to have a father like you.

640
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,900
Miss.

641
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,567
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you earlier.

642
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,950
You didn't even take
the money Seong Tae offered.

643
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,067
Never seen anyone refuse that.

644
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,984
It's only 3 million won, after all.

645
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,967
3 million won isn't going
to change my life.

646
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,750
Wow.

647
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:06,217
Even though you speak so annoyingly,

648
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,433
you seem to have a good heart.

649
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,450
Alright.

650
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,650
I think we've had enough.

651
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,600
Let's go have breakfast.

652
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,250
Is 50,000 won enough for this?

653
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,967
Come on.

654
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,550
Solving everything with money

655
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,450
doesn't work on me.

656
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,750
Eat that as dessert.

657
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,467
Here.

658
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,484
Why?

659
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,650
Changed your mind?

660
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,533
Should I give you money?

661
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,533
No.

662
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,133
Let's go.

663
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:23,750
When did you get that scar?

664
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,550
Scar?

665
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:27,667
There's a scar on your wrist.

666
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:31,833
This isn't a scar.

667
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,933
Oh, everyone has a scar or two, right?

668
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,117
Lower your shirt now.

669
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,300
Nice abs, by the way.

670
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,767
I wasn't showing them off.

671
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,900
Sis, what's going on this morning?

672
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,633
Is something good happening?

673
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,650
Seon Woo.

674
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,700
Did you find Kim So Yeong?

675
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,800
How did you know?

676
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,550
Sis.

677
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,250
I'm working hard to catch Kim Yeong Ran.

678
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,133
I'll bring her to you. Don't worry.

679
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,984
<i>Is having a child just for show?</i>

680
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,150
<i>You'll quit after having a kid.
Why take parental leave?</i>

681
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:33,384
<i>Quit now!</i>

682
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:36,017
<i>I said quit!</i>

683
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,833
Ga Seon Woo.

684
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,600
Sis.

685
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,784
This is...

686
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:48,050
Not a single word you said was wrong.

687
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:49,817
Is having a baby just a show?

688
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,817
I also don't like how anyone
and everyone takes maternity leave,

689
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,950
gives birth, and quits,
causing harm to the company.

690
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,050
I hate it too.

691
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,517
Right?

692
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,617
I did good, didn't I?

693
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,833
- Seon Woo.
- Yeah.

694
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,350
I always say,

695
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:15,367
'Don't show your true self

696
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,900
to those idiots.'

697
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:27,750
Sis.

698
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,184
Sis, I get it.

699
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:31,250
I'll take care of this right away, okay?

700
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,317
Hey, get this done through
the secretary's office.

701
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,033
It's done, right?

702
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,567
If you let pigs disrespect you,
you become one. Understood?

703
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:45,184
Answer.

704
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,617
Okay.

705
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,333
I'll really follow your advice now.

706
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,884
Seon Woo.

707
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:55,317
Cancel the party and starve for three days.

708
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,150
Don't shave.
Apologize publicly looking haggard.

709
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,650
Understand?

710
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:01,917
Okay.

711
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,317
I always listen to everything you say, sis.

712
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,433
- Follow me.
- Huh?

713
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,084
- Yes?
- Attorney Lee Don?

714
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,084
Yeah, that's me.

715
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,800
We are the police.

716
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,917
I don't need an introduction, I know.

717
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,684
You're under urgent arrest
for embezzlement charges.

718
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:36,800
Embezzlement. How cliché.

719
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,333
Huh? Vice Chairman!

720
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,084
I saw that your video is popular online.

721
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,550
Congratulations.

722
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:46,817
Congratulations?

723
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,500
Ga Seon Woo!

724
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,350
What brings you here this early?

725
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:55,484
You didn't come out of concern for me,
did you?

726
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,384
Are you here to watch me get arrested?

727
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,300
To warn you.

728
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:02,017
Taking down that video is no big deal.

729
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,517
People easily forgive the privileged
who abuse power.

730
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,550
But they just can't forgive the ones
who have nothing but lack integrity.

731
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:14,400
The lawyer of Chairman Ga Sung Ho, who wanted
to become a tycoon through coins and embezzlement.

732
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,267
How's that for a news headline,
Attorney Lee?

733
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,784
I may not have money,

734
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:23,667
but I still have my conscience, Professor.

735
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:27,600
Everyone's yapping about
conscience these days.

736
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,167
Attorney Lee.

737
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,400
Where did you hide Kim Yeong Ran?

738
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:42,050
The right to remain silent is used
in situations like this, right?

739
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,317
Give me a moment.

740
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,617
Shouldn't you at least
let me put on clothes?

741
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,850
Right?

742
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:51,033
Darn it, that punk...

743
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,117
Good day.

744
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,517
Hey, Butler Choi.

745
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,917
Contact me immediately
once you find the will. Understood?

746
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,400
Understood, Vice President.

747
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:22,450
Professor.

748
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:25,300
Can we work together again?

749
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:30,250
The owner never fired you,
so this isn't reemployment.

750
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

751
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:33,584
Let's go, Cheol Su.

752
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,117
Yes, Butler.

753
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,450
Thank you.

754
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,167
Thank you.

755
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,050
This familiar feel.

756
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:48,417
I can't tell you how much I missed this.

757
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,250
Butler.

758
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,200
We should find the will first.

759
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,617
You check the second floor.

760
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,017
I'll start searching the first floor.

761
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,967
Understood.

762
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,184
Jeez.

763
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:10,600
Look at this mess since I've been gone.
Huh?

764
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,400
Huh?

765
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,233

Would you mind going to town with me?

777
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,184
I need someone familiar
with the area to escort me.

778
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:24,100
I need to cook.

779
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:26,450
Okay.

780
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:29,333
I'm free.

781
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:33,717
Do you have a car?

782
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,650

783
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:37,933
Wait, hold on.

788
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:22,417
Oh, nice socks.

00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,450
I should show these to Hye Ji.
How should I show it?

Pyo Seung Hee.

835
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,984
You're writing about Gaseong Group,
but why not use 'widow' in the headline?

836
00:52:57,067 --> 00:52:58,650
That's archaic language.

837
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:02,017
Of course, whether it's an old term or not,
people would click on the 'widow' article

838
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,117
much more than the Gaseong Group one.

839
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,184
Right. So why not use it?

every last bit of dust.

907
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:36,467
The economy is tough,
but they're just bloodsucking ants.

908
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,333
I'll take my leave now.

909
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,084
Good luck.

910
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,767
Yeah.

911
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:49,817
Senior, Gaseong Group exclusive.

912
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,417
Clear an 8 o'clock news slot.

913
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,200
It's an exclusive, a big scoop.

914
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:17,084
Why do you keep checking the time?

915
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,933
I guess being with me
makes you uncomfortable, my friend.

916
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:24,584
Cut to the chase, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

917
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:28,084
You gave Tae Min the motorcycle because
you have something to tell me, right?

918
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:29,617
Okay.

919
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,617
Then I'll ask you bluntly.

920
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,284
What's your relationship with Lee Don?

921
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,650
What are you talking about?

922
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:37,717
I saw you use Lee Don's email earlier.

923
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,250
How close are you if you
both use his emails?

924
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,984
Closer than me?

925
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:44,784
Best friends?

926
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:49,500
It's just that I couldn't access
my email at the time.

927
00:57:53,633 --> 00:57:55,584
Right?

928
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:56,850
I thought

929
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,884
you were dating Lee Don.

930
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,467
That misunderstanding is very unpleasant.

931
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,484
I bought a gift for you earlier.

932
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,267
I'll give it to you later.

933
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,017
Do that if you want.

934
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,733
Just wait for it.

935
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:18,950
<i>The phone's off. Please leave
a message after the beeping sound.</i>

936
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:20,684
ATTORNEY

937
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,917
It's still turned off.

938
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,450
Keep trying until he answers.

939
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:26,584
Yes.

940
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:28,867
But do you guys know that?

941
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:38,217
Ma'am,

942
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,433
you talk too much.

943
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:45,150
My daughter married Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

944
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:49,300
So do you think she'll have a lot of money
or a lot of vice presidents?

945
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,733
Order food for them.

946
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:01,784
Black bean noodles? Seafood noodles?

947
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:03,500
I'll have seafood with vegetables.

948
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,267
I'll take japchae rice.

949
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,384
You even eat expensive stuff, seriously.

950
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:13,450
Give me some of that.

951
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:20,033
- Ga Seon Woo!
- Ga Seon Woo!

952
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:24,184
Let's accept a cup poured
by our Gaseong Group CEO.

953
00:59:24,267 --> 00:59:25,950
- Yeah.
- Oh, so loud.

954
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:28,550
Hey, I'm still the vice president.

955
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,750
Why? You'll become CEO soon.

956
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,284
- Exactly.
- Yeah, it'll be soon.

957
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:35,000
Hey, give it here.

958
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,867
Everyone, drink plenty.

959
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:42,517
But isn't your sister the real power
in Gaseong Group?

960
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,050
- Hey.
- Watch your mouth.

961
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:47,717
How many times have I told you?

962
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,184
My sister is a professor.

963
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:51,950
She doesn't know about business management.
How many times have I told you?

964
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,784
- Got it.
- She's a professor.

965
00:59:53,867 --> 00:59:55,950
- Right.
- Hey, Seon Woo.

966
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:57,484
You're on the news today, huh?

967
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,584
Why? What for?

968
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,750
- Let me see.
- What is it?

969
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:02,184
Oh, nice!

970
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:03,517
You look great on camera.

971

Wow, Seon Woo looks good on screen.

01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,784
Hey, is this true?

992
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:08,884
Your sister will beat you up for this.

993
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:11,684
Oh, shut up!

<i>Unimaginable wealth.</i>

- Wow.
- What's this?

1007
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:10,850
I'll eat well.

1008
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:12,084
Miss, try some.

1009
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:13,800
Yes.

1010
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,550
Even without adding dried pollack,

1011
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,084
if you cook it following the recipe
on the back of the package, it tastes best.

1012
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:22,984
Countless researchers
spent years developing this.

1013
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:25,617
Jeez, taste it before you talk.

1014
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,050
You look exactly like
the owner of a red noodle company.

1015
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:32,567
My friend holds tons of shares
in that red noodle company.

1016
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:38,350
But the vice president keeps causing
scandals, so the stock's crashing hard.

1017
01:02:38,433 --> 01:02:39,484
Right, friend?

1018
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,567
Yeah, eat up.

1019
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:44,850
We'll do the dishes today.

1020
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:47,700
Oh, you don't have to.

1021
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,784
I'll enjoy it.

1022
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,933
Enjoy your meal.

1023
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,900
Oh, my.

1024
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,933
This is ridiculously good.

1025
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:09,384
Mr. Dong Min.

1026
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:12,250
When will you teach me this recipe?

1027
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,384
I'll tell you later.

1028
01:03:13,467 --> 01:03:14,417
I'll get some water.

1029
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,017
Alright.

1030
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,350
We're out of makgeolli too.

1031
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:19,367
Need to bring more.

1032
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,150
Dong Min.

1033
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,517
Ms. Bu Se Mi's
a 3rd-degree black belt in taekwondo.

1034
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,550
Isn't that impressive?

1035
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:31,400
She's full of surprises, I'm telling you.

1036
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,517
She really has a knack for surprising
people in all sorts of ways.

1037
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
- Sorry, the ointment...
- You okay?

1038
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:39,433
Ugh, seriously.

1039
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,567
<i>Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.</i>

1040
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:52,817
What? What?

1041
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,884
Broth got in my eye.

1042
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:55,933
- Dried pollack, yes.
- Dried pollack!

1043
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,417
MUCHANG SUPERMARKET,
881ST LOTTERY 1ST PRIZE WINNER

1044
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,300
Cheers.

1045
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,084
I should head out now.

1046
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,084
Need to prep for tomorrow's
kindergarten class.

1047
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,317
No way.

1048
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,384
No, drink a bit more.

1049
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:28,384
I'm being utterly adorable right now.

1050
01:04:28,467 --> 01:04:31,167
- Miss, can you have just one more drink?
- No, thanks.

1051
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:33,850
My friend.

1052
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:35,767
Don't mess this up.

1053
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,533
Are you worried about me?

1054
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:42,533
Don't sweat it, pal.

1055
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:48,850
I'll take my leave first.

1056
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:50,884
- Go ahead.
- Let's go together.

1057
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:52,950
I've got an early start tomorrow too.

1058
01:04:53,033 --> 01:04:55,184
Then I should head out early too.

1059
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,984
No, you stay and drink more.

1060
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,284
Let's go together.

1061
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,684
Bye, Dong Min.

1062
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:01,217
What's the occasion, Jeon Dong Min?

1063
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,067
Escort her properly.

1064
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,133
Let's go together, Miss.

1065
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:16,150
They look really good together.

1066
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:18,117
- Huh?
- Tae Min.

1067
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,950
- Did the spirit say that?
- No, I did.

1068
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:22,117
Come on.

1069
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,984
Let me pour you a drink.

1070
01:05:24,067 --> 01:05:25,967
Ms. Hye Ji, you're cute.

1071
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:30,567
You're dead.

1072
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,433
You're killing me.

1073
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,967
Do you have something to say to me?

1074
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:05,267
You've been staring me like
you have something to say since earlier.

1075
01:06:06,267 --> 01:06:08,800
Now here, back at the supermarket too.

1076
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:14,784
Forget it, say it another time.

1077
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:17,133
I'm too exhausted today.

1078
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:20,733
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

You are Kim Yeong Ran, right?

1081
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,050
<i>♫ Now is the time ♫</i>

1082
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:56,017
<i>♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫</i>

1083
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,150
<i>♫ I share the light ♫</i>

1084
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:05,917
<i>♫ I'll brighten the days
shrouded in darkness ♫</i>

1085
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,950
<i>♫ It's not over ♫</i>

1086
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:16,384
<i>♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫</i>

1087
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:22,250
<i>♫ Come back to me safely ♫</i>

1088
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:28,133
<i>♫ So I'm, I'm alive ♫</i>

1089
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:33,750
<i>♫ From the untouchable darkness ♫</i>

1090
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:39,317
<i>♫ Starting to be born again ♫</i>

1091
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,617
<i>♫ For the new me about to begin ♫</i>

1092
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:50,450
<i>♫ I want to sail away ♫</i>

1093
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,950
<i>♫ Again ♫</i>

1094
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:53,750
{\an8}<i>♫ Show you better ♫</i>

1095
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:54,884
{\an8}<i>♫ Enclose the letters of the past ♫</i>

1096
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:56,650
{\an8}Jeon Dong Min knows my true identity.

1097
01:07:56,733 --> 01:07:58,017
{\an8}Are you afraid I'll say something?

1098
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,950
{\an8}She's just someone who
only stayed at school.

1099
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,550
{\an8}What does he know about management?

1100
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:03,250
{\an8}You want me to expose this?

1101
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,150
{\an8}We didn't recognize a tiger cub, did we?

1102
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:06,950
{\an8}You're terrified of your sister,
aren't you?

1103
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:08,850
{\an8}What exactly do you two want?

1104
01:08:08,933 --> 01:08:10,784
{\an8}I love this place.

1105
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:12,717
{\an8}I'll make sure you two rot in jail.

1106
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,750
{\an8}Ms. Bu Se Mi got arrested.

1107
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,817
{\an8}No, background check.

1108
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,850
{\an8}Oh, Lord.

1109
01:08:16,933 --> 01:08:19,684
{\an8}Let's go. Search every possible spot.

1110
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:21,317
{\an8}Hey, get down!

1111
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,533
{\an8}I'll leave Muchang.
