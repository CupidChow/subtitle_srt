00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:13,813
What do you mean, friend?

184
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:17,813
Women with, like, around 100 million won?

185
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,613
Well, he might like a woman like that.

186
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,313
- Cheol Su.
- Yeah, why?

187
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,847
Did I mention?

188
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,113
Mention what?

189
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,747
This winter, I'll cash out my savings.

190
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,347
About 100 million won.

191
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:38,647
Oh.

192
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,313
Why are you telling me that?

193
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,213
Just...

194
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,513
Thinking of having ramyeon for dinner?

195
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,513
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

196
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,613
I do love ramyeon too, you know?

197
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,647
Want to share some?

198
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,647
Great idea.

199
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,647
By the way, when did you save all that?

200
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,913
Just little by little.

201
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:08,147
[Muchang County]
You'll stay here for three months.

202
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:10,113
Muchang?

203
00:15:10,113 --> 00:15:13,813
Yes. No train station, four hours by car.

204
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,747
It's a very peaceful place.

205
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:19,947
It's the kind of town where you even know
how many spoons the neighbor has.

206
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,313
Is there really a need to go
all the way to Muchang?

207
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:26,847
You risked your life for money too.
Do you think others are any different?

208
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,347
If the siblings

209
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:31,380
find out you're the heir,

210
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,347
they'll come after you just like 15 years ago.

211
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:40,080
It's a good place to hide from those chasing you.

212
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,547
And if they send a hitman,

213
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:47,980
it's perfect for setting a trap.

214
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,147
What are they doing inside?

215
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:18,913
What is this?

216
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,747
It's a resume.

217
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,347
[Resume]

218
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,280
Bu Se Mi.

219
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,413
Iseon Women's University,
Early Childhood Education majored.

220
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:32,280
I chose the least suspicious
and harmless cover as a kindergarten teacher.

221
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,113
Coincidentally, my sister runs
a kindergarten in Muchang.

222
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:37,280
Since she's so kind-hearted...

223
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:54,513
She won't die easily.

224
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:03,113
Oh my goodness.

225
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,580
Butler Choi.

226
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,280
Chairman.

227
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,647
I was just cleaning the door.

228
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:18,113
I'll pay more than Seon Yeong,

229
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:21,047
so could you stop fussing over the food now?

230
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,647
Well...

231
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,480
How much more will you give me?

232
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,380
Spend as much as you want.

233
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:46,947
Thank you, Chairman.

234
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,113
See?

235
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:12,647
In this place, money can buy anything.

236
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:15,580
Yesterday's ally becomes today's enemy

237
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,713
and Seoul, especially this house,
is the most dangerous.

238
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,880
I'll go to Muchang.

239
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:30,047
Don't you dare die before the shareholders'
meeting in three months, Madam.

240
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:04,380
<i>This batch of strawberries is the sweetest. Enjoy!</i>

241
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,047
<i>I'll see you in two weeks.</i>

242
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,947
I was wondering when you'd come.

243
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,213
There's one thing I'm curious about.

244
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:33,947
Why do these Muchang strawberries
taste so exceptionally good?

245
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:36,613
Oh, well...

246
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:39,247
Speak comfortably.

247
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,147
Ah, yes.

248
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,347
For the strawberries to grow well,

249
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:48,347
the weather can't be too hot
or too cold all year round.

250
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:51,113
The soil is rich, and there's plenty of water.

251
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:53,880
Muchang is just the perfect place for that.

252
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,513
What a wonderful place.

253
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:08,680
How long does it take to get here from Muchang?

254
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,980
About four hours by car.

255
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,780
Excuse me, Chairman.

256
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,313
May I ask just one thing?

257
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:19,713
Yes.

258
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:23,147
How do you like our strawberries?

259
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,613
I'm not a charity worker.

260
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:30,847
I ate them because they're good. That's all.

261
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:39,380
Oh, why's Chairman out in the garden?

262
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,813
Madam, you know that there are
main characters in novels, right?

263
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,680
He's just... one of the others.

264
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,313
Not a lead, not even a supporting role.

265
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:56,147
Not curious.

266
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,913
Oh, you really aren't curious, huh?

267
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,513
- See you again.
- Yes.

268
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,780
These strawberries are delicious. Have some.

269
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,813
Yes, Chairman.

270
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:55,047
Hello?

271
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,847
Chairman!

272
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,347
Chairman!

273
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:23,847
Chairman.

274
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:25,680
Chairman!

275
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,547
Chairman, are you okay?

276
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,480
Be quiet.

277
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,313
Chairman.

278
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,313
Chairman.

279
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:53,413
Chairman, if we use morphine,
we won't be able to hide it anymore.

280
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:57,013
Dr... Dr. Kim.

281
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,513
Chairman.

282
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,313
You should prepare yourself mentally.

283
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:08,347
Your condition has worsened.

284
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:15,213
You likely won't last more than three months now.

285
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:24,813
You'll need morphine more frequently now.

286
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,247
She's pretty?

287
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,613
Not me.

288
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:15,813
Having an affair with your
hospital nurse? How predictable.

289
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:20,713
Even your mother, if you think about it,
remarried her company's factory manager.

290
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:28,580
How dare you compare yourself to my mom?

291
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:12,147
Go on, say it.

292
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:13,647
Yes, Professor.

293
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:17,813
They'd been cleverly hiding it
on the chart, but it was morphine.

294
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:19,080
Since morphine is a controlled drug,

295
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,047
it's legally restricted
to terminal cancer patients.

296
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:24,413
<i>They can't hide it anymore.</i>

297
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,447
Terminal cancer?

298
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,947
How much time does my father have left?

299
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,547
<i>Usually, with morphine treatment,</i>

300
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,413
it's no more than three months.

301
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,447
It means the pain is going to be unbearable.

302
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:39,047
He hid all this to keep
his children from worrying.

303
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,947
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

304
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:46,747
I'll transfer your payment to your account.

305
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:54,547
About the medical article you wrote last time.

306
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,813
'Miracles can happen even
for terminal cancer patients.'

307
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,213
Could I possibly get
that renowned doctor's contact information?

308
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,747
My father...

309
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:16,913
has terminal cancer.

310
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,713
Yes.

311
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:28,213
Please get me that contact quickly.

312
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:32,280
Thank you.

313
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,647
Bravo!

314
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:48,980
My sister really is a theater and film professor.

315
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,913
Your acting.

316
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,580
Am I really becoming
the chairman of Gaseong Group?

317
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,180
Finally, we're reclaiming
the inheritance left by Mom,

318
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:06,713
after 28 years.

319
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,713
Yes!

320
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,542
Where are you going?

321
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,075
I need to go home.

322
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,842
Yeong Ran.

323
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:51,209
Let's carry out

324
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,509
my euthanasia tonight.

325
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,842
What?

326
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:02,342
You saw it too.

327
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:06,109
That pain...

328
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:08,575
I never want to experience that again.

329
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:14,109
I've already asked Dr. Kim.

330
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,675
You just need to bring it.

331
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:26,975
Only give this to Chairman when he's struggling.

332
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,242
Ah, come in.

333
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:44,075
Put that down for now.

334
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:52,809
Go check if Butler Choi has finished
preparing the ramyeon.

335
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,775
I want ramyeon for my last meal.

336
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:59,509
It's my plan, so you have to be there
for the very last part too.

337
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:07,375
Keep an eye on Butler Choi
and make sure she's not up to anything.

338
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:15,242
You're going to make me
eat the soggy last ramyeon?

339
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,642
Understood.

340
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:21,775
I'll be right back.

341
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:36,542
The Chairman is asking if the ramyeon's ready.

342
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:37,775
Huh?

343
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:40,209
One minute left. Wait a moment longer.

344
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:44,009
The chairman insisted it be cooked
exactly according to the recipe.

345
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,909
Alright.

346
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,075
Ye Rim.

347
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:30,309
We'll meet again soon.

348
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,109
Cooked for 5 minutes exactly
according to the recipe. Perfect.

349
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,442
Chairman.

350
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,742
Chairman!

351
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,042
Chairman!

352
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,875
What's happening?

353
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:17,775
Too many eyes watching.

354
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,275
What?

355
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:36,042
- Attorney Lee...
- What's the matter?

356
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:39,909
Attorney.

357
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:50,209
<i>Why did the chairman change the plan?</i>

358
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,109
<i>Hard to say.</i>

359
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:57,342
<i>It seems the Chairman truly believed
you would succeed, Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.</i>

360
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,809
<i>According to the police investigation,</i>

361
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:07,709
<i>Chairman Ga was confirmed
to have taken his own life</i>

362
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:10,475
<i>after becoming despondent
following a terminal diagnosis.</i>

363
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,009
[Despair leads to extreme act at residence]
<i>The sudden news of his death...</i>

364
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:18,575
Ugh, Father's going to

365
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,742
leave us like that...

366
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,609
Father?

367
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,909
I rehearsed this.

368
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:28,142
I'm technically the chief mourner.

369
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:31,209
Here you are.

370
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,075
You're here.

371
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,575
The paternal mourning station is to your left.

372
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:40,542
Thank you.

373
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,075
The family must be enduring immense grief.

374
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:44,942
I have no words.

375
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,309
Attorney Lee, the shareholders' meeting
is in three months, right?

376
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:52,642
This family adapts remarkably
fast to circumstances.

377
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,909
What's done is done.

378
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:57,275
Yes, three months from now.

379
00:35:57,275 --> 00:36:02,375
At that meeting, you'll elect the chairman
to lead the entire Gaseong Group.

380
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:06,675
For Seon Woo to become chairman, we need to
resolve Chairman Ga Sung Ho's stock inheritance.

381
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:07,942
That should happen
before the general meeting, right?

382
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:12,509
Well, but there's been one change in the will.

383
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,942
What?

384
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:38,309
Here they are.

385
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:39,809
Just give us one statement.

386
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,175
How do you feel?

387
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:43,575
We ask for a brief comment.

388
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:59,245
[Pray for the repose of Chairman Ga Sung Ho]
Even until the very end, the deceased...

389
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:11,132
[We will forever cherish
his grand vision and warm heart]

390
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:18,709
What's that?

391
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,475
Sorry for the late introduction.

392
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:23,242
That lady over there, our Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

393
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,609
Hey.

394
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:40,642
Isn't that the bodyguard from back then?

395
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:43,775
No more 'hey', 'you', or 'that person'.

396
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:44,809
Then what?

397
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,075
One month ago, Ms. Kim Yeong Ran over there

398
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:51,109
filed marriage registration documents
with Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

399
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,775
Oh my God.

400
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:02,942
My father...

401
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:06,109
Unbelievable, huh?

402
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:09,709
Wait, what's that on your finger?

403
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:11,809
Isn't that Mom's ring?

404
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,442
Why are you wearing that ring?

405
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:18,375
Take it off.

406
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:20,909
Take off the ring. Can't you hear me?

407
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:22,075
This is a funeral home.

408
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:23,475
- Let go!
- Chairman is watching.

409
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:24,509
What can a dead person see?

410
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,475
Hey, take that ring off now! I said take it off!

411
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:27,809
Do you know what kind of ring that is?

412
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,909
Ga Seon Woo!

413
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,675
Attorney Lee.

414
00:38:53,442 --> 00:38:56,342
What did he just say earlier?

415
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,209
Marriage registration?

416
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,209
With you?

417
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,375
Didn't you hear?

418
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,709
Attorney Lee said that.

419
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:11,609
From now on, I'm not longer
'you,' 'that,' 'this,' or 'that'.

420
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:19,042
Then, if you're not 'this' or 'that,'

421
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,209
what are you?

422
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:26,675
From now on, I'm your mother.

423
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:53,542
Excuse me, coming through.

424
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:56,342
One moment, please. Sorry.

425
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:06,375
Ugh, Chairman Ga is so tacky.

426
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,142
Even in death, he's messing with us, huh?

427
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:10,609
[We will forever cherish
his grand vision and warm heart]

428
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:14,075
Oh my God, I'm going crazy here, seriously.

429
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:20,309
Sis, are we really just
going to sit still like this?

430
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:21,942
We need to think of a way.

431
00:40:21,942 --> 00:40:24,209
We can't let that bodyguard
take everything from us.

432
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,142
Let's figure out a plan.

433
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:28,109
Sis, answer me already. This is seriously...

434
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:30,875
I'll never give her money like that.

435
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:54,356
[We will forever cherish
his grand vision and warm heart]

436
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:37,009
Madam, you must have been through a lot.

437
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,975
Friend...

438
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,542
Madam, are you okay?

439
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,775
They say couples grow alike.

440
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,409
You scared me!

441
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:15,442
No.

442
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:17,542
You startled me, Madam.

443
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:21,242
Madam, you were surprised, right?

444
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,342
Ask whatever you want to ask.

445
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,742
Friend.

446
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:34,042
Did you really marry the chairman?

447
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,875
Yes.

448
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,175
When did you two do that?

449
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:40,109
When everyone was asleep.

450
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,009
No way, at night?

451
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:46,642
Usually after 11 p.m., once the bell rings.

452
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,109
Then

453
00:42:51,342 --> 00:42:53,275
did you kiss the chairman too?

454
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:54,342
We're a married couple.

455
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:56,209
Insane.

456
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,642
I misspoke. Sorry.

457
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:02,742
Wait, why have you been using informal speech
with me this whole time?

458
00:43:02,742 --> 00:43:03,742
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

459
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:05,109
Yes?

460
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:07,842
You're a year younger than me, born in '98?

461
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:13,009
- That's...
- What?

462
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:32,909
Madam, would you like to continue
using your bedroom as is?

463
00:43:34,075 --> 00:43:35,542
We have guest rooms too.

464
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:38,575
Or should I prepare another room?

465
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,109
It's fine.

466
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,842
Are you truly okay with that?

467
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:50,642
Yes.

468
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,075
Thank you.

469
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:09,409
Ugh, I don't know.

470
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:53,275
You know Pungsan Paper, right?

471
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:57,642
It's a small company compared to Gaseong Group,
but a similar uproar happened there.

472
00:44:57,642 --> 00:45:00,409
She seduced the Chairman at a hotel health club

473
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:03,375
and even registered their marriage
without the family knowing.

474
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:07,309
If the marriage registration is complete,
legally there's no problem.

475
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:09,142
So?

476
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,542
There's nothing we can do?

477
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:18,209
At this point, we can pursue
a reserved portion lawsuit,

478
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:19,275
but making this public to the masses...

479
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:21,309
Hey!

480
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:24,075
Whose money was that originally?

481
00:45:24,075 --> 00:45:25,509
It was originally my mother's.

482
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,809
That means it was originally ours!

483
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,175
I know, I get it.

484
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:32,042
But even if we convert
that wealth to current values,

485
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:34,442
Chairman Ga Sung Ho's assets

486
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:38,075
after Madam passed away are far greater.

487
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,842
Watch the situation carefully and mind your words.

488
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,275
Attorney Kim.

489
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,775
Yes.

490
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:13,175
Darn it.

491
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,909
Instead of billing for fees and medical costs

492
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:25,242
and making excuses, use your head.

493
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:27,042
Okay?

494
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:29,375
Come on!

495
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,342
Let's get this right.

496
00:46:58,842 --> 00:46:59,909
Professor.

497
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:02,075
You want Madam to be stuck in this house?

498
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:03,442
The funeral procession is tomorrow.

499
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:05,275
<i>Who's Madam?</i>

500
00:47:05,275 --> 00:47:08,142
Ah, sorry, Professor.

501
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:10,242
You mean keep Kim Yeong Ran

502
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:13,642
from taking a single
step out of this house, right?

503
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:17,342
But how do we stop someone with legs?

504
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:20,675
Ah, yes.

505
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:25,542
Wait, does that mean we'll get something too?

506
00:47:30,742 --> 00:47:33,042
Yes, Professor.

507
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:36,075
Thank you, yes.

508
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:50,209
- Cheol Su.
- Yes?

509
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:52,375
You're on SNS now? Hurry up and follow me!

510
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,475
Ah, why?

511
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:55,809
Hurry up!

512
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:57,675
What's wrong?

513
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:10,775
Why are you doing this to me?

514
00:48:10,775 --> 00:48:13,642
Cheol Su, Cheol Su, Cheol Su.

515
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:14,842
What now?

516
00:48:14,842 --> 00:48:18,409
I think I'm about to get 100 million won.

517
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,209
100 million won?

518
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:22,275
From where?

519
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:26,442
The professor wants us to keep
Yeong Ran detained for a week.

520
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:29,875
But how?

521
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:33,309
I'll handle the brains,
you handle the muscle. Got it?

522
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:34,342
Got it.

523
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:35,942
Wake up early tomorrow morning.

524
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:38,009
Ugh, okay.

525
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:54,975
Hey, friend!

526
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:56,842
Madam!

527
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:01,609
Butler Choi and Yang Cheol Su
are trying to keep you detained.

528
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:04,809
How do you know that?

529
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,175
Me?

530
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:08,909
I eavesdropped in the living room.

531
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:13,142
They said Ga Seon Yeong will
give them 100 million if they hold you.

532
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,342
Oh my, that's...

533
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:42,475
Isn't that club a bit too much?

534
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:45,875
Come on, Yeong Ran has trained in Taekwondo
and Hapkido with several dan ranks,

535
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,475
and yet this still seems insufficient.

536
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:49,275
Right.

537
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,328
[Gold-digger]

538
00:49:57,842 --> 00:49:59,442
Yes, Madam.

539
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:02,375
I brewed some really good coffee for you.

540
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:06,209
I prepared it for you to drink
before the funeral procession.

541
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:07,875
Understood.

542
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,675
Okay.

543
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:01,942
Madam.

544
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:05,975
This is my favorite Costa Rica coffee.

545
