00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,588
(This drama is fictional,
and any resemblance

3
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,333
to real people or events is coincidental.)

4
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,367
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

{\an8}(Episode 6)

6
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,033
{\an8}You're Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, right?

7
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,600
{\an8}Who are you calling?

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,500
{\an8}Ms. Bu Se Mi.

9
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,000
You're not very good at lying, actually.

10
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,200
Don't you remember the first day you saw me
at Chairman Ga Sung Ho's residence?

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
<i>Thank you.</i>

12
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,733
I was going to greet you whenever we
crossed paths because I'm so grateful.

13
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,400
But,

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I only ever saw your back.

15
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,933
I've figured it all out.

16
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,067
But are you still going to pretend?

17
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,567
Yes.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,133
Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

19
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,067
Can you keep pretending
not to know until the end?

20
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,533
I told you at the strawberry field.

21
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,700
That kind of thing doesn't work on me.

22
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,933
Then what do you want?

23
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,267
What will you do with my weakness?

24
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,467
You think I found your weakness?

25
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,867
Jeez, this is really absurd.

26
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,200
I want nothing. Happy now?

27
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,200
If you want something, just say it now.

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,833
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

29
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,733
Is that how you've lived your life?

30
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,200
Covering everything up with money?

31
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:53,667
When people first learn
about my past, they all pity me.

32
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:57,700
Poor family background,
juvenile detention history.

33
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,800
You've read the articles.
You know all this, right?

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
But you know,

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,900
sharing sadness doesn't make it half,
it just becomes a weakness.

36
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,967
A parentless child becomes
an easy target without protectors.

37
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:14,700
'A juvenile delinquent
struggling to survive.'

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,233
And then if something goes missing,

39
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:20,400
they all immediately
suspect me of being the thief.

40
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,233
Will you be any different, Jeon Dong Min?

41
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,800
Then let me ask you this.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,700
Did you look at me with the same eyes
when I was Ms. Bu Se Mi

43
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:34,367
and when I was Kim Yeong Ran?

44
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,333
Since you were Kim Yeong Ran...

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,633
Enough.

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,433
You've changed too, Mr. Jeon.

47
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,733
It's okay. That's human nature.

48
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,233
You wouldn't believe me if I denied it?

49
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,967
Just ask for money instead.

50
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,967
That would be simpler.

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,433
I didn't know you were so eloquent.

52
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,400
But,

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,267
I really won't say anything.

54
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm fine with my money.

55
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:40,033
There are no buses or taxis at this hour.

56
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,167
Don't even ask to borrow my car.

57
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,433
You drank earlier.

58
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,400
Why are you saying
something like that all of a sudden?

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,100
If you're going to leave,

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,767
go when it gets light.

61
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,033
It's dangerous.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,500
I can't run away!

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,133
Nowhere left to run!

64
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,567
Madam.

65
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,733
Did you see the news?

66
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,167
Jeon Dong Min knows my true identity.

67
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,767
What?

68
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:12,567
Why are you so careless, Madam?

69
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,833
We just need to silence
Jeon Dong Min, right?

70
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,367
If you had a plan, why call me?

71
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,767
What's Jeon Dong Min's weakness?

72
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,600
Since he knows mine, I need leverage too.

73
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
His weakness?

74
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,567
Since he's a father,

75
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,200
probably his child?

76
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,667
His child.

78

84
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,033
I talked a lot with Hye Ji today.

85
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,100
We really connected well.

86
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,867
Yeah, good luck.

87
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,800
Are you feeling okay?

88
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,300
Things never work out with women for me.

89
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,067
What's wrong?

90
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:36,467
You can do it.

91
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,800
What's with you?

92
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Hey.

93
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,567
You're back.

94
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:54,767
Friend!

95
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,600
What were you doing?

96
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,433
Getting ready for bed.

97
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,400
I'll sleep on the floor
today. You take the bed.

98
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,200
You're giving me the bed, friend?

99
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,533
Wow! I'm touched.

100
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,533
Oh, smell of alcohol!

101
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:19,100
Let's sleep first and talk more tomorrow.

102
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,533
No, no, no!

103
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,133
Ta-da!

104
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,133
We have to wear this together.

105
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,933
Why do we need to wear it together?

106
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,667
Because it's my wish.

107
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,700
Huh?

108
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, goodness.

109
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,567
Welcome, Attorney Lee.

110
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,767
It's been a while, Attorney Lee.

111
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,900
What are you two doing right now?

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,333
Why are you acting
like you've seen a ghost?

113
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,232
Attorney Lee, we did our research too.

114
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:09,067
About what exactly?

115
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,367
What was late Chairman
Ga Sung Ho's ironclad rule?

116
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,867
It's about hiring all employees
as full-time staff, right?

117
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,933
Both Yang Cheol Su and I
signed full-time contracts.

118
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:20,667
Therefore, unilateral termination
would be considered wrongful dismissal,

119
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:24,133
especially since you're
not even the employer.

120
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:27,233
This has all the signs
of wrongful termination.

121
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,400
Professor's lawyer personally told us.

122
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,067
Oh.

123
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,900
Then go ahead and look it up.

124
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,567
A will.

125
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, Attorney Lee. How did you know?

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,467
You never changed the password?
You missed us too, right?

127
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,667
What exactly do you two want?

128
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,667
Money?

129
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,567
How much do you need?

130
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,867
There's nothing good about staying here.

131
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,600
There's something you
don't know, Attorney Lee.

132
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,900
I love this house too much.

133
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,067
I've worked here for ten years.

134
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,367
If this isn't my home, where else would be?

135
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:06,500
And he said we could use all the cars too.

136
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,767
The inheritance isn't
settled yet. That's illegal.

137
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,433
You're the one who broke the law first!

138
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,233
It's 11 o'clock now,

139
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,267
so return to the annex as per the rules.

140
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:19,900
Wait.

141
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,867
See you tomorrow, Attorney Lee.

142
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,233
We'll meet again tomorrow, Attorney Lee.

143
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,900
This is driving me crazy.

144
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm losing my mind.

145
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,400
Ah, what a relief.

146
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Enough, enough now.

147
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,533
Oh, my goodness.

148
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:58,667
What was it?

149
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,467
Why are those ominous crows...

150
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,967
- Hey.
- Oh, what?

151
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,600
What?

152
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,100
Is there really a ghost in that house?

153
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,433
Why?

154
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,867
Well,

155
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:14,267
during the day,

156
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:17,833
someone put soju in a glass.

157
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,167
Soju?

158
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,167
Attorney Lee can't drink at all.

159
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,200

00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,733
Don't run away.

183
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,867
What does that mean?

184
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,667
Everyone ran away while I was asleep.

185
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,000
My mom, my dad,

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,333
and even ex-boyfriend.

187
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,800
I won't run.

188
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:01,267
If you do, tell me first, okay?

189
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,600
Okay.

190
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,967
Promise me.

191
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,067
Copy.

192
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,933
Friend.

193
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,167
You know Berry Berry Boy.

194
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:28,667
He's handsome, fit,

195
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,033
and though he seems cold,

196
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:36,367
he's actually really thoughtful
when you look closely.

197
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:41,933
He seems like the kind of guy
you could plan a future with, right?

198
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,133
You noticed all that in such a short time.

199
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:51,900
Friend, want to stay here
and grow strawberries with me?

200
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,967
Put down roots here
like these strawberries.

201
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:04,100
<i>Strawberries are sensitive
to temperature and humidity.</i>

202
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,067
<i>But this greenhouse stands firm,</i>

203
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,000
<i>blocking rain, wind, and cold.</i>

204
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,267
<i>It protects them from all that.</i>

205
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,100
<i>Feels secure, doesn't it?</i>

206
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,067
How could a person put down roots?

207
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,367
We're not strawberries.

208
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,967
And we don't have any soil

209
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,733
or greenhouse to protect us.

210
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,100
Vice President.

211
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,367
Where are you going?

212
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,933
You know me.

213
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:51,200
Around this time of year,
I always go to Hawaii to catch some sun.

214
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,400
- Keep up the...
- Wait a second.

215
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,933
Stay in Korea for now.

216
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,300
Why?

217
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,367
Is my sister still furious?

218
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,967
Yes.

219
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:07,733
Get in.

220
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,567
Got it.

221
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,633
I said I got it.

222
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,433
Just get in.

223
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,833
Don't make a scene.

224
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,267
- I said I got it.
- Huh?

225
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,900
I got it.

226
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,300
Mr. Jeon Dong Min!

227
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,333
(Muchang Strawberries)

228
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:41,067
You really didn't run away?

229
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,667
I told you escaping isn't an option.

230
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,067
Are you going to expose who I am?

231
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,333
You still don't trust me.

232
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,433
Dong Min.

233
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,133
I got really close with
Ms. Hye Ji yesterday.

234
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,033
Yeah, you mentioned that yesterday.

235
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,733
Oh, but Ms. Hye Ji kept

236
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,133
asking questions about you.

237
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:23,733
Like who Ju Won's mom is, where she is...

238
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,633
And?

239
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,767
So, um...

240
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,667
I said Ju Won's mom left you
for a rich guy and is living happily now.

241
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,100
Told her not to get any ideas about you.

242
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,933
Tae Min.

243
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,067
Did I say something wrong again?

244
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,733
Jeez, forget it.

245
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,600
Don't fall for Baek Hye Ji.

246
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,033
Wait, are you into her?

247
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,333
I'm not interested at all.

248
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,533
Ms. Baek Hye Ji

249
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,133
doesn't seem interested in you at all.

250
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,133
So don't waste your time and energy on her.

251
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,533
She could leave any day, man.

252
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,667
Oh, Miss. What brings you here?

253
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:00,833
Hello.

254
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,233
I came to help pick strawberries.

255
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,567
That's so kind.

256
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:04,800
Here, use this one.

257
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,333
- I can grab a new one.
- It's fine.

258
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,067
Really, it's okay.

259
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,300
Are you afraid I'll say something?

260
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
I can't deny that.

261
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,067
I told you, I won't say anything.

262
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,967
Wow, Miss. You're great
at picking strawberries.

263
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,633
I tend to pick things
up quickly once I learn.

264
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,167
You're a genius. A genius!

265
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:29,967
Huh?

266
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,367
A vice president runs the
company into the ground,

267
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:42,133
and Vice President Ga Seon Woo

268
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,933
is trying to sell shares to a Chinese firm.

269
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:47,367
This could lead to legal issues.
He might lose his executive position.

270
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,200
Then who should we appoint as CEO?

271
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Director Ga Seon Yeong
has only worked at the university.

272
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,767
What does she know about management?

273
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,733
But she's the founder's descendant.

274
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,600
By that logic, the widow also qualifies.

275
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,733
(Kim Dong Wook) She's bound
to become the largest shareholder.

276
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,867
(Park Yong Guk)

277
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:07,833
Even the stubborn Chairman Ga
is helpless around women.

278
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,767
Director Park, did you really not know?

279
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:17,533
Director Ga called for this meeting
but hasn't come yet?

280
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,267
Professor Ga Seon Yeong

281
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,033
informed us she can't attend
today's board meeting.

282
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,033
Unbelievable.

283
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,600
Someone from academia
breaking schedules like this?

284
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,667
Jeez.

285
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:36,400
And the press conference originally scheduled
for tomorrow has been moved up to today at 2 p.m.

286
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
Who changed it? Vice President Ga Seon Woo?

287
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,233
That's all the updates.

288
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:49,833
(Park Yong Guk)

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,500
<i>Didn't we all propose this?</i>

290
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,767
<i>A professional management system</i>

291
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,667
<i>is the future of our Gaseong Group...</i>

292
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,867
They are all speaking so carelessly
like it's someone else's company.

293
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,500
Everyone all acted like loyal subordinates
in front of Ga Sung Ho.

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,900
Where's Seon Woo?

295
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,200
He's confined to a
Gangwon-do resort with guards.

296
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,233
Hello.

297
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, hello.

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,967
I'm Ga Seon Yeong.

299
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,067
Did I surprise you?

300
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,667
You're here to see me because of the article
about Vice President Ga Seon Woo, right?

301
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,000
I can't reveal my sources.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,767
That's the journalist's principle.

303
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,267
That's why I looked into you,

304
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,333
but my purpose today

305
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,300
isn't about that.

306
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,500
I have some information
to share with you too.

307
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,900
Seon Woo might have his flaws,
but he's not a bad person.

308
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,267
At today's press conference, he's going to
step down from Gaseong Group management.

309
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,600
Then what exactly is this document?

310
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,133
Documents regarding Gaseong
Group's board members.

311
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:15,333
Though Gaseong Group thrived
thanks to the Korean Wave trend,

312
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,033
there were many internal issues.

313
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,967
You'll understand once you review them.

314
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,000
In our family, I yielded my position
to Seon Woo simply because I'm a woman,

315
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,800
but now I want to lead
Gaseong Group with integrity.

316
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,500
You want me to break this story?

317
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
The essence of journalism
is objectivity, isn't it?

318
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,700
I don't think you released that recording
to harm Gaseong Group

319
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,200
or to make Seon Woo look bad.

320
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,633
I believe you did it out of professional
integrity because you believe in

321
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,200
your mission as a
journalist, to reveal the truth.

322
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,933
Am I wrong?

323
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,333
Let me examine the documents first.

324
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,767
We'll handle media outreach
separately from our side.

325
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,200
Wait and see. She's going to blow
this story wide open.

326
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,667
People like her actually
believe in journalistic principles

327
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,100
and have a sense of mission.

328
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,600
Darn it.

329
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,448
Darn it.

330
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:57,433
Pick up the phone, you punk!

331
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,500
Hey.

332
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,400
What happened to Lee Don?

333
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,133
They let him out?

334
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,933
Darn it.

335
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,867
Nothing is working out.

336
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Hey.

337
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,167
Come pick me up right now.

338
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:24,400
<i>Bring my in-law and that woman
with you when you come.</i>

339
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,967
How much will you pay?

340
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:30,233
<i>I said I'll pay. 100 million won!</i>

341
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,900
Understood.

342
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,067
Ah, darn it.

343
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,233
Oh, you startled me.

344
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:53,000
Ma'am.

345
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,967
Shall we go meet your in-law?

346
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,300
- Hands.
- Ma'am, hands.

347
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,433
Dad.

348
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,367
This!

349
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:28,433
Well, ham is something you eat
occasionally. Didn't I say that?

350
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,667
I want to eat it. Can't
I just have it today?

351
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,967
You had it a few days ago, so no.

352
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
<i>His weakness?</i>

353
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,400
<i>Well, since he's a
father, probably his child?</i>

354
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,467
I want to eat it.

355
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
You?

356
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,533
Yes, I really want some.

357
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,733
Could you grill it just for today?

358
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,533
Well, if you insist.

359
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,133
Give me that.

360
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:07,100
Dong Min, this kimchi stew
is absolutely perfect today.

361
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,700
Of course.

362
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,933
It's delicious.

363
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,967
Dong Min.

364
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:26,300
Isn't there anything we can do
at your strawberry house?

365
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,967
Our operation isn't that big,

366
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,600
so Tae Min alone can handle it.

367
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,533
Hye Ji, you should come too.

368
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,400
Why? Miss used to come help
with the early morning work, right?

369
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,867
Friend.

370
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,867
Want to teach ballet at our kindergarten?

371
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:48,333
Oh no, that's nonsense.

372
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,133
Come on.

373
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,067
No, that's okay.

374
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,167
Shall I show you again now?

375
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,900
No need... Just focus
on your meal at the table.

376
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,400
Hurry up and eat.

377
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Eat up.

378
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,033
What are you doing? Why are you like this?

379
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,233
No.

380
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,533
This isn't acceptable.

381
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,300
This is absolutely not acceptable.

382
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,167
Miss, even if you're friends,
you can't just ask me to hire anyone.

383
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,600
I can't do that.

384
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,033
Look, the kindergarten
has financial problems, and also...

385
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,100
Don't worry about finances.

386
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,933
I'll cover Ms. Baek Hye Ji's salary myself.

387
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,167
Miss, why are you really doing this?

388
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,333
Did you do anything wrong to...

389
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,533
Principal.

390
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,300
Mr. Jeon Dong Min

391
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,900
discovered my true identity.

392
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,433
Why were you so careless?

393
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,000
If everyone who knows my true identity

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,967
remains within my sight,
I can keep them under control.

395
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,800
I need to ask you a favor.

396
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,833
Yes.

397
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,633
I guess there's no choice.

398
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,167
Our dear Ms. Bu Se Mi.

399
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,300
I see what you mean.

400
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,167
Sit.

401
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,067
That's right.

402
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,700
Wait.

403
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,733
Sit.

404
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,233
There you go. Good.

405
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,033
Dong Min, I heard

406
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,433
you found out Ms. Bu's true identity.

407
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:22,533
So what did you get in return

408
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:25,333
for keeping her real identity a secret?

409
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,667
Money? Land? Or...

410
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,700
Oh, so you did make a deal?

411
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
No, no.

412
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,333
You trust me, right?

413
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,733
I didn't start this. She proposed it first.

414
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,333
Trust me.

415
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,900
I need to go to the restroom.

416
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,867
What? That makes it even weirder.

417
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,500
Good morning, everyone.

418
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,200
Hello, Miss.

419
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,900
You look beautiful as always today.

420
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Miss, did you dream about me?

421
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,800
No wonder, I had a really good dream.

422
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,500
You'll ride in my car, right?

423
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,133
I even have ginger tea in it, Miss.

424
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:06,200
Ah, I already agreed to ride with Dong Min.

425
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,233
Maybe next time, thanks.

426
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,367
Hello, Dong Min.

427
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:10,467
Have a nice day.

428
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,167
- Yes.
- Good work today.

429
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,133
You said you were going with me?

430
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,833
Are you spying on me?
Are you afraid I'll tell?

431
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,367
'I don't need money or anything else.'

432
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,100
How am I supposed to
trust someone who says that?

433
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,433
Then what will make you trust me?

434
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,067
We'll figure that out over time.
For now, let's go.

435
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,967
We'll be late for kindergarten.

436
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:47,300
<i>Recent exposes about Gaseong Group Vice President
Ga Seon Woo's abuse of power and corruption</i>

437
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,967
<i>have sparked nationwide boycotts
of Gaseong Ramyeon products.</i>

438
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,167
<i>Vice President Ga Seon Woo is suspected of</i>

439
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,400
<i>trying to manipulate stock prices
by mobilizing certain forces...</i>

440
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,033
Ju Won's been so
rebellious lately. Never listens.

441
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,033
Seven-year-olds are terrifying.

442
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,033
Don't try to change the subject.

443
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,233
I check the news daily.

444
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,233
I don't know much about chaebols,

445
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:22,367
but if stock prices are affected,
wouldn't people get more sensitive?

446
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,233
That's how it's shown in dramas.

447
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:28,400
This is my first time dealing with something
like this too, so I'm not sure yet.

448
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I wasn't great at math back in school.

449
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,867
Were you good at it?

450
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,633
Of course I wasn't.

451
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,767
Thought so.

452
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,300
Enjoy your meal.

453
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,333
Thank you for the food.

454
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,767
I hate carrots.

455
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,767
Carrots are a secret.

456
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,367
Secret.

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,367
Miss, let's have snacks
and play hair salon.

458
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,833
Alright.

459
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,833
(Baek Hye Ji's Resume)

460
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:27,033
You really had the elite path, huh?

461
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,000
Is this Iseon Kids or what?

462
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,100
Oh, Lord.

463
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,967
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

464
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:41,467
Let's skip formalities.
We both know the truth.

465
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,567
That's exactly what I wanted, Principal.

466
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,667
Since when have you known Madam's name?

467
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,500
Since she came into
Chairman Ga's household.

468
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,300
Oh, so not very long then.

469
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,667
It's longer than your time.

470
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,633
Didn't know that, did you?

471
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,700
In relationships, what's
more important than how long?

472
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,100
Depth. It's about depth.

473
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,833
What do you want from Madam?

474
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,500
Me?

475
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,900
I want to eat together and watch movies.

476
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,800
But you,

477
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,233
here talk about emotional depth,

478
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,933
yet want something else, huh?

479
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,333
No, no, no.

480
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,633
What 'something else'?

481
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,067
I'm just trying to show

482
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:32,933
that Madam and I have a somewhat

483
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:36,867
special relationship, that's important.

484
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,233
Do you think Madam sees it that way too?

485
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,000
Huh?

486
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,567
- I'm the prince.
- What?

487
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:50,067
I said I'm the prince.

488
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,000
What's this sound?

489
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,833
What's this sound?

490
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,867
- I'm the prince.
- I'm telling you, I'm the prince.

491
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:02,500
- Go away.
- No! I'm the prince!

492
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,000
- I'm the prince.
- I'll add another one.

493
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,633
Yes.

494
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,833
You look pretty. Now you're a princess.

495
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:13,867
Yeah?

496
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,267
- I'm the prince.
- I'm telling you, I'm the prince.

497
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,433
Strawberry class.

498
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,200
Everyone focus. Quiet!

499
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Quiet! Quiet!

500
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,833
Oh, my.

501
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,667
Ms. Bu Se Mi became a princess.

502
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:26,667
Pretty, right?

503
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,767
So pretty.

504
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,900
- Yes.
- Wow, friend.

505
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,833
The crown's really beautiful.

506
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,067
No! Construction!
Dangerous! Principal! Principal!

507
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,867
Thank you. Thank you.

508
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,133
What's happening?

509
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,833
What are you doing right now?

510
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,400
What are you doing? Wait, this is...

511
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,533
Oh my, what...

512
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,133
What are you doing right now?

513
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,033
The landowner

514
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,867
asked us to dig here
along the yellow line on this map.

515
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:15,267
Sir, this is a kindergarten.

516
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,100
Jeez.

517
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,433
Can't you see the children?

518
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,700
We're just doing what we were told.

519
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,867
Kang Seong Tae!

520
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,733
I'll kill this punk!

521
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:31,867
Huh? Hey!

522
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,667
You! What are you doing? You!

523
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,700
Oh, my.

524
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,933
Wait, this is...

525
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:39,267
- Oh my, friend.
- Principal.

526
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:43,267
Friend!

527
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,633
Are you okay?

528
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,000
Madam... I mean, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

529
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,733
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

530
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,600
Principal and teachers should go that way.

531
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,700
Go quickly.

532
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,400
- Take care of the children first.
- Kids first.

533
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Follow your teacher.

534
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,633
Come on kids, I'll take you.

535
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,067
Hey, stop!

536
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,400
You just touched my stuff, huh? Huh?

537
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,800
You're both trespassing on my land.

538
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,933
- Film this.
- Got it.

539
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,667
Stop filming.

540
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,733
No, keep filming.

541
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,300

What if the kids get
hurt while playing here?

543
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,033
Then don't let them play here.

544
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:27,367
Not my problem.

545
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,567
What did you just say?

546
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,933
- Dong Min.
- Keep recording.

547
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,200
Hello? Yes, police station?

548
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,467
This is Iseon Kindergarten in Muchang.

549
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:41,533
There are intruders trespassing
on private property.

550
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:44,233
An innocent citizen is being harassed.

551
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,133
Please dispatch officers immediately.

552
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:48,267
Okay.

553
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,367
- Did you get it on film?
- Yes.

554
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,567
Got it all, right?

555
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,167
Good job.

556
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
You threatening me now?

557
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,467
Got all the evidence.

558
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,600
Trespassing on private property.

559
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,533
I'll make sure you two

560
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,567
rot in jail.

561

562
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:07,500
Could the will really be here?

563
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,200
I've searched everywhere for days.

564
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,333
This is the only place left.

565
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:17,133
But if we keep entering the wrong password

566
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,433
and it locks permanently.

567
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,233
That would be terrible.

568
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,767
If the will's there,
I'll stake my life on it.

- Don, Don.

571
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,833
Big trouble.

572
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,133
Ms. Bu Se Mi got arrested.

573
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,100
Police?

574
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,067
No, background check.

575
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,933
Attorney Lee, where are you going?

576
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,633
Why do you care?

577
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,133
Are you two a package deal?

578
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,833
Why not just date already?

579
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,300
Attorney!

580
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,167
You are crossing the line.

581
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,567
And stop touching the
chairman's belongings.

582
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,500
That's all illegal.

583
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,700
How could he say that?

584
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,300
- Hey.
- Yes.

585
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,333
We're only five years apart.

586
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,033
Is dating such a bad idea?

587
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,800
Gosh, I miss Hye Ji
who has 100 million won.

588
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,133
I wonder who she's hanging out with.

589
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,867
Attorney Lee is rushing off somewhere.

590
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,367
<i>Follow him.</i>

591
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,033
Yes, understood.

592
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,200
I feel like I can breathe again now.

593
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,533
Are you sure Lee Don knows
where Kim Yeong Ran is hiding?

594
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:06,267
According to that lady,

595
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:09,867
Kim Yeong Ran entrusted
everything to that lawyer.

596
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,467
So, he'd know, of course.

597
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,033
Wait, but...

598
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:17,733
Why keep those women at the resort?

599
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:21,733
I did something wrong to my sister.

600
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:24,000
They're hostages until
we catch Kim Yeong Ran.

601
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,367
You're really scared of her.

602
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,100
Hey.

603
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,000
You mocking me?

604
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,100
Oh, sorry.

605
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,567
If you've never been through it, shut up.

606
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,867
Hey.

607
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,033
What happened?

608
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,167
Hey, hey, hey.

609
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,500
Why are you so scared?

610
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,067
Are we really allowed to
eat as much as we want?

611
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,733

620
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:52,467
This is cheap stuff, Professor.

621
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:53,500
How much?

622
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,167
20,000 won.

623
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,667

735

These two trespassed
on my private property.

excavated with the excavator?

This entire area belongs
to Mr. Kang Seong Tae.

766

Unfortunately, these two
violated private property.

You've put up barbed wire?

770
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:32,100
Yes, I did.

771
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,233
This is standard for
protecting private property.

Ah, doubtful.

773
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:39,667
According to Article
13 of the Criminal Code,

774
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,700
a crime requires intent to be established,

775
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,367
and negligence isn't punishable
unless specially stated by law.

776
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:49,533
Also, per Supreme Court precedent,

777
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:53,300
trespassing requires clear intent.

778
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,567
So, did you two

clearly intend to trespass?

You'll need to prepare compensation
for physical and emotional damages.

- And he disrupted kindergarten classes, right?
- Yes.

00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:55,700
Kim Yeong Ran!

907
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,967
Miss.

908
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:14,367
What are you doing?

909
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:16,233
Hey!

910
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,433
Grab her.

911
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,800
Stay there. Hey!

912
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,267
- Get down.
- Get down!

913
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:21,867
Hey!

914
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,167
They are following us.

915
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:47,133
Come on, hurry up!

916
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:57,000
Step on it harder!

917
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,933
Get out now.

918
00:56:50,733 --> 00:56:52,933
I said get out!

919
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:55,000
What are you doing?

920
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,067
Ah, jeez.

921
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,133
Miss, just stay here.

922
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:09,633
Darn.

923
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:11,633
What are you guys?

924
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:13,133
You get lost.

925
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,533
Kim Yeong Ran.

926
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:17,400
Let's handle this peacefully, okay?

927
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,600
I said let's go.

928
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:12,433
What are you doing?

929
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:13,867
Hey, you go.

930
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,633
You finish this. Huh?

931
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,300
1 billion won.

932
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,100
2 billion won.

933
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,533
I'll give you 2 billion won.
Hurry up and finish it off. I'm hungry.

934
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:25,167
2 billion won? Okay.

935
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,667
Are you insane?

936
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,600
What the heck?

937
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:10,833
Let's go too.

938
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:12,967
Quickly, quickly.

939
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,633
- Darn it.
- Boss.

940
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,267
Hey, run.

941
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:40,267
Mr. Jeon Dong Min, I'm sorry.

942
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:44,367
I didn't realize others
might get hurt because of me.

943
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,500
I'll leave Muchang.

944
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:58,133
What are you doing?

945
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:09,200
What is this place?

946
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
<i>Re-routing due to deviation from path.</i>

947
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,733
This stupid GPS isn't working!

948
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,133
Come on.

949
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:24,167
Darn it.

950
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,233
No!

951
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,667
This is Moodeave.

952
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,633
Muchang's Maldives.

953
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:13,933
Only I call it that.

954
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:16,833
Coming here clears my mind.

955
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,067
Oh, but there's no mojito.

956
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,033
I'll bring some next time.

957
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:26,967
Don't overdo it.

958
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:31,667
Miss.

959
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:34,900
Are you really going to leave Muchang?

960
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,400
When you, Chairman Ga
Sung Ho's wife, came down,

961
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,000
you changed your name and identity
to avoid the bereaved,

962
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,500
you didn't come here
for some getaway or healing, right?

963
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,267
In Muchang,

964
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,800
please stay as Ms. Bu Se Mi.

965
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:08,733
Ju Won likes you more than anyone.

966
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,900
You said sorrow doesn't halve when shared,

967
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,967
but it becomes a weakness, right?

968
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,567
I'll protect you,

969
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,167
so it won't become a weakness.

970
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:28,000
No matter what happens.

971
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:32,967
Why are you protecting me?

972
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,067
And how can I trust your words?

973
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:40,300
Wow, you really don't trust people.

974
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,900
Should we make a written contract?

975
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,900
I'll take your silence as agreement.

976
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,900
Want to try it too, Miss?

977
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:02,467
Kim So Yeong?

978
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:04,433
Oh, jeez.

979
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:09,067
This young brat...

980
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:12,133
How dare you call elders by name?

981
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,233
Secretary Ham.

982
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:20,867
Yes, Professor.

983
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,533
Tell Lee Don.

984
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:27,400
If Kim Yeong Ran doesn't show up,

985
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,167
we'll kill her mother.

986
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:31,900
Understood.

01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,733
{\an8}please tell me first.

995
01:06:24,733 --> 01:06:27,667
{\an8}We have a visitor.

996
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,100
{\an8}Ms. Bu Se Mi.

997
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,233
{\an8}My daughter!

998
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:31,667
{\an8}How did you get here?

999
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:34,400
{\an8}Shouldn't you repay my care?

1000
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,500
{\an8}It's been a while.

1001
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,233
{\an8}I called you for a favor.

1002
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:38,233
{\an8}Ju Won.

1003
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:39,500
{\an8}How dare you do this to me!

1004
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,933
{\an8}I'm used to being in charge.
Being the weaker party feels strange.

1005
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:45,067
{\an8}What? Ju Won's missing?

1006
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,167
{\an8}If anything happens to Ju Won,
I won't forgive you.
