- Be quiet.

182
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,788
Oh, jeez.

183
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:45,121
Where is she rushing off to?

184
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,988
Hey, I've got an emergency. I'll be back.

185
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:49,788
Good luck with your confession.

Where did she go?

188
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,988
Corn.

189
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:13,488
When the corn grows tall, tall, tall,

190
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,621
pick the corn, knock, knock, knock,

191
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,755
peel off the husk, shuck, shuck, shuck,

192
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:19,821
then the corn is plump, plump, plump!

193
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,221
You startled me.

195

Make some noise when you walk!

196
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,621
I'm the owner of this house,

197
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,821
yet I feel like a squatter in my own home.

198
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:32,755
Oh, what a scare.

199
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:37,988
Nobody here is normal, including Madam.

200
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:39,221
Ugh, what should I do?

[Practical Assignment for 'Field Practice']
I need to upload this quickly.

202

The moon today

203
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:54,955

There...

209
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:54,921
He disappeared near here, right?

210
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,521
Yes.

211

By the way, where are we?

212
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:00,488
It's the lodging for the farmhands.

213
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,421
I think the only place he could run to is here.

214
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:03,555
I'll go check it out.

215
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:04,821
Oh, wait a minute.

I'll go check. Wait here for a bit.

It's not.

Oh, nothing.

That person had a scar on their collarbone.

227
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:10,821
It would be useful if you remembered that too.

Not Mr. Jeon Dong Min, not Mr. Jeon, not Teacher.

It's old-fashioned.

262

Old-fashioned?

00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:42,555
I don't care about what's trendy.

that your people have a great reputation
for doing good work.

329

They really are good.

So, by the way,

could you share them with me?

I was walking last night

358
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:12,385
and saw a suspicious person
lurking at the village entrance.
