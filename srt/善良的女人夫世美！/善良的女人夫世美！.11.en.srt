I'm sorry, Chairman.

00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:26,791
You want to give up everything and die now?

10
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:38,824
Chairman.

11
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:43,758
Chairman, you were alive all along?

12

Chairman.

13

Attorney Lee.

15
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:54,358
Did you know about this too?

16
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,024
Madam.

17
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,858
What have you two... What on earth did you do!

18
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,224
Explain yourselves.

19
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,858
Why don't you let go of me and talk?

20
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,391
Yeong Ran, stop!

21
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,524
Chairman.

22
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:12,291
Have you been toying with me all this time?

23
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,824
Must've been fun, huh?

24
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:17,491
Had fun watching me fight for my life?

25
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:19,791
It wasn't that fun.

26
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,524
So you knew everything?

27
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,124
Do you even know

28
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:28,791
how many people got hurt because of you?

29
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,458
So what?

30
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,358
You're broke, but still righteous, huh?

31
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,291
Did you think changing your life was that easy?

32
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,658
You want to give up everything now?

33
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:47,191

Madam, were you really trying to die?

38
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,924
Chairman.

39
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:03,258
No, I'm fine.

40
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,591
When I pointed the gun at her head,
everything became clear.

41
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:09,491
Even if I die,

42
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,858
Ga Seon Yeong wouldn't release Jeon Dong Min.

43
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,458
She'd pin all her crimes on me.

44
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,158
And make Jeon Dong Min look like an accomplice.

45
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,924
Obviously.

46
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:22,358
Now you're thinking like Seon Yeong.

47
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:23,958
Chairman.

48
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:29,324
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

49
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:32,691
I'm a businessman.

50

I always need multiple
contingency plans to survive.

51
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,558

52

Our relationship

56
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:54,491

Not only leave my assets,

61
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:12,391
but also pass the Gaseong Group
chairmanship to Kim Yeong Ran.

62
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:15,724
You're giving Madam
the Gaseong Group chair position too?

63
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:20,091
That's the only way to use Gaseong Group's power.

Seon Yeong control everything?

70
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:04,924

77
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:30,491

Before the shareholders' meeting?

85
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:04,558
By hiding in Muchang and killing the hitman,

86
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,224
you've blown our plan to reveal all of

87

88
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:13,291
Will revealing this really give us any leverage?

89
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,958
At the very least, it'll help us clear

90
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,658

91
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:24,491

In Korea, there's nothing money can't buy.

108
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:24,258
Why are you even doing this, Attorney Lee?

109
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,624
Is it just for the success fee?

110
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:28,758
Of course.

111
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,591
I'm being paid more than I could ever earn

113
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,424
Is that all there is to it?

114
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:41,691
Chairman Ga was the one who helped me
when I was a poor student,

115
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:44,558
he gave me scholarships.

116
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,958
I'm repaying that debt now.

117
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,158
Let me ask you instead.

118
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:53,258
Why did you choose to get involved in this,
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran?

119
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,591
You could die,

120
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,391
or even end up killing someone else.

121
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:00,358
Was it really just about the money?

122
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,791
At first, it was all about money.
But now, it's my revenge too.

123
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,824
I won't let her get away with using money

124
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:13,658
and influence to frame innocent people.

125
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:17,124
I'll expose everything
Ga Seon Yeong did through Gil Ho Se

126
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,558

127

131

What about these two?

132
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,624

Yes, don't worry.

135

- Okay.
- That's right.

149
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,158
Hey.

150
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:11,591
I'll look into this quietly,
so keep your mouth shut.

151

I'll know it came from you, got it?

154

Eat?

155
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:27,124

156

Madam.

158
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:41,124
You've been going to the study quite often lately.

159
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:44,924
Isn't Attorney Lee the only one in there?

160
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,458
Why are you so curious about that?

161
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,091

162

even if we're house staff,
firing us overnight like this

165
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,224
is wrongful termination.

166
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:03,358

168
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,558

Okay, maybe her, but why me?

Madam, I'll delete all of it.

179
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:35,491
At least give us some time to pack before we go.

180
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:37,591
How despicable and petty. Really.

181

But how did you track down Gil Ho Se anyway?

228
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:23,724
I investigated through Jeong Woo and found that

229
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:27,158
Gil Ho Se had ties to Ga Seon Yeong going back to

230

They also met at a small theater
on the day Ga Seon Woo died.

prepared in advance by Ga Seon Yeong.

00:38:57,108 --> 00:38:58,542
Oh.

542
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:02,075
Could you deliver this for me?

543
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:04,642
When Ms. Bu Se Mi gave her final class
at the kindergarten,

544
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,108
[Ms. Bu Se Mi, I miss you, from Ju Won]
the kids wrote these letters to her.

545
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:09,175
Okay, got it.

546
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:12,842
By the way, where's the civil affairs office here?

547
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,475
Why the civil affairs office all of a sudden?

548
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:17,508
I collected petitions from the villagers.

549
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:20,675
We need to actively publicize Dong Min's
unfair situation and get him out quickly.

550
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:22,808
You don't have to go this far.

551
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:23,808
Dong Min will be released soon.

552
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,375
Just go back now.

553
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,375
No...

554
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,742
- Mi Seon.
- Yes.

555
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:28,908
They said the civil affairs office is that way.

556
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,108
Lee Don, we'll handle things here.
Don't worry too much.

557
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,108
Don, focus on what you can do.

558
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:36,108
I'll do what I can.

559
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,142
Let's hurry.

560
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,775
- Don, good luck.
- This way?

561
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:40,675
- Don, stay strong.
- That's not it.

562
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:43,075
- Mi Seon, it's here.
- Come quick.

563
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:49,108
Yeah, that's my sister.

564
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,742
Ms. Baek Hye Ji finished her testimony well.

565
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:09,142
Director Kim says she'll be better
after a few more days in the hospital.

566
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:11,208
Madam, and this...

567
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,742
These are letters written
by the kindergarten children themselves.

568
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,837
[Ms. Bu Se Mi, I miss you, from Ju Won]

569
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:26,075
I thought you'd want to know.
The autopsy results just came in.

570
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,408
The gunpowder residue and fingerprints

571
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:30,342
all match Gil Ho Se.

572
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:34,742
It's concluded as him killing Ga Seon Woo
before committing suicide.

573
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:37,842
Dong Min will be released soon.

574
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:40,475
That was remarkably fast.

575
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:44,142
Madam, I'm Lee Don.

576
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:50,608
Now let's return the favor
to Ga Seon Yeong as she deserves.

577
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,342
Let's do that.

578
00:41:04,975 --> 00:41:07,142
- Don.
- Yeah.

579
00:41:07,142 --> 00:41:09,908
Ah, though you already know each other,
I'll introduce properly.

580
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:11,608
This is the heir of Gaseong Group,

581
00:41:11,608 --> 00:41:14,742
not a gold digger, but Madam Kim Yeong Ran.

582
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,808
Seung Hee, sit down.

583
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,442
Okay.

584
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:26,475
I asked to meet you because I had
something important to deliver.

585
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,675
What's this?

586
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:33,375
Real name Gil Tae, alias Gil Ho Se.

587
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:37,075
Autopsies confirm Gil Ho Se
is Ga Seon Woo's murderer.

588
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:40,708
And there's testimony that

589
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,208
he tried to kill me in Muchang.

590
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,375
What exactly was the relationship
between Ga Seon Woo and Gil Ho Se?

591
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,808
Not Ga Seon Woo, but Ga Seon Yeong.

592
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:52,775
They met through the Cheongsan Prison
rehabilitation program.

593
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:56,842
They developed a deep connection from then on.

594
00:41:56,842 --> 00:42:00,308
You're saying she killed her own brother?

595
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,075
That's impossible.

596
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:06,375
Such impossible things
happen frequently around here.

597
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:11,308
Reporter Pyo, you should also get payback
from Ga Seon Yeong for what she did.

598
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:14,775
But last time too,
all the articles got blocked from above.

599
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,175
That absolutely won't happen this time.

600
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:19,008
Don't worry.

601
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:23,375
Wait a minute.

602
00:42:24,908 --> 00:42:27,975
It appears that Professor Ga Seon Yeong has been
meeting Gil Ho Se, whose real name is Gil Tae,

603
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:30,942
a prisoner she met
through the rehabilitation program

604
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:33,842
at Cheongsan Prison, until recently.

605
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,442
So what?

606
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:38,542
Gil Ho Se was also at the dock
where Vice President Ga Seon Woo died,

607
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,275
yet no news or records mention it.

608
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,142
Doesn't that seem suspicious?

609
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:45,708
Ten days ago, he even attempted
to kill Kim Yeong Ran.

610
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:49,408
We've secured all the witness
and victim testimonies from the scene.

611
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:52,875
Senior, are you going to let this
exclusive story slip away?

612
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:56,442
Let's do this.

613
00:42:56,442 --> 00:42:57,475
Really?

614
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:58,775
Release it.

615
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,775
Reporting the truth is our mission, right?

616
00:43:05,108 --> 00:43:08,442
Senior! So should I really write the article?

617
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,208
Professor.

618
00:43:18,575 --> 00:43:20,175
Professor Ga Seon Yeong.

619
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:21,508
What brings you here?

620
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:22,875
You know Gil Ho Se, right?

621
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,608
On the day Mr. Ga Seon Woo died, the last person
he met was you, Ms. Ga Seon Yeong.

622
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:29,208
We'll need your full cooperation
with the investigation.

623
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,308
Wait a moment.

624
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:35,508
That day, I was the one who met
Gil Ho Se, not Professor.

625
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,108
What?

626
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:51,175
<i>The subscriber you are calling
is not available. After the tone...</i>

627

evidence of his sister being the mastermind]

632
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,275
The humiliation you suffered,

633
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:26,642
I'm repaying it in full.

634
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:15,575
Madam.

635
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,475
Are you here?

636
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:22,075
You're not, are you?

637
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:29,575
It's dirty and despicable, really...

638
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:33,008
Still wet behind the ears, and you,

639
00:45:33,008 --> 00:45:36,408
rising in status through marriage, huh?

640
00:45:36,408 --> 00:45:37,708
'Get out right now?'

641
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:40,408
Fine, I'll leave immediately.

642
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:44,675
But I'm taking my severance pay with me.

643
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:49,308
I worked my butt off in this house.

644
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:56,775
But,

645
00:45:56,775 --> 00:46:01,975
I was trying to set everything
back to where it belonged.

646
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:26,675
I ordered Gil Ho Se to kill Kim Yeong Ran.

647
00:46:26,675 --> 00:46:29,342
You know abetment of murder
is treated as murder itself, right?

648
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:31,008
Mr. Ham Hyeon Woo.

649
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:33,175
You've worked as Secretary
to Ms. Ga Seon Yeong for a long time, right?

650
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:36,975
Moreover, both Kim Yeong Ran and Baek Hye Ji
survived attempted murders.

651
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:38,242
One count of murder,

652
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:41,308
and two counts of attempted murder.

653
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:45,108
You'll likely face at least ten years in prison.

654
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:47,408
How much is Ga Seon Yeong offering?

655
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:50,942
I'll remain silent until my lawyer arrives.

656
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:21,575
It was definitely Chairman, right?

657
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:22,842
Chairman.

658
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:25,542
It's really you, right?

660
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:42,475
He's warm.

661
00:48:49,342 --> 00:48:53,242
Chairman, you're alive?

662
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:55,775
Give me some water.

663
00:48:57,608 --> 00:49:01,175
Yes, yes, Chairman.

664
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,908
Chairman.

665
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,875
Here, drink some water.

671
00:49:32,175 --> 00:49:34,808
Do you remember me?

00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:37,708
It's me, Butler Choi.

673
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,608

674
00:49:49,842 --> 00:49:51,675
No.

676
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,208
Look here.

677
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,475
One, two.

678
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:01,408
Oh, splendid.

679
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:04,442
Now, let's take one together too.

680
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:07,142
One, two, three.

681
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,908
Chairman.

682
00:50:13,908 --> 00:50:16,908
Do you remember Kim Yeong Ran?

683
00:50:16,908 --> 00:50:19,342
She was your security guard.

684
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:21,842
Who?

685
00:50:21,842 --> 00:50:25,942
Ah, the plain-looking one with the pitiful face.

686
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,442
Yeah.

687
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,208
Exactly.

688
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:33,242
A face that doesn't even stick in memory.

689
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:38,775
Let me escort you to the bedroom, Chairman.

690
00:50:38,775 --> 00:50:40,808
Here.

691
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:47,275
Hold your cane.

692
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:50,775

00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:12,675

701
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,808

Yes, so you want me to

turn off all the house CCTV

715

756
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:32,216
Why are you so late?

757
