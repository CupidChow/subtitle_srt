00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,658
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL,
AND ANY RESEMBLANCE

2
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,533
TO REAL PEOPLE OR EVENTS
IS COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,584
EPISODE 3

4
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:50,650
My money, my choice!

5
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,658
MUCHANG SILVER TOWN
OFFERS THE BEST FACILITIES!

6
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,584
Come on, why object
when I'm using my own money

7
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,650
to develop my own land
and build my own building?

8
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,715
This is exactly the kind of thing

9
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:03,017
that blocks Muchang's
growth and development...

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,817
Muchang strawberries are here!

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,550
Korea's most delicious strawberries
from Muchang.

12
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,317
MUCHANG STRAWBERRIES

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,567
Hey, Jeon Dong Min. Will you turn that off?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,717
You turn it off.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,517
This is right in front of a kindergarten.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,027
The kids are about to start class.

17
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,450
You know this is clearly
disrupting their lesson, right?

18
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,684
Whatever.

19
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:30,850
And seriously, how many students
does this kindergarten even have?

20
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,967
Stop getting in my way.

21
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:37,000
Sorry about that, I'll continue.

22
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,517
Our respected citizens of Muchang,

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,300
during all this time...

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,567
Oh, Jeong Woo! Perfect timing!

25
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,150
Perfect timing? I came
because someone reported this, pal.

26
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,584
That punk Jeon Dong Min hit me.

27
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,250
I just aimed a kick at the megaphone.

28
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,584
No, I actually got hit!

29
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,784
Arrest him.

30
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,017
What are you waiting for?

31
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,084
Arrest him for what?

32
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,684
Using a megaphone in front of
a kindergarten was also your fault.

33
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,189
Huh?

34
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,050
But there aren't any kids

35
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,184
or teachers here today.

36
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,250
It's basically a done deal
that the kindergarten's closing.

37
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,417
Seriously, are you guys for real?

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,284
We'll just pass through.

39
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,617
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,884
- Hello.
- Strawberry class kids.

41
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,217
- What happens if you fight?
- It's bad!

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,450
What was that? Louder!
What happens if you fight?

43
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,050
- It's bad.
- It's bad.

44
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:43,867
Exactly.

45
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,700
Principal, can we talk for a moment?

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,950
There are only nine kids here
and no homeroom teacher, right?

47
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,084
Everyone, please wait just a moment.

48
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,417
Yes, yes, ma'am.

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,767
Thank you.

50
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,950
This teacher will be arriving shortly.

51
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,850
Can you see her?

52
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:12,217
Dong Min, I need to teach the kids.
You go meet her instead.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,917
Oh my, she'll be here any minute now.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,633
Go on.

55
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,417
Iseon Women's University?

56
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,350
Is this the teacher who's coming?

57
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,100
Yes.

58
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,917
Is this some kind of job scam?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,850
Why would someone from
Iseon Women's University come to Muchang?

60
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:31,517
Don introduced her.
That means she's reliable.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,250
I'm counting on you.

62
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,067
I'll be watching.

63
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,533
See?

64
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,350
Hey! Jeon Dong Min, where are you going?

65
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,584
Hey! You broke my megaphone.
Where are you going?

66
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,684
Anyway, those gym rats are hopeless.

67
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,967
Brains are useless but the body's...

68
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,733
pretty great.

69
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,017
Hey, hey.

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,950
No, I didn't mean it badly.
I meant you have a great physique...

71
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:06,000
Here's for the megaphone, okay?

72
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,133
I bought it for 5,000 won secondhand.

73
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,050
- Let's go, follow me.
- Huh?

74
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,150
Where are we going?

75
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:20,800
We need to catch that punk Jeon Dong Min!

76
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,567
Why's it suddenly raining?

77
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:44,233
STRAIGHT FROM FARM, NATIONWIDE DELIVERY

78
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,917
Uh, excuse me...

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,067
You're Ms. Bu Se Mi, aren't you?

80
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:26,050
Madam, that guy is just an extra.

81
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,817
Not a lead, not even a supporting role.

82
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,317
Why is a guy who's not even
a supporting character here?

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Are you Ms. Bu Se Mi?

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,167
Wait a minute...

85
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,533
Excuse me, by any chance...

86
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,584
Yes, that's right.

87
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm Bu Se Mi.

88
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,150
Ah, yes.

89
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,484
The principal of Iseon Kindergarten
sent me.

90
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,267
Let's go.

91
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,084
- Oh, let me carry that.
- No.

92
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,767
No, I don't like anyone touching my things.

93
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,033
It's really pouring.

94
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:05,333
MUCHANG STRAWBERRIES

95
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,800
The weather's been so unpredictable lately.

96
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,167
Excuse me, Miss.

97
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,000
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

98
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,984
I'm very sensitive to UV rays.

99
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,617
UV rays stay strong even on cloudy days.

100
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,333
Ah, I see.

101
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,509
But hey,

102
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:58,533
have we really never met before?

103
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,784
Not that I know of.

104
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,167
Have you maybe seen me somewhere?

105
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,817
'You're a Solo'.

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,250
Oh, no.

107
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,884
Well...

108
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,767
You were on 'Couples to Hell', yes?

109
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,867
Am I wrong?

110
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,150
I just made a joke because it felt awkward.

111
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,317
Let's just drive quietly.

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

113
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,984
Didn't Chairman Ga
look like he has dementia?

114
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,450
Dementia?

115
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,550
Any hospital records?

116
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,984
No records, but could we bribe
someone who worked in that house?

117
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,884
In court, witnesses are critical
in cases like this.

118
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,584
Seon Yeong, what about Butler Choi?

119
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,250
And that strange caretaker?

120
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,850
Start the lawsuit.

121
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,084
We'll aim for annulment
of the marriage due to dementia.

122
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:03,050
Attorney Kim,
that's too predictable and weak.

123
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,733
Ah, you're right.

124
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,750
By the way, Professor.
Kim Yeong Ran has a criminal record.

125
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,300
She was sent to juvenile detention
for stealing sanitary pads as a child.

126
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,267
Use that against her.

127
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:22,267
A repeat offender who's been in and out
of juvenile for theft since minor years.

128
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,367
Her mother too shuffled
through prisons for petty fraud.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,584
A young woman with criminal records marries
a trillion-won conglomerate chairman

130
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,484
and lives as his wife for a month.

131
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,917
Yet the man transferred
enormous assets to her

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,933
as if he knew he was going to die.

133
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,517
- Attorney Kim.
- Yes?

134
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,817
Looks like we've got the framework.

135
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,150
How about gaslighting?

136
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,217
Brilliant, Professor.

137
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,150
An elderly man with dementia manipulated
by a female bodyguard into marriage

138
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,850
and handing over his fortune.

139
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,384
- And...
- She gaslit Chairman Ga Sung Ho

140
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:00,484
to the point of driving him to death.

141
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,550
The widow, inheriting great wealth,

142
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:06,917
disappeared after the funeral.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Dementia, criminal record,
gaslighting, assisted suicide...

144
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,884
Those four keywords
should get the public's attention.

145
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:21,017
We'll push that narrative in the media
and immediately file for annulment.

146
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,217
These days,

147
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,333
even the courts can't
ignore public opinion.

148
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,450
Any record of Kim Yeong Ran
leaving the country?

149
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,917
We checked, but no immigration records.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,233
We're securing airport CCTV footage.

151
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,717
Let me get that for you.

152
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,833
No, I'm fine.

153
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,967
Right this way, please.

154
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,450
The principal urgently
requested living quarters,

155
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,550
so we cleared out our storage shed.

156
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,700
It's really far
from Seoul to Muchang, right?

157
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,284
Yes.

158
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:32,533
But, how did you hear about
and apply to Muchang Kindergarten?

159
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:36,650
Muchang strawberries are famous, right?

160
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,433
Are they?

161
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,550
People eating them rarely check origins.

162
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,250
I pay attention to those details.

163
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,817
Honestly, you didn't come
for strawberries, right?

164
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Do you have relatives here?

165
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,733
Must I answer every such question?

166
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,633
No, no need.

167
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,884
I heard you worked at Iseon Kindergarten.

168
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,050
Can teachers be transferred mid-term?

169
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,584
Yes, that's possible.

170
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,717
Oh, I teach part-time PE
at Muchang Kindergarten too.

171
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,700
My son attends there as well.

172
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,350
Let me show you the shed.

173
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,817
When you look at it,

174
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,317
you'll see I personally
took care of every little detail.

175
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,084
You built all this yourself?

176
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,350
Well, pretty much built it myself.

177
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,033
Come take a look.

178
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,000
- Inside you'll see...
- Excuse me.

179
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,833
I get the picture.

180
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,684
But

181
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,633
could you stop paying
so much attention to me?

182
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Totally rude.

183
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,267
He can't possibly
have recognized me, right?

184
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,517
Annoah.

185
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,817
That teacher's pretty weird, right?

186
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,300
Right? You think so too, huh?

187
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:04,500
Let's keep a close eye on her, okay?

188
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,784
What's with the vibe here today?

189
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,667
Annoah, how is it? Can you see?

190
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,050
Jeez.

191
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:19,467
They say dogs see ghosts,
but maybe our Annoah can't see them.

192
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,339
BITES ONCE: 'ANNOAH'

193
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:27,817
These days with the recession,

194
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,050
a lot of people even get
spirit-invoking rituals on purpose.

195
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,750
Aren't you doing it
because you don't want to go to work?

196
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,467
Hey, I wanna do that too.

197
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,096
Oh right.

198
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,633
Where's the new teacher?

199
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,000
There she is.

200
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,700
What's she like?

201
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,384
Rejects help when offered.

202
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,717
Quite independent.

203
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,517
She asked me if I'd ever seen her
somewhere before.

204
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,850
Is she an influencer or something?

205
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:57,017
Ah, no way.

206
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,117
'No way'.

207
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,684
Oh, right,
didn't you once deliver strawberries

208
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,317
to the ramyeon chairman's place?

209
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,350
I did.

210
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,367
Hey, then check this article.

211
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:13,629
FEMALE BODYGUARD 40 YEARS YOUNGER

212
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,717
MARRIES LATE CHAIRMAN GA SUNG HO,
WHO IS SHE REALLY?

213
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,850
Then, do you know that bodyguard
who married the chairman?

214
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,533
Have you seen her?

215
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,200
Have I?

216
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,817
CHAIRMAN GA SUNG HO'S
PISTOL SUICIDE, HIDDEN TRUTH

217
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,684
Check it out carefully.

218
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,584
CHOKING AND PUNCHING!
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER'S RECKLESS VIOLENCE

219
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,250
What is this?

220
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,084
She's clearly a nasty woman, right?

221
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,917
She's bad.

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,850
Nasty?

223
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,417
People who hurt others like this
should be thrown in jail,

224
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,584
cut off from society,
and don't even feed them prison meals.

225
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,184
Don't even feed them prison meals.

226
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,384
Seriously.

227
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,650
I'm so pissed. I'll make pancakes.

228
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,850
Pancakes, huh?

229
00:15:56,933 --> 00:16:00,033
I'm so angry. I'll drink makgeolli too.

230
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,333
Did he recognize me or what?

231
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,667
If people find out you married me,

232
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:07,567
the whole world will point fingers
and condemn you mercilessly.

233
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,167
Living a life like mine,
I've heard almost every insult out there.

234
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,467
The gun

235
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,133
renders everything powerless.

236
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:36,250
Even with your 3rd-degree taekwondo
and hapkido black belt,

237
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,333
it means nothing against this.

238
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,017
If a hitman comes,

239
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,967
are you telling me to protect
myself with that gun?

240
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,333
No.

241
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:03,900
About Ye Rim's killer,

242
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:09,000
my only way to punish them

243
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,733
is through you.

244
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,450
There's no guarantee
the same person will come, right?

245
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,733
No guarantee,

246
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
but there are people who don't change.

247
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:46,733
Should I kill that person, Chairman?

248
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,167
One of you two

249
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,233
needs to survive.

250
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:58,500
I want that survivor to be you.

251
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:12,767
Murder carries
at least a five-year sentence.

252
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,800
If I kill someone and serve five years...

253
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,733
I don't want to stay longer than that.

254
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,567
You can make that happen with money, right?

255
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:27,667
What can't money fix?

256
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,850
If I behave as a model prisoner
and get parole,

257
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,784
I'd be in my mid-thirties when I get out.

258
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:39,467
I want to start
a new somewhere unknown then.

259
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,067
Okay.

260
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,100
Even if you restart then,

261
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,800
it won't be too late.

262
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,567
Five years is fair compensation.

263
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,433
If I survive.

264
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,567
I'm hungry.

265
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:47,850
So I combed through
social media for our influencer.

266
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:51,033
But I couldn't find the name 'Bu Se Mi'.

267
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:55,333
It's just because
she's not a popular influencer.

268
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:01,217
It's obvious now that
she's like a guy-version Tae Min.

269
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,967
Darn it.

270
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,784
It's too quiet.

271
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,467
I wonder what she's doing.

272
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,317
- Seo Tae Min.
- Yeah?

273
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,917
I know you're being nice, but,

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,717
people reveal themselves over time,
you punk.

275
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,700
So, you were dating for that long
and then boom, you had a kid?

276
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,584
We were together long enough.

277
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,717
But you know,

278
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,050
you can't really know a person completely.

279
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,017
Oh, spirit, you came for pancakes too?

280
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,700
Ugh.

281
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,667
Stop that. It's creepy.

282
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,950
Pancakes. Pancakes.

283
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:57,117
- You serve.
- Bring the pancake to her quickly.

284
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,584
You go and tell her.

285
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,300
Miss!

286
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,084
You make pancakes?

287
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,800
Huh?

288
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,350
Can you cook pancakes?

289
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:13,967
No, I'm not good at cooking them.

290
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,284
You know I get tongue-tied around women.
Why would you make me talk to her?

291
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:24,567
Where's she heading this evening?
I heard it's her first time in Muchang.

292
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:36,984
We have an emergency meeting
regarding the new teacher.

293
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,967
Come to Muchang Supermarket by 8 PM.

294
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,050
Just keep an eye on that person
for three months,

295
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:02,033
and we'll make them permanent
after three months.

296
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,584
You said you're a lawyer, right?

297
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,750
Yes, that's right.

298
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,000
Looks like something
good happened to Yeong Ran?

299
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:17,250
Actually, Kim Yeong Ran won the lottery.

300
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,350
First prize.

301
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,384
What? Oh my!

302
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,733
- Keep it down.
- Oh.

303
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,717
Sorry about that.

304
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,650
That's amazing.

305
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,950
So, my job is

306
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,817
just to watch that person closely, right?

307
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,767
Yes, exactly.

308
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,833
You startled me.

309
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,900
Come in, come in.

310
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:36,333
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION

311
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,250
Are you looking for her?

312
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,317
Yes.

313
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,417
What should we do if we find her?

314
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,167
Kill her.

315
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,317
How much money do you need?

316
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,584
A single bill should do, right?

317
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,333
Sir.

318
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,817
Do you enjoy crime movies or dramas?

319
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,333
What kind of nonsense
is this all of a sudden?

320
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:07,050
You look perfectly normal.

321
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,884
But you're so clueless
about how the world works.

322
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,050
There's nowhere in Korea
without CCTV nowadays.

323
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:17,050
If we kill someone,
we'll get caught immediately.

324
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,833
This

325
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,633
is our specialty.

326
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,217
WE HANDLE ANY TASK

327
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,400
If you're not owed money
or missing someone, just leave.

328
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:34,797
If you keep asking to kill someone

329
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,867
over a measly 100 million won,

330
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,167
I'll report you to the police.

331
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,433
Report?

332
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:50,584
Darn it, I made time to come here, hey.

333
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:53,550
Then, who's gonna kill her, huh?

334
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,717
Hold on.

335
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,067
If you find her, you can hook us up
with someone to kill her, can't you?

336
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,050
Well, sure.

337
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:06,300
I do know people
who handle that sort of thing.

338
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,933
But not us.

339
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:14,433
First find her, then plan the next step.

340
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:19,217
Please find this woman.

341
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,000
Her mother too.

342
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,633
Seems like someone you really want to find.

343
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,333
I miss her

344
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,467
so much that I could kill her.

345
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:43,933
So if you want money, find her quickly.

346
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,000
Looks like you're loaded.

347
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,984
The strawberry farmhouse
is quite far from the village.

348
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,517
There aren't many streetlights either.

349
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,167
Someone could be killed there,
and no one would notice.

350
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,250
Okay.

351
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,014
MUCHANG SUPERMARKET,
LOTTERY 1ST PRIZE WINNER

352
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:20,984
Now, just say it straight.

353
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:24,350
Our Ju Won started kindergarten at five
and by the time he turned seven,

354
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,350
five different teachers
had come and gone, right?

355
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,117
- Yes.
- Correct.

356
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,984
But they all vanished
without saying goodbye, right?

357
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,817
- Exactly.
- That's right.

358
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,650
Three of them

359
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,933
stole supplies, embezzled snack funds,

360
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,417
and had affairs.

361
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,850
- Never pegged them for that.
- Shocking.

362
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,117
The other two made promises.

363
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,500
They told the kids,
'I'll stay till graduation, promise.'

364
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,600
3 million won.

365
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,250
Thank you.

366
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,050
They took the money Seong Tae handed them,

367
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,384
couldn't even last three months,
then quit and ran off.

368
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,317
- Right.
- Exactly.

369
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,617
So, the kids cried and were a mess, right?

370
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,517
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

371
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,884
I hate seeing the kids get hurt.

372
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:15,084
Me too.

373
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,584
Dong Min, I get how you feel.

374
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:20,084
But without a teacher,
the kindergarten would have to close.

375
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,750
Yeah, maybe this time will be different.

376
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,450
Still, throwing a welcome party
might be too much.

377
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,584
But we can't just do nothing
for a newcomer...

378
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,384
Did you see the news today?

379
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:35,250
A kindergarten teacher hitting kids
was the headline.

380
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,653
Really?

381
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,317
- What?
- How could it be?

382
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,133
Never judge a book by its cover.

383
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,867
Raising kids is no joke.

384
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
Haven't seen her before.

385
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,050
It's her! It's the teacher!

386
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:04,150
- The teacher's here!
- Get her a drink!

387
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,157
We should've prepared something!

388
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,750
Oh my, what now?

389
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,967
Oh, no.

390
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,617
Welcome.

391
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,467
Welcome.

392
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:25,284
Where's the ramyeon?

393
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,633
Over there.

394
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,184
Miss, you haven't eaten dinner, have you?

395
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:06,433
There's nothing to eat at home.

396
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:15,267
Meals are included in the rent.

397
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,184
Why mention that now?

398
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,633
Earlier, you told me to shut up.

399
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,100
It's late tonight. I'll have ramyeon.

400
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:34,000
Wait, you're not giving her food?

401
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,317
Should I... carry it?

402
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,384
- Pardon?
- Should I bring it in for you?

403
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:43,033
No, it's fine. I'll take it.

404
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,650
Take care.

405
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,617
Goodbye.

406
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,333
Go ahead.

407
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:56,050
MUCHANG SUPERMARKET,
881ST LOTTERY 1ST PRIZE WINNER

408
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,250
- She left.
- Hey, you...

409
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,284
You're just...

410
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:00,317
Did you all see that?

411
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,784
She doesn't seem
like a kindergarten teacher at all.

412
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:03,617
We need to watch her closely. Seriously.

413
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,150
Look, aside from just watching,

414
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:07,084
you need to feed her, right?

415
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,650
You go with her too, Dong Min.

416
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,817
- Go now!
- No...

417
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,284
- Go quickly.
- Wait a second.

418
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:13,617
Go now.

419
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,584
No, I said let's talk.

420
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,617
You need to feed her, alright?

421
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,484
- Go feed her now.
- Go quickly.

422
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,267
Follow her back.

423
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,800
- Go.
- After her.

424
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,900
Let's go in.

425
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,617
Miss, I'm heading home too.

426
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,467
Don't be suspicious.

427
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,600
That extra

428
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,833
sure talks a lot.

429
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,050
If we can't find a teacher
this time either,

430
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,717
Muchang Kindergarten itself
will shut down next year.

431
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,297
Then, our kids will have to ride

432
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:13,450
the shuttle bus for over
an hour to get out.

433
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,317
Our jobs will disappear too.

434
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,317
Exactly.

435
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,050
Plus, she's a teacher
from Iseon Women's University.

436
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:24,784
It's a golden chance for our kids to get
Seoul-level quality education.

437
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,650
- Right, a golden chance.
- Exactly.

438
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,250
We're all on the same page, right?

439
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,384
- Obviously.
- Of course.

440
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,317
Until our kids graduate,

441
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,050
we have to somehow keep that teacher

442
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:35,984
at Iseon Muchang Kindergarten.

443
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,717
- Keep her!
- Yes.

444
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,350
But how do we keep her?

445
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:44,100
If Seong Tae uses cash bribes,
we honestly have no alternatives.

446
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:48,384
What if we do something for her?

447
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,367
Like cooking meals.

448
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,950
Speaking from my experience
living in Seoul,

449
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:58,817
Seoul people tend to be wary
if someone is overly kind for no reason.

450
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,117
First, you have to subtly take care of her,

451
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,517
pretending not to notice.

452
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,050
Absolutely without her knowing.
Never make her feel burdened.

453
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,284
Just casually.

454
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:11,050
Wait, why didn't Dongwaru come?

455
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,484
- Dongwaru?
- He never misses these meetings.

456
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,417
- Busy?
- Strange.

457
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,517
EX-CHEF AT SEOUL SHINSUNG HOTEL, DONGWARU

458
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,617
It's past 8:30. Do we still
need to go to the supermarket?

459
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,984
I heard this teacher
came from Iseon Kindergarten in Seoul.

460
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,617
Lives in Gangnam, rich parents.

461
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,450
No idea why someone so loaded
would come down here.

462
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:33,950
Seriously,
we're not going to get caught, right?

463
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,217
My heart's pounding.

464
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,367
Should we change the sign?

465
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:43,717
I spent three months just peeling onions
in the Shinsung Hotel kitchen.

466
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,750
She's supposedly a rich girl.

467
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,750
She must've been to Shinsung Hotel.

468
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,750
One taste, and she'd recognize it.

469
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,750
Se A, our youngest, is in her class, right?

470
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,400
We can't avoid her. What do we do?

471
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,050
Honey, don't worry.

472
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,284
Last time, other teachers

473
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,584
all ran away within three months.

474
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,617
True.

475
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,384
Let's endure a bit longer.

476
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:12,317
That woman won't last in Muchang either.

477
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,850
Until then, Ms. Bu Su Mi

478
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,217
isn't allowed in our Dongwaru!

479
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,284
Not allowed!

480
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,250
Okay.

481
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,967
Clever.

482
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,317
Let me.

483
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,233
What are you doing right now?

484
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,967
I'm just apologizing
for not taking care of your meals.

485
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:39,717
Is that really all?

486
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,533
Then, should there be anything more?

487
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,584
Do you always reject kindness like this?

488
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,517
Kindness is only kind
if the receiver feels it as such.

489
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,284
Jeez.

490
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,517
From now on, breakfast will be
at 8 and dinner at 7.

491
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,550
If you have time, come and eat together.

492
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,050
I'll handle that myself.

493
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,517
This isn't kindness.
It's what your money paid for.

494
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,967
You don't have
any food restrictions, right?

495
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,117
Rice mixed with beans.

496
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,384
Bean rice.

497
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:11,050
Wow, seriously.

498
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,417
Seriously what?

499
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,267
First adult I've seen
who can't eat bean rice.

500
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,050
Ugh.

501
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:25,000
Don't even ask.

502
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,298
MUCHANG GOLD MEDALIST
DROPS OUT OF NATIONAL TEAM

503
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:31,317
He will be your landlord, Madam.

504
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,084
He's actually my cousin,

505
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:36,784
but honestly stay away from him.

506
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,917
It's better for you.

507
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,384
Why?

508
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:42,584
You know the 'crazy dog, ' right?

509
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:45,150
When Jeon Dong Min snaps,

510
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,600
no one in Muchang dares cross him.

511
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,767
I don't think he's that crazy, though.

512
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
- Shh.
- Shh.

513
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,350
Teacher?

514
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,517
Teacher?

515
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,050
Oh, yeah, yeah.

516
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,350
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi.

517
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,350
But who are you?

518
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:15,784
Dad told me not to give
my heart easily to the new teacher.

519
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,017
What's that supposed to mean?

520
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,084
I don't know either.

521
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:19,767
Jeon Ju Won!

522
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,984
Ms. Bu Se Mi!

523
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,867
Sorry, I'll just come in for a moment.

524
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:40,633
Jeon Ju Won hiding inside the tent.

525
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:45,067
And why are you hiding there, Miss?

526
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,600
Jeon Ju Won.

527
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:00,784
Who told you to sneak
into the teacher's cabin?

528
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:03,117
This used to be my hideout.

529
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,284
But now it's where I live.

530
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,350
This was his hideout when it was empty.

531
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,584
He won't do it again.

532
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:16,400
Dad, I heard her stomach growl
about three times earlier.

533
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,800
It was just once, not three times.

534
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,950
Let's go.

535
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:27,867
If you come here again, you'll get scolded.

536
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,950
Make sure to have dinner.

537
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,117
Uh, I...

538
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,850
Yes.

539
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:36,950
Well...

540
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:41,050
I just... couldn't buy the kimchi.

541
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,784
Could I ask for some kimchi?

542
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:46,584
Miss, I'll bring you some.

543
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,900
Hey, if you put on your shoes there...

544
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,200
I'll bring it to you.

545
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,967
Jeon Ju Won, come with me.

546
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,400
Dad told me not to give
my heart easily to the new teacher.

547
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,667
I don't plan to give it either.

548
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:43,167
CCTV INSTALLATION

549
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,267
CCTV INSTALLATION

550
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,350
- Now, leave.
- Wait a second.

551
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:50,617
- Wait, just...
- Why?

552
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,484
Open it up.

553
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,584
This is trespassing.

554
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:58,117
Attorney Lee, why should we leave?

555
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,789
- Hey.
- What?

556
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:02,717
Uh, this... It's that.

557
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,017
This is wrongful termination.

558
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,050
Yes, wrongful termination.

559
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:06,284
Wrongful termination?

560
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,550
Isn't it?

561
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,084
Wrongful termination.

562
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,684
A deal?

563
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:15,150
Wrongful termination means an employer
can't fire someone without just cause.

564
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,017
The key here is 'just cause.'

565
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,517
Let's set aside legal terms
and speak plainly.

566
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,917
Butler Choi and Mr. Yang Cheol Su.

567
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,584
- Yes.
- Right here.

568
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,750
Who are your employers?

569
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,717
Cheol Su! Chairman Ga Sung Ho!

570
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,850
- Wrong!
- Kim Yeong Ran! Madam!

571
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:32,950
Correct answer.

572
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,017
- I was about to say that...
- Hey.

573
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,050
This isn't the time to celebrate.

574
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,650
After Chairman Ga Sung Ho passed away,

575
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:41,050
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran
naturally became the owner.

576
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:44,050
Meaning your employer is Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

577
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,117
But you two,

578
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,350
do you both realize
what you've done to your employer?

579
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,784
No, that's...

580
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,917
Since the previous owner
suddenly passed away,

581
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,850
- the handover...
- The handover

582
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:57,617
wasn't properly done, so we made a mistake.

583
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,784
'A dog that's bitten once
tends to bite again.'

584
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:02,350
Attorney Lee, calling me a dog?
That's Cheol Su.

585
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:03,350
Oh, are you talking to me?

586
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:04,350
You called me a dog?

587
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,284
Attorney Lee, I won't bite again.

588
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,217
Wait, I'll pull out my fangs.

589
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,784
I've added some severance pay.

590
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,167
- Take this at least.
- Thank you.

591
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:16,833
Wait.

592
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:19,584
Butler.

593
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,317
Yang Cheol Su.

594
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,250
Listen carefully from now on.

595
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:27,750
I listened to you and ended up like this.

596
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,050
Ah, our Hye Ji.

597
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,567
Hye Ji said she has 100 million in savings.

598
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,684
I know who we should turn to.

599
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,417
Who is that?

600
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,050
Who else?

601
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,450
The professor.

602
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,733
She must have a plan.

603
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,752
Wait, wait. Wait for me.

604
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,133
Only my back hurts.

605
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,684
Wow, chicken.

606
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:50,250
I'll stay here until Madam returns.

607
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,617
Act like you're invisible, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

608
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,617
Attorney Lee, have you eaten?

609
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,984
Didn't I tell you?

610
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:59,584
'Leave the cooking to the chef,
and the chicken to the chicken shop.'

611
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:02,284
Don't want homemade food?

612
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,084
This isn't my home.

613
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,350
Ah, one more thing,

614
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:09,217
stay out of the main house
except during meals, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

615
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,350
Alright.

616
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,200
Attorney, you know, um...

617
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,267
Where exactly is Madam?

618
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,033
Why should I have to explain that
to you, Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

619
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,217
Because Madam and I are friends.
You little troublemaker.

620
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,033
Have you heard
from Professor Ga Seon Yeong?

621
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:32,784
No.

622
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:37,867
If Professor Ga approaches you even once,
tell me immediately, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

623
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,267
Okay.

624
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:45,150
Yes... Why do I have to tell you?

625
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:48,250
Listen to people until the end.

626
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,933
Hmph.

627
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,500
Muchang must be peaceful, right?

628
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,317
Dong Min, did you talk
with the teacher yesterday?

629
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,117
Does she prefer spicy red ramyeon? Or mild?

630
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,833
Don't know.

631
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:03,017
Do you think she likes soju? Or beer?

632
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,650
Wait, she probably prefers wine. Right?

633
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,050
No idea.

634
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:09,384
Ugh, you two barely talked.

635
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:11,150
No progress at all.

636
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,150
She hates bean rice. Bean rice!

637
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:16,084
Whoa, how'd you figure that out?
Impressive.

638
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,217
Did things already move forward?

639
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,667
Jeez. What could a single guy
like you even know?

640
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:26,250
We even changed the strawberry variety
using the agricultural loan.

641
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,017
Why are the seedlings so wilted?

642
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,250
Hey, guys.

643
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,684
You need to grow big and strong.

644
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:35,017
So Ju Won can go to cram school
and learn piano. Right?

645
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,733
Don't you agree?

646
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:41,333
Don't worry, Uncle Dong Min.
We'll strike it rich.

647
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,867
Another new spirit.

648
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:48,867
Hey, I'll go wake Ju Won, okay?

649
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,800
Seriously.

650
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:54,717
But,

651
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,500
strawberries won't make us rich.

652
00:46:04,767 --> 00:46:06,933
They're sweet! Sweet.

653
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,967
Uncle Dong Min's an idiot.

654
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:14,433
When did you get here?

655
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,884
Oh, hi.

656
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:32,284
- Hello, Ju Won.
- There you go.

657
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:34,084
- Hello.
- Hello.

658
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,217
- Hello.
- Hello.

659
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,384
Jeon Ju Won, listen to your teacher.

660
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,384
- Okay.
- We're late.

661
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,067
See you.

662
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,750
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

663
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,650
This is Lee Mi Seon,
Principal of Iseon Kindergarten.

664
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:57,950
I've been preoccupied
with the academic conference.

665
00:46:58,033 --> 00:47:00,784
Due to kindergarten circumstances,
we need you to start teaching immediately.

666
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:04,450
Please arrive by 8:30 AM.

667
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:05,784
Dong Min. Dong Min.

668
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,384
- Yes?
- How is she?

669
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:10,917
Don sent her all the way
to the kindergarten.

670
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,617
I feel like he's subtly
trying to introduce her to me.

671
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,850
Introduce her?

672
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,684
He wants me to vet her
as his potential match.

673
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,967
Top education, good family background.
Perfect for Don, right?

674
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,184
Then do a thorough background check, sis.

675
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:26,884
People fake degrees
and careers these days, right?

676
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:31,284
Check her past workplaces
for any incidents.

677
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:32,384
Dong Min.

678
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:33,584
You don't know who I am?

679
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:34,784
Lee Mi Seon.

680
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:36,667
Already verified everything.

681
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:41,733
I'm heading to work first.

682
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,817
Hello, children.

683
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,650
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi.

684
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,717
Hello, children.

685
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,650
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi.

686
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:05,367
Okay.

687
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,550
Yes.

688
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:13,950
I'd like to inquire about installing CCTV.

689
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:15,784
Can it be done today?

690
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:17,700
Money isn't an issue.

691
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,417
Hey, is this Kim Yeong Ran?

692
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,784
Yes, correct.

693
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:35,884
We verified multiple times
through airport CCTV footage.

694
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:37,250
Then, where is she now?

695
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,317
We're tracking her.

696
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,117
Seoul's CCTV isn't accessible to everyone.

697
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,333
It's challenging to trace her.

698
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,084
Wow, unbelievable.

699
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,017
What is she doing in the meantime?

700
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,717
Professor, Lee Don changed the will's
release date to the shareholders' meeting.

701
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,284
All heirs must attend.

702
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,917
We need to obtain it before then.

703
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,450
I already checked all bank VIP vaults.

704
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:04,417
No traces under the chairman's name,
Lee Don's, or anyone else's.

705
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,084
Ga Sung Ho trusts no one.

706
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,033
He probably kept it at home.

707
00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:11,684
Contact Prosecutor Kim.

708
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:14,150
Pin any charge on Lee Don
to drag him out of his house.

709
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:15,867
Yes, Professor.

710
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,217
I love these photos. Send me the best ones.

711
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,684
We should file a missing person report.

712
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,200
Mom left home.

713
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,700
Should her children just stay silent?

714
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,200
ENROLLMENT OPEN YEAR-ROUND
AT MUCHANG ISEON KINDERGARTEN

715
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,533
SECURITY CCTV IN OPERATION

716
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:06,833
ISEON KINDERGARTEN

717
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:12,633
RESUME

718
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:17,050
You've done a lot of volunteer work abroad?

719
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:20,017
Both my parents were active volunteers.

720
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,317
I think I inherited that from them.

721
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,684
Exactly. Family background matters.

722
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:28,650
But with credentials like yours,
Ms. Bu Se Mi,

723
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,080
you could've easily gotten into

724
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:32,250
Iseon Women's University
Affiliated Kindergarten.

725
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,117
Ah...

726
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Why did you come all the way to Muchang?

727
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:42,084
I'm about to

728
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,667
tell you the reason now.

729
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:52,284
Since childhood,
I followed my professor father

730
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:54,350
living abroad at times.

731
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:57,750
During college breaks,
I volunteered in Africa

732
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:02,084
and realized
education's crucial importance.

733
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,550
Then I heard about

734
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:08,784
a principal in Muchang
embodying Iseon's spirit.

735
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:12,967
I desperately
wanted to teach children here.

736
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:18,050
You're exactly the teacher
we've been waiting for.

737
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:20,750
And arriving just before orientation,

738
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:24,633
we're so fortunate to have
someone like you, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

739
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:30,050
Shall we see the classrooms now?

740
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:32,284
The children will arrive by shuttle soon.

741
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,850
You can leave your bag here.

742
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:37,200
Muchang is a safe place.

743
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,600
This way.

744
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:43,684
Our Muchang Iseon Kindergarten

745
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,784
is the most prestigious in the area.

746
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:49,167
Many children commute from far away.

747
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,967
Aren't they adorable?

748
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:58,184
Principal! Where are you?

749
00:51:58,267 --> 00:51:59,617
Come out and talk to me.

750
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,550
Oh my, what's going on this morning?

751
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:05,817
Miss, the Strawberry Class
is at the far end.

752
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,800
Please go ahead first.

753
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,184
What's this?

754
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:12,250
How many times have I said
I won't renew the contract next year...

755
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:13,284
Please calm down.

756
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,450
Wait in the Apple Class.

757
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,750
Go inside. To the Apple Class.

758
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,250
Go in.

759
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,167
Go in.

760
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:28,217
The owner of this land
is nearing the end of his life.

761
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,050
And his kids promised to sell me this land.

762
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:32,784
I'll pay the full deposit tomorrow.

763
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:36,850
I'm going to bulldoze
this garden and playground

764
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:37,950
and build a nursing home.

765
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,150
Seong Tae.

766
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:41,617
Did you tear this?

767
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,333
Yes.

768
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:45,617
Seong Tae.

769
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,384
If this kindergarten closes,

770
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,350
kids will spend hours commuting by bus.

771
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:54,984
But Principal, you know what?

772
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:58,817
Soon there'll be more elders
needing nursing homes

773
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,667
than kids attending this kindergarten.

774
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:04,584
That's just reality.

775
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:05,984
Market demand

776
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:08,517
changes with the times.

777
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,550
Understand?

778
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,567
What demand? You...

779
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,650
Take this.

780
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:17,717
Take it, you bedwetter.

781
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,400
What?

782
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,784
DDU

783
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,884
Kang Seong Tae.

784
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:28,784
I'm busy right now,
but I'll be watching you.

785
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:31,400
Straighten up! You little...

786
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:35,817
Sure, let's see how this plays out.

787
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,384
Nothing will change by doing that.

788
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,217
Sorry about that. Did you check?

789
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,167
About Ms. Bu Se Mi.

790
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,850
Ugh, yes.

791
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:45,750
Ugh, thank you.

792
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:49,284
Her resume's impressive but,

793
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:52,517
we value character most.

794
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,484
Right?
You're the Iseon Women's University expert.

795
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:59,517
Principal Lee,
I found one Bu Se Mi graduate.

796
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,050
Well,

797
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:05,850
wouldn't someone like Bu Se Mi
be famous among alumni?

798
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:10,684
Well, Bu Se Mi I know is much older.

799
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:12,917
A 94 liner? That's young.

800
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,184
People marry after thirty nowadays.

801
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:19,850
But Bu Se Mi I know was born in '72.

802
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:20,950
Fifty-three.

803
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:22,124
ISEON WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY, BU SE MI

804
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,584
She has three kids,
and youngest started college.

805
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,517
What?

806
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,417
Well. Check again, okay?

807
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,850
Bu Se Mi isn't a common name, right?

808
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,217
And, you know, my younger brother?
The attorney.

809
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,984
Yeah, Don.

810
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:39,117
He sent this resume himself.

811
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,050
I have 30 years of alumni records.

812
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:46,250
Would I miss such a standout graduate?

813
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,767
Did Attorney Lee make a mistake?

814
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,217
That's why we need to verify again.

815
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,700
You can't possibly remember every graduate.

816
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,133
TEACHER BU SE MI

817
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:09,433
Is he seeing the teacher these days?

818
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:13,550
Did you see it?

819
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:16,633
Is there something I shouldn't see,
Attorney?

820
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:23,567
I'm done eating, so clear this up for me.

821
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:43,233
Hello?

822
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:47,484
Yes, Madam. What's the matter?

823
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:50,117
I think the principal is
investigating my background.

824
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,867
What should I do?

825
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,517
Then do a thorough background check, sis.

826
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,284
People fake degrees
and careers these days, right?

827
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:07,233
Check her past workplaces
for any incidents.

828
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:25,217
ISEON WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
AFFILIATED KINDERGARTEN

829
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,900
Oh.

830
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,350
32...

831
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,233
Wait, hold on.

832
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:45,184
Ah, yes. Hello.

833
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:48,950
That's Iseon Women's University
Kindergarten, right?

834
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:51,250
We're looking for a teacher
who worked there.

835
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:54,517
Bu Se Mi, born in 1994.

836
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,784
Ah, one moment.

837
00:56:56,867 --> 00:57:00,567
Born September 13, 1994, correct?

838
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:03,650
Yes, that's right.

839
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:06,284
Ah, Ms. Bu Se Mi worked here
until last month.

840
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:09,517
She's an Iseon Women's University graduate,
right?

841
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,584
Of course, naturally.

842
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:13,017
We only hire
Iseon Women's University graduates.

843
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,817
Didn't you know?

844
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,667
Ugh, yes. Understood.

845
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:23,067
Principal.

846
00:57:26,367 --> 00:57:28,517
A million won for just saying a few words?

847
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,484
Ms. Kim, buy something good today.

848
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:32,567
Ms. Lee, quiet.

849
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:00,584
Are you going to report me?

850
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:04,633
Why would I tell you about that,
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

851
00:58:10,933 --> 00:58:12,533
Who are you?

852
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,900
Dong Min! Jeon Dong Min!

853
00:58:27,567 --> 00:58:28,617
Oh my, oh my.

854
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,617
Let go of me.

855
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,517
What on earth are you?

856
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,317
What's your real identity?

857
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,217
Oh my, I'm saying such rude things
at a sacred kindergarten.

858
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,917
Wait, wait.

859
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,250
Dear God, forgive me. Help me.

860
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,700
Oh, don't come closer.

861
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,884
You won't believe anything I say, will you?

862
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:55,900
What's the story behind these lies? Huh?

863
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,684
By the way,

864
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:01,884
how did you trick our Don?

865
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:04,133
Our innocent Don!

866
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,200
Are you two

867
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,417
involved in some way, huh?

868
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,184
That suspicion is quite unpleasant.

869
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:21,117
What's wrong with our Don?

870
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,217
Oh my.

871
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,550
Oh, what should I do?

872
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:27,250
OUR DON

873
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:28,850
Yes, Attorney. It's me.

874
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,050
Why are you answering my sister's phone?

875
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:34,084
Don, hey Don, it's your sister.

876
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:36,817
Oh, silly Don. What should I do?

877
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,817
Sis, calm down first.

878
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,684
Hey, what's going on?

879
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:44,950
You said you hired someone through
Iseon Kindergarten's principal in Seoul.

880
00:59:45,033 --> 00:59:47,650
Then, why isn't she
an Iseon Women's University graduate?

881
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:50,917
Who's this person in front of me?

882
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,850
Did you meet at a nightclub? Huh?

883
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:57,100
Sis, it's not a nightclub these days,
it's a club!

884
00:59:58,133 --> 01:00:00,284
Madam? And sis...

885
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,317
Both of you, calm down first.

886
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,484
Now listen carefully to what I have to say.

887
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,867
Madam? Sis?

888
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,550
Sis, the person beside you now

889
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:15,433
is the widow of Chairman Ga Sung Ho
of Gaseong Group, who recently passed away.

890
01:00:18,467 --> 01:00:19,717
That gold digger?

891
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,391
Oh, my.

892
01:00:20,474 --> 01:00:22,250
Sis, if you say that,
that 'gold digger'...

893
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:26,050
No, Madam will be hurt if she hears that.

894
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:28,567
I'm not hurt by such things.

895
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:31,400
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

896
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:35,117
This kindergarten is facing closure, right?

897
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,467
The landowner could die any day now,
and the kids naturally want to sell, right?

898
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,717
How do you know that?

899
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,567
Three months.

900
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,450
Exactly three months will suffice.

901
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:50,167
So those three months...

902
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:52,850
You heard about me, right?

903
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:55,684
Who I am, how much money I have.

904
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:57,050
And with that money,

905
01:00:57,133 --> 01:01:00,667
buying this kindergarten's land
would be trivial.

906
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,250
Just give me three months.

907
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:09,717
If you let me stay here quietly
as a kindergarten teacher,

908
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,500
you'll become
the kindergarten's true owner.

909
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:17,967
Miss.

910
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,333
Miss.

911
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,667
This must be that famous

912
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:30,217
noblesse oblige I've heard about.

913
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,784
However, for those three months,

914
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:34,150
you must absolutely keep it a secret

915
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,217
that I am the widow of Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

916
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,217
During those three months,

917
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,484
everyone will know me only as Ms. Bu Se Mi
from Iseon Women's University.

918
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:46,200
Of course, Teacher.

919
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:49,100
- Principal.
- Yes.

920
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:57,067
Lying itself isn't bad.

921
01:01:58,567 --> 01:02:00,667
As long as you don't get caught.

922
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:04,667
Of course, Madam.

923
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,433
Principal.

924
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,584
What did you just say?

925
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:17,300
Huh?

926
01:02:17,933 --> 01:02:19,684
What, Dong Min?

927
01:02:19,767 --> 01:02:21,733
Who is Madam?

928
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:28,133
You mean Ms. Bu Se Mi?

929
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,967
♫ Starting to be born again ♫

930
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,417
♫ Now is the time ♫

931
01:02:53,500 --> 01:03:01,450
♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫

932
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:04,617
♫ I share the light ♫

933
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:11,450
♫ I'll brighten the days
shrouded in darkness ♫

934
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:13,417
♫ It's not over ♫

935
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:21,850
♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫

936
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:23,517
♫ Come back to me safely ♫

937
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,500
Back suplex!

938
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:29,117
You pulled this stunt
all the way from Seoul?

939
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,550
You're crossing the line.

940
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:31,691
MUCHANG RESIDENTS' RELATIONSHIP CHART

941
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:32,750
I think the people of Muchang suspect me.

942
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:35,017
It seems Ga Seon Yeong filed
a missing person's report.

943
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,850
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

944
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,784
Wait a second, Miss!

945
01:03:38,867 --> 01:03:40,384
If someone comes looking for me,
pretend you don't know me.

946
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:41,417
Don't you trust me?

947
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,684
I'm just telling you to be careful.

948
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:45,421
Is that ordinary info?

949
01:03:45,504 --> 01:03:46,204
ISEON KINDERGARTEN

950
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:47,350
It's worth hundreds of millions.

951
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:48,950
Friend.

952
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,867
Found you.
