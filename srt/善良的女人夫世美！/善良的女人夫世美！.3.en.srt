00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,658
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL,
AND ANY RESEMBLANCE

2
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,533
TO REAL PEOPLE OR EVENTS
IS COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,200
EPISODE 4

4
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,884
The kindergarten class is
about to start, you know?

5
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,984
When will it end?

6
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,100
It should take about two hours.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,367
Dong Min! Jeon Dong Min!

8
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,417
Of course.

9
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,884
Of course, Teacher.

10
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,133
- Principal.
- Yes.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Lying itself isn't bad.

12
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,833
As long as you don't get caught.

13
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,217
Of course, Madam.

14
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,033
Madam?

15
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,967
Principal.

16
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,400
What did you just say?

17
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,250
What, Dong Min?

18
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,367
Who is Madam?

19
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,917
You mean Ms. Bu Se Mi?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,967
Huh? What?

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,033
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

22
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,933
Madam?

23
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,250
Madam, yes. Oh, my.

24
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,850
Our church's pastor's wife. Shh!

25
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,717
I'm sorry, Madam.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,550
Oh, yes, just a moment...

27
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,217
Dong Min, yes.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,250
Yes, I mean, exactly.

29
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,884
Yes, Madam. I'll see you on Sunday then.

30
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,584
Yes. Amen.

31
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,267
Okay.

32
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,300
Ugh.

33
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,750
Dong Min, why did you come here
all of a sudden?

34
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,650
You called my name.

35
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,050
Don't you remember?

36
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,384
Did I call your name?

37
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,184
Dong Min, Jeon Dong Min!

38
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,867
Oh, my.

39
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,867
I...

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,650
called your name.

41
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,667
Lately, my memory's been so bad.

42
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,084
Dong Min!

43
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,850
It's almost time
for the shuttle bus to arrive!

44
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,750
What?

45
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,950
Wait, you called about the shuttle bus
that's always coming?

46
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,350
Dong Min, today's a special day.

47
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,517
Ms. Bu Se Mi's first day at work!

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,584
We need to welcome the children specially.

49
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,350
Hurry, go out

50
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,184
and please give them a special welcome.

51
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,850
Hurry, Mister.

52
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,050
Sorry, Miss.

53
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,767
Shh.

54
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,600
Is eavesdropping your hobby?

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,100
No, I was just leaving.

56
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,417
Admiring...

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,133
Our beloved Ms. Bu Se Mi!

58
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,417
You're really meticulous.

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,750
Then, shall we finish the conversation
we were having earlier?

60
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,467
Let's do that.

61
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,317
Please don't make any mistakes
with titles from now on.

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,384
Of course, of course!

63
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,417
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,350
Good.

65
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:17,717
About the 300 million you promised earlier.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,317
It should be manageable
for acquiring the kindergarten.

67
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,750
As you can see, it's rural here,
so prices aren't high.

68
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,050
300 million?

69
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,784
Yes.

70
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,817
I did mention three months.

71
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,184
Oh dear, just my share was 300 million?

72
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,384
Don't worry.

73
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,817
I'll settle it as soon as this job is done.

74
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,633
Oh, you tease!

75
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,033
Oh, you're being mischievous.

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,250
A verbal contract is valid,
but for things like this,

77
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,650
it's always more proper
to have it in writing, right?

78
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,884
You really do seem like
Attorney Lee's older sister.

79
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,750
I'll let the attorney know.

80
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,633
Well, if it's about our money...

81
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:12,300
Even our Lord
would forgive this kind of lie.

82
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,217
Lying itself isn't bad, you know?

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,400
As long as you don't get caught.

84
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,300
That's quite a quote.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,433
Would you like to grab a coffee?

86
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,817
KE COMMUNICATIONS

87
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,984
What are they doing?

88
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,600
Looks like there's an internet issue?

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,867
Tae Min, you notice things like that now?

90
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,717
He's wearing a telecom company vest.

91
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,950
Can't you see?
Are you getting presbyopia already?

92
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,800
Hey, come on!

93
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,633
Madam.

94
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,750
The information I'm about to share

95
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,367
is known only to you in Muchang,
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

96
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,750
But why are you telling me this
in such detail?

97
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,717
If anyone in Muchang

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,684
discovers I'm Kim Yeong Ran, not Bu Se Mi,

99
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,184
and learns my personal information,

100
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,900
it means you leaked it,
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,700
So, please keep this absolutely
confidential from now on.

102
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,600
Then

103
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,167
your real education...

104
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,250
You didn't actually graduate
from Iseon Women's University, did you?

105
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,350
No, I only finished high school.

106
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,584
I passed the GED
for middle and high school.

107
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,867
Took the middle school equivalency test
at juvenile detention.

108
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,400
Juvenile detention?

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,184
I stole sanitary pads.

110
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,817
Oh, dear.

111
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,600
You've had such misfortune.

112
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,317
Then these family records must all be...

113
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,717
They're fake.

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,050
I don't know who my father is.
I only have my mother.

115
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,100
She has three criminal convictions.

116
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,717
Oh, my. Oh, my.

117
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,900
So your mother has a record too.

118
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:24,150
It's probably easier to find what's true
than what's false, right?

119
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,517
At least my Class-1
driver's license is real.

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,984
Well,
then this isn't completely fake, is it?

121
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,784
If you want to know more about me,

122
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,784
just search the news articles,
plenty of them.

123
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:39,650
But, you know the media always exaggerates.

124
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,250
Stuff like calling you a 'gold digger',

125
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,284
that's not all true, right?

126
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:47,084
Everything except the 'gold digger' part
is basically true.

127
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,067
Oh, so most of it's true.

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
- Principal.
- Yes?

129
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,750
What should I do now?

130
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,250
Well, then...

131
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,184
Oh! Could you head over first?

132
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,950
I'll follow shortly.

133
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,250
You can leave your bag here.

134
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,167
Muchang is a safe place.

135
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,367
By the way, Miss...

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,700
You and our Don aren't involved
in anything, right?

137
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,833
I'm not into guys like Attorney Lee.

138
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,817
What? Huh?

139
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,700
Wait, that somehow feels insulting.

140
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,884
'Just not my type.' Pfft.

141
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,900
Ugh, really.

142
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,800
Cams in the classroom.

143
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
But not in the hallway.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,633
What are you doing?

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,684
Aren't kindergartens required to have CCTV?

146
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,650
Huh?

147
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,484
Daycares are required to have it,

148
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,784
but kindergartens aren't.

149
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,184
You didn't know?

150
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,517
My previous kindergarten
had cameras everywhere.

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
There's a call.

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,350
- Yes.
- Installation's complete.

153
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,117
I've sent you a link.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,217
Install it to monitor from your phone
or laptop anytime.

155
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,333
Good work.

156
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,400
WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN THE LINK?

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,817
Why are you staring?

158
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,250
- Mi Seon.
- Huh?

159
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,284
Is Ms. Bu Se Mi...

160
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,617
She's pretty, right?
You can't take your eyes off her.

161
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,184
Not that much.

162
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,017
I get it, Dong Min.

163
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,750
But don't you dare make a move. Ever.

164
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,017
With her credentials and looks,
you think she's single?

165
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,784
Bet her boyfriend's loaded too.

166
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,717
How'd you know that?

167
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,084
Of course. I know that.

168
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,417
I can tell at a glance.

169
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,517
Birds of a feather, you know?

170
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,750
Mi Seon, about Ms. Bu Se Mi,

171
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,450
you did properly verify her education
and background, right?

172
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:39,917
I personally called Iseon Kindergarten
to confirm everything.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,417
Resumes don't show character
or compatibility, right?

174
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,717
What, you live in deception?

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,284
I just don't want the kids hurt.

176
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,017
You should care more
about this as principal.

177
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,850
Then, this time, I'll pay extra attention.

178
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:54,700
So stop suspecting everything, okay?
Please?

179
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,900
Oh, hello.

180
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,217
ORDER
Hello.

181
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,017
- Hello.
- Hi.

182
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,617
- Slowly. Shoes in place.
- Take your time.

183
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,684
Good.

184
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,800
- Hello.
- You're here.

185
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,233
What brings you here?

186
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,184
To file a missing person report.

187
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,184
How old is the person?

188
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,167
Any dementia or chronic illness?

189
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,850
Twenty-nine this year?

190
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,633
Twenty-nine...

191
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,317
What? Are you joking?

192
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,933
My father remarried.

193
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,817
Even if you report an adult missing,

194
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,584
we can't search
without proof of endangerment.

195
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,850
And even if we find her,

196
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,684
we can't disclose contact info
if she refuses.

197
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:59,767
So, I might never find my mother?

198
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:05,884
Even when an adult is missing,
their personal decision is important.

199
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,817
Isn't your mother more likely hiding

200
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,217
than missing?

201
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,084
Detective, you're really not
understanding me.

202
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,833
Pardon?

203
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,350
Yes, this is Sergeant Kim Hak Su.

204
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,717
Yes, Team Leader.

205
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,817
Yes, yes.

206
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,450
What? The chief called you?

207
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,467
Ah, yes, understood.

208
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,350
Though she's an adult,
there's sufficient reason to believe you.

209
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,017
We'll file a missing person report.

210
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,233
We'll conduct a nationwide search
and investigate the disappearance.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,633
Finally, you understand.

212
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,217
You're new here.

213
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,084
Who introduced you?

214
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,784
Someone named Kim So Yeong.

215
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,617
Kim So Yeong?

216
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,984
That's a common name.

217
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,484
I know at least three Kim So Yeongs myself.

218
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:10,833
Short So Yeong, Tall So Yeong,
Chubby So Yeong.

219
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,917
But

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,524
the Kim So Yeong you did time

221
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:18,333
with for pyramid schemes,
that one's not common, huh?

222
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,850
You know foot baths are great, right?

223
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:29,650
Raise your body temperature just one degree
and it prevents cancer and such.

224
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,617
Add this enzyme to a foot bath

225
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,433
and your skin becomes smooth and silky.

226
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,184
My mother suffered from diabetes for years.

227
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:44,784
No hospital in Korea could cure it,

228
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,284
but enzyme cured her.

229
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,384
Then please enjoy a foot bath
before you leave.

230
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,084
How much is that?

231
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,717
Oh, sir! You've got a good eye.

232
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,284
I'm not the boss yet.

233
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:01,784
With that shiny forehead
and prominent nose,

234
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,917
you're born to be a CEO.

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,850
This bottle costs 180,000 won.

236
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,584
Original production cost
was over 300,000 won,

237
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,117
but we deal directly
with Cambodian factories,

238
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,050
so we offer half price.

239
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,917
We're selling at barely 30,000 won profit,

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,133
practically giving it away.

241
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,817
Should we buy a hundred bottles?

242
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,484
A hundred?

243
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,267
That many?

244
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,333
How many installments would you like?

245
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,884
Forget installments.

246
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,567
I'll buy 100 bottles

247
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,567
if you tell me where Kim So Yeong is.

248
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,317
18 MILLION WON

249
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,033
KIM SO YEONG

250
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,533
You called earlier?

251
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,084
Me? Just working like a dog, as usual.

252
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,117
Why? What's up?

253
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,900
A clean-cut guy's looking for me?

254
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,867
I've never even dated a 'clean-cut' man.

255
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,950
Hyeon Ok.

256
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,917
Did you tell them where I am?

257
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,184
Hey.

258
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,267
Don't you trust me?

259
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,617
Just warning you to be careful.

260
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,533
Got it.

261
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,050
What, what, what?

262
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,617
Why don't you follow me to the toilet
while you're at it?

263
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,784
Oh, jeez, this.

264
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,550
I saved yours but you disappeared.

265
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:01,984
Ah, hot.

266
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,433
Once it cools it's not as good.

267
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,250
Anyway, if someone looks for me,
pretend you don't know me.

268
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,584
Ugh, this place is just like jail.

269
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,984
A mutt's on my tail,
even following me to the bathroom.

270
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,450
I don't follow you
when you poop, it smells.

271
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,517
Whoa, jeez...

272
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,150
Not talking about you.

273
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:25,133
Okay, talk again later.

274
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
People who say 'don't you trust me'
are never trustworthy.

275
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,350
Tasty.

276
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,717
Nice touch.

277
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,684
GASEONG

278
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:46,717
I'll handle your coffee from now on.

279
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Suit yourself.

280
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,117
Attorney, it's Byeol Nae.

281
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,184
Someone's looking for Kim So Yeong.

282
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:01,450
The caller is named Hyeon Ok.

283
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:04,750
Kim So Yeong says she can't be trusted.

284
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,184
They were prison mates,

285
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,584
but they only have each other.

286
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,450
Oh, Attorney,

287
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,750
and she called me a 'mutt'.

288
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,750
It seems Kim So Yeong

289
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,517
doesn't realize how smart mutts are.

290
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,584
Facts, opinions,
and plot twists all in one.

291
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,600
Her texts have hidden charm.

292
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,067
Oh! You scared me.

293
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,850
Sorry, did I startle you?

294
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,750
I did ballet as a child,

295
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,533
so I'm good at silent walking.

296
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,133
This vacuum is really quiet too, isn't it?

297
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,684
Of course, it's turned off.

298
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,784
Is anyone here normal?

299
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:54,950
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

300
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:55,984
Yes?

301
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,467
If you're done cleaning,
get back to the annex.

302
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,850
Attorney Lee, did you make my toast too?

303
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,050
That's so touching.

304
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,450
Shall we eat together now?

305
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,550
I'm starving right now.

306
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,917
I'll eat all of this myself.

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,150
Oh, and,

308
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,637
I'm going out this afternoon,

309
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,217
so clean every corner before then.

310
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,567
There's too much dust in the corners.

311
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,800
Why is it so quiet?

312
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,800
Attorney Lee.

313
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,067
Attorney Lee.

314
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,333
Attorney Lee.

315
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,817
Strawberry Class!

316
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,617
- Yes!
- Oh.

317
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,250
Aren't they adorable?

318
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,684
The kids have so much energy,

319
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:15,650
so it takes time for them to calm down.

320
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,650
Principal!

321
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,433
Principal!

322
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh, please come in.
I've been waiting, just a moment.

323
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,491
Actually, we had a meeting scheduled today

324
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,433
with the kindergarten supplies
coordinator...

325
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,517
Miss!

326
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,784
Can you watch the kids for a bit?
Just briefly!

327
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,217
Are you asking me to teach them?

328
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,784
It'll just be a short while, really quick!

329
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,484
You can read them a book
or teach them a song,

330
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:45,817
do anything you want, anything.

331
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,667
- Wait here.
- Principal.

332
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,017
Hello, children.

333
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,217
- Hello.
- Hello.

334
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,217
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi, starting today

335
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,800
with the Strawberry Class.

336
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,984
Well, today's lesson will be...

337
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,650
- Miss!
- Yeah?

338
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,050
How long will you be staying here?

339
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,584
You'll stay until Christmas, right?

340
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:23,833
We'll make a Christmas tree, right?

341
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,267
Well...

342
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,684
That's...

343
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,317
Ju Won, what's that?

344
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,350
I've never seen that before.

345
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,750
Oh, Uncle Tae Min bought it for me.

346
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,650
Really? Let me play with it a bit.

347
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,950
Play with your own toy.

348
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,850
Just let me play with it.

349
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,117
No, play with your own.

350
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,950
- Ah!
- Hey, that's mine.

351
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:47,150
Give it back!

352
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:49,284
- Kids, stop fighting.
- Fight.

353
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,867
- Children, no fighting.
- Fight.

354
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,500
Oh my goodness.

355
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,800
Kids! Quiet!

356
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:17,467
- Wow!
- Wow!

357
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:21,084
Kids,

358
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,800
focus!

359
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,533
Sit down.

360
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,433
Children, have you heard of self-defense?

361
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,084
By age seven, you should know
how to protect yourselves.

362
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:47,150
That's what I believe.

363
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,184
There are 30,000 child
abuse cases annually,

364
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:54,233
with 38 children losing their lives.

365
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,784
Bad people

366
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:07,533
always target those weaker than them.

367
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,117
Understood?

368
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

369
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,833
This is the most popular product
for kids these days.

370
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,450
But nothing here really
catches my eye this time.

371
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:27,400
Oh dear, what a shame.

372
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,750
Principal,

373
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:35,884
I haven't met this month's quota yet,
so I'll give you a great deal.

374
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,417
Sorry for making you come all this way.

375
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,017
Well, our enrollment
has been decreasing too,

376
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,584
so we can't afford to replenish supplies.

377
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:48,417
We've done business for a long time,
and I'd love to help you out,

378
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,300
but our situation is tight too.

379
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:55,667
We have a more affordable version here.

380
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,167
Kids,

381
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,817
this person is the villain now.

382
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,684
That's my Dino-ping!

383
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,950
Ping? What ping?

384
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,267
This dinosaur is the bad guy.

385
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,700
The villain is attacking.

386
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,684
So what should we do first?

387
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,217
What should we do first?

388
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,900
I don't know either.

389
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,284
Great for sensory play
and fine motor development.

390
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,250
Ah, wait.

391
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,167
What's that sound?

392
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,767
What is that noise?

393
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,350
Okay! Kids! One more time!

394
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:48,017
- Help me!
- Help!

395
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,250
After calling for help,
use anything you have

396
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,667
to distract your attacker!

397
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,917
Seize any opening!

398
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,817
Back suplex!

399
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,650
Strike the weak spots!

400
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:06,567
Hey!

401
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,684
My Dino-ping burst!

402
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,900
- It popped!
- My Dino-ping.

403
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,984
The Dino-ping popped.

404
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,017
- Dino-ping.
- CPR.

405
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,717
One, two, one, two.

406
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,600
Rescue breathing!

407
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,600
CPR!

408
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,467
Miss, what are you doing?

409
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,184
We were practicing self-defense.

410
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,884
- Wake up.
- Dino-ping, wake up.

411
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,384
- Wake up.
- Oh, my.

412
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,550
CPR!

413
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,050
What on earth is going on here?

414
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:58,550
- Rescue breathing!
- Why did it burst?

415
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:01,084
Dino-ping is expensive.

416
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:05,850
The teacher popped Dino-ping.

417
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,817
Oh, don't cry.

418
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,284
Oh no, three tissues.

419
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,517
The principal will fix it.

420
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,750
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

421
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,050
Oh, my, what is this?

422
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,217
Blow your nose!

423
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,784
Ms. Bu Se Mi,

424
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,600
may I have a word with you?

425
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,650
- Wake up.
- Dino-ping, wake up.

426
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:27,950
CPR!

427
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:32,784
One, two, one, two.

428
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,900
- One, two.
- CPR!

429
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:43,167
She'll be able to last
three more months, right?

430
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,284
Huh?

431
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,568
PARK SEO JUN'S FEES
FOR JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST

432
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:53,517
Why is Seo Jun's tuition fee here?

433
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,633
I definitely put this in my bag.

434
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,300
Wait.

435
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:07,284
Oh, what is this?

436
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,584
Oh, my. Why is the money gone? Oh!

437
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,884
I'll get straight to the point.

438
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:16,050
Why would a graduate of Iseon Women's
University who taught at Iseon Kindergarten

439
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,800
come all the way to Muchang?

440
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,917
As you can see,
I came as a kindergarten teacher.

441
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,984
Does teaching self-defense
on the first day make sense?

442
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,217
In fact, I

443
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,950
believe the world is harsher on the weak.

444
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,784
So, children should learn from a young age
to protect themselves...

445
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,050
If you know that,

446
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,417
don't you realize how dangerous it is
to teach self-defense in a classroom

447
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,384
without safety measures?

448
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,033
If they get hurt,
it could scar them for life.

449
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:45,700
Did you cause trouble in Seoul
and get sent down here?

450
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,750
Ju Won's father.

451
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,833
You're crossing the line.

452
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,633
I didn't come to Muchang
after causing trouble in Seoul.

453
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,050
I also

454
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,717
teach part-time PE here.

455
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,184
And I'm Ju Won't father, a parent here.

456
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,850
In the last two years,
five teachers have come and gone.

457
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:12,117
Three had serious problems.

458
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,117
The other two

459
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,850
ran away without even saying goodbye
because they hated the countryside.

460
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:20,617
You graduated from a top university
and have an impressive resume.

461
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,633
At least don't hurt the children.

462
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,767
I'll be watching closely. Seriously.

463
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:38,784
I clearly put this in my bag.

464
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,301
Ah, no.

465
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,284
How about here?

466
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,350
Oh, it's gone! Gone!

467
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:45,384
APPLE CLASS RECORD BOOK

468
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,767
BU SE MI'S RESUME

469
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,184
Juvenile detention?

470
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,567
I stole sanitary pads.

471
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,100
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

472
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:12,517
Ah, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

473
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,050
Wait, hold on.

474
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:16,733
Well.

475
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,950
Don't misunderstand.

476
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:23,650
Well.

477
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,850
By any chance...

478
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,217
Have you seen an envelope?

479
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,650
What are you talking about?

480
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:32,417
A white envelope.

481
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,617
Seo Jun's grandfather
can't do bank transfers,

482
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,717
so he always sends tuition
fees in cash envelopes.

483
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,817
But...

484
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,233
the money's gone.

485
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:47,550
- Principal.
- Yes?

486
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,633
Are you suspecting me because of my past?

487
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,450
Me? That's not it.

488
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,467
It's just that the only person
in my office today was...

489
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,700
Oh, no.

490
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,484
I'm so, so sorry.

491
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:11,084
Ugh, what do I do? What is happening?

492
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,767
Wait.

493
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,717
Wow, she's fast.

494
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,567
She's already running away
after a few words?

495
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,867
Ms. Bu Se Mi!

496
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,317
Ms. Bu Se Mi!

497
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,817
Wait a minute!

498
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,533
Miss!

499
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,550
Let's talk.

500
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,817
What... About what?

501
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,450
Miss, talk to me.

502
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,584
Dong Min, who is she?

503
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,117
Let go, really.

504
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,517
I need to check something.

505
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,117
Have you seen the envelope
in the principal's office?

506
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,417
What envelope?

507
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,150
Why are you asking me about an envelope?

508
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,484
Weird woman.

509
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,717
Oh, Miss, what's wrong?

510
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,784
Ah, wait a second.

511
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:29,677
MUCHANG POLICE STATION

512
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,917
Principal, I'm really hurt.

513
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,084
We've been working together for 10 years.

514
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,550
How could you think of me as a thief?

515
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:38,817
I'm so sorry.

516
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,084
I forgot I paid
the utility bills in a hurry,

517
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:43,050
and let things get this far.

518
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,284
This is all my fault.

519
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,384
I truly have nothing to say
even if you scold me ten times.

520
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:47,517
I'm really, truly sorry.

521
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,050
And please, just hate me.

522
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,584
These two did nothing wrong.

523
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,933
Please show them generous mercy.

524
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:57,933
Principal.

525
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,500
How much are these?

526
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,384
Why are you suddenly asking that?

527
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:07,067
Are you worried I stole these too?

528
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,933
I'll buy all of them.

529
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:12,750
You?

530
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,350
You must feel awful
being accused of stealing.

531
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,584
I wanted to apologize for that.

532
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,350
So you think money fixes everything

533
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:22,450
after calling someone a thief, is that it?

534
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:26,017
If money can't fix it, I'll take it back.

535
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,600
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

536
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,400
Originally it's 370,000 won,

537
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,933
but you can give me 300,000 won.

538
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,133
Take the full amount.

539
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,817
Manager Kim, I'm so sorry.

540
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,167
She is buying all these.
Now, please let go of your resentment.

541
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,267
What else can I do?

542
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,167
Drive safe. Goodbye.

543
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:17,617
I need to stop by the bank,

544
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,584
so you can head back
to the kindergarten first.

545
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,950
Please take care of this properly.

546
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,667
- Okay.
- Okay.

547
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,400
- Let me carry it.
- It's fine.

548
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,567
Why did you follow me?

549
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,333
Ah, well...

550
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:51,907
Did you think I was running off

551
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,400
because what you said
on the field upset me?

552
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,933
No, that's not it.

553
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,450
Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

554
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,133
Yes?

555
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,350
You seem to misunderstand me a lot.

556
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:16,533
I'm neither that bad nor weak.

557
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,450
Earlier,

558
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:26,317
I didn't mean to hurt you, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

559
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,917
I got hurt during exercise too,

560
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,484
and when you kept mentioning
self-defense techniques,

561
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:33,300
I got angry.

562
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:38,333
I'm sorry. I misunderstood many things.

563
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,350
But you know,

564
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:44,750
you don't always have
to apologize with money.

565
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,367
Sometimes a sincere word
means more than money.

566
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
But for those who need money,

567
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:56,733
this method might be better
than a sincere apology.

568
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:03,950
DINO-PING

569
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:09,900
SORRY

570
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,417
See you tomorrow.

571
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,233
Dino-ping.

572
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,584
Hello, Teacher.

573
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,567
I'm Jun's mom.

574
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,267
Hello.

575
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,133
Miss, you run really fast.

576
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,017
How do you know that?

577
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,050
This is a small town.
Everyone knows everything.

578
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,450
Oh, Miss, we don't have fancy cafés
or theaters in Muchang.

579
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,017
You'd need to drive
30 minutes to find a café.

580
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,417
Is that okay with you?

581
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,717
Yes, I don't like fancy cafés
or theaters anyway.

582
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,717
You're not like
other young people these days.

583
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,533
You look young yourself.

584
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,533
I hear that a lot.

585
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,050
Actually, I didn't mention it earlier
because I thought you might feel pressured.

586
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,617
I'm the president
of the women's association here.

587
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,984
People kept saying I'm too young
to be association president,

588
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:53,800
so I dress to look older.

589
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,584
So, here's the thing.

590
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,417
When someone new comes to town,

591
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,717
we usually share a meal

592
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,784
and get acquainted.

593
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:05,017
It's good to start on friendly terms.

594
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,517
What do you like, Miss?

595
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,833
Uh...

596
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,817
Things I like?

597
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,250
JEONG HWA

598
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,817
Miss, you like spicy ramyeon, right?

599
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,801
Oh, I bet you've never had ramyeon before.

600
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:21,350
Jeong Woo.

601
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,617
Pen, pen.

602
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,467
- Why?
- To take notes.

603
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:29,617
Just record it. Record.

604
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,050
Ah, right.

605
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,367
JUN'S MOM

606
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:38,767
I prefer Hanwoo beef with double marbling,

607
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,350
and abalone must be wild-caught
from Wando's waters.

608
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:47,400
Wild-caught? My, you have refined tastes.

609
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,884
And as for the strawberries...

610
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:52,800
JEONG HWA

611
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:55,450
I love Muchang strawberries.

612
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,584
Oh.

613
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,684
Wait. Isn't that Ms. Bu Se Mi's voice?

614
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,550
- Don't say anything.
- I left my phone here...

615
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:03,379
JEONG HWA

616
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:04,567
Oh, there it is.

617
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,617
Why are you acting like that
when it's just the two of you?

618
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,817
Wait... I need to talk to her.

619
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,817
How many strawberries
should I bring tomorrow?

620
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,650
- No, wait...
- How many?

621
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:16,217
Just get out.

622
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,933
JEONG HWA

623
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:21,967
Ugh, I have asthma.

624
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,250
- Jun's mom.
- Yes?

625
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,984
You can drop me off here.

626
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,450
But we still have some way to go?

627
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,300
Let me out.

628
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:43,617
Miss, when should we schedule
the welcome dinner?

629
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,584
Meals with parents would violate
the Kim Yeong Ran Anti-Graft Law.

630
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,833
Thank you for the ride.

631
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,500
What's the Kim Yeong Ran Anti-Graft Law?

632
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,067
Open sesame!

633
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,867
Sesame!

634
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,667
What?

635
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,133
I can't do it.

636
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,584
Why are you the only one in red?

637
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,867
You must feel so lonely.

638
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,467
Huh?

639
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,850
RESUME

640
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,217
MUCHANG ISEON KINDERGARTEN

641
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,033
My friend.

642
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,733
Found you.

643
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:58,350
She's not answering your calls?

644
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:01,650
Cheol Su,
meet with Hye Ji and convince her.

645
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,917
Don't worry, Butler Choi.

646
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,217
Hye Ji and I have history.

647
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,684
Women can't forget old ties, you know.

648
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,817
A reliable man like me...

649
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,517
Ugh, fine. I'm really counting on you.

650
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,917
Okay, okay.

651
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,384
SYSTEM SECURITY ZONE

652
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,817
It's been a while, Butler Choi.

653
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,550
Mr. Yang Cheol Su.

654
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:26,984
Hi, Hye Ji.

655
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,950
You've been well, Hye Ji?

656
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,633
Huh?

657
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,884
But you're not part of this family anymore.

658
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:35,850
Fine, let's talk here.

659
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:37,867
Yeah. Come out and talk.

660
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:43,067
Hye Ji.

661
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,767
Do you contact Yeong Ran?

662
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:56,300
Why should I share that with you two?

663
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,167
So, you are in contact.

664
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:05,684
- So what?
- The professor is suing her stepmom.

665
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:08,950
You've seen the news, right?

666
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,117
Yes.

667
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,017
The professor said if we testify in court,

668
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,684
she'll reinstate us

669
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:17,650
and give generous compensation.

670
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,333
Wow.

671
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:21,884
Hye Ji.

672
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,584
You need to be on our side.

673
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,850
We nobodies should stick together.

674
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,717
- Yeong Ran's a chaebol now.
- Exactly.

675
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,084
She's out of our league.

676
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,817
And frankly,

677
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,617
would Yeong Ran
really report her own assistant?

678
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,967
- Of course not.
- Never.

679
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,700
Hye Ji.

680
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:52,600
You know where Yeong Ran is, right?

681
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,150
Ah.

682
00:45:57,233 --> 00:46:01,533
But honestly,
I don't know her exact location.

683
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:07,384
But if I watch Lee Don
for a few days, I might.

684
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:08,684
Really?

685
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:12,150
If you find out, we can
put in a good word with the professor.

686
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:13,450
Of course.

687
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:14,717
About what?

688
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,933
That info's worth hundreds of millions.
You expect it for free?

689
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,417
Hye Ji.

690
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,267
We're on the same side now, aren't we?

691
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,300
I'll contact you if I find out.

692
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,917
- Yeah.
- You better contact us, okay?

693
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,017
Hey, Hye Ji.

694
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,233
- If you find out...
- Contact us.

695
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,767
Will she even contact us?

696
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,517
Why did she let go of my hand?

697
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,917
She said she'd contact us.

698
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,167
- She will, right?
- Yeah.

699
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,350
How did things end up like this?

700
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:03,117
Why should I share the information I found

701
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,833
with you guys?

702
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,933
Especially when it's worth billions?

703
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,733
This is my house.

704
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:49,133
Miss, let's eat dinner.

705
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:54,733
But can you let go of my hand?

706
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,984
No, no.

707
00:47:58,067 --> 00:47:59,867
Let's walk holding hands, Strawberry Class.

708
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,417
I'm Jeon Ju Won.

709
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,750
Oh, Ju Won.

710
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:09,684
Miss, maybe you're not that bright.

711
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,400
Huh?

712
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,333
Miss here.

713
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,917
I'm fine.

714
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,917
It needs a bit more grilling.

715
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,667
Please wait.

716
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,684
Dad, there's a message.
Let me read it for you.

717
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:51,117
Okay.

718
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,217
Just as Ju Won's father said,

719
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,084
she's someone who probably
messed up in Seoul and snuck back here.

720
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,350
We rushed in without proper vetting.
Our mistake.

721
00:49:00,433 --> 00:49:02,567
Exactly. Ju Won...

722
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,300
That wasn't me.

723
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,167
I'm full.

724
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:17,200
Miss, this is a misunderstanding.

725
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:26,733
MUCHANG RESIDENTS' RELATIONSHIP CHART

726
00:49:48,967 --> 00:49:49,950
Madam.

727
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:53,784
I told you calls are risky.
Don't phone unless necessary.

728
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:55,617
There's nobody here.

729
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,884
No wiretaps or hidden cameras either.

730
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:00,045
Except what I installed myself.

731
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:01,817
Attorney Lee.

732
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,533
The Muchang folks seem to suspect me.

733
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:10,700
Dong Min, what are you doing there?

734
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:18,750
Then, let's make befriending
Muchang residents part of the mission.

735
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,250
It seems Ga Seon Yeong filed
a missing person's report.

736
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:23,484
To survive three months in Muchang safely,

737
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,217
that would be wiser.

738
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,500
I'll call again later.

739
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,884
What are you two doing here?

740
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,450
Ah, these are strawberries I grew.

741
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:40,650
Try some.

742
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,784
No, thanks. I don't like strawberries.

743
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:44,667
But you said you liked them earlier...

744
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,850
Ah, Miss.

745
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,584
I know it because...

746
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:51,617
No, thanks.

747
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,084
Miss, want some makgeolli with these?

748
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:56,584
Strawberries and makgeolli
are a heavenly combo.

749
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,484
I can't handle alcohol well.

750
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:00,567
You two enjoy yourselves.

751
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,600
I won't get kicked out for three months.

752
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,450
Dong Min.

753
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:31,833
I really admire women
who take care of themselves.

754
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,550
Right.

755
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:37,917
Just meet any woman, please.

756
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,733
But I don't...

757
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,317
- Dong Min.
- What?

758
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,884
Today your logic
and your heart will collide.

759
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:52,667
Whatever happens,
don't lose your head. Got it?

760
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,017
Skip the horoscope today.

761
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,335
Pray for a strawberry harvest,

762
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:59,250
whether it's for the general
or baby spirit.

763
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,350
Boss, does that count as a day's wage too?

764
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:04,584
What's wrong with you?

765
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,784
Apply it on your eyelids like this.

766
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:09,967
Dab the center of your ears too.

767
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:11,617
What next?

768
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,417
Make sure to apply it evenly.

769
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,217
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

770
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,733
When blending, lower your middle finger
slightly to reduce the area...

771
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,717
Miss.

772
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,750
Jun's mom, mind giving me a ride?

773
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,050
Oh! Of course not.

774
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:35,767
Get in, get in.

775
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,067
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

776
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,850
Miss.

777
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:54,784
About the other day...
We were just trying to be hospitable.

778
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:58,717
Accepting meals from parents
violates the Kim Yeong Ran Act,

779
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,217
but me treating you is fine, right?

780
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,450
What do you mean?

781
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,217
I was thinking of holding
a welcome party in our yard today.

782
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,017
Whose welcome party?

783
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,767
Mine.

784
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,584
We'd love that.

785
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,084
This isn't just your welcome party,

786
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,884
but it's more like neighbors
getting together for a meal.

787
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:19,850
That's small-town hospitality, you know.

788
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,350
Lovely.

789
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:22,717
Where are you going, Miss?

790
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,750
To the kindergarten.

791
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:24,917
But it's Saturday.

792
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,633
Huh?

793
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,784
This is the Women's Association President.

794
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:34,484
Today at 5 PM at Mr. Jeon Dong Min's house,

795
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:38,050
we're hosting a welcome party
for our new neighbor, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

796
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,384
All residents should pause their work

797
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,029
and attend.

798
00:53:41,112 --> 00:53:42,884
Are we really holding
the welcome dinner today?

799
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:48,550
Yeah, Dong Min, we decided to hold it.

800
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:50,450
Oh, my.

801
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:53,250
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

802
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,750
Madam... No, no.

803
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,884
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

804
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,017
A welcome party? Seriously?

805
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,450
Don't you know this breaks
the Kim Yeong Ran Act?

806
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:04,200
This is a huge problem.

807
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:10,317
Yes, that's why
I decided to host the dinner myself.

808
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,750
To get to know the neighbors
and build relationships.

809
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,433
I've heard Dongwaru's food is great.

810
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:24,284
- Here.
- Miss, why are you like this?

811
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,217
Normally, as the principal,
I would handle all this...

812
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,317
- Understood.
- No.

813
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,784
I'm good at things like this.

814
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:34,917
I'll prepare everything perfectly.

815
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,850
Don't worry,
let go of this and answer the phone.

816
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:41,267
I receive your sincerity.

817
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,667
Alright, then.

818
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:59,700
MUCHANG MART

819
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,733
Huh?

820
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:19,084
Oh, my. He's...

821
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:20,884
Hey, Jeon Dong Min!
What are you doing there?

822
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:23,150
Grab a shopping cart and get in here fast.

823
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:26,117
Hurry up, we don't have time.
Come on, Dong Min. Ugh, seriously.

824
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,833
Okay.

825
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:31,367
Jeez.

826
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,917
Dong Min,
put the snacks and dried side dishes

827
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,450
in there with some love.

828
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:44,350
But Ms. Bu's hosting the welcome party.
Why are we doing this?

829
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:46,150
Because Ms. Bu has other matters to handle.

830
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:47,984
This is how we help each other in life.

831
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:51,833
Why are you always so grumpy with her?

832
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,450
Did you also get bribed by her money?

833
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:56,917
To make you take her side?

834
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,533
No, nothing like that!

835
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:02,717
This is really weird.

836
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,984
But, why does Ms. Bu Se Mi

837
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:08,317
even need to be in Muchang,
spending money to bribe people?

838
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,450
Why did Don recommend her anyway?

839
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,617
You're too suspicious.

840
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,884
She just likes the countryside,

841
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:16,917
wants to make friends,

842
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,117
and has money to spend.

843
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,617
You wouldn't understand
because you don't have it.

844
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,650
Dong Min, if you won't help me,
go stand over there.

845
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:26,950
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

846
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:29,617
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

847
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,750
I'll bring the dried side dishes.

848
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:35,967
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

849
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,667
Hallelujah.

850
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
Why's it so quiet here?

851
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,700
Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

852
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,700
Ms. Baek Hye...

853
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,200
Baek Hye Ji!

854
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,933
BAEK HYE JI

855
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,900
The subscriber you dialed
is not available. Please leave a message...

856
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:24,700
What?

857
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,600
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

858
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:37,384
What?

859
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:39,300
Where did she disappear to?

860
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:51,050
Oh, no, what do I do?

861
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:52,784
Hello, everyone.

862
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:54,817
Thank you for your hard work.

863
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,384
Please take care of this.

864
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,784
- Wow, this is amazing.
- What's all this?

865
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:02,517
Ms. Bu Se Mi prepared everything.

866
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,050
She's someone who truly loves the children.

867
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:07,950
We don't even have a play café here,
you know.

868
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:10,150
Ah, I'm honestly envious.

869
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:13,250
How rich does she have to be
for a kindergarten teacher to go this far?

870
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,450
- Unbelievable.
- Hey.

871
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,450
Dong Min, put the makgeolli
in the farmhouse fridge.

872
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:20,850
There's no space here.

873
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:23,417
- Okay.
- Oh, Ju Won will love this!

874
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,950
Ah, he's going to love this.

875
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:26,617
Please handle this well.

876
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,867
This is wonderful.

877
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,367
Miss, I'll just leave
the makgeolli here and go.

878
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:56,950
CCTV.

879
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,650
Dong Min.

880
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,367
Yes?

881
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,350
What's that?

882
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:08,550
Oh, this?

883
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:10,317
Makgeolli. For the welcome party later.

884
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,367
Wait a second.

885
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:19,100
Can we talk privately?

886
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:22,933
Let me put that down first. Just a moment.

887
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,500
Miss, why are you so close to me?

888
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,967
Oh.

889
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,417
When did I do that?

890
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Right now.

891
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:54,384
I'll just put this here.

892
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:56,733
I said stay still.

893
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,784
Everything arrived at once.

894
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:05,417
This needs to chill in the cooler.

895
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,884
- Cooler?
- Makgeolli should be served cold.

896
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,589
The cooler.

897
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:11,387
- Let me put this here.
- Good work.

898
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:14,250
- Is here okay?
- It's fine.

899
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:18,317
Shouldn't we mix the food varieties?

900
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,117
Pair them with tasty sides.

901
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,667
All the fried rice is here.

902
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:29,900
Hey, Tae Min, this is...

903
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,033
You seem like a new face...

904
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:43,017
Who are you looking for?

905
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:46,000
Is Teacher Bu Se Mi here?

906
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:50,384
Huh? Who?

907
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:52,117
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

908
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,133
Yes, she's here. And you are?

909
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:57,917
Oh.

910
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,633
I'm...

911
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:04,833
Se Mi's friend.

912
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,600
Oh, what are you doing?

913
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:26,917
I might not seem like it,
but I'm very traditional.

914
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,400
- I'll put this down quickly.
- Dong Min!

915
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,850
It's been a while.

916
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:49,733
My friend.

917
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,517
Thank you for welcoming me.

918
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,050
How on earth did Ms. Baek Hye Ji
find out I'm here?

919
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:52,850
Oh, no. Baek Hye Ji!

920
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:55,317
There are no secrets
in this world, you know.

921
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,850
If you let dogs and pigs look down on you,
you become the dog and pig. Understand?

922
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:02,017
I might be able to find out
where our Yeong Ran is.

923
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,284
Attorney Lee,
where did you hide Kim Yeong Ran?

924
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:07,050
If you're in Muchang,
you have to follow Muchang's rules.

925
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:08,450
- Stop it.
- Ms. Se Mi.

926
01:04:08,533 --> 01:04:12,333
You may have a sharp tongue,
but I think you're actually a kind person.
