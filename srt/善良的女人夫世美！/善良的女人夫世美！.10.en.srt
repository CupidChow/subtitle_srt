5
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,267
Here.

6
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,033
Still trying to earn good karma?

7
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,500
That's why we're here together. You and me.

8
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,667
What's so special about this place?

9
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,833
Then, why are you here?

10
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,533
Yeong Ran.

11
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:19,700
It feels like you've changed a bit

12
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,567
after you came back from Muchang.

13
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,833
You used to be indifferent
and not care about people.

14
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,833
You

15
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:34,533
like that guy from earlier, don't you?

16
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,067
I shouldn't like him.

17
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,567
What do you mean you 'shouldn't' like him?

18
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:05,633
People are supposed to like other people,
how can you say that?

19
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,567
He's such a good person.

20
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,667
That's exactly why I shouldn't like him.

21
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,367
Have you eaten?

22
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,600
Yeah.

23
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,233
Thank you.

24
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,933
Why did you come back?

25
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,967
Didn't you come to Seoul
to meet Ms. Bu Se Mi?

26
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,867
I came for that.

27

<i>Those feelings are</i>

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,267

<i>And</i>

30
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,900
<i>I don't like you enough to abandon
my dreams, Mr. Jeon Dong Min.</i>

31
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,333
How is she doing?

32
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:29,067
It seems like all the
news is talking about her.

33
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,067
The news says

34
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Ms. Yeong Ran is a bad person,

35
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,667
but actually, she's a good person.

36
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,600
She bears everything alone

37
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,133
to protect others from getting hurt.

38
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,733
So you got rejected, huh?

39
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,033
You always nail those depressing guesses.

40
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,100
Tae Min.

41
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,733
Yeah?

42
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,100
I...

43
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,533
I can't do anything for her.

44
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,633
Why can't you do anything?

45
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:32,267
Just being there for her when she's
struggling is already a huge help.

46
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,333
That's why I'm staying by Hye Ji's side.

47
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,567
Right.

48
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,533
Dong Min.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,200
They say caregivers need stamina
to properly support patients.

50
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,967
That's why ICU families all work out.

51
00:05:56,967 --> 00:06:00,767
Just mirror my movements, okay?

52
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,000
It'll clear your mind too.

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,367
Let's start with push-ups.

54
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,000
Here I go.

55
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,267
Jeon Dong Min, fighting!

56
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,800
Thank you.

57
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:29,267
Good morning, Madam.

58
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:31,900
Do you have plans today?

59
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,500
Yes.

60
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,333
Who is it?

61
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,067
It's the police.

62
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,667
They say they're the police, Madam.

63
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,400
What should we do?

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,267
Please open the door.

65
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,467
Madam.

66

Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

67
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:09,800
You're under arrest for conspiracy
in the attempted murder of Ga Seon Yeong.

68
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,133
Is it necessary to handcuff me?

69
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:22,067
There are exceptions
when there's no risk of escape or assault.

70
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,733
I don't plan on doing either.

71
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,433
I'll go on my own.

72
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,133
Alright then.

73
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,900
Attorney.

74
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,500

<i>The phone is off...</i>

76
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,367
Why is Attorney Lee's phone off
at a time like this?

77
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,433
<i>The phone is off...</i>

78
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,567
Attorney.

79
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,867
Without Attorney Lee, Kim Yeong Ran
will be investigated alone,

80
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:02,100
and since we have submitted evidence, it
won't be easy for her to get out of this.

81
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,333
It's almost over, Professor.

82
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,100

83
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,867

There's Kim Yeong Ran.

86
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,733
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, did you really order
the murder of Professor Ga Seon Yeong?

87
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,333
Is it true that this was done
because of inheritance disputes?

88
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,333
That's right. Yes.

89
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,700
Okay.

90
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,467

arrested by the police!</i>

go to the bathroom, my stomach hurts.

Go ahead there. Attorney.

00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,967
Did you give him a chamber pot?

106
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,367
I gave him the newspaper.

107
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,167
Jeez, it'll start to stink.

108
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,267
I'll handle it later.

109

Ah, I don't know. You clean it all up.

more if it succeeded.

But when it failed,
she pretended like she didn't know,

ordered it. There's evidence.

<i>I made him do it.</i>

176
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:37,700

it wouldn't be a small amount of money.</i>

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,633
Butler Choi, you haven't had much
experience with romance, have you?

357
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:12,233
I was quite popular back in the day. Why?

358
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:16,967
Does Yeong Ran look at the attorney
like someone in love?

359
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,733
Who knows what's in her heart?

360
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:23,233
But it's definitely not the attorney.

361
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:27,133
Those two glare at each
other like fighting cocks.

362
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,733
Just like us.

363
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,700
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,167
Strangely convincing.

365
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,400
Ugh, why is it so dirty? Full of dust.

366
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Oh! Madam, you are out.

367
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:46,433
They say couples resemble each other.

368
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:49,133
She's becoming just like
the late Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

369
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:57,267
Why do I hear water here?

370
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,067
That's odd.

371
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:16,167
Ah, something's off.

Did you look into what I asked?

377
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,500
But according to this, it's not Gil Ho Se.

378
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,930
(Inmate Identity Card)
There's a guy named Gil Tae

379
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,533
who got 10 years
for patricide and arson as a teen,

380
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,833
served time at Cheongsan Prison.

381
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,300
I think this might be
the same person as Gil Ho Se.

Are you sure?

00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,700

384
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,800
There's something I need to check.

<i>You're not personally investigating
now that everything's blocked, are you?</i>

387
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,567
It's not like that.

388

Hey, don't do anything stupid, alright?

389
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,767

398
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,167
Is he blackmailing you with that?

399
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:20,267
He wants me to abandon
everything I've built.

It's urgent for tonight?

408

Tell them I'll give as
much money as they want.

These days, there's no one working
due to the strike.

will be available next week,

hire someone illegally?

No, that's...

443
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:18,033
If the education office finds out,
the kindergarten will close!

I think I'll remember for sure.

498
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:37,400
Yes, that's correct. It's definitely him.

That's all?

501
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:56,367

So please, just trust me.

533
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:01,867
Are you going to do it or not?

534
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,500
Darn it, I'm losing it here.

535
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:22,633
You better be careful too.

536
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,333
Kim Yeong Ran.

537
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,300
Madam.

538
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:01,733
Who put you up to this?

539
00:51:01,733 --> 00:51:03,967
Was it Ga Seon Yeong? Huh?

540
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:06,233
How could she kill her own brother?

541
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,467
What's so funny?

542
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:13,633
What's so funny?

543
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:15,600
You're all insane.

544
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,200
What are you doing?

545
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,633
Don't do it, don't!

546
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:22,567
Stop!

547
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,500
Yeong Ran.

548
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,733
Yeong Ran.

549
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:54,567
Are you okay?

550
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,000
Why are you here, Dong Min?

551
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,200
I followed Gil Ho Se.

552
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:05,333
Madam! Are you alright?

553
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,733
Madam.

554
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,000
What's happening here?

555
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,333
Gil Ho Se killed Ga Seon Woo
and committed suicide.

556
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,967
What?

557
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:22,100
Did someone call the cops?

558
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,800
Wait.

559
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,200
This is a trap set by Ga Seon Yeong.

560
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:30,333
Madam, give that to me.

561
00:52:39,467 --> 00:52:41,467
Quickly, get out of here.

562
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:00,400
It looks like we're already surrounded.

563
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,400
You two go ahead.

564
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,033
I'll stay behind and try to handle it.

565
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,167
What do you mean?

566
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:06,233
Ms. Yeong Ran.

567
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:08,167
If you get involved now,
it'll complicate things more.

568
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,567
Please just listen to me, okay?

569
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,433
Go quickly.

570
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,233
- Dong Min.
- Hurry!

571
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,067
No.

572
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,000
We can't leave you here alone.

573
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,167
No.

574
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,500
Wait, Madam.

575
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,400
Dong Min is right.

576
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,867
If you get arrested,

577
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,633
everything we've built
will go down the drain.

578
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,367
Let's go.

579
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:30,667
What does that mean?

580
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:33,600
If we stay, all three of us
will get caught, Madam.

581
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,467
Dong Min is also my brother.

582
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:42,733
You need to leave, so we can save Dong Min.

583
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:46,300
No, I'll get him out no matter what.

584
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,367
Let's go, Madam.

585
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,067
It's okay, Yeong Ran. Don't worry.

586
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,000
I'll definitely come to save you.

587
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,133
Dong Min, I'm so sorry.

588
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,833
Just go.

589
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:26,267
Hurry.

590
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:28,067
Let's go.

591
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:29,867
Madam, let's go.

592
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Drop the gun and put your hands up.

593
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,200
Please just go.

594
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,733
Drop the gun!

595
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,567
Put your hands above your head.

596
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,767
The autopsy results show that the cause
of death was head trauma from a gunshot.

597
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:17,733
Who's the perpetrator?

598
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:21,233
The suspect was caught at the scene and
is currently being transported to Seoul.

599
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,067
The USB was completely destroyed,

600
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:35,033
and Ho Se committed suicide there.

601
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:36,433
What about Ho Se's body?

602
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:38,740
There was nothing to verify his identity,

603
00:56:38,764 --> 00:56:41,467
so he was sent to a
morgue for unclaimed bodies.

604
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,600
He was quite useful though.

605
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,133
Kim Yeong Ran and Lee Don fled immediately,

606
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:50,933
and a suspect named Jeon Dong Min
was caught onsite.

607
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:54,533
Jeon Dong Min?

608
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:05,967
Interesting.

609
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:12,533
Oh, my, Yeong Ran.

610
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:15,067
What on earth is happening?

611
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:27,233
The situation's got complicated,

612
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:31,367
but I'll find evidence somehow
and get Dong Min out.

613
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:34,900
First, let's check
which police station he went to.

614
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,100
Madam.

615
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,567
You need to stay alert,
especially in times like this.

616
00:57:38,567 --> 00:57:40,733
Do you understand?

617
00:57:40,733 --> 00:57:41,867
Please take good care of Madam.

618
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:43,467
Ah, yes.

619
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:48,100
Yeong Ran, I'll bring you some water.

620
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:02,200

622
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,533

to Chairman Ga's house, kill Gaseong Group VP?)

625

What the heck are you up to now?

626
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,533
Wait.

627
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:59,133
Could you pick a photo for the article?

628
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:02,800
They all look good, so it's hard to choose.

629
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:09,067
By 9 AM tomorrow,
Dong Min's face will be everywhere.

630
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,400
Stop this now, Seon Yeong.

631
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,700
Dong Min's son's name
is Jeon Ju Won, right?

632
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:25,000
He's cute.

633
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,700
Dong Min grew up
parentless, raised by his cousin.

634
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,533
I wonder how his son will turn out
if he grows up the same way.

635
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:37,867
Being pointed at as a murderer's son.

636
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:44,000
Are you even human after all this?

(Suicide Note, Kim Yeong Ran)

638
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,400
I'll show mercy one last time.

639

To stop this article,

640
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,100
you just have to die, Kim Yeong Ran.

641
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:15,000
'I killed Ga Seon Woo too because I didn't want
to split Chairman Ga Sung Ho's inheritance.'

642
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:18,733
'And I also tried to kill Seon Yeong too.'

643
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:23,267
'I never meant for things to go this far.
I'll atone through death and find freedom.'

644
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:24,900
How about it?

645
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:34,900
As long as you die, I won't release
Dong Min's photo nationwide.

646
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:41,533
Ga Seon Yeong.

647
01:00:46,933 --> 01:00:48,633
If you don't like it, kill me.

648
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,016
Kill me and frame this innocent man
as the criminal.

649

650
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,133

I should never have gone to Muchang
in the first place.

655
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,967
None of this would've happened otherwise.

656
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,000
I ruined everything.

657
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:47,667
I thought money was the most important,

658
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:50,700
but I was wrong.
