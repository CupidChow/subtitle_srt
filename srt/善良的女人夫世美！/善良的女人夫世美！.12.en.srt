00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,500
(Ms. Incognito)

2
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,972
(This drama is fictional,
and any resemblance

3
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:46,100
to real people or events is coincidental.)

4
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,600
{\an8}(Final Episode)

5
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,867
{\an8}Ye Rim, you came?

6
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,933
Why are you so late?

7
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,533
I've been waiting so long.

8
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,933
<i>Chairman is alive.</i>

9
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,500
<i>But he doesn't recognize me.</i>

10
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:55,000
Were you waiting for me?

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,333
Of course.

12
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:02,033
It's my daughter after 20 years.
Of course, I'd wait.

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,333
Ye Rim.

14
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:12,500
You have no idea how lonely
I've been living in this house, huh?

15
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,700
From now on, I'll stay by your side, Dad.

16
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,900
Good. I appreciate that.

17
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,733
But if you're living here,
beware of Seon Yeong.

18
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,700
Never go near her.

19
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,700
Make sure she doesn't notice you. Got it?

20
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,000
Why Seon Yeong?

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,833
She's only after my fortune.

22
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:59,833
If she learns you're inheriting
everything from me,

23
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,367
she won't leave you alone.

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,033
Okay.

25
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,767
I'll follow your advice.

26
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,733
Good.

27
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:16,033
You truly are my only blood.

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,600
You're fundamentally different
from these money-hungry people.

29
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,700
Everyone in this house is a monster.

30
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,133
Monsters?

31
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,600
Seon Yeong is terrifying.

32
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,700
So scary.

33
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,733
But

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,500
that Seon Yeong,

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,233
she's a pitiful child.

36
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:59,867
Her father's death

37
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:06,267
was actually caused by her mother
for the inheritance.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
On a rainy day,

39
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,733
she hired someone to kill him

40
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,300
at the fishing spot.

41
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,633
Ever since then,

42
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,233
she grew up

43
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:30,467
without a single kind word

44
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:35,367
or warm look from her mother.

45
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,000
How pitiful.

46
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,200
Pitiful?

47
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,833
How dare you say 'pitiful'?

48
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,267
It was disgusting enough
that Lee Seon Yeong became Ga Seon Yeong.

49
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,433
Say it again, huh?

50
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,867
Wait, Ye Rim. Why are you acting like this?

51
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,867
Ye Rim, Ye Rim, Ye Rim!

52
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,267
Why keep calling a dead girl's name?

53
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,600
Who died? Ye Rim. Who's dead?

54
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:14,800
The Ga family members
should've been eliminated from the start.

55
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,633
You were just a factory manager.

56
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,133
How dare you pity anyone?

57
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,867
Ga Sung Ho.

58
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,900
Know my biggest regret?

59
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:38,033
When you married Mom,

60
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,533
I should've killed you then.

61
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,033
None of this would've happened.

62
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,600
Ye Rim.

63
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,300
I told you not to say that name!

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
You're already dead.
Dying again won't matter.

65
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,967
Ye Rim.

66
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong with you?

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,700
Why act like that wretched Seon Yeong?
Like that wretched woman.

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,433
Wretched woman?

69
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:15,167
I'll let you meet
the Ye Rim you're desperately seeking.

70
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,200
Shut your filthy mouth!

71
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,567
Ye Rim.

72
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:38,333
Ye Rim's gone. I killed her.

73
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,200
I personally choked your daughter to death.

74
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,067
Just like I'm killing you.

75
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,267
Seon Yeong.

76
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,300
Thank you.

77
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,433
'Thank you'?

78
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,500
You lunatic.

79
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,267
Die, you insufferable creature!

80
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,967
Die!

81
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,467
Dad.

82
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,167
I need your fingerprint.

83
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,400
(Will)

84
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,867
Chairman.

85
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,533
Oh, no.

86
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,933
Chairman.

87
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:32,267
Chairman, wake up.

88
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,433
Chairman.

89
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,700
What do we do?

90
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,067
Darn it!

91
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,167
Ga Seon Yeong!

92
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,200
Chairman.

93
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,267
Ga Seon Yeong!

94
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:49,233
Attorney Lee, call an ambulance.

95
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,933
Can't do that.

96
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,833
What do you mean?

97
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,100
Chairman's already deceased.

98
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,433
What does that matter?

99
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,867
Forgive me, Madam.

100
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,000
Give me the phone.

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,633
Give me the phone!

102
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,467
- Give me the phone!
- Madam.

103
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,000
Please, please.

104
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,533
What should I do?

105
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, what should I do?

106
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,433
Chairman.

107
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,933
Chairman, what should I do?

108
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,333
Chairman.

109
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:51,867
Chairman, please open your eyes.

110
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,600
Chairman. Oh God, what should I do?

111
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,333
Chairman.

112
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:52,233
We've temporarily moved Chairman
to Gaseong Hospital's mortuary.

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,167
We failed to protect Chairman.

114
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,033
Madam.

115
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,467
It must be so hard for you,
but you need to pull yourself together.

116
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,467
We still have work to do.

117
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,733
The shareholders'
meeting is about to begin.

118
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,767
Understood.

119
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:34,333
Jeon Dong Min is waiting outside.
Would you like to see him?

120
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,367
Oh, Don.

121
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:59,600
Is something wrong with Ms. Yeong Ran?

122
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,833
You should go back to Muchang.

123
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,100
Don't ask anything for now.

124
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,800
That's how you can help.

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,500
(Jeon Dong Min)

126
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:57,033
<i>Ms. Yeong Ran, contact me anytime
if you need anything.</i>

127
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,933
Dong Min!

128
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,067
Mi Seon!

129
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,200
You've been through a lot, huh? Good job.

130
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,467
Eat quickly.

131
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,500
What is this?

132
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,400
Tofu. You've got to do
what needs to be done.

133
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,967
Eat it all, and you'll never go
near the police station again, hurry.

134
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,633
- All of this?
- It's not that much.

135
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:33,800
But where's Ju Won?

136
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,333
Huh? Where'd he go?

137
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,200
He was here just a minute ago.

138
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,267
I'll go look for Ju Won.

139
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,100
Wait, no. This...

140
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,733
Dong Min, eat the tofu before it gets cold.

141
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,033
Jeon Ju Won.

142
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,367
Jeon Ju Won!

143
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:09,533
Dad's here, but Ju Won isn't,

144
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,233
so I guess I have to go back to Seoul.

145
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,700
No!

146
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
Dad!

147
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,033
Dad, where are you going again?

148
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,533
I'm sorry.

149
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,433
Did you wait long for me?

150
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,867
A bit.

151
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:34,000
You must've been busy too, Dad.

152
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Jeon Ju Won.

153
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,633
You've grown so much since I last saw you.

154
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,500
Dad.

155
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,200
I look like an elementary
school kid now, right?

156
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,667
Not like a kindergartener, right?

157
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,433
Well.

158
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,200
I'll ask Miss when she comes back.

159
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Dad, when will Miss come back?

160
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,533
She has lots of things to finish.

161
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,167
She'll come back after finishing them.

162
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,600
When?

163
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,567
She still needs some time.

164
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,433
But in my opinion,

165
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,667
she will definitely come back.

166
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
I don't believe you, Dad.

167
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,967
Just because you grew taller,
you don't believe your dad?

168
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,567
I never believed you even before.

169
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,600
Look at this kid.

170
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,100
I'm sorry.

171
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,233
I'll try to be a better dad.

172
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,600
Well,

173
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,167
then I'll try to be a better son too.

174
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,867
Madam, we have a problem.

175
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:14,233
The secret study's CCTV
wasn't recording either.

176
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,667
What do you mean?

177
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,067
There's absolutely no footage.

178
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,833
Professor, you look beautiful today.

179
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,233
(The 20th Gaseong Group
Shareholders' Meeting)

180
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,133
We now begin the 20th
Gaseong Group Shareholders' Meeting.

181
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:14,967
We'll proceed with the vote for Director
Ga Seon Yeong's chairmanship appointment.

182
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,133
(Kim Yeong Ran)

183
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,167
What's happening?

184
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,500
Executive Director.

185
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,867
You need to see this message.

186
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:46,167
(Will)

What's the meaning of
this, Executive Director?

188
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:56,033
So Kim Yeong Ran presented a fake will?

189

Whose will is the real one?

248
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,667
I propose that Gaseong Group's management

249
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:19,867
be entrusted to Executive Park Yong Guk,

250

since Minjeong Foods' early days.

Additionally,

252
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:33,967
I demand a complete overhaul
of the board of directors,

253
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:38,667
which is riddled with various corruption,
as the majority shareholder.

without showing any remorse,

348

00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:20,700
Let go!

359
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,800
Do you know who I am?

360
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,767
- Remove the defendant.
- Hey!

361
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,067
Hey!

362
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,667
Let go!

363
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,067
Kim Yeong Ran.

364
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,700
I won't let you get away with this.

365
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,533
Let go! Hey!

366
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,167
Let go of me!

367
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,433
- There she comes.
- She's coming.

368
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,300
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran,
please give us an interview.

369
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,700
From Chairman Ga Sung Ho's case
to the Ga Seon Woo and Ga Ye Rim cases,

370
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,167
the prosecution sought
death penalty for Ga Seon Yeong.

371
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,367
How do you feel about this?

372
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll keep it brief today

373
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,567
and provide details another time.

374
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:11,733
Let's go.

375
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:18,000
- Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, please give us a statement.
- Say a few more words.

376
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,133
{\an8}(The late Ga Ye Rim, the late Ga Sung Ho)

377
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:26,433
{\an8}(Red Ramyeon)

378
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:47,967
Chairman.

379
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,500
Now rest peacefully with your daughter.

380
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,333
Madam.

381
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,667
It's time you gave that guy an answer too.

382
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:21,000
He worries about you more than anyone else.

383
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,333
Are you okay?

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,267
I'm trying to be.

385
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm sorry, Dong Min.

386
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,433
Oh, there's nothing to apologize for.

387
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,800
For everything.

388
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:56,400
I never once blamed you, Yeong Ran.

389
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,167
I'm not a good person, Dong Min.

390
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,267
Blinded by greed, I deceived
the people of Muchang

391
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:12,667
and even framed you.

392
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,467
- So...
- Yeong Ran.

393
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:20,067
Truly bad people don't
say things like this.

394
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,867
And why care what others say?

395
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,900
To me, Yeong Ran,

396
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,200
you're better than anyone else.

397
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,600
Yeong Ran.

398
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,300
After all this is over,

399
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,700
if you ever think of Muchang or me,

400
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,100
come back then.

401
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll be waiting.

402
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,067
You don't have to wait for me.

403
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:54,467
I'm only human. I don't
mean I'll wait forever.

404
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,833
I'll wait exactly ten years.

405
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
But no complaining when you come back
and I've become an old man.

406
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:22,367
These days there are too many caregivers
exploiting the elderly,

407
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,367
so we're pretty strict about hiring.

408
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,800
I guess I have nothing to worry about.

409
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:33,700
This is the room.

410
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:39,533
Go ahead and step inside.

411
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,467
Oh, you don't know anything.

412
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:57,600
Men prefer women like Yeong Ran

413
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:02,567
who act all pitiful and vulnerable.

414
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:09,767
And what makes me worse than Yeong Ran?

415
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,733
Sir?

416
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,333
I'm Choi Mi Hyang.

417
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,467
Last time at Grandma's
handmade knife-cut noodles.

418
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,633
Oh, the one 'made by hand'?

419
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,700
Literally by hand.

420
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,633
Who is it?

421
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:47,867
Hye Ji.

422
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:51,167
If I'd known you were here,
I would've come sooner.

423
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,833
Why didn't you contact me? Huh?

424
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:57,833
Excuse me, who are you?

425
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,900
Did she hurt her head or something?

426
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,200
No.

427
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,900
Just joking.

428
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,133
Hye Ji, you scared me!
Why are you teasing me?

429
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,333
But, Mister, what brings you here?

430
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,233
Mister? Who?

431
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,500
Me?

432
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,867
Are there other 'misters' besides you?

433
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,300
Hye Ji, stop joking around. What's wrong?

434
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,033
- Tae Min.
- Yes.

435
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,667
I want to rest.

436
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,067
Hye Ji hasn't fully recovered yet.

437
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,833
Visitations are currently prohibited.

438
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,200
Please leave now.

439
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,967
Hye Ji, let's talk, okay?

440
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:47,333
- Hye Ji.
- Leave.

441
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,000
Get out. Now.

442
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Let go, young man!

443
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,633
You only like Hye Ji because of
that 100 million won too, right?

444
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,567
What are you talking about? Get out now.

445
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:55,600
- What's wrong with you people?
- Out!

446
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,000
- You can't treat me like this.
- Out!

447
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hye Ji, over here.

448
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,867
Get out!

449
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,167
Let's be honest, you're not my oppa.

450
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,167
Hye Ji.

451
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:12,767
If I don't say this now,
I might never get another chance.

452
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,700
- I...
- Stop!

453
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,733
- Tae Min.
- Yes.

454
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,800
There's something I'm curious about.

455
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,867
Why are you taking care of me?

456
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,333
Well...

457
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:35,333
Because I thought you'd be lonely

458
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,467
here at the hospital.

459
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,200
You always smile, Hye Ji,

460
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,100
but deep down,

461
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,833
you're someone who gets lonely easily.

462
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,700
So I wanted to stay by your side.

463
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Tae Min.

464
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,833
Yes?

465
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,033
Wanna make

466
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:16,033
today our day one?

467
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:21,833
Today isn't day one, Hye Ji.

468
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,267
If you check the calendar...

469
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,167
I'm asking you to be my boyfriend.

470
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:33,333
But can we handle a
long-distance relationship?

471
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,100
I can. I'll come every single day.

472
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,000
It only takes 4 hours
from Muchang to here. Just 4 hours.

473
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,933
Tae Min, have you ever kissed someone?

474
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,200
Me neither.

475
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
I see.

476
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,567
Not even once.

477
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,733
Same here.

478
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:53,767
Me too.

479
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,367
- Me too.
- Me too.

480
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,500
Me too.

481
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,433
<i>♪ Even the warmth you lost ♪</i>

482
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:05,267
<i>♪ I'll rekindle it all ♪</i>

483
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,833
<i>♪ Have you seen the star-filled night ♪</i>

484
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,767
Wait for me.

485
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:22,667
<i>♪ I won't let go, I'll keep waiting ♪</i>

486
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,600

<i>♪ I'll be colored by your smiles ♪</i>

489
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,800
Does it hurt?

490
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:40,433
- Here?
- It's racing.

491
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:41,767
Hearts naturally beat fast.

492
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,833
My heart beats too fast.

493
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,533
Should we see a doctor?

494
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,667
Friend!

495
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,967
Are you here to pick me up?

496
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,367
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

497
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:13,867
What's wrong, friend?

498
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:17,067
Ms. Baek Hye Ji, you and Tae Min
look good together.

499
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,667
And Muchang is a nice place, huh?

500
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:23,800
What?

501
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,067
Are you telling me to go to Muchang?

502
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:29,833
I was going to watch movies with friends,

503
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,700
eat meals, drink coffee,

504
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,400
do all those normal things now.

505
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:45,267
This is...

506
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,900
You really learned ballet once, right?

507
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,000
I heard from Attorney Lee.

508
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,933
Yeah.

509
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:56,967
I persuaded the orphanage director,

510
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:59,567
so I could only attend for one month.

511
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,800
But I didn't even have pointed shoes
back then, so I got bullied every day.

512
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,267
That won't happen anymore.

513
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,867
You'll stay friends with me forever, right?

514
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,433
Yeah.

515
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,700
Madam.

516
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,933
Congratulations on completing
the contract with the chairman.

517
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,167
Are you going somewhere?

518
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,333
Now that my contract
with the chairman is over,

519
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,567
so my stay here as a
live-in lawyer is over.

520
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:05,167
It wouldn't look good for me
to stay here alone with the heir.

521
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,600
If unnecessary gossip spreads,

522
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,667
it could significantly
impact Gaseong Group's stock price.

523
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,933
That's the kind of person
you are now, Madam.

524
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,800
Do you have somewhere to go?

525
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,833
Well.

526
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:20,100
It's small compared to your wealth,

527
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,033
but I have a decent
amount in my bank account.

528
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:27,433
Maybe I'll go to a hotel for a staycation.

529
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,233
Thank you for your hard work until now.

530
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:44,433
Oh, right.

531
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,933
I've already sent all the gifts to Muchang.

532
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:52,867
Alright.

533
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:58,733
What's this? I wasn't expecting
any registered mail.

534
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:05,867
The land below has been purchased
by Gaseong Foundation.

535
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:08,477
(Notice of purchase)
To be permanently used as a kindergarten

536
00:45:08,477 --> 00:45:11,100
for early childhood
education in remote areas...

537
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,267
Lord!

538
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:18,700
What? What happened?

539
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,600
What? Why?

540
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,267
Why? Why?

541
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:27,667
This place was sold.

542
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,667
Huh?

543
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:31,033
Sold?

544
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:33,267
The landowner is still alive.

545
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:37,267
Ah, did he sell it off to another
nursing home operator again?

546
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,400
Ms. Bu Se Mi bought it!

547
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,800
She said it'll be used
as a kindergarten forever!

548
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,700
Forever!

549
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,567
Ms. Bu Se Mi? Forever?

550
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:54,367
Ugh, she drives me crazy.

551
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:56,267
My archenemy!

552
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,633
I should've bought it.

553
00:45:58,633 --> 00:45:59,667
Seong Tae.

554
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:03,167
How grateful you should be for this, huh?

555
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:06,133
Now even you can live as a good person!

556
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:08,100
Forever!

557
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,100
Lord.

558
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,400
But isn't Ms. Bu Se Mi coming back?

559
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,700
The kids and Dong Min
really want to see her.

560
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:25,267
Are you doing well, Ms. Bu Se Mi?

561
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:06,067
You've worked hard, Chairman.

562
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,400
Chairman.

563
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,967
Now I think

564
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:37,600
I finally understand

565
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,933
why you stayed here all this time.

566
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:47,733
How lonely you must have been.

567
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,067
Now,

568
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,967
all these CCTV cameras

569
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:57,133
are no longer needed.

571
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,733

<i>Yeong Ran.</i>

574
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:44,700
<i>I think I need to give
you my final goodbye,</i>

575
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,533

<i>Since childhood,</i>

<i>with no adult to rely on,</i>

593
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:08,267
No, Chairman.

594
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,667
Chairman, that's not true.

595
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,433
Chairman.

596
00:50:21,733 --> 00:50:25,733

Everything has its season,

602
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:05,067
a time to be born and a time to die.

603
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:08,500
It's been a while since I've seen
something this entertaining.

604
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,700
What is she babbling about?

605
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,067
New inmate incoming.

606
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,233
Sis, you're here.

607
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:18,867
You're here.

608
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:37,733
So we meet here.

609
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:39,267
So Yeong.

610
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:40,733
Do you know this wench?

611
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:42,633
She's a total psycho.

612
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,833
Oh, I know her well.

613
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:48,533
I happened to owe some debts.

614
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,067
In-law,

615
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,700
I'll serve you well from now on.

616
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:05,133
Did you throw a welcome
party for my in-law?

617
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:07,000
Oh, right.

618
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,767
We should do it now.

619
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:13,067
Geez.

620
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,367
Let's do it today.

621
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,467
First,

622
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,967
shall we hang this wench upside down?

623
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,300
Let's start by roughing her up first.

624
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:44,533
It's been a while, Ms. Jo Byeol Nae.

625
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,700
You're here, Attorney.

626
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,000
Merry Christmas.

627
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,933
Merry Christmas.

628
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,500
I brought cake and champagne.

629
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,867
Thank you.

630
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:55,400
Is Madam not here?

631
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,367
Yeah, I haven't seen her since morning.

632
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,667
Did she go exercise?

633
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,267
Madam.

634
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:12,433
What? Even the CCTV...

635
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,567
Who turned all these off?

636
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:49,733
<i>Don.</i>

637
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:52,767
<i>You couldn't do it
because you had no money or power.</i>

638
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,567
<i>Now unleash your full potential.</i>

639
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:05,000
Chairman.

640
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,000
<i>Attorney.</i>

641
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,600
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

642
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,233
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

643
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:22,167
<i>To find happiness.</i>

644
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,100
{\an8}(6 Months Later)

645
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,867
{\an8}Oh, pretty flowers.

646
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,433
{\an8}- Which is prettier?
- To me, you're the most beautiful.

647
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,367
What?

648
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,700
Dong Min.

649
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,267
Help me with this bow tie.

650
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:19,300
Let me try.

651
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,633
Well, it worked fine yesterday.

652
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:23,967
But now that I'm
nervous, I can't get it right.

653
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,333
What's there to be nervous about
on such a happy day?

654
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:30,967
Hey, both General and
I are first-time grooms.

655
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:33,567
I'll take the herbal pill.

656
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:35,867
Open it for me.

657
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,133
Why isn't this working?

658
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:40,633
Hold your breath for a second.

659
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:43,067
Got it. Is it done?

660
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:45,533
I'll be late to my own wedding.

661
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:47,433
By the way, Ms. Bu
Se Mi still hasn't called?

662
00:55:47,433 --> 00:55:50,300
She just sent a gift.

663
00:55:51,733 --> 00:55:54,500
Who even wants that?

664
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,633
All done. All set.

665
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,533
Enough. I'm leaving now.

666
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:02,867
Ugh, this feels tighter than before.

667
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:05,167
Oh, did this shrink?

668
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:10,100
Now then, for our very nervous groom,
Mr. Seo Tae Min,

669
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,367
the proud children of

670
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,633
Muchang's Iseon Kindergarten
will now enter as flower kids

671
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:15,833
to congratulate the couple.

672
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:19,233
Flower children, enter now.

673
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,333
Sir, congratulations.

674
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:33,133
Thanks, Ju Won.

675
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:35,500
- Congratulations.
- Be happy.

676
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,433
Thank you all.

677
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:41,467
The moment we've all waited for is here.

678
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,400
The silent powerhouse.

679
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,900
Whose steps make no sound.

680
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,067
Who silently stole groom
Seo Tae Min's heart.

681
00:56:50,067 --> 00:56:53,333
Please welcome the bride-to-be
and Muchang's newest family member,

682
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:56,000
Ms. Baek Hye Ji!

683
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,300
Ms. Baek Hye Ji, are you ready?

684
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,367
Yes!

685
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:03,533
For once, the audible bride shall enter.

686

Today, a beautiful couple

705
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,133
Let's give them a big round of applause,

Oh please, I might meet someone.

It's my wedding. I really thought
you wouldn't come, friend.

722
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:53,667
Of course, I'd come to my friend's wedding.

723
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,933
You look so beautiful.

724
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:01,433
Congratulations on your marriage, friend.

725
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:06,933
Hye Ji.

726
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:08,567
Why?

727
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,533
Have you been well?

728
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,533
Yes.

729
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:29,733

I think I'm happiest when I'm here.

There's no place better than Moodeave.

740
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,100
And,

741
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:19,900
there's no one better than you, Dong Min.

742
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:25,600
You just realized that now?

743
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,100
Yeong Ran.

744
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,367
Why don't we just keep living in Muchang?

745
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,133
Let's live together.

746
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,267

I'll protect you for the rest of your life.

748
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,933
Didn't you say you'd wait ten years?

749
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:03,933
Yeah, but now that I see you again,

750
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,800
I can't possibly wait.

751
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:10,967

Ms. Jo Byeol Nae, what do you mean
your card was declined?

756
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,700
We have a guest here.

757
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,233
Guest?

758
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:55,733
That star, Shin Su Hyeon, Shin Su Hyeon!

759
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:57,733
- Shin Su Hyeon?
- That scandal.

760
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,600
- The chaebol scandal?
- Shh.

761
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,767
I'm such a big fan.

762
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:03,000
Snap out of it.

763
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,233
Prepare some drinks.

764
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:05,633
- What kind?
- Anything.

765
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:07,867
Anything? Peppermint tea?

766
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,700
You're Attorney Lee Don, correct?

767
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,467
Yes, I'm your fan.

768
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:34,533
No, I'm Lee Don.

769
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:38,567
I heard you're good at hiding people.

770
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,633
That's my specialty.

771
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,667
But there's one thing...

772
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:49,200
I charge 50,000 won per minute.
Is that all right with you?

773
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,567
Money won't be an issue.
