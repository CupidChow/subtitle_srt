It's also great for blood circulation.

190
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:58,293
Now, I'll take a photo of each of you one by one.

191
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:03,993
Let's see who's doing well.

192
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:05,659
Who wants to go first?

193
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,593
Okay, plié.

194
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:09,693
Oh, very good.

195
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,893
So fast, thank you.

196
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:15,759
Next one, plié.

197
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,193
Ooh, excellent.

198
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:18,593
Now, we're going to try

199
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:23,093
a de... demi-plié.

200
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:24,859
Ready?

201
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,926
After the plié here,

202
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,159
raise your arms sideways.

203
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,993
Now, stretch out your arm.

204
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:36,659
Let's see whose armpits look nicest!

205
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,326
Oh, lovely.

206
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:39,893
Wow, so beautiful.

207
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:40,893
Oh, well done.

208
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:44,659
'Long, long ago, when tigers used to smoke.'

209
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,993
'In a small hut deep in the mountains.'

210
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:50,959
'A widowed mother lived there,
raising her two young children alone.'

211
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,793
'Every time she went to work,
she warned her children.'

212
00:15:55,793 --> 00:16:00,993
'Kids, when Mommy's not home,
never open the door for anyone.'

213
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,293
'One day, their mother
did chores at a village feast.'

214
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,593
'She received rice cakes as payment.'

215
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:10,526
'Thinking of her children, she hurried home.'

216
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:15,026
'I need to give these cakes to my babies quickly.'

217
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:23,293
'But on the shadowy mountain path,
there was a tiger as big as a house!'

218
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:28,359
'The tiger growled, raising its massive paws.'

219
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:35,726
'Give me a rice cake, and I won't eat you.'

220
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:37,626
'Grrr!'

221
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:40,093
'Grrr!'

222
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:44,726
'Trembling, the mother handed over the rice cake.'

223
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:49,059
'The tiger ate the cake and slunk away.'

224
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,326
'Phew.'

225
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:54,793
'As the mother calmed her racing heart
and crossed the next hill,'

226
00:16:54,793 --> 00:17:00,093
'the tiger reappeared, baring its sharp teeth.'

227
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,359
'Grrr!'

228
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:07,159
'Give me a rice cake, and I won't eat you.'

229
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,993
'The sister became the sun,
and the brother became the moon.'

230
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:16,926
'They lived happily ever after.'

231
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:21,826
Strawberry Class, everyone.

232
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,493
- Yes.
- Yes.

233
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:27,059
If you're home alone
and a stranger asks to open the door,

234
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,426
what should you do?

235
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,359
- No.
- Never let anyone in.

236
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,093
- I must never open the door.
- No.

237
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:36,059
Never ever.

238
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,559
Alright.

239
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,593
This is Iseon Kindergarten's
unique interactive class!

240
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,026
Strawberry Class.

241
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:46,759
One, two, three!

242
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,259
- Grrr!
- Grrr!

243
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:53,493
What's going on?

244
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:57,326
That was great, Miss.

245
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:00,259
Sorry to interrupt.

246
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,893
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

247
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,293
Yes?

248
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:22,159
Daughter! My daughter!

249
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,959
Parents,

250
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,126
our next class is physical education.

251
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:54,926
Please follow us to the Apple Classroom
with your children.

252
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,326
Strawberry Class, move out!

253
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,526
- Move out.
- Move out.

254
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:01,593
Let's all do the pliés
we learned earlier as we go out.

255
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:05,059
- Plié.
- Plié.

256
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,159
Plié.

257
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,693
Didn't you miss me?

258
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,608
Yeong Ran.

259
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:49,365
Do you know how hard it was
for Mommy to come here?

260
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:52,307
Whoa!

261
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:56,407
Yeong Ran.

262
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:59,873
Shouldn't you worry about me
coming all this way like this?

263
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:03,007
Is that how I raised you, Yeong Ran?

264
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:05,540
Why are you rolling your eyes?

265
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,440
Well, you are Madam now...

266
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,040
Did Ga Seon Yeong send you?

267
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,007
How did you even get here? Huh?

268
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,373
See this? This?

269
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,973
That witch Ga Seon Yeong did this to me.

270
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,340
I thought I was going to die.

271
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,107
I ran out without even having time
to dress properly.

272
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:26,940
Ugh, this might leave a scar.

273
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,840
How did you find out I was here? Huh?

274
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,807
Yeong Ran.

275
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,807
Only the back of your head was in the article,

276
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,673
but I recognized you.

277
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:39,340
Hey.

278
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,107
Turns out I have maternal instincts too.

279
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,207
So I decided,

280
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:48,273
I deserve payback for raising you.

281
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,840
As payment, ever since I became an adult

282
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,007
I've been living to pay off
your debts day by day, haven't I?

283
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,373
Isn't that enough?

284
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:02,207
Thanks to that, you married
a man old enough to be your grandfather.

285
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,073
I raised you that way,

286
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,740
tough,

287
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,707
so you'd survive anywhere.

288
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:18,573
Your survival skills are all thanks to me.

289
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,640
Ugh, I stink.

290
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,707
I need a warm shower.

291
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,373
What shower?

292
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:30,007
Leave now.

293
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,973
By the way, Yeong Ran,

294
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:36,773
be honest.

295
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,140
Why did you marry that old man from Gaseong Group?

296
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,740
Even if you had nothing,

297
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,040
it doesn't seem like you simply
married a man 40 years older than you.

298
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:50,073
Did you get something in return?

299
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:52,207
Or...

300
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,873
Did you tell that old man to kill himself?

301
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:07,140
Is that something a mother
should say to her daughter?

302
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,240
I need to wash up.

303
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:17,040
Any cafes here?

304
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,340
After my shower, I need to down an iced Americano.

305
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,840
You want to see me?

306
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,573
- Secretary Han.
- Yes, Professor.

307
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:15,007
Even if we sway the whole board, to be sure,

308
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,140
we need Seon Woo's shares.

309
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,607
Find Seon Woo by any means necessary.

310
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,207
Understood.

311
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:36,040
Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

312
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,073
Mr. Jeon Dong Min?

313
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,040
Miss.

314
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,673
Oh, Ju Won.

315
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,173
Where's your dad?

316
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,107
He went to the village chief's house.

317
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:50,907
Okay, got it.

318
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,540
Miss.

319
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,373
Give me your hand.

320
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:59,540
Here.

321
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:07,540
This is my favorite candy.

322
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:14,273
When I'm feeling down, this makes me happy.

323
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:16,507
You should try some.

324
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:21,407
How did you know I was in a bad mood?

325
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,973
Your mom showed up.

326
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,073
I miss my mom too.

327
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:34,340
But I might get angry if I see her.

328
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,373
She left me and my dad.

329
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:39,940
I totally understand how you feel.

330
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:47,173
Ju Won.

331
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:51,773
If one day I suddenly disappear,

332
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,107
would you be angry then too?

333
00:24:58,607 --> 00:24:59,640
Miss.

334
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,907
If you ever do go somewhere,

335
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:05,707
promise you'll tell me, okay?

336
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,407
Okay.

337
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:28,207
Huh? Where are my slippers?

338
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,673
Why is she wearing them?

339
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:56,807
Friend, I'll just take three bills today...

340
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,907
Wait, I'll only take four.

341
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,707
Caught you, thief!

342
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:06,907
I'm not a thief, old lady.

343
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:09,907
This is what we call catching
someone in the act, you thief!

344
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,873
And I'm not an old lady.

345
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,307
But you are an old lady.

346
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,707
You liar!

347
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,773
What did you say?

348
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:19,907
Nyah.

349
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:21,873
Where are you running off to?

350
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,507
Ow! You're stretching my clothes.

351
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,040
- Give me the money and go.
- No.

352
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
It's not yours.

353
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,940
You're so noisy.

354
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,207
Oh, Yeong Ran.

355
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:34,907
My friend.

356
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,473
That woman isn't really your mom, right?

357
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:37,707
She's too suspicious.

358
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:39,107
A friend?

359
00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:42,140
Since when do you call someone
who steals other people's money a friend?

360
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,773
Yeong Ran, it's not like that...

361
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,707
- I was...
- Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

362
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,273
I need to talk to my mom alone.

363
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,273
Could you step out for a minute?

364
00:26:57,507 --> 00:27:00,340
Is she really your mom? That woman?

365
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,140
What are you saying?

366
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,740
Yeong Ran.

367
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,173
I was going to pay it all back with my savings.

368
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,807
Fine.

369
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
And don't wear my slippers!

370
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:32,807
Yeong Ran.

371
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,707
I like it here.

372
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:38,807
I want us to live in the same room for a while,

373
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:42,173
patch up the mother-daughter love
we couldn't build.

374
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:46,607
What are you doing?

375
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:48,273
You don't have my number.

376
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm trying to save it for you.

377
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:54,873
That's true.

378
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:02,873
Type it in.

379
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,340
Here.

380
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:16,573
By the way, Yeong Ran.

381
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:20,940
Did Chairman Ga Sung Ho really commit suicide?

382
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:24,707
What do you think?

383
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:27,307
Why don't you guess, Mom?

384
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:29,007
Ms. Bu Se Mi!

385
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
Who's that?

386
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:36,440
You have so many questions, Mom.

387
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,373
Don't think about going anywhere,
and stay right here.

388
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,840
Jeez, which side do I have to pick to make money?

389
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:05,973
Why are you empty-handed?

390
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:07,373
Weren't you going to give Hae Na a present?

391
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:08,373
Oh, right.

392
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,373
Dad, wait.

393
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,840
Miss.

394
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,807
Are you okay?

395
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,873
Did you come here to ask me that?

396
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,607
Do you need anything?

397
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:33,740
Ju Won wanted to play with Hae Na,
so I'm going to drop him off.

398
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
And for your mother...

399
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,473
If she needs anything, I'll get it for her.

400
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:40,740
It seems like she came here in a hurry.

401
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,440
It's fine.

402
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:48,173
Just call me if you need anything later.

403
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:49,773
Okay.

404
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:04,636
[Psychopath]

405
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,073
You never know who'll become the cash cow.

406
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,910
[Kim So Yeong]

407
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,507
What's her real intention here?

408
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:09,507
How did she find out where I am?

409
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,973
What? My phone's already dead.

410
00:31:27,273 --> 00:31:28,273
Yeong Ran.

411
00:31:28,273 --> 00:31:31,507
Where's your phone charger?

412
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,073
I lost mine too. We need to buy new ones.

413
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,540
Mom, do you want to go to the local store?

414
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,373
You seem to need a lot of things.

415
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,307
Earlier, you told me
not to move and stay put here.

416
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:50,807
Take money from that suitcase
whenever you need it.

417
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:53,107
Yeong Ran.

418
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:55,807
What are you up to now?

419
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,340
This is the price for keeping secrets.

420
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,640
People here call me Bu Se Mi, not Kim Yeong Ran.

421
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Bu Se Mi?

422
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,307
Yes, a graduate from Iseon Women's University's
Early Childhood Education department.

423
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:08,973
Born in 1994. Raised in Gangnam.

424
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:11,440
Father's a professor. Mother runs an art gallery.

425
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,073
That's who I need to be for now.

426
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:15,807
You know me better than anyone.

427
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:16,940
For that kind of money...

428
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,973
You'd even drink lye if you have to.

429
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,373
Don't worry.

430
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,040
My memory is amazing.

431
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,373
The people who bought me
jade flooring or lent me money.

432
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:32,373
I still remember all their phone numbers.

433
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,107
Go ahead.

434
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:39,740
And I know you have phone chargers.

435
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,473
Your phone's at 100%, right?

436
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:45,607
Don't think I'm that easy to fool.

437
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:48,107
I'll be right back.

438
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:03,240
Ugh, this backwater town.

439
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,640
Doubt there are any taxis here.

440
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,507
Hey! Wait!

441
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:13,573
Give me a ride!

442
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:15,673
- Excuse me?
- Give me a ride!

443
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,340
Sure, get in.

444
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,773
Don't you have a phone charger?

445
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,307
Here you go.

446
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,273
Did you know my daughter already?

447
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:33,307
I first met her when she came to the kindergarten.

448
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:36,340
My cousin is the principal here.

449
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,107
What do you do?

450
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:42,873
Me?

451
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:45,507
I'm a farmer.

452
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:48,040
Farmers are wealthier these days, you know.

453
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,873
You must own some land.

454
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:52,673
I rent land to grow strawberries.

455
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,340
Pfft.

456
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,407
All show and no substance.

457
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:02,440
Where's the kid's mother?

458
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,273
I'm raising him alone.

459
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:07,907
How young were you when you messed up?
You don't look the type.

460
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:09,507
Your parents?

461
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:13,340
Died in an accident.

462
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,473
Without parents, what would
a child have to learn from?

463
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:24,273
Did you also grow up without a mother,
without anyone to look up to, old lady?

464
00:34:25,473 --> 00:34:27,407
What? You little brat.

465
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:29,673
Ju Won, don't talk back to adults.

466
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:33,640
Hey, how old are you?

467
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,140
And why are you calling me old lady?

468
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:39,307
You cheeky little thing.

469
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:40,940
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:44,307
What is this?

471
00:34:44,307 --> 00:34:45,340
What do you think this is?

472
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
She has investigated all of us.

473
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,188
Darn it.

474
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:54,440
Professor Ga.

475
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,573
What is this about?

476
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,307
There's an extraordinary
general meeting next week, right?

477
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:05,373
The matter of dismissing Vice President
Ga Seon Woo and electing a new CEO.

478
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:07,573
Please postpone the Seon Woo issue,

479
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,673
and I'd like to be recommended as the CEO.

480
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,073
Today's meeting is sort of a request.

481
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,573
Since I'm the one making the request,

482
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:20,407
it looks like you guys are 'the ones in power'

483
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:22,940
and I'm 'the one at your mercy'.

484
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,740
'The ones in power' and 'the one at your mercy'.

485
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,440
Then what's with that behind you?

486
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,540
Professor Ga?

487
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,573
Though I'm asking for a favor,
I don't want to be pathetic.

488
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:41,307
Pathetic?

489
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,240
What's going on?

490
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,373
Dad.

491
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:58,707
Su... Su Jin.

492
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,307
Calm down.

493
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,207
Professor Ga, what are you doing?

494
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:10,273
Still, blood is thicker than water.

495
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,607
Wait...

496
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,840
Director Kim.

497
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,873
Yes?

498
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:31,307
If you spent company money on
erectile dysfunction medication to enjoy yourself,

499
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:39,373
now your daughter has to pay for it with her body.

500
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,140
Eyes, kidneys, liver, all in perfect condition.

501
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,407
And her organs are pristine.

502
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,873
You raised her well.

503
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,840
She'll fetch a high price.

504
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:54,607
Professor Ga.

505
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:57,873
- I'll do anything.
- Dad.

506
00:36:57,873 --> 00:37:01,040
Please just forgive me this once.

507
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,940
Director Han.

508
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,040
Yes.

509
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,807
Your son's face looks very swollen.

510
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,640
I was wrong.

511
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,140
Professor Ga, I'm sorry.

512
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,273
Only my son...

513
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:19,973
- My son...
- I'll do anything you ask.

514
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,773
Please, spare my son....

515
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:27,747
[Loyalty Pledge]

516
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,073
Directors.

517
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:35,107
I've always been the one in power,
so I'm not used to being on the receiving end.

518
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,140
People should wear clothes
that suit their position, right?

519
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:47,440
Stamp the document.

520
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,573
- Yes.
- Yes.

521
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,807
We confirmed Vice President Ga Seon Woo
is at Cheongmu Psychiatric Hospital.

522
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:05,740
Bring him to me immediately.

523
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,373
Understood.

524
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,873
Sir.

525
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,207
Please, save me.

526
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,407
Please, save me.

527
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:21,407
Please, save me.

528
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:24,873
Hey.

529
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,540
Call Lee Don for me.

530
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,773
Call Attorney Lee for me.

531
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,973
Yes.

532
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,773
I'll be right there.

533
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:06,707
<i>Yes, amidst the winds of change,
there were hardships,</i>

534
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:11,273
<i>economic indicators are gradually showing
signs of recovery, offering positive signals.</i>

535
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:15,640
<i>Having endured the crisis,
we can now look forward to better days ahead.</i>

536
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,573
<i>That concludes today's news report.</i>

537
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:19,740
<i>- This has been GNA News.</i>
- What?

538
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,340
<i>Thank you.</i>

539
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,573
Why isn't it airing?

540
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:24,940
Senior.

541
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,407
What happened to my piece?

542
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,607
The corruption piece
on Gaseong Group's board members.

543
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:30,107
It got blocked from above.

544
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:32,407
Ga Seon Yeong said she doesn't need it anymore.

545
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,273
Your source was Ga Seon Yeong, right?

546
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:37,207
Jeez, that's absurd.

547
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,640
Pyo Seung Hee, you need more reporter instincts.

548
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,773
Can't you see the obvious?

549
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:43,640
They used you to recruit the board members.

550
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,707
To the conglomerates like them,
reporters like us are just pawns.

551
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:48,973
