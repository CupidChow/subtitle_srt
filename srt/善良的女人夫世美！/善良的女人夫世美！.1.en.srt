Wait, Chairman.

361
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,198
I suggested this idea, Father.

362
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:47,331
You should have clear reasons...

363
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,964
I...

364
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,864
I said keep personal life and business separate!

365
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:03,731
Darn it, the old man's temper...

366
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:10,098
Vice President Ga Seon Woo's project
is already the third loss-making one.

367
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:14,031
You know how quickly a company can wobble

368
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:16,798
if the wrong manager comes in, right?

369
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:19,764
Director Park, you worry too much.

370
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:23,098
Would I let my life's work collapse?

00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:23,298
It's over.

379
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:30,898

<i>Another young woman this time?</i>

382
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:38,931
Men don't like pitiful women, you know.

383
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,164
What does 'pitiful' even mean?

384
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:43,964
It means a woman should have a nurturing vibe,

385
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,998
but she's got no one to nurture.

386
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:49,298

387
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,764
Don't worry, Professor.

388
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:56,764
I did major in food nutrition.

389
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:59,364
Well, this time,

390
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:02,531
I saw the chairman's latest health check,

391
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:05,364
and his cholesterol is really high.

392
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:09,998
When cholesterol is high,
the arteries can get clogged easily.

393
00:36:09,998 --> 00:36:11,964
If that happens,

394
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:16,231
the risk of stroke goes up.

395
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:18,631

396
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:21,198

Ugh, this brat.

00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:39,631
Oh, but,

399
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:45,031
why only hire female guards, old man?

00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:41,664
Your cholesterol levels were high
again in the last health check-up.

403

I made sure to strictly warn
Butler Choi to pay attention to your diet.

[Late Lee Min Jeong]
A pricey and showy flower.

410
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,964
Mom grew up without ever lacking
for anything, right?

411
00:38:58,531 --> 00:39:00,131
As the daughter of a wealthy family.

412
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:12,931
You know those two aren't
his biological children, right?

413
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:17,498
I didn't know.

414

She died in a car accident after just a year.

Not a drop of shared blood,
but legally they're family.

417
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:31,798
Ridiculous, isn't it?

418

What about the deceased daughter?

419

Oh? You're not completely clueless.

420
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,498
She's the only biological daughter.

Some kid he fathered outside and brought home.

422
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:49,164
Anyway, he brought her here once she was
fully grown and even sent her abroad to study.

423
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:52,464
Then, she got into drugs and men, ugh.

424
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:57,098
You can ignore that useless son.

425
00:39:57,098 --> 00:40:00,531
But watch out for the elder daughter.

She's some professor at Se An University.

427

She monitors every woman approaching the chairman.

428

Butler Choi reports his every single move.

429
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:13,498
Well, there's probably
nothing to report about you.

431
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,398

433
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,931
They'd just cause headaches over the inheritance.

436

but secretly waits for the day they die.

437
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,098
All because of that darn inheritance.

who lived with love and faith,

still live among us,
so let us reflect on this truth.

00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:40,431
Go buy some coffee. Something iced.

452
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,231
Pardon? Coffee...

The wound on your wrist.

456
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:06,231
How did that happen?

457
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,031
If I answer you,

458
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:11,731
can I ask a question too?

459
00:42:11,731 --> 00:42:13,898
Answer first.

460
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:17,198
I was hit.

461
00:42:17,198 --> 00:42:19,131
By whom?

462
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:21,331
It's my turn to ask.

463
00:42:25,464 --> 00:42:27,764
Chairman, you set up hidden cameras, didn't you?

464
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:34,931
At first, I thought you were a perv.

465
00:42:39,764 --> 00:42:42,731
But there's none in bathrooms or dressing rooms.

466
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:47,331
Two buildings but only one kitchen?
That's weird too.

467
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:52,431
Is someone trying to kill you, Chairman?

468
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:58,364
I didn't ask you to question me.

469
00:42:58,364 --> 00:43:00,064
Keep searching.

470
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,998
Any reward if I find something?

471
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:06,231
Ever gone on a treasure hunt,
like on a school trip?

472
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,564
Never been on a school trip.

473
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:11,598
Think of this as a picnic at my house

474
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:13,731
and take your time.

475
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:26,864
Oh.

476
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,798
The chairman won't be having lunch today.

477
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:33,364
Ugh, I prepared special dishes.

478
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:35,298
Forget it.

479
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:37,031
Ah, by the way, Butler?

480
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,431
Yes, why?

481
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:42,264
Why are you cooking when you're
supposed to be doing butler duties?

482
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:45,031
I enjoy cooking.

483
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:47,198
Liking something and being good at it
are two different things.

484
00:43:47,198 --> 00:43:50,331
If I did what I liked, I'd be in Hollywood now.

What?

498
00:44:29,264 --> 00:44:31,331
Did they notice something?

499
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:35,198
Ugh, what good does it do if I cook?

500
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:38,564
Today's lunch is chicken. Chairman.

501
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:42,698
Even so, you should eat Butler Choi's
food occasionally. Right?

502
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:47,431
The thing I hate most in this world
is tasteless food.

503
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:51,898

You've been smiling a lot lately.

506
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:24,798
I was planning to stay home during this holiday.

507
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:28,864
If you're free, come over
for braised ribs and soju.

508
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:33,098
Or we can have chicken and beer
like people do these days.

509
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:37,031
Chairman. I too have a place I call my hometown.

510
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:38,664
It's a four-hour drive from Seoul.

511
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:40,031
No train station either.

512
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:43,364
A place where everyone knows
what the whole village had for dinner tonight.

513
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:46,431
And what they'll eat tomorrow morning.

514
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:48,531
That kind of horrible hometown.

515
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:50,598
Where's your hometown?

516
00:45:50,598 --> 00:45:51,898
Muchang.

517
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:55,131
The strawberries you eat are delivered
every other week from there.

518
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:59,231
Then, bring some strawberries on your way back.

519
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:00,964
Okay.

520
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:10,498
Thank you.

521
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:17,931
Alright.

522
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:19,531
This time, particularly,

523
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:23,998
your bonus is 20% higher than last time.

524
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,398
Meeting adjourned.

525
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:27,731
- Thank you, Attorney Lee.
- Thank you.

526
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,564
- Thank you.
- Want to share a ride?

527
00:46:31,264 --> 00:46:35,398
Friend, when I post my photoshoot,
hit 'like' right away, okay?

528
00:46:35,398 --> 00:46:36,498
Okay.

529
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:38,464
When are you going home?

530
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:42,164
Later this evening.

531
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:45,798
Both my parents work late, so I go home late.

532
00:46:47,064 --> 00:46:49,631
Wow, you must be bored.

533
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:29,498
You waited long enough.

534
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,231
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if you hid like that?

535
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:37,864
How did you know?

536
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,464
How many CCTV cameras do you think this house has?

537
00:47:42,864 --> 00:47:45,031
Two in the annex entrance and hallway.

538
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,598
One in the main building entrance.

539
00:47:46,598 --> 00:47:49,831
Three in the living room and first-floor hallway.

540
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:52,464
One next to each window.

541
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:56,231
Oh, and there's one at the back door too.

542
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:58,264
You found quite a lot.

543
00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:03,531
Do you know the best way to cook this ramyeon?

544
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,098
No, I don't.

545
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:11,931
Just follow the instructions
on the back of this packet.

546
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:15,164
Don't add or reduce anything,
cook it exactly as instructed.

547
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:17,531
That's how it tastes best.

548
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,098
<i>It's really delicious, Dad.</i>

549
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:05,431
Slow down.

550
00:49:07,298 --> 00:49:08,998
Thank you.

551
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:12,964
It's so good.

552
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,664
Are you thinking of your late daughter?

553
00:49:35,364 --> 00:49:37,331
You knew already?

554
00:49:39,698 --> 00:49:41,298
Yes.

555
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:45,398
Back when I had nothing,

556
00:49:46,498 --> 00:49:49,831
I briefly dated a woman.

557
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:52,031
After we broke up,

558
00:49:52,664 --> 00:49:54,898
she gave birth to a child.

559
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:59,198
So that child grew up in an orphanage

560
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,231
for 19 years

561
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:05,998
without even knowing I existed.

562
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:11,464
Angry at the world for abandoning her,

563
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:18,831
full of resentment toward me,

564
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:22,298
she was all bristled up.

565
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:27,031
Like a hedgehog.

566
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:35,198
Do you know why

567
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,931
a hedgehog raises its quills?

568
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:43,198
To protect itself.

569
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:51,331
Because it has no other way.

570
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:02,931
Are you okay?

571
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:05,864
Sir, pull yourself together!

572
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:07,598
Where? Where?

573
00:51:11,364 --> 00:51:13,264
Butler Choi.

574
00:51:13,264 --> 00:51:15,298
Chairman Ga isn't alone, you say?

575
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:17,664
<i>Ah, I couldn't confirm it exactly.</i>

576
00:51:17,664 --> 00:51:22,098
<i>The new bodyguard mentioned leaving late.</i>

577
00:51:22,098 --> 00:51:24,931
You should've informed me about this earlier.

578
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:27,898
Who knows what they might do together?

579
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,098
Professor.

580
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:57,192
There's something I'm curious about you.

581
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:03,517
Go ahead, I'll pay for the ramyeon.

582
00:52:03,517 --> 00:52:07,617
How did you serve six months for stealing
something worth only ten thousand won?

583
00:52:07,617 --> 00:52:09,550
What do your parents do?

584
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,383
Huh? Chairman, I'll go check.

585
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:30,217
You stay hidden since no one can see you here.

586
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,417
I have an idea who it might be.

587
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,250
Who is it?

588
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,383
Father, it's me.

589
00:53:09,517 --> 00:53:11,717
Father.

590
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:14,083
Ramyeon during the holiday? Seriously?

591
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:16,717
It's raining, why are you here?

592
00:53:16,717 --> 00:53:18,650
Is something wrong?

593
00:53:51,717 --> 00:53:53,417
Open up.

594
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:55,517
Not opening?

595
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:57,650
<i>Hey, Yeong Ran, are you there?</i>

596
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,650
<i>Darn.</i>

597
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,883
<i>Hey, Yeong Ran! Kim Yeong Ran!</i>

598
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:07,150
<i>Ugh!</i>

599
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:52,417
Seon Yeong.

600
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:06,717
<i>Yeong Ran.</i>

601
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,450
<i>Kim Yeong Ran.</i>

602
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:19,917
<i>Yeong Ran.</i>

603
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,983
<i>Where are you?</i>

604
00:55:39,317 --> 00:55:42,217
<i>Yeong Ran.</i>

605
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,583
<i>Where are you?</i>

606
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,117
<i>Are you in there?</i>

607
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:34,717
All checked, yes? You can go now.

608
00:56:42,117 --> 00:56:44,950
Take good care of yourself and eat well, Father.

609
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,883
I bought this myself at the department store.

610
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:49,950
Yeah, I'll enjoy it.

611
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:03,718
She's gone.

612
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:05,917
You can come out now.

613
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:55,950
I enjoyed the ramyeon.

614
00:58:44,698 --> 00:58:47,857
[Chairman Ga Sung Ho]

615
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,683
Yes, Chairman.

616
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,150
Come in.

617
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:27,983
I mostly eat and sleep here.

618
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,983
Chairman.

619
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:14,217
Is someone really trying to kill you, Chairman?

620
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:28,283
My daughter, Ye Rim.

621
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,917
I saw the article.

622
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:45,150
Drugs, men, and all that...

623
01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:51,383
That's not true.

624
01:01:53,383 --> 01:01:55,983
My daughter was murdered.

625
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:05,083
She was 19 when she first came to this house
and said she wanted to study art.

626
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,417
I sent her to New York.

627
01:02:10,217 --> 01:02:12,050
All by herself.

628
01:02:22,883 --> 01:02:25,050
The monster who killed my daughter.

629
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:34,483
It was late, but I sent someone to New York.

630
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:38,617
In the article from a local newspaper,
there was a photo.

631
01:02:38,617 --> 01:02:43,083
I found the original photo and enlarged it.

632
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:47,683
Seon Yeong was there.

633
01:02:51,817 --> 01:02:53,950
<i>How's studying abroad? Managing okay?</i>

634
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,550
<i>Yeah.</i>

635
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:02,550
<i>I missed you so much that I had to come visit.</i>

636
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,217
<i>Ah.</i>

637
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:16,783
How could family do something like that?

638
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:20,817
That scar on your wrist. Did your family do that?

639
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:24,517
Because of the money.

640
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:26,817
To those punks, I'm just

641
01:03:27,483 --> 01:03:31,417
the one who snatched the inheritance
they were supposed

642
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:34,950
to get from their mother.

643
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:37,717
But then Ye Rim appeared,

644
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:43,083
who might inherit the company's management rights.

645
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:45,583
She must have become an eyesore.

646
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:49,217
Yeong Ran,

647
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,217
I'm terminally ill.

648
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:57,950
At most, six more months.

649
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:02,483
Before I die,

650
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:05,317
I want to take revenge on those punks.

651
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:09,583
And in the way they fear the most.

652
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,617
<i>There was a rumor circulating among bodyguards.</i>

653
01:05:10,883 --> 01:05:13,817
<i>Sometimes, when protecting wealthy people,</i>

654
01:05:13,817 --> 01:05:16,517
<i>they get offers for contract killings</i>

655
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:18,917
<i>along with large sums of money.</i>

656
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:27,250
Chairman.

657
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:31,283
What can I do for you?

658
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,983
Yeong Ran,

659
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:19,383
marry me.

660
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:40,233
[Miss Incognito]

661
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:51,517
<i>♫ Now is the time ♫</i>

662
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:59,583
<i>♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫</i>

663
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:02,750
<i>♫ I share the light ♫</i>

664
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:09,517
<i>♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫</i>

665
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:11,517
<i>♫ It's not over ♫</i>

666
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:19,050
<i>♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫</i>

667
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:21,350
It's different from what was said earlier, right?

668
01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:25,883
They'd been cleverly hiding it
on the chart, but it was morphine.

669
01:07:25,883 --> 01:07:28,650
I'll deposit the fee into your account.

670
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,117
- Let go!
- The chairman is watching.

671
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,350
Ga Seon Woo!

672
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:34,050
I might get 100 million won, you know?

673
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,450
You'll be the bait, setting the trap and waiting.

674
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:40,117
Now, from this moment,

675
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:44,317
you're not Kim Yeong Ran,
but Bu Se Mi the teacher.
