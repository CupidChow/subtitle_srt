00:43:05,362 --> 00:43:07,162
I'll check.

539
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:19,262
Hey, Reporter Pyo. What's up?

540
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:21,429
Yeah, it's me.

541
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:23,395
Are you with Kim Yeong Ran right now?

542
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:26,729
<i>Could you ask if she knows
someone named Kim Gyo Bong?</i>

543
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,095
Why?

544
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:31,362
He just turned himself in

545
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:33,762
claiming he acted on Kim Yeong Ran's orders.

546
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:35,295
What?

547
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,129
Got it, I'll check.

548
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:39,862
Madam.

549
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:42,729
Do you know someone named Kim Gyo Bong?

550
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,495
Your face says you do.

551
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,295
Let's go home first.

552
00:43:53,295 --> 00:43:55,462
We need a strategy.

553
00:44:02,895 --> 00:44:06,229
The man submitted proof that
he received money from you.

554
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:10,329
Since he was your mother's man,
it's understandable that he's under suspicion.

555
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,295
Evidence can be fabricated or exaggerated.

556
00:44:13,295 --> 00:44:15,195
But the public will blindly believe

557
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,362
the fake, exaggerated proof.

558
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:19,395
You know Ga Seon Yeong did this.

559
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,195
Who wouldn't know that?

560
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:23,829
They've fabricated evidence against you, Madam!

561
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,695
Prove it's fake.

562
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:27,162
That's your job, Attorney Lee.

563
00:44:27,162 --> 00:44:29,195
A lawyer isn't a miracle worker.

564
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:33,962
How much longer do I have to clean up your messes?

565
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,029
You've got quite a list of issues
hanging off you, don't you?

566
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:42,229
Seems Chairman overestimated you,
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

567
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:46,595
I told him to find someone
from a decent, clean background.

568
00:45:02,495 --> 00:45:05,729
<i>The wife of late Gaseong Group
Chairman Ga Sung Ho, Kim Yeong Ran,</i>

569
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:08,195
<i>appeared at a public event for the first time.</i>

570
00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:10,629
That woman's really something.

571
00:45:10,629 --> 00:45:13,362
Marrying a man forty years older?

572
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:14,529
She's not ordinary.

573
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:17,529
How dare she show her face so brazenly?

574
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:21,395
Do you know her well?

575
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,695
She's always on the news.

576
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:29,429
They say she deliberately
went after an old, rich man.

577
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:37,395
Miss, do you always believe
others' words without context?

578
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:39,495
No,

579
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:43,695
I'm just sharing what I heard.

580
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:49,229
I'll take my leave now.

581
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:50,962
Yes.

582
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:52,662
Don't do that.

583
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,929
What if she's actually a good person?

584
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:58,062
Ju Won, eat up a lot, okay?

585
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,994
[Ms. Bu Se Mi]

586
00:46:29,629 --> 00:46:31,262
Tae Min.

587
00:46:47,762 --> 00:46:50,029
I packed some side dishes.

588
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:51,729
Thanks.

589
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:58,429
Did you pack everything?

590
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:00,462
Yeah, mostly.

591
00:47:01,629 --> 00:47:03,029
You should've called me.

592
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,029
I would've brought them.

593
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:09,862
How's Ms. Baek Hye Ji's condition?

594
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:12,095
If it's too hard, come back.

595
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:18,395
I just want to stay by Hye Ji's side.

596
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:23,195
It's my first time.

597
00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:28,095
When people say I'm possessed,

598
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:32,462
they avoid or ignore me at first.

599
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:37,262
But Hye Ji was the first to look at me

600
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:40,295
without prejudice.

601
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,262
And there's no one else at Hye Ji's side.

602
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:50,629
I've noticed since day one.

603
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:56,329
How lonely must she have been to come
all the way here looking for a friend?

604
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:02,695
Dong Min.

605
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:04,329
Yeah?

606
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:08,129
You miss Ms. Bu Se Mi, right?

607
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:11,195
Is the general here?

608
00:48:12,762 --> 00:48:14,229
Can't you tell?

609
00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:16,495
Didn't come today.

610
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:28,229
I just wonder

611
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:30,629
if I'm allowed to miss her.

612
00:48:30,629 --> 00:48:32,695
There's Ju Won too.

613
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:35,795
If you overthink it, is that really love?

614
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:39,095
You said it yourself.

615
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:43,829
When Ju Won's mother left him

616
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:48,195
for the man she liked, you said,

617
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:51,729
'How could anyone

618
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,329
not follow where their heart goes?'

619
00:48:58,295 --> 00:49:00,162
Ms. Bu Se Mi

620
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:02,762
is a strong person.

621
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:06,262
She'll get through this on her own,

622
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:12,562
and me going would just burden her.

623
00:49:12,562 --> 00:49:15,162
Who's ever strong from the start?

624
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:18,595
And that wouldn't be a burden.

625
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:21,329
People are desperate to bring her down,

626
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,095
but having someone by her side

627
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:31,795
who believes in her, that's such a comfort.

628
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,829
Just pretend to give in and go see her.

629
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,595
Yeong Ran!

630
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:17,529
Hey, Tae Min.

631
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:20,795
I'll drive you to Seoul.

632
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:22,495
Wait here.

Leaving?

637
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,829
I should stop relying on you too.

638

Hey, So Yeong.

639
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:28,662
Stop hanging around Kim Gyo Bong.

640
00:51:28,662 --> 00:51:31,162
He's a bloodsucker.

641
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:32,829
I'll handle it myself.

642
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,029
Jeez.

643
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,262
This is for lodging.

644
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:39,462
Why so much?

645
00:51:41,895 --> 00:51:44,895
I found a solid investor.

646
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,895
Thanks for everything so far.

647
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:53,595

I'm sorry.

696

You had another money source.

Let me make a proposal.

698
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,490
A proposal?

Kim Yeong Ran will soon be arrested
as an accomplice to murder.

700
00:56:07,123 --> 00:56:12,123
I want to see Kim Yeong Ran fight
completely alone without help.

701
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:19,157
This family is really unbearable.

The principal of Iseon Kindergarten Lee Mi Seon.

704

She illegally hired Kim Yeong Ran,
a high school graduate who never even set foot

705
00:56:31,523 --> 00:56:35,323
near Iseon Women's University,
as a kindergarten teacher.

706
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:38,923
Don't drag my family in.

707
00:56:41,057 --> 00:56:44,623
All the CCTV here was turned off,

708
00:56:44,623 --> 00:56:46,646
and there are people who would do
anything for money.

709
00:56:46,646 --> 00:56:48,823
How about this?

710
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,190
How much will you pay me

711
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,090
as the price for that proposal?

712
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,257
As much as you want.

713
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,723
Thank you for today.

714
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:40,323
Please go back now.

715
00:57:48,623 --> 00:57:50,457
I have something to say.

716
00:57:58,423 --> 00:58:00,190
Actually, I...

717
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,790
Next time.

718
00:58:03,023 --> 00:58:04,990
We can talk later.

719
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,257
I missed you.

00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,990
I was very worried about you.

721
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,290
I'm not the Bu Se Mi that you know.

722
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:38,257
I'm Kim Yeong Ran, who married
a man 40 years older for money.

723
00:58:38,257 --> 00:58:40,590
The person I saw in Muchang

724
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,490
was Kim Yeong Ran.

725
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:46,423
Someone who's been hurt a lot inside

726
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:48,523
and is easily hurt.

727
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:51,823
And the person standing before me now

728
00:58:52,757 --> 00:58:54,590
is that same person.

729
00:58:57,057 --> 00:58:58,890
Even if your words are cold,

730
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:02,923
I know you're warm-hearted inside.

731
00:59:07,957 --> 00:59:09,890
I like you very much.

732
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:31,790
Those feelings are
all misunderstandings and delusions.

733
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,790
And

734
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,423
I don't like you enough
to abandon my dreams, Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

735
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,823
Once this is all over, I'll leave.

736
00:59:45,257 --> 00:59:49,457
Kim Yeong Ran, the ex-convict wife of Chairman Ga,

737
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:53,557
will start a new life where nobody knows her.

738
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,090
So don't interfere.

739
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,390
I have no intention of ever
returning to this wretched country.

740
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:05,290
Thank you for everything.

742
01:01:40,657 --> 01:01:41,726
[Thank you Kim Ah Young for your special appearance]

748
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,890
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran, you're under
arrest on suspicion of conspiring

749
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,257
to commit murder against Ga Seon Yeong.

750
01:02:25,257 --> 01:02:26,423
Did you check what I asked you to?

751
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:28,790
Don't tell me you're... Don't do anything stupid.

752
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,790
Hey, Kim Yeong Ran.

753
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,157
Come out to Pyeongtan Port dock.

754
01:02:31,157 --> 01:02:34,890
The fact that you contacted us like this
means he's definitely cornered.

755
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,990
- Is she right?
- Yes, it is.

756
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,157
It's really her.

757
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:39,123
Jeon Dong Min, are you at Pyeongtan Port?

758
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,257
Just stay put.

759
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,890
Yeong Ran.

760
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,657
Are you even human after all this?

761
01:02:45,657 --> 01:02:47,290
Ga Seon Yeong.
