(Ms. Incognito)

2
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,771
(This drama is fictional,
and any resemblance

3
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,616
to real people or events is coincidental.)

4
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,283
{\an8}(Episode 4)

5
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,050
{\an8}The kindergarten class is
about to start, you know?

6
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,150
{\an8}When will it end?

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,183
{\an8}It should take about two hours.

8
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,450
{\an8}Dong Min! Jeon Dong Min!

9
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,583
{\an8}Of course.

10
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,050
{\an8}Of course, Teacher.

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,216
{\an8}- Principal.
- Yes.

12
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:18,083
{\an8}Lying itself isn't bad.

13
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,916
As long as you don't get caught.

14
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,383
Of course, Madam.

15
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:29,116
Madam?

16
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,050
Principal.

17
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:38,483
What did you just say?

18
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:42,416
What, Dong Min?

19
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,450
Who is Madam?

20
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,083
You mean Ms. Bu Se Mi?

21
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,050
Huh? What?

22
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:55,116
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,016
Madam?

24
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,416
Madam, yes. Oh, my.

25
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,016
Our church's pastor's wife. Shh!

26
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:06,883
I'm sorry, Madam.

27
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,716
Oh, yes, just a moment...

28
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,383
Dong Min, yes.

29
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:14,416
Yes, I mean, exactly.

30
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,050
Yes, Madam. I'll see you on Sunday then.

31
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,750
Yes. Amen.

32
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,350
Okay.

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,383
Ugh.

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,916
Dong Min, why did you
come here all of a sudden?

35
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,816
You called my name.

36
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,216
Don't you remember?

37
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,550
Did I call your name?

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,350
<i>Dong Min, Jeon Dong Min!</i>

39
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>Oh, my.</i>

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,950
I...

41
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:52,816
called your name.

42
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:55,750
Lately, my memory's been so bad.

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,250
Dong Min!

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,016
It's almost time for
the shuttle bus to arrive!

45
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,916
What?

46
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,116
Wait, you called about the shuttle bus
that's always coming?

47
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:11,516
Dong Min, today's a special day.

48
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,683
Ms. Bu Se Mi's first day at work!

49
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:15,750
We need to welcome the children specially.

50
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,516
Hurry, go out

51
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:20,350
and please give them a special welcome.

52
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,016
Hurry, Mister.

53
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,216
Sorry, Miss.

54
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:25,850
Shh.

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,683
Is eavesdropping your hobby?

56
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,183
No, I was just leaving.

57
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,583
Admiring...

58
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,216
Our beloved Ms. Bu Se Mi!

59
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,583
You're really meticulous.

60
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,916
Then, shall we finish the conversation
we were having earlier?

61
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,550
Let's do that.

62
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,483
Please don't make any mistakes
with titles from now on.

63
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:08,550
Of course, of course!

64
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,583
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

65
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,516
Good.

66
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:17,883
About the 300 million you promised earlier.

67
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,483
It should be manageable
for acquiring the kindergarten.

68
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:23,916
As you can see, it's rural here,
so prices aren't high.

69
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,216
300 million?

70
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:26,950
Yes.

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,983
I did mention three months.

72
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:35,350
Oh dear, just my share was 300 million?

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,550
Don't worry.

74
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,983
I'll settle it as soon as this job is done.

75
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,716
Oh, you tease!

76
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,116
Oh, you're being mischievous.

77
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,416
A verbal contract is valid,
but for things like this,

78
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:58,816
it's always more proper
to have it in writing, right?

79
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,050
You really do seem like
Attorney Lee's older sister.

80
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,916
I'll let the attorney know.

81
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,716
Well, if it's about our money...

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,383
Even our Lord would
forgive this kind of lie.

83
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:15,383
Lying itself isn't bad, you know?

84
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,483
As long as you don't get caught.

85
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:21,383
That's quite a quote.

86
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,516
Would you like to grab a coffee?

87
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,983
(KE Communications)

88
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:31,150
What are they doing?

89
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,683
Looks like there's an internet issue?

90
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:37,950
Tae Min, you notice things like that now?

91
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,883
He's wearing a telecom company vest.

92
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,116
Can't you see? Are you
getting presbyopia already?

93
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,883
Hey, come on!

94
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,716
Madam.

95
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:55,916
The information I'm about to share

96
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,450
is known only to you in Muchang,
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

97
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,916
But why are you telling
me this in such detail?

98
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,883
If anyone in Muchang

99
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:08,850
discovers I'm Kim Yeong Ran, not Bu Se Mi,

100
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,350
and learns my personal information,

101
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,983
it means you leaked it,
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

102
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:20,783
So, please keep this absolutely
confidential from now on.

103
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,683
Then

104
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,250
your real education...

105
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:36,416
You didn't actually graduate
from Iseon Women's University, did you?

106
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,516
No, I only finished high school.

107
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:40,750
I passed the GED for
middle and high school.

108
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,950
Took the middle school equivalency test
at juvenile detention.

109
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,483
Juvenile detention?

110
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:52,350
I stole sanitary pads.

111
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,983
Oh, dear.

112
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,683
You've had such misfortune.

113
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,483
Then these family records must all be...

114
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:01,883
They're fake.

115
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:04,216
I don't know who my father is.
I only have my mother.

116
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,183
She has three criminal convictions.

117
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,883
Oh, my. Oh, my.

118
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:13,983
So your mother has a record too.

119
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,316
It's probably easier to find what's true
than what's false, right?

120
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:26,683
At least my Class-1
driver's license is real.

121
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:30,150
Well, then this isn't
completely fake, is it?

122
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,950
If you want to know more about me,

123
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,950
just search the news
articles, plenty of them.

124
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,816
But, you know the media always exaggerates.

125
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,416
Stuff like calling you a 'gold digger',

126
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,450
that's not all true, right?

127
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,250
Everything except the 'gold digger' part
is basically true.

128
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,150
Oh, so most of it's true.

129
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,483
- Principal.
- Yes?

130
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,916
What should I do now?

131
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,416
Well, then...

132
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,350
Oh! Could you head over first?

133
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,116
I'll follow shortly.

134
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,416
You can leave your bag here.

135
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,250
Muchang is a safe place.

136
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,450
By the way, Miss...

137
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:22,783
You and our Don aren't involved
in anything, right?

138
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,916
I'm not into guys like Attorney Lee.

139
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,983
What? Huh?

140
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,783
Wait, that somehow feels insulting.

141
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:42,050
'Just not my type.' Pfft.

142
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,983
Ugh, really.

143
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,883
Cams in the classroom.

144
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,483
But not in the hallway.

145
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,716
What are you doing?

146
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,850
Aren't kindergartens required to have CCTV?

147
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,816
Huh?

148
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:19,650
Daycares are required to have it,

149
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,950
but kindergartens aren't.

150
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,350
You didn't know?

151
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,683
My previous kindergarten
had cameras everywhere.

152
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,283
There's a call.

153
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,516
- Yes.
<i>- Installation's complete.</i>

154
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:37,283
<i>I've sent you a link.</i>

155
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:41,383
<i>Install it to monitor from your phone
or laptop anytime.</i>

156
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:43,416
Good work.

157
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,483
(Would you like to open the link?)

158
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,983
Why are you staring?

159
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,416
- Mi Seon.
- Huh?

160
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,450
Is Ms. Bu Se Mi...

161
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,783
She's pretty, right?
You can't take your eyes off her.

162
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,350
Not that much.

163
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,183
I get it, Dong Min.

164
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:15,916
But don't you dare make a move. Ever.

165
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,183
With her credentials and looks,
you think she's single?

166
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:22,950
Bet her boyfriend's loaded too.

167
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,883
How'd you know that?

168
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:27,250
Of course. I know that.

169
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,583
I can tell at a glance.

170
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,683
Birds of a feather, you know?

171
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:33,916
Mi Seon, about Ms. Bu Se Mi,

172
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,616
you did properly verify her education
and background, right?

173
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:40,083
I personally called Iseon Kindergarten
to confirm everything.

174
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,583
Resumes don't show character
or compatibility, right?

175
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,883
What, you live in deception?

176
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,450
I just don't want the kids hurt.

177
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,183
You should care more
about this as principal.

178
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:50,016
Then, this time, I'll pay extra attention.

179
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,783
So stop suspecting
everything, okay? Please?

180
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,983
Oh, hello.

181
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,383
(Order)
Hello.

182
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:06,183
- Hello.
- Hi.

183
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,783
- Slowly. Shoes in place.
- Take your time.

184
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:09,850
Good.

185
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,883
- Hello.
- You're here.

186
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,316
What brings you here?

187
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,350
To file a missing person report.

188
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,350
How old is the person?

189
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,250
Any dementia or chronic illness?

190
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:36,016
Twenty-nine this year?

191
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:37,716
Twenty-nine...

192
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,483
What? Are you joking?

193
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,016
My father remarried.

194
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:47,983
Even if you report an adult missing,

195
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:50,750
we can't search without
proof of endangerment.

196
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,016
And even if we find her,

197
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:55,850
we can't disclose
contact info if she refuses.

198
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,850
So, I might never find my mother?

199
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,050
Even when an adult is missing,
their personal decision is important.

200
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,983
Isn't your mother more likely hiding

201
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,383
than missing?

202
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:13,250
Detective, you're really
not understanding me.

203
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,916
Pardon?

204
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,516
Yes, this is Sergeant Kim Hak Su.

205
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:19,883
Yes, Team Leader.

206
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,983
Yes, yes.

207
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,616
What? The chief called you?

208
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:27,550
Ah, yes, understood.

209
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,516
Though she's an adult,
there's sufficient reason to believe you.

210
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,183
We'll file a missing person report.

211
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:40,316
We'll conduct a nationwide search
and investigate the disappearance.

212
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,716
Finally, you understand.

213
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:56,383
You're new here.

214
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:58,250
Who introduced you?

215
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,950
Someone named Kim So Yeong.

216
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,783
Kim So Yeong?

217
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,150
That's a common name.

218
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,650
I know at least three Kim So Yeongs myself.

219
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,916
Short So Yeong, Tall So
Yeong, Chubby So Yeong.

220
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:14,083
But

221
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:18,416
the Kim So Yeong you did time with for
pyramid schemes, that one's not common, huh?

222
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,016
You know foot baths are great, right?

223
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,816
Raise your body temperature just one degree
and it prevents cancer and such.

224
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:32,783
Add this enzyme to a foot bath

225
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:36,516
and your skin becomes smooth and silky.

226
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,350
My mother suffered from diabetes for years.

227
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,950
No hospital in Korea could cure it,

228
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,450
but enzyme cured her.

229
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,550
Then please enjoy a
foot bath before you leave.

230
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,250
How much is that?

231
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,883
Oh, sir! You've got a good eye.

232
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,450
I'm not the boss yet.

233
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,950
With that shiny forehead
and prominent nose,

234
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,083
you're born to be a CEO.

235
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,016
This bottle costs 180,000 won.

236
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,750
Original production cost
was over 300,000 won,

237
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,283
but we deal directly
with Cambodian factories,

238
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,216
so we offer half price.

239
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:16,083
We're selling at barely 30,000 won profit,

240
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,216
practically giving it away.

241
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,983
Should we buy a hundred bottles?

242
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,650
A hundred?

243
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,350
That many?

244
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,416
How many installments would you like?

245
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:36,050
Forget installments.

246
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,650
I'll buy 100 bottles

247
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:43,650
if you tell me where Kim So Yeong is.

248
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,483
(18 million won)

249
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,116
(Kim So Yeong)

250
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,616
You called earlier?

251
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,250
Me? Just working like a dog, as usual.

252
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,283
Why? What's up?

253
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,983
A clean-cut guy's looking for me?

254
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,950
I've never even dated a 'clean-cut' man.

255
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,116
Hyeon Ok.

256
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,083
Did you tell them where I am?

257
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,350
Hey.

258
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,350
Don't you trust me?

259
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,783
Just warning you to be careful.

260
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,616
Got it.

261
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,216
What, what, what?

262
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,783
Why don't you follow me to the toilet
while you're at it?

263
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:57,950
Oh, jeez, this.

264
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,716
I saved yours but you disappeared.

265
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:02,150
Ah, hot.

266
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,516
Once it cools it's not as good.

267
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,416
Anyway, if someone looks for me,
pretend you don't know me.

268
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,750
Ugh, this place is just like jail.

269
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,150
A mutt's on my tail,
even following me to the bathroom.

270
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,616
I don't follow you when
you poop, it smells.

271
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:20,683
Whoa, jeez...

272
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:22,316
Not talking about you.

273
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,216
Okay, talk again later.

274
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:31,383
People who say 'don't you trust me'
are never trustworthy.

275
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,516
Tasty.

276
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:40,883
Nice touch.

277
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,850
(Gaseong)

278
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,883
I'll handle your coffee from now on.

279
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,583
Suit yourself.

280
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:57,283
<i>Attorney, it's Byeol Nae.</i>

281
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,350
<i>Someone's looking for Kim So Yeong.</i>

282
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,616
<i>The caller is named Hyeon Ok.</i>

283
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,916
<i>Kim So Yeong says she can't be trusted.</i>

284
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,350
<i>They were prison mates,</i>

285
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,750
<i>but they only have each other.</i>

286
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,616
<i>Oh, Attorney,</i>

287
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,916
<i>and she called me a 'mutt'.</i>

288
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,916
<i>It seems Kim So Yeong</i>

289
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,683
<i>doesn't realize how smart mutts are.</i>

290
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:24,750
Facts, opinions, and
plot twists all in one.

291
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,683
Her texts have hidden charm.

292
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,150
Oh! You scared me.

293
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,016
Sorry, did I startle you?

294
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:35,916
I did ballet as a child,

295
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,616
so I'm good at silent walking.

296
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:46,216
This vacuum is really quiet too, isn't it?

297
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,850
Of course, it's turned off.

298
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,950
Is anyone here normal?

299
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,116
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

300
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,150
Yes?

301
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,550
If you're done cleaning,
get back to the annex.

302
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,016
Attorney Lee, did you make my toast too?

303
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:09,216
That's so touching.

304
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:10,616
Shall we eat together now?

305
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,716
I'm starving right now.

306
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,083
I'll eat all of this myself.

307
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,316
Oh, and,

308
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,803
I'm going out this afternoon,

309
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:21,383
so clean every corner before then.

310
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,650
There's too much dust in the corners.

311
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,883
Why is it so quiet?

312
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,883
Attorney Lee.

313
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,150
Attorney Lee.

314
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,416
Attorney Lee.

315
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,983
Strawberry Class!

316
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:08,783
- Yes!
- Oh.

317
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,416
Aren't they adorable?

318
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,850
The kids have so much energy,

319
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,816
so it takes time for them to calm down.

320
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,816
Principal!

321
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,516
Principal!

322
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,183
Oh, please come in.
I've been waiting, just a moment.

323
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:32,516
Actually, we had a meeting scheduled today
with the kindergarten supplies coordinator...

324
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,683
Miss!

325
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:38,950
Can you watch the
kids for a bit? Just briefly!

326
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,383
Are you asking me to teach them?

327
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:41,950
It'll just be a short while, really quick!

328
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,650
You can read them a
book or teach them a song,

329
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,983
do anything you want, anything.

330
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,750
- Wait here.
- Principal.

331
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,183
Hello, children.

332
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,383
- Hello.
- Hello.

333
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:07,383
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi, starting today

334
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:09,883
with the Strawberry Class.

335
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:14,150
Well, today's lesson will be...

336
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,816
- Miss!
- Yeah?

337
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,216
How long will you be staying here?

338
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,750
You'll stay until Christmas, right?

339
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,916
We'll make a Christmas tree, right?

340
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,350
Well...

341
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:29,850
That's...

342
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,483
Ju Won, what's that?

343
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,516
I've never seen that before.

344
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:34,916
Oh, Uncle Tae Min bought it for me.

345
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,816
Really? Let me play with it a bit.

346
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:40,116
Play with your own toy.

347
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:42,016
Just let me play with it.

348
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,283
No, play with your own.

349
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,116
- Ah!
- Hey, that's mine.

350
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:47,316
Give it back!

351
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:49,450
- Kids, stop fighting.
- Fight.

352
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,950
- Children, no fighting.
- Fight.

353
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,583
Oh my goodness.

354
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,883
Kids! Quiet!

355
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,550
- Wow!
- Wow!

356
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,250
Kids,

357
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,883
focus!

358
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,616
Sit down.

359
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,516
Children, have you heard of self-defense?

360
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:44,250
By age seven, you should know
how to protect yourselves.

361
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,316
That's what I believe.

362
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:50,350
There are 30,000 child
abuse cases annually,

363
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,316

Bad people

365
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,616
always target those weaker than them.

366
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:12,283
Understood?

367
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,183
- Yes.
- Yes.

368
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:19,916
This is the most popular product
for kids these days.

369
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:25,616
But nothing here really
catches my eye this time.

370
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:27,483
Oh dear, what a shame.

371
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,916
Principal,

372
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:36,050
I haven't met this month's quota yet,
so I'll give you a great deal.

373
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,583
Sorry for making you come all this way.

374
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,183
Well, our enrollment
has been decreasing too,

375
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:44,750
so we can't afford to replenish supplies.

376
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,583
We've done business for a long time,
and I'd love to help you out,

377
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,383
but our situation is tight too.

378
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:55,750
We have a more affordable version here.

379
00:23:56,616 --> 00:23:58,250
Kids,

380
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,983
this person is the villain now.

381
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,850
That's my Dino-ping!

382
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,116
Ping? What ping?

383
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,350
This dinosaur is the bad guy.

384
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,783
The villain is attacking.

385
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,850
So what should we do first?

386
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,383
What should we do first?

387
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:18,983
I don't know either.

388
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,450
Great for sensory play
and fine motor development.

389
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,416
Ah, wait.

390
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,250
What's that sound?

391
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,850
What is that noise?

392
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:42,516
Okay! Kids! One more time!

393
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:48,183
- Help me!
- Help!

394
00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:51,416
After calling for help,
use anything you have

395
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,750
to distract your attacker!

396
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:00,083
Seize any opening!

397
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,983

398
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,816
Strike the weak spots!

399
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:06,650
Hey!

400
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,850
My Dino-ping burst!

401
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,983
- It popped!
- My Dino-ping.

402
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:31,150
The Dino-ping popped.

403
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,183
- Dino-ping.
- CPR.

404
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:34,883
One, two, one, two.

407
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,550
Miss, what are you doing?

408
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:50,350
We were practicing self-defense.

409
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,050
- Wake up.
- Dino-ping, wake up.

410
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,550
- Wake up.
- Oh, my.

411

412

What on earth is going on here?

413
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,716
- Rescue breathing!
- Why did it burst?

414
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:01,250
Dino-ping is expensive.

415
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,016
The teacher popped Dino-ping.

416
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,983
Oh, don't cry.

417
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,450
Oh no, three tissues.

418
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,683
The principal will fix it.

419
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:13,916
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

420
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,216
Oh, my, what is this?

421
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:16,383
Blow your nose!

422
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:17,950
Ms. Bu Se Mi,

423
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,683
may I have a word with you?

424
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,816
- Wake up.
- Dino-ping, wake up.

425
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,116
CPR!

426
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:32,950
One, two, one, two.

427
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,983
- One, two.
- CPR!

428
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:43,250
She'll be able to last
three more months, right?

429
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:51,450
Huh?

(Park Seo Jun's Fees for June, July, and August)
Why is Seo Jun's tuition fee here?

431
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:56,716
I definitely put this in my bag.

432
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,383
Wait.

433
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:07,450
Oh, what is this?

434
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,750
Oh, my. Why is the money gone? Oh!

435
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,050
I'll get straight to the point.

436
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,216
Why would a graduate of Iseon Women's
University who taught at Iseon Kindergarten

437
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,883
come all the way to Muchang?

438
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,083
As you can see, I came
as a kindergarten teacher.

439
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,150
Does teaching self-defense
on the first day make sense?

440
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,383
In fact, I

441
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:29,116
believe the world is harsher on the weak.

442
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,950
So, children should learn from a young age
to protect themselves...

443
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,216
If you know that,

444
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:36,583
don't you realize how dangerous it is
to teach self-defense in a classroom

445
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,550
without safety measures?

446
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,116
If they get hurt, it
could scar them for life.

447
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,783
Did you cause trouble in Seoul
and get sent down here?

448
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,916
Ju Won's father.

449
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,916
You're crossing the line.

450
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:56,716
I didn't come to Muchang
after causing trouble in Seoul.

451
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:02,216
I also

452
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,883
teach part-time PE here.

453
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,350
And I'm Ju Won't father, a parent here.

454
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,016
In the last two years,
five teachers have come and gone.

455
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:12,283
Three had serious problems.

456
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:13,283
The other two

457
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:17,016
ran away without even saying goodbye
because they hated the countryside.

At least don't hurt the children.

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,850
I'll be watching closely. Seriously.

461
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,950
I clearly put this in my bag.

Ah, no.

463
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,450
How about here?

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,516

What are you talking about?

478
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,583
A white envelope.

479
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,783
Seo Jun's grandfather
can't do bank transfers,

480
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:38,883
so he always sends tuition
fees in cash envelopes.

482
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:43,316

- Principal.
- Yes?

Are you suspecting me because of my past?

485
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,616
Me? That's not it.

486

00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,483
- Let me carry it.
- It's fine.

546
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:46,650
Why did you follow me?

547
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,416
Ah, well...

548
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,483
Did you think I was running off because
what you said on the field upset me?

549
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:59,016
No, that's not it.

550
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:06,616
Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

551
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,216
Yes?

552
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,516
You seem to misunderstand me a lot.

553
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:16,616
I'm neither that bad nor weak.

554
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:23,616
Earlier,

555
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,483
I didn't mean to hurt you, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

556
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,083
I got hurt during exercise too,

557
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,650
and when you kept mentioning
self-defense techniques,

558
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,383
I got angry.

559
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,416
I'm sorry. I misunderstood many things.

560
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,516
But you know,

561
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:44,916
you don't always have
to apologize with money.

562
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,450
Sometimes a sincere word
means more than money.

563
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:51,883
But for those who need money,

564
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,816
this method might be better
than a sincere apology.

565
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,116
(Dino-ping)

566
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:09,983
(Sorry)

567
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,583
See you tomorrow.

568
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,316
Dino-ping.

569
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,750
Hello, Teacher.

570
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,650
I'm Jun's mom.

571
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,350
Hello.

572
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:14,216
Miss, you run really fast.

573
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,183
How do you know that?

574
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:20,216
This is a small town.
Everyone knows everything.

575
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:23,616
Oh, Miss, we don't have fancy cafés
or theaters in Muchang.

576
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,183
You'd need to drive 30
minutes to find a café.

577
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:27,583
Is that okay with you?

578
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:31,883
Yes, I don't like fancy
cafés or theaters anyway.

579
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,883
You're not like other
young people these days.

580
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,616
You look young yourself.

581
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,616
I hear that a lot.

582
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:46,216
Actually, I didn't mention it earlier
because I thought you might feel pressured.

583
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:48,783
I'm the president of the
women's association here.

584
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,150
People kept saying I'm too young
to be association president,

585
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,883
so I dress to look older.

586
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,750
So, here's the thing.

587
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,583
When someone new comes to town,

588
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,883
we usually share a meal

589
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:01,950
and get acquainted.

590
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,183
It's good to start on friendly terms.

591
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,683
What do you like, Miss?

592
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:08,916
Uh...

593
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:12,983
Things I like?

594
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:16,416
(Jeong Hwa)

595
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:18,983
<i>Miss, you like spicy ramyeon, right?</i>

596
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,516
<i>- Oh, I bet you've never had ramyeon before.</i>
- Jeong Woo.

597
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:22,783
Pen, pen.

598
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:25,550
- Why?
- To take notes.

599
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,783
Just record it. Record.

600
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:31,216
Ah, right.

601
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:33,450
(Jun's Mom)

602
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:38,850
I prefer Hanwoo beef with double marbling,

603
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:44,516
and abalone must be wild-caught
from Wando's waters.

604
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:47,483
Wild-caught? My, you have refined tastes.

605
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:51,050
And as for the strawberries...

606
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,883
(Jeong Hwa)

607
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,616
<i>I love Muchang strawberries.</i>

608
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:56,750
<i>Oh.</i>

609
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,850
Wait. Isn't that Ms. Bu Se Mi's voice?

610
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,716
- Don't say anything.
- I left my phone here...

611
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,650
(Jeong Hwa)
<i>Oh, there it is.</i>

612
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,783
Why are you acting like that
when it's just the two of you?

613
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,983
Wait... I need to talk to her.

614
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:12,983
How many strawberries
should I bring tomorrow?

615
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,816
- No, wait...
- How many?

616
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:16,383
Just get out.

617
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:18,016
(Jeong Hwa)

618
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:22,050
Ugh, I have asthma.

619
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,416
- Jun's mom.
- Yes?

620
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,150
You can drop me off here.

621
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,616
But we still have some way to go?

622
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,383
Let me out.

623
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,783
Miss, when should we
schedule the welcome dinner?

624
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:46,750
Meals with parents would violate
the Kim Yeong Ran Anti-Graft Law.

625
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,916
Thank you for the ride.

626
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,583
What's the Kim Yeong Ran Anti-Graft Law?

627
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,150
Open sesame!

628
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,950
Sesame!

629
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:40,750
What?

630
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:07,216
I can't do it.

631
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,750
Why are you the only one in red?

632
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,950
You must feel so lonely.

633
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,550
Huh?

634
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:15,016

(Muchang Iseon Kindergarten)

636
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:19,116
My friend.

637
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,816
Found you.

638
00:43:57,116 --> 00:43:58,516
She's not answering your calls?

639
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:01,816
Cheol Su, meet with
Hye Ji and convince her.

640
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:04,083
Don't worry, Butler Choi.

641
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:07,383
Hye Ji and I have history.

642
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,850
Women can't forget old ties, you know.

643
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,983
A reliable man like me...

644
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,683
Ugh, fine. I'm really counting on you.

645
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:16,083
Okay, okay.

646
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:21,550
{\an8}(System Security Zone)

647
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,983
It's been a while, Butler Choi.

648
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:25,716
Mr. Yang Cheol Su.

649
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:27,150
Hi, Hye Ji.

650
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,116
You've been well, Hye Ji?

651
00:44:29,116 --> 00:44:30,716
Huh?

652
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,050
But you're not part of this family anymore.

653
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,016
Fine, let's talk here.

654
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:37,950
Yeah. Come out and talk.

655
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,150
Hye Ji.

656
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,850
Do you contact Yeong Ran?

657
00:44:51,816 --> 00:44:56,383
Why should I share that with you two?

658
00:44:57,683 --> 00:45:00,250
So, you are in contact.

659
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:05,850
- So what?
- The professor is suing her stepmom.

660
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,116
You've seen the news, right?

661
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:10,283
Yes.

662
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:13,183
The professor said if we testify in court,

663
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:14,850
she'll reinstate us

664
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,816
and give generous compensation.

665
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,416
Wow.

666
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,050
Hye Ji.

667
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,750
You need to be on our side.

668
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,016
We nobodies should stick together.

669
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,883
- Yeong Ran's a chaebol now.
- Exactly.

670
00:45:28,883 --> 00:45:32,250
She's out of our league.

671
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,983
And frankly,

672
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:37,783
would Yeong Ran really
report her own assistant?

673
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:41,050
- Of course not.
- Never.

674
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,783
Hye Ji.

675
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:52,683
You know where Yeong Ran is, right?

676
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:57,316
Ah.

677
00:45:57,316 --> 00:46:01,616
But honestly, I don't
know her exact location.

678
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,550
But if I watch Lee Don
for a few days, I might.

679
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,850
Really?

680
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,316
If you find out, we can
put in a good word with the professor.

681
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:13,616
Of course.

682
00:46:13,616 --> 00:46:14,883
About what?

683
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:19,016
That info's worth hundreds of millions.
You expect it for free?

684
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:23,583
Hye Ji.

685
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:27,350
We're on the same side now, aren't we?

686
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:38,383
I'll contact you if I find out.

687
00:46:43,516 --> 00:46:46,083
- Yeah.
- You better contact us, okay?

688
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,183
Hey, Hye Ji.

689
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:49,316
- If you find out...
- Contact us.

690
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,850
Will she even contact us?

691
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,683
Why did she let go of my hand?

692
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:56,083
She said she'd contact us.

693
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,250
- She will, right?
- Yeah.

694
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,516
How did things end up like this?

695
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:03,283
Why should I share the information I found

696
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:05,916
with you guys?

697
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:09,016

698

700
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,816

00:47:56,483 --> 00:47:58,150
No, no.

00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,916
Oh, Ju Won.

705
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:09,850
Miss, maybe you're not that bright.

706
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,483
Huh?

707
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,416
Miss here.

708
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:34,083
I'm fine.

709
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:36,083
It needs a bit more grilling.

710
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,750
Please wait.

711
00:48:46,183 --> 00:48:49,850
Dad, there's a message.
Let me read it for you.

712
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,283
Okay.

713
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:53,383
Just as Ju Won's father said,

714
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:57,250
she's someone who probably
messed up in Seoul and snuck back here.

715
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,516
We rushed in without
proper vetting. Our mistake.

716
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:02,650
Exactly. Ju Won...

717
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:09,383
That wasn't me.

718
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,250
I'm full.

719
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,283
Miss, this is a misunderstanding.

00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:01,983
Attorney Lee.

727
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:04,616
The Muchang folks seem to suspect me.

728
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:10,783
Dong Min, what are you doing there?

729
00:50:15,116 --> 00:50:18,916
Then, let's make befriending
Muchang residents part of the mission.

730
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,416
It seems Ga Seon Yeong filed
a missing person's report.

731
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,650
To survive three months in Muchang safely,

732
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,383
that would be wiser.

733
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:27,583
I'll call again later.

734
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,050
What are you two doing here?

735
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,616
Ah, these are strawberries I grew.

736
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:40,816
Try some.

737
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:42,950
No, thanks. I don't like strawberries.

738
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,750
But you said you liked them earlier...

739
00:50:47,316 --> 00:50:49,016
Ah, Miss.

740
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:50,750
I know it because...

741
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,783
No, thanks.

742
00:50:51,783 --> 00:50:54,250
Miss, want some makgeolli with these?

743
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,750
Strawberries and makgeolli
are a heavenly combo.

744
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,650
I can't handle alcohol well.

745
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,650
You two enjoy yourselves.

746
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:14,683
I won't get kicked out for three months.

747
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,616
Dong Min.

748
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:31,916
I really admire women
who take care of themselves.

749
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:35,716
Right.

750
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:38,083
Just meet any woman, please.

751
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,816
But I don't...

752
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:46,483
- Dong Min.
- What?

753
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:49,050
Today your logic and
your heart will collide.

754
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:52,750
Whatever happens, don't
lose your head. Got it?

755
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:56,183
Skip the horoscope today.

756
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:59,416
Pray for a strawberry harvest, whether
it's for the general or baby spirit.

757
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,516
Boss, does that count as a day's wage too?

758
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:04,750
What's wrong with you?

759
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,950
<i>Apply it on your eyelids like this.</i>

760
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,050
<i>Dab the center of your ears too.</i>

761
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,783
<i>What next?</i>

762
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,583
<i>Make sure to apply it evenly.</i>

763
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:15,383
<i>Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.</i>

764
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:20,816
<i>When blending, lower your middle finger
slightly to reduce the area...</i>

765
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,883
Miss.

766
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,916
Jun's mom, mind giving me a ride?

767
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,216
Oh! Of course not.

768
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:35,850
Get in, get in.

769
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,150
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

770
00:52:49,283 --> 00:52:51,016
Miss.

771
00:52:51,016 --> 00:52:54,950
About the other day...
We were just trying to be hospitable.

772
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,883
Accepting meals from parents
violates the Kim Yeong Ran Act,

773
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:01,383
but me treating you is fine, right?

774
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,616
What do you mean?

775
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:06,383
I was thinking of holding
a welcome party in our yard today.

776
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,183
Whose welcome party?

777
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:09,850
Mine.

778
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:12,750
We'd love that.

779
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,250
This isn't just your welcome party,

780
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,050
but it's more like neighbors
getting together for a meal.

781
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,016
That's small-town hospitality, you know.

782
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:21,516
Lovely.

783
00:53:21,516 --> 00:53:22,883
Where are you going, Miss?

784
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:23,916
To the kindergarten.

785
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,083
But it's Saturday.

786
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,716
Huh?

787
00:53:29,516 --> 00:53:30,950
<i>This is the Women's Association President.</i>

788
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,650
<i>Today at 5 PM at Mr. Jeon Dong Min's house,</i>

789
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:38,216
<i>we're hosting a welcome party
for our new neighbor, Ms. Bu Se Mi.</i>

790
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,550
<i>All residents should pause their work</i>

791
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,050
<i>- and attend.</i>
- Are we really holding the welcome dinner today?

792
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:48,716
Yeah, Dong Min, we decided to hold it.

793
00:53:48,716 --> 00:53:50,616
Oh, my.

794
00:53:50,616 --> 00:53:53,416
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

795
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,916
Madam... No, no.

796
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:57,050
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

797
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,183
A welcome party? Seriously?

798
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:01,616
Don't you know this breaks
the Kim Yeong Ran Act?

799
00:54:01,616 --> 00:54:04,283
This is a huge problem.

800
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:10,483
Yes, that's why
I decided to host the dinner myself.

801
00:54:10,483 --> 00:54:13,916
To get to know the neighbors
and build relationships.

802
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,516
I've heard Dongwaru's food is great.

803
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,450
- Here.
- Miss, why are you like this?

804
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,383
Normally, as the principal,
I would handle all this...

805
00:54:27,383 --> 00:54:29,483
- Understood.
- No.

806
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:32,950
I'm good at things like this.

807
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,083
I'll prepare everything perfectly.

808
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:38,016
Don't worry, let go of
this and answer the phone.

809
00:54:38,016 --> 00:54:41,350
I receive your sincerity.

810
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,750
Alright, then.

811
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,783
{\an8}(Muchang Mart)

812
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,816
Huh?

813
00:55:17,616 --> 00:55:19,250
Oh, my. He's...

814
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,050
Hey, Jeon Dong Min!
What are you doing there?

815
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,316
Grab a shopping cart and get in here fast.

816
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:26,283
Hurry up, we don't have time.
Come on, Dong Min. Ugh, seriously.

817
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:27,916
Okay.

818
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:31,450
Jeez.

819
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:39,083
Dong Min, put the snacks
and dried side dishes

820
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:41,616
in there with some love.

821
00:55:41,616 --> 00:55:44,516
But Ms. Bu's hosting the welcome party.
Why are we doing this?

822
00:55:44,516 --> 00:55:46,316
Because Ms. Bu has other matters to handle.

823
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:48,150
This is how we help each other in life.

824
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,916
Why are you always so grumpy with her?

825
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,616
Did you also get bribed by her money?

826
00:55:55,616 --> 00:55:57,083
To make you take her side?

827
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,616
No, nothing like that!

828
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,883
This is really weird.

829
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:05,150
But, why does Ms. Bu Se Mi

830
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,483
even need to be in Muchang,
spending money to bribe people?

831
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:10,616
Why did Don recommend her anyway?

832
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,783
You're too suspicious.

833
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:15,050
She just likes the countryside,

834
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,083
wants to make friends,

835
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,283
and has money to spend.

836
00:56:19,283 --> 00:56:20,783
You wouldn't understand
because you don't have it.

837
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:23,816
Dong Min, if you won't help me,
go stand over there.

838
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:27,116
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

839
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:29,783
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

840
00:56:29,783 --> 00:56:30,916
I'll bring the dried side dishes.

841
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:36,050
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

842
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:38,750
Hallelujah.

843
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:45,683
Why's it so quiet here?

844
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,783
Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

845
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,783
Ms. Baek Hye...

846
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,283
Baek Hye Ji!

847
00:57:14,283 --> 00:57:16,016
(Baek Hye Ji)

848
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:20,983
<i>The subscriber you dialed
is not available. Please leave a message...</i>

849
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,783
What?

850
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,683
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

851
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,550
What?

852
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,383
Where did she disappear to?

853
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,216
Oh, no, what do I do?

854
00:57:51,216 --> 00:57:52,950
Hello, everyone.

855
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,983
Thank you for your hard work.

856
00:57:54,983 --> 00:57:57,550
Please take care of this.

857
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,950
- Wow, this is amazing.
- What's all this?

858
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,683
Ms. Bu Se Mi prepared everything.

859
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:05,216
She's someone who truly loves the children.

860
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:08,116
We don't even have a
play café here, you know.

861
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:10,316
Ah, I'm honestly envious.

862
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:13,416
How rich does she have to be
for a kindergarten teacher to go this far?

863
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:15,616
- Unbelievable.
- Hey.

864
00:58:15,616 --> 00:58:19,616
Dong Min, put the makgeolli
in the farmhouse fridge.

865
00:58:19,616 --> 00:58:21,016
There's no space here.

866
00:58:21,016 --> 00:58:23,583
- Okay.
- Oh, Ju Won will love this!

867
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,116
Ah, he's going to love this.

868
00:58:25,116 --> 00:58:26,783
Please handle this well.

869
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:28,950
This is wonderful.

870
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,450
Miss, I'll just leave the
makgeolli here and go.

871
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,116
CCTV.

872
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,816
Dong Min.

873
00:58:58,816 --> 00:59:00,450
Yes?

874
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,516
What's that?

875
00:59:07,516 --> 00:59:08,716
Oh, this?

876
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:10,483
Makgeolli. For the welcome party later.

877
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:12,450
Wait a second.

878
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:19,183
Can we talk privately?

879
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,016
Let me put that down first. Just a moment.

880
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:42,583
Miss, why are you so close to me?

881
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:45,050
Oh.

882
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:48,583
When did I do that?

883
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,383
Right now.

884
00:59:53,516 --> 00:59:54,550
I'll just put this here.

885
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,816
I said stay still.

886
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,950
Everything arrived at once.

887
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,583
This needs to chill in the cooler.

888
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,050
- Cooler?
- Makgeolli should be served cold.

889
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,755
The cooler.

890
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:11,553
- Let me put this here.
- Good work.

891
01:00:11,553 --> 01:00:14,416
- Is here okay?
- It's fine.

892
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:18,483
Shouldn't we mix the food varieties?

893
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:21,283
Pair them with tasty sides.

894
01:00:21,283 --> 01:00:24,750
All the fried rice is here.

895
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:29,983
Hey, Tae Min, this is...

896
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:40,116
You seem like a new face...

897
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,183
Who are you looking for?

898
01:00:43,183 --> 01:00:46,083
Is Teacher Bu Se Mi here?

899
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,550
Huh? Who?

900
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,283
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

901
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:56,216
Yes, she's here. And you are?

902
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,083
Oh.

903
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,716
I'm...

904
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,916
Se Mi's friend.

905
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,683
Oh, what are you doing?

906
01:01:24,316 --> 01:01:27,083
I might not seem like it,
but I'm very traditional.

907
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,483
- I'll put this down quickly.
- Dong Min!

908
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:48,016
It's been a while.

909
01:02:48,016 --> 01:02:49,816
My friend.

910
01:03:45,983 --> 01:03:47,683
{\an8}<i>Thank you for welcoming me.</i>

911
01:03:47,683 --> 01:03:50,216
{\an8}<i>How on earth did Ms. Baek Hye Ji
find out I'm here?</i>

912
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:53,016
{\an8}<i>Oh, no. Baek Hye Ji!</i>

913
01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:55,483
{\an8}<i>There are no secrets
in this world, you know.</i>

914
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:59,016
{\an8}<i>If you let dogs and pigs look down on you,
you become the dog and pig. Understand?</i>

915
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:02,183
{\an8}<i>I might be able to find out
where our Yeong Ran is.</i>

916
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:04,450
{\an8}<i>Attorney Lee, where did
you hide Kim Yeong Ran?</i>

917
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:07,216
{\an8}<i>If you're in Muchang,
you have to follow Muchang's rules.</i>

918
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:08,616
{\an8}<i>- Stop it.
- Ms. Se Mi.</i>

919
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:12,416
{\an8}<i>You may have a sharp tongue,
but I think you're actually a kind person.</i>
