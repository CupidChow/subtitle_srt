5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,831
The kindergarten class is
about to start, you know?

6
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:21,931
When will it end?

7
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,964
It should take about two hours.

8
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:28,231
Dong Min! Jeon Dong Min!

9
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:37,364
Of course.

10
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:38,831
Of course, Teacher.

11
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,997
- Principal.
- Yes.

14
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,164
Of course, Madam.

Madam?

16
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,831
Principal.

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,264
What did you just say?

18
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:10,197
What, Dong Min?

19
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:12,231
Who is Madam?

20
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:16,864
You mean Ms. Bu Se Mi?

21
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:18,831
Huh? What?

22
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:22,897
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

Madam, yes. Oh, my.

25
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:32,797
Our church's pastor's wife. Shh!

26
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:34,664
I'm sorry, Madam.

27
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:37,497
Oh, yes, just a moment...

28
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,164
Dong Min, yes.

29
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:42,197
Yes, I mean, exactly.

30
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:45,831
Yes, Madam. I'll see you on Sunday then.

31
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,531
Yes. Amen.

32
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,131
Okay.

33
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:53,164
Ugh.

34
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,697
Dong Min, why did you come here all of a sudden?

35
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,597
You called my name.

36
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:00,997
Don't you remember?

37
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,331
Did I call your name?

38
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,131
<i>Dong Min, Jeon Dong Min!</i>

39
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,731
<i>Oh, my.</i>

40
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,731
I...

41
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,597
called your name.

42
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:23,531
Lately, my memory's been so bad.

43
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,031

00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:31,797
It's almost time for the shuttle bus to arrive!

45
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:33,697
What?

46
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:36,897
Wait, you called about the shuttle bus
that's always coming?

47
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:39,297
Dong Min, today's a special day.

48
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,464
Ms. Bu Se Mi's first day at work!

49
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:43,531
We need to welcome the children specially.

50
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,297
Hurry, go out

51
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:48,131
and please give them a special welcome.

52
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:50,797
Hurry, Mister.

53
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:51,997
Sorry, Miss.

54
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,631
Shh.

55
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,464
Is eavesdropping your hobby?

No, I was just leaving.

59
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:25,364
You're really meticulous.

60
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:29,697
Then, shall we finish the conversation
we were having earlier?

65
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:41,297
Good.

66
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:45,664
About the 300 million you promised earlier.

67
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:48,264
It should be manageable
for acquiring the kindergarten.

68
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,697
As you can see, it's rural here,
so prices aren't high.

69
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:52,997
300 million?

70
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,731
Yes.

71
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,764
I did mention three months.

72
00:03:57,764 --> 00:04:03,131
Oh dear, just my share was 300 million?

73
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,331
Don't worry.

74
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:07,764
I'll settle it as soon as this job is done.

75
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:10,497
Oh, you tease!

76
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,897
Oh, you're being mischievous.

77
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:22,197
A verbal contract is valid,
but for things like this,

78
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:26,597
it's always more proper
to have it in writing, right?

79
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:28,831
You really do seem like
Attorney Lee's older sister.

80
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,697
I'll let the attorney know.

81
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:33,497
Well, if it's about our money...

82
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:40,164
Even our Lord would forgive this kind of lie.

83
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:43,164

discovers I'm Kim Yeong Ran, not Bu Se Mi,

100
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:39,131
and learns my personal information,

101
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,764
it means you leaked it, Principal Lee Mi Seon.

You didn't actually graduate
from Iseon Women's University, did you?

No, I only finished high school.

107
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:08,531
I passed the GED for middle and high school.

110
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,131

You've had such misfortune.

113
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:28,264

114
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,664
They're fake.

I don't know who my father is.
I only have my mother.

116

118
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,764
So your mother has a record too.

119
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:52,097
It's probably easier to find what's true
than what's false, right?

120
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:54,464
At least my Class-1 driver's license is real.

121
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:57,931
Well, then this isn't completely fake, is it?

122

If you want to know more about me,

123
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:02,731
just search the news articles, plenty of them.

124
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:07,597

Stuff like calling you a 'gold digger',

126
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:12,231
that's not all true, right?

127
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,031
Everything except the 'gold digger' part
is basically true.

128
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:18,931
Oh, so most of it's true.

What? Huh?

140
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:06,564
Wait, that somehow feels insulting.

141

What are you doing?

146
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:42,631
Aren't kindergartens required to have CCTV?

147
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:44,597
Huh?

148
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,431
Daycares are required to have it,

149
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:49,731
but kindergartens aren't.

00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,131
You didn't know?

- Mi Seon.
- Huh?

160
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,231
Is Ms. Bu Se Mi...

161
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:35,564
She's pretty, right?
You can't take your eyes off her.

162
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:37,131
Not that much.

163
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:38,964
I get it, Dong Min.

164
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:43,697
But don't you dare make a move. Ever.

165
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:46,964
With her credentials and looks,
you think she's single?

166
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:50,731
Bet her boyfriend's loaded too.

167
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:52,664
How'd you know that?

168
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,031
Of course. I know that.

169
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,364
I can tell at a glance.

170
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:59,464
Birds of a feather, you know?

171
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,697
Mi Seon, about Ms. Bu Se Mi,

172
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,397
you did properly verify her education
and background, right?

173
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,864
I personally called Iseon Kindergarten
to confirm everything.

174
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,364
Resumes don't show character
or compatibility, right?

175
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,664
What, you live in deception?

176
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:13,231
I just don't want the kids hurt.

177
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,964
You should care more about this as principal.

178
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:17,797
Then, this time, I'll pay extra attention.

179
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:22,564
So stop suspecting everything, okay? Please?

180
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:26,764

00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,631
Good.

185
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:40,664
- Hello.
- You're here.

186
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:52,097
What brings you here?

187
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,131
To file a missing person report.

188
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,131
How old is the person?

189
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:01,031
Any dementia or chronic illness?

190
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:03,797
Twenty-nine this year?

191
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,497
Twenty-nine...

192
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,264
What? Are you joking?

193
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:11,797
My father remarried.

194
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:15,764
Even if you report an adult missing,

195
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:18,531
we can't search without proof of endangerment.

196
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:19,797
And even if we find her,

197
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:23,631
we can't disclose contact info if she refuses.

198
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:27,631
So, I might never find my mother?

199
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:33,831
Even when an adult is missing,
their personal decision is important.

200
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:36,764
Isn't your mother more likely hiding

201
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,164
than missing?

202
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,031
Detective, you're really not understanding me.

203
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,697
Pardon?

204
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,297
Yes, this is Sergeant Kim Hak Su.

205
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:47,664
Yes, Team Leader.

206
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,764
Yes, yes.

207
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:52,397
What? The chief called you?

208
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:55,331
Ah, yes, understood.

209
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:02,297
Though she's an adult,
there's sufficient reason to believe you.

210
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:03,964
We'll file a missing person report.

211
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:08,097
We'll conduct a nationwide search
and investigate the disappearance.

212
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,497
Finally, you understand.

213
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:24,164
You're new here.

214
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:26,031
Who introduced you?

215
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:27,731
Someone named Kim So Yeong.

216
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,564
Kim So Yeong?

217
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:31,931
That's a common name.

218
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,431
I know at least three Kim So Yeongs myself.

219
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,697
Short So Yeong, Tall So Yeong, Chubby So Yeong.

220
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:41,864
But

221
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:46,197
the Kim So Yeong you did time with
for pyramid schemes, that one's not common, huh?

222
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,797
You know foot baths are great, right?

223
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:57,597
Raise your body temperature just one degree
and it prevents cancer and such.

224
00:12:57,597 --> 00:13:00,564
Add this enzyme to a foot bath

225
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:04,297
and your skin becomes smooth and silky.

226
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,131
My mother suffered from diabetes for years.

227
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:12,731
No hospital in Korea could cure it,

228
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,231
but enzyme cured her.

229
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,331
Then please enjoy a foot bath before you leave.

230
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,031
How much is that?

231
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:23,664
Oh, sir! You've got a good eye.

232
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,231
I'm not the boss yet.

233
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:29,731
With that shiny forehead and prominent nose,

234
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:31,864
you're born to be a CEO.

235
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:34,797
This bottle costs 180,000 won.

236
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:37,531
Original production cost was over 300,000 won,

237
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:40,064
but we deal directly with Cambodian factories,

238
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:41,997
so we offer half price.

239
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:43,864
We're selling at barely 30,000 won profit,

240
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,997
practically giving it away.

241
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,764
Should we buy a hundred bottles?

242
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,431
A hundred?

243
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,131
That many?

244
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:58,197
How many installments would you like?

245
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:03,831
Forget installments.

246
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:06,431
I'll buy 100 bottles

247
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:11,431
if you tell me where Kim So Yeong is.

248
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,239
[18 million won]

249
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:31,245
[Kim So Yeong]

250
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,397
You called earlier?

251
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:54,031
Me? Just working like a dog, as usual.

252
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:57,064
Why? What's up?

253
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,764
A clean-cut guy's looking for me?

254
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,731
I've never even dated a 'clean-cut' man.

255
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:07,897
Hyeon Ok.

256
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,864
Did you tell them where I am?

257
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,131
Hey.

258
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:13,131
Don't you trust me?

259
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:17,564
Just warning you to be careful.

260
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:19,397
Got it.

261
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:21,997
What, what, what?

262
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,564
Why don't you follow me to the toilet
while you're at it?

263
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,731
Oh, jeez, this.

264
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,497
I saved yours but you disappeared.

265
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:29,931
Ah, hot.

266
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:32,297
Once it cools it's not as good.

267
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:37,197
Anyway, if someone looks for me,
pretend you don't know me.

268
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:40,531
Ugh, this place is just like jail.

269
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:43,931
A mutt's on my tail,
even following me to the bathroom.

270
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,397
I don't follow you when you poop, it smells.

271
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,464
Whoa, jeez...

272
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,097
Not talking about you.

273
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,997
Okay, talk again later.

274
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,164
People who say 'don't you trust me'
are never trustworthy.

275
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,297
Tasty.

276
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:08,664
Nice touch.

277
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,631
[Gaseong]

278
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:14,664
I'll handle your coffee from now on.

279
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:16,364
Suit yourself.

280
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:25,064
<i>Attorney, it's Byeol Nae.</i>

281
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,131
<i>Someone's looking for Kim So Yeong.</i>

282
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,397
<i>The caller is named Hyeon Ok.</i>

283
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:32,697
<i>Kim So Yeong says she can't be trusted.</i>

284
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:35,131
<i>They were prison mates,</i>

285
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,531
<i>but they only have each other.</i>

286
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,397
<i>Oh, Attorney,</i>

287
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:41,697
<i>and she called me a 'mutt'.</i>

288
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:43,697
<i>It seems Kim So Yeong</i>

289
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:47,464
<i>doesn't realize how smart mutts are.</i>

290
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:52,531
Facts, opinions, and plot twists all in one.

291
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:55,464
Her texts have hidden charm.

292
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:57,931
Oh! You scared me.

293
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,797
Sorry, did I startle you?

294
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:03,697
I did ballet as a child,

295
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:07,397
so I'm good at silent walking.

296
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:13,997
This vacuum is really quiet too, isn't it?

297
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:19,631
Of course, it's turned off.

298
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,731
Is anyone here normal?

299
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:22,897
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

300
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:23,931
Yes?

301
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:27,331
If you're done cleaning, get back to the annex.

302
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,797
Attorney Lee, did you make my toast too?

303
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,997
That's so touching.

304
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:38,397
Shall we eat together now?

305
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,497
I'm starving right now.

306
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,864
I'll eat all of this myself.

307
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,097
Oh, and,

308
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,584
I'm going out this afternoon,

309
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:49,164
so clean every corner before then.

310
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,431
There's too much dust in the corners.

311
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:26,664
Why is it so quiet?

312
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,664
Attorney Lee.

313
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:36,931
Attorney Lee.

314
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,197
Attorney Lee.

315
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,612
Strawberry Class!

316
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:36,412
- Yes!
- Oh.

317
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:38,045
Aren't they adorable?

318
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,479
The kids have so much energy,

319
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:43,445
so it takes time for them to calm down.

320
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:45,445
Principal!

321
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,145
Principal!

322
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:52,812
Oh, please come in.
I've been waiting, just a moment.

323
00:19:56,345 --> 00:20:00,145
Actually, we had a meeting scheduled today
with the kindergarten supplies coordinator...

324
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,312
Miss!

325
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:06,579
Can you watch the kids for a bit? Just briefly!

326
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,012
Are you asking me to teach them?

327
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:09,579
It'll just be a short while, really quick!

328
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:12,279
You can read them a book or teach them a song,

329
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,612
do anything you want, anything.

330
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,379
- Wait here.
- Principal.

331
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,812
Hello, children.

332
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,012
- Hello.
- Hello.

333
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:35,012
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi, starting today

334
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,512
with the Strawberry Class.

335
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,779
Well, today's lesson will be...

336
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,445
- Miss!
- Yeah?

337
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,845
How long will you be staying here?

338
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,379
You'll stay until Christmas, right?

339
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,545
We'll make a Christmas tree, right?

340
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,979
Well...

341
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,479
That's...

342
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,112
Ju Won, what's that?

343
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:00,145
I've never seen that before.

344
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:02,545
Oh, Uncle Tae Min bought it for me.

345
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:05,445
Really? Let me play with it a bit.

346
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:07,745
Play with your own toy.

347
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,645
Just let me play with it.

348
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,912
No, play with your own.

349
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,745
- Ah!
- Hey, that's mine.

350
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:14,945
Give it back!

351
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:17,079
- Kids, stop fighting.
- Fight.

352
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,579
- Children, no fighting.
- Fight.

353
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,212
Oh my goodness.

354
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:34,512
Kids! Quiet!

355
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:45,179
- Wow!
- Wow!

356
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,879
Kids,

357
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,512
focus!

358
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,245
Sit down.

359
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:05,145
Children, have you heard of self-defense?

360
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:11,879
By age seven, you should know
how to protect yourselves.

361
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,945
That's what I believe.

362
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:17,979
There are 30,000 child abuse cases annually,

363
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:21,945
with 38 children losing their lives.

364
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,579
Bad people

365

Dong Min, what are you doing there?

729
00:49:42,745 --> 00:49:46,545
Then, let's make befriending
Muchang residents part of the mission.

730
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:49,045
It seems Ga Seon Yeong filed
a missing person's report.

731
00:49:49,045 --> 00:49:51,279
To survive three months in Muchang safely,

732
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,012
that would be wiser.

733
00:49:53,012 --> 00:49:55,212
I'll call again later.

734
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:04,679
What are you two doing here?

735
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:07,245
Ah, these are strawberries I grew.

736
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:08,445
Try some.

737
00:50:08,445 --> 00:50:10,579
No, thanks. I don't like strawberries.

738
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:12,379
But you said you liked them earlier...

739
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,645
Ah, Miss.

740
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:18,379
I know it because...

741
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:19,412
No, thanks.

742
00:50:19,412 --> 00:50:21,879
Miss, want some makgeolli with these?

743
00:50:21,879 --> 00:50:24,379
Strawberries and makgeolli are a heavenly combo.

744
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:26,279
I can't handle alcohol well.

745
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,279
You two enjoy yourselves.

746
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:42,312
I won't get kicked out for three months.

747
00:50:54,879 --> 00:50:56,245
Dong Min.

748
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:59,545
I really admire women who take care of themselves.

749
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:03,345
Right.

750
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:05,712
Just meet any woman, please.

751
00:51:05,712 --> 00:51:07,445
But I don't...

752
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:14,112
- Dong Min.
- What?

753
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,679
Today your logic and your heart will collide.

754
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,379
Whatever happens, don't lose your head. Got it?

755
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,812
Skip the horoscope today.

756
00:51:23,812 --> 00:51:27,045
Pray for a strawberry harvest,
whether it's for the general or baby spirit.

757
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:30,145
Boss, does that count as a day's wage too?

758
00:51:30,145 --> 00:51:32,379
What's wrong with you?

759
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:34,579
<i>Apply it on your eyelids like this.</i>

760
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:37,679
<i>Dab the center of your ears too.</i>

761
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:39,412
<i>What next?</i>

762
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:41,212
<i>Make sure to apply it evenly.</i>

763
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:43,012
<i>Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.</i>

764
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:48,445
<i>When blending, lower your middle finger
slightly to reduce the area...</i>

765
00:51:57,279 --> 00:51:58,512
Miss.

766
00:51:58,512 --> 00:52:00,545
Jun's mom, mind giving me a ride?

767
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:01,845
Oh! Of course not.

768
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:03,479
Get in, get in.

769
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:08,779
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

770
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:18,645
Miss.

771
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:22,579
About the other day...
We were just trying to be hospitable.

772
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:26,512
Accepting meals from parents
violates the Kim Yeong Ran Act,

773
00:52:26,512 --> 00:52:29,012
but me treating you is fine, right?

774
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,245
What do you mean?

775
00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:34,012
I was thinking of holding
a welcome party in our yard today.

776
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:35,812
Whose welcome party?

777
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:37,479
Mine.

778
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,379
We'd love that.

779
00:52:40,379 --> 00:52:42,879
This isn't just your welcome party,

780
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,679
but it's more like neighbors
getting together for a meal.

781
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,645
That's small-town hospitality, you know.

782
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:49,145
Lovely.

783
00:52:49,145 --> 00:52:50,512
Where are you going, Miss?

784
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:51,545
To the kindergarten.

785
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:52,712
But it's Saturday.

786
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,345
Huh?

787
00:52:57,145 --> 00:52:58,579
<i>This is the Women's Association President.</i>

788
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:02,279
<i>Today at 5 PM at Mr. Jeon Dong Min's house,</i>

789
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,845
<i>we're hosting a welcome party
for our new neighbor, Ms. Bu Se Mi.</i>

790
00:53:05,845 --> 00:53:08,179
<i>All residents should pause their work</i>

791
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:10,679
<i>- and attend.</i>
- Are we really holding the welcome dinner today?

792
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:16,345
Yeah, Dong Min, we decided to hold it.

793
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:18,245
Oh, my.

794
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:21,045
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

795
00:53:21,045 --> 00:53:22,545
Madam... No, no.

796
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:24,679
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

797
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,812
A welcome party? Seriously?

798
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:29,245
Don't you know this breaks the Kim Yeong Ran Act?

799
00:53:29,245 --> 00:53:31,912
This is a huge problem.

800
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:38,112
Yes, that's why
I decided to host the dinner myself.

801
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:41,545
To get to know the neighbors
and build relationships.

802
00:53:41,545 --> 00:53:44,145
I've heard Dongwaru's food is great.

803
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:52,079
- Here.
- Miss, why are you like this?

804
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,012
Normally, as the principal,
I would handle all this...

805
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:57,112
- Understood.
- No.

806
00:53:57,112 --> 00:54:00,579
I'm good at things like this.

807
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:02,712
I'll prepare everything perfectly.

808
00:54:02,712 --> 00:54:05,645
Don't worry, let go of this and answer the phone.

809
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,979
I receive your sincerity.

810
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,379
Alright, then.

811
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:26,865
[Muchang Mart]

812
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,445
Huh?

813
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:46,879
Oh, my. He's...

814
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:48,679
Hey, Jeon Dong Min! What are you doing there?

815
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,945
Grab a shopping cart and get in here fast.

816
00:54:50,945 --> 00:54:53,912
Hurry up, we don't have time.
Come on, Dong Min. Ugh, seriously.

817
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:55,545
Okay.

818
00:54:57,445 --> 00:54:59,079
Jeez.

819
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:06,712
Dong Min, put the snacks and dried side dishes

820
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:09,245
in there with some love.

821
00:55:09,245 --> 00:55:12,145
But Ms. Bu's hosting the welcome party.
Why are we doing this?

822
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:13,945
Because Ms. Bu has other matters to handle.

823
00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:15,779
This is how we help each other in life.

824
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:19,545
Why are you always so grumpy with her?

825
00:55:20,512 --> 00:55:23,245
Did you also get bribed by her money?

826
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:24,712
To make you take her side?

827
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:27,245
No, nothing like that!

828
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,512
This is really weird.

829
00:55:30,512 --> 00:55:32,779
But, why does Ms. Bu Se Mi

830
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:36,112
even need to be in Muchang,
spending money to bribe people?

831
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,245
Why did Don recommend her anyway?

832
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:40,412
You're too suspicious.

833
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:42,679
She just likes the countryside,

834
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,712
wants to make friends,

835
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:46,912
and has money to spend.

836
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:48,412
You wouldn't understand because you don't have it.

837
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:51,445
Dong Min, if you won't help me,
go stand over there.

838
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:54,745
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

839
00:55:54,745 --> 00:55:57,412
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

840
00:55:57,412 --> 00:55:58,545
I'll bring the dried side dishes.

841
00:55:58,545 --> 00:56:03,679
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

842
00:56:04,412 --> 00:56:06,379
Hallelujah.

843
00:56:11,312 --> 00:56:13,312
Why's it so quiet here?

844
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:17,412
Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

845
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,412
Ms. Baek Hye...

846
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:35,912
Baek Hye Ji!

847
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,033
[Baek Hye Ji]

848
00:56:44,712 --> 00:56:48,612
<i>The subscriber you dialed
is not available. Please leave a message...</i>

849
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:52,412
What?

850
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,312
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

851
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,179
What?

852
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:07,012
Where did she disappear to?

853
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,985
Oh, no, what do I do?

854
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:20,009
Hello, everyone.

855
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,473
Thank you for your hard work.

856
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:25,064
Please take care of this.

857
00:57:25,064 --> 00:57:27,221
- Wow, this is amazing.
- What's all this?

858
00:57:27,245 --> 00:57:29,978
Ms. Bu Se Mi prepared everything.

859
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:32,670
She's someone who truly loves the children.

860
00:57:32,694 --> 00:57:35,594
We don't even have a play café here, you know.

861
00:57:35,594 --> 00:57:37,794
Ah, I'm honestly envious.

862
00:57:37,794 --> 00:57:40,894
How rich does she have to be
for a kindergarten teacher to go this far?

863
00:57:40,894 --> 00:57:43,094
- Unbelievable.
- Hey.

864
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:47,094
Dong Min, put the makgeolli
in the farmhouse fridge.

865
00:57:47,094 --> 00:57:48,494
There's no space here.

866
00:57:48,494 --> 00:57:51,061
- Okay.
- Oh, Ju Won will love this!

867
00:57:51,061 --> 00:57:52,594
Ah, he's going to love this.

868
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,261
Please handle this well.

869
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:56,428
This is wonderful.

870
00:58:12,628 --> 00:58:14,928
Miss, I'll just leave the makgeolli here and go.

871
00:58:22,928 --> 00:58:24,594
CCTV.

872
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:26,294
Dong Min.

873
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,928
Yes?

874
00:58:33,128 --> 00:58:34,994
What's that?

875
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:36,194
Oh, this?

876
00:58:36,194 --> 00:58:37,961
Makgeolli. For the welcome party later.

877
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:39,928
Wait a second.

878
00:58:42,594 --> 00:58:46,661
Can we talk privately?

879
00:58:48,728 --> 00:58:50,494
Let me put that down first. Just a moment.

880
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:10,061
Miss, why are you so close to me?

881
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:12,528
Oh.

882
00:59:13,861 --> 00:59:16,061
When did I do that?

883
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:17,861
Right now.

884
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:22,028
I'll just put this here.

885
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:24,294
I said stay still.

886
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:30,428
Everything arrived at once.

887
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:33,061
This needs to chill in the cooler.

888
00:59:33,061 --> 00:59:34,528
- Cooler?
- Makgeolli should be served cold.

889
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:36,233
The cooler.

890
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:39,031
- Let me put this here.
- Good work.

891
00:59:39,031 --> 00:59:41,894
- Is here okay?
- It's fine.

892
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:45,961
Shouldn't we mix the food varieties?

893
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:48,761
Pair them with tasty sides.

894
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:52,228
All the fried rice is here.

895
00:59:55,694 --> 00:59:57,461
Hey, Tae Min, this is...

896
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:07,594
You seem like a new face...

897
01:00:08,328 --> 01:00:10,661
Who are you looking for?

898
01:00:10,661 --> 01:00:13,561
Is Teacher Bu Se Mi here?

899
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:18,028
Huh? Who?

900
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:19,761
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

901
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:23,694
Yes, she's here. And you are?

902
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:25,561
Oh.

903
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:27,194
I'm...

904
01:00:30,528 --> 01:00:32,394
Se Mi's friend.

905
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,161
Oh, what are you doing?

906
01:00:51,794 --> 01:00:54,561
I might not seem like it,
but I'm very traditional.

907
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:56,961
- I'll put this down quickly.
- Dong Min!

908
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:15,494
It's been a while.

909
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:17,294
My friend.

910
01:02:33,722 --> 01:02:36,657
[Miss Incognito]

911
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,248
Thank you for welcoming me.

912
01:03:15,248 --> 01:03:17,781
How on earth did Ms. Baek Hye Ji
find out I'm here?

913
01:03:17,781 --> 01:03:20,581
Oh, no. Baek Hye Ji!

914
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:23,048
There are no secrets in this world, you know.

915
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:26,581
If you let dogs and pigs look down on you,
you become the dog and pig. Understand?

916
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:29,748
I might be able to find out
where our Yeong Ran is.

917
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:32,015
Attorney Lee, where did you hide Kim Yeong Ran?

918
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:34,781
If you're in Muchang,
you have to follow Muchang's rules.

919
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:36,181
- Stop it.
- Ms. Se Mi.

920
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:39,981
You may have a sharp tongue,
but I think you're actually a kind person.
