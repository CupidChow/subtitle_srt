1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,960

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,620

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,350

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,830
 Lee Ma Ha!

5
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,740
Kwon Ryeok.

6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,260
I'm busy.

7
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,040
I can't. I have a meeting.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,350
I forgot my pouch.

9
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,080
What's this?

10
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,810
Who left the car after parking like this?

11
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,530
Let's go.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,490
Why are you here?

13
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,810
The tribute pack. To give you the tribute pack.

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,390
It's Ma Ha, but who's the person next to her?

15
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,250
Is it Yoo Jin?

16
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,210
It's not him.

17
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,150
 Lee Ma Ha!

18
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,890
Lee Ma Ha!

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,390
Wait up!

20
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,860
Lee Ma Ha!

21
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,780
Lee Ma Ha!

22
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm quite sure she came this way.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,070
Did she go that way?

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,360
Wait for me!

25
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,500
Why did you come unannounced and embarrass me? How did you even find my address?

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,100
I told you just now. I came to give you the tribute pack.

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,410
You gave me your address.

28
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,570
That... You could send it through a carrier.

29
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,380
- I personally did it. 
 - It wouldn't have taken long to deliver even if you sent it through a carrier.

30
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,250
I wanted to give it to you myself.

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,300
But... why?

32
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,280
That's because...

33
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,910
You also personally gave it to me.

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,490
I wanted to do the same.

35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,310
Then give it to me quickly and go.

36
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,370
I came in a hurry, so I left it in the car.

37
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,640
What?

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,960
Wait here. I'll be right back.

39
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,660
Okay?

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,430
Ma Ha.

41
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,120
Even if you cover yourself, that doesn't cover your identity.

42
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,500
Kwon Ryeok of SHAX.

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,400
Kwon Ryeok?

44
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,480
What are you doing?

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,400
Why do you want to see Ma Ha?

46
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,390
I... I came here because...

47
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,230
I'll explain.

48
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,050
My tribute pack was switched with his because of my mistake.

49
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,100
So I went to his hotel room.

50
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,450
Hotel?

51
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,030
Room?

52
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,050
You went there and then what?

53
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,210
If you finished your task, please leave.

54
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,980
We need to talk to Ma Ha about something.

55
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,310
I'm sorry, but I was first.

56
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,560
She must be okay, right?

57
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,190
Oh, no.

58
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,480
Why is the car not here?

59
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,350
It should be.

60
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,480

11MO5633

61
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,150
That's our car.

62
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,310
I'm sorry, Dae Kwon.

63
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,890

64
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,660
I got a lot from the explanation. I heard enough and I understand it.

65
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,550
- Lee Ma Ha. 
 - Don't misunderstand.

66
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,800
So... what are you going to do?

67
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
She says it's a misunderstanding.

68
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,520
You also know that this is not something we can just overlook.

69
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,210
Did you go through all that trouble from the Fins for a fan-made padded jacket but a hotel room?

70
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,340
Whatever the reason may be, do you think they'll listen?

71
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,250
 Never!

72
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,910
A replay kiss with Lee Ma Ha? If we can't prevent it, we Fins are going to blow things up.

73
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,020
Attack to death!

74
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,790
 To death!

75
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,800

76
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,590

77
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,010

78
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,660

79
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,050

80
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,820

81
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,190

82
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,010

83
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,660

84
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,390
Right? I'm also afraid of Fins.

85
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,460
Ma Ha, why don't you delete and block Kwon Ryeok's number?

86
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,420
What?

87
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,400
  Are you okay?

88
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,250
What's the use of having Ma Ha delete it? Kwon Ryeok still has her number.

89
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,950
Right.

90
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,480
Change your number.

91
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,820
Why do we need to go that far?

92
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,960
That's right, Lia. Once she blocks him, she won't receive anything from him.

93
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,160
This is your problem, Hyun Ji.

94
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,830
You can't say things other people will not like. Do you think this is only Ma Ha's problem?

95
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,600
Did you forget what we went through to get here?

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,410
No.

97
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,510
It's still fresh in my mind.

98
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,230
The first day Ma Ha came, we were rested assured.

99
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:22,380
It didn't matter if it was Annie or Ma Ha. We were that desperate to debut.

100
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,260
But now, we need Ma Ha.

101
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,770
If Ma Ha disappears as Annie did,

102
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,450
Then I won't be able to stand on the stage ever again.

103
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,670
I'm sure Ma Ha feels the same way.

104
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:43,420
That's why even if you don't go out of your way, Ma Ha will take care of it.

105
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't fight because of me.

106
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,400
I'll make sure there is nothing for you to worry about.

107
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,630
I promise.

108
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,760
Where is it?

109
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,720
You'll never find what you're looking for.

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,390
What?

111
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,850
Dae Kwon!

112
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,210
We're going the opposite way.

113
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,040
Here.

114
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,750
What's wrong with you? Say it with words. This is not like you.

115
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,580
Ryeok.

116
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,340
I guess my advice didn't work for you.

117
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,730
- Hyung. 
 - Punch me and go.

118
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,200
What's wrong?

119
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,890
Hit me.

120
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,350
What's my job description?

121
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,020
What am I doing right now?

122
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,340
If it weren't for you, why would I, the team leader, be on the road?

123
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,950
You said you wanted to work with me. You said it must be me.

124
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,750
- I'm sorry. 
 - I told you not to.

125
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,720
It's for you!

126
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,830
Don't you know it'll become a problem if you're with her?

127
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,570
If you're going to be like this, don't work with me.

128
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,390
You choose.

129
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,610
Answer me!

130
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,200
Answer me.

131
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,750
 Answer me, Kwon Ryeok!

132
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,160
Ryeok, you...

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,830

135
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,180

136
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,790

137
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,410

138
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,750
Tea Party doesn't feel like Tea Party.

139
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,760
The problem is that you guys are too close.

140
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,540
Even if you're close, like family,

141
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,650
if you keep interfering in this and that, there will definitely be trouble.

142
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,500
You guys are technically in a symbiotic relationship with each other.

143
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,650
A team which only works when all of us work well together.

144
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,190
It's because we are a team. We want it to work well.

145
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,540
You don't need to know and understand 100% about each other.

146
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,430
Just 90%.

147
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,610
For the rest of the 10%, you just have to encourage and trust each other, believing that the other will do well.

148
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,650
Let's just touch it, but not cross the line beyond that.

149
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,180
That's how you will be able to last.

150
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,550
It will become interference and nagging once we cross that line.

151
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,320
- Yes. 
 - Yes, sir.

152
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,560
Looking at your expression tells me you guys are out of the woods.

153
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,400
To commemorate this, there's a sitcom audition that's come in...

154
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,990
What do you guys think about it?

155
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,830
I'll pass.

156
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,680
It's is too cringey for me.

157
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,100
There's something I want to do more than acting.

158
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,680
Okay, Lia passes.

159
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,220
Hyun Ji?

160
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,790
I am also not comfortable with acting yet.

161
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,600
Actually, even for the magazine shoot last time, I froze.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,390
I want to do it, but I'll think about it next time.

163
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,680
Okay, Hyun Ji's going to work on her confidence.

164
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,260
What about you, Ma Ha?

165
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,500
Me?

166
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,960
How's Ryeok these days?

167
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,230
We have got a meeting for the movie whose casting was finalized last week.

168
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,110
This week, we are set for a variety show...

169
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,430
It's overlapping with the live radio show. How did this happen?

170
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,850
If I change the dates this way...

171
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,300
The radio broadcast will also work, CEO.

172
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,980
Isn't the schedule too tight?

173
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,450
We should push Ryeok further when all this momentum is there, right?

174
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,040
I need to check the schedule, so I'll be going.

175
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,660
I mean...

176
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,370
Hey, is something wrong with Dae Kwon?

177
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,450
She's not replying.

178
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,540
Dae Kwon, why is there a camera?

179
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,510
Are you shooting something?

180
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,120
Nothing.

181
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,020
Recline the chair and sleep comfortably. We have a long way.

182
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,950
Ryeok, we're here.

183
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,410
We've reached.

184
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,300
Where are you going?

185
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,480
We have to film here quickly.

186
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,850
I am telling you we are here.

187
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,550
You have to work.

188
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,140
What is this?

189
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,490
What is all this nature in front of me?

190
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,870
What you see is right.

191
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,450
 Kwon Ryeok!  Congratulations on starting the filming of 'Nature Exploration Life' which broadcast starting next week.

192
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,790
We will take away everything that you have brought with you starting now.

193
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,050
Here's your phone.

194
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,130
Yes, your phone too.

195
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,790
Let's go.

196
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,630
Ryeok.

197
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,200
This is it for me.

198
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,510
If you have some extra time, do some of the script reading ahead of time.

199
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,620
Come on quick!

200
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,950
Something... got stuck... on the bag.

201
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,690
Alright. If the setting is complete, let's retreat.

202
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,930
Hurry and retreat!

203
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,010
Gu Dae Kwon!

204
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,130
 We have opened it right now. You can use it right away.

205
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,930
Thank you.

206
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,820
Excuse me.

207
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,650
I'm a fan. Could I have your autograph?

208
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,740
Sure.

209
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,700

210
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,820
Thank you.

211
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,140
Thank you.

212
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,250
Goodbye.

213
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,590
 Thank you.

214
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,340
Ta da!

215
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,950
♫  I really like this, I can't faint  ♫

216
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,190
♫  This is a mysterious adventure.   ♫

217
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,370
♫  We gotta go  ♫

218
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,610
CEO, this is my new number.

219
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,970
♫  Now I want to go up to the sky  ♫

220
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,620
You got a new phone.

221
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,410
I can't breathe.

222
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,490
That's right. I should always be cautious.

223
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,760
You did well.

224
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,890

225
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,560
I guess you cannot ignore someone who gets awards.

226
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,470
He's first in line for Chungmuru casting. He even got the big screen. 
  (T/N: Chungmuru is like Korea's Hollywood)

227
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,700
Is it Kwon Ryeok? 
 (T/N: Word play. Kwon Ryeok means power too.)

228
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,430
Yes.

229
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,470
Kwon Ryeok plays the main role, so NOG will promote it well.

230
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,630
It will get a good amount of attention.

231
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,950
Still, the part is too small, isn't it?

232
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,020
What do you want to do? Should I look for something else?

233
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,850
It's not as if he has already got it. He still has to audition.

234
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,130
- Give it back. 
 - Give it to me if you don't want to do it.

235
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,890
Hyung. Did you forget about the head-to-head fight he had in the waiting room with Kwon Ryeok?

236
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,430
You should just avoid him.

237
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,920
Why should I?

238
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,180
I should be grateful since it's my first time.

239
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,320
I know it's not many scenes, but I will focus and try my best.

240
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,520
I'll make my presence stand out more than the main character.

241
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,550
I'll audition.

242
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,460
Okay, then Yoo Jin, get ready.

243
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,650
Min Soo, bring it out.

244
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,130
57.1?

245
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,630
Min Soo, 1.5 and Se Young, 2 kg?

246
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,720
Hyun Oh, 2.1 kg?

247
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,690
Let's just have at least one person pass. I've been too lenient, right?

248
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,460
We'll lose the weight quickly, Hyung.

249
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,120
We'll start eating healthy again.

250
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,950
If you're going to do it again, why did you even gain it in the first place?

251
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,380
Do you call yourselves idols and maintain your weight like this?

252
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,910
Hyun Oh, have you been drinking these days?

253
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,630
Look at your weight!

254
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,670
I'm going to give you two hours. Go back to your normal weights.

255
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,470
- Hyung! 
 - Hyung!

256
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,440
Hyun Oh, you heard me, right? Back to normal.

257
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,860
Yes!

258
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,610
Koo Dae Kwon.

259
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,630
Ah, this is going somewhere I dislike.

260
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,820
This is hard.

261
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,170
Tea Time!

262
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,360
Hot!

263
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,820
 Wow!

264
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,430
Daebak.

265
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,280
You can't eat all of it?

266
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,030
We're a girl group.

267
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,960
It's okay. You can lose weight again.

268
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,930
You need to eat well.

269
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,490
So annoying.

270
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,990
All for this?

271
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,190
So pretty.

272
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,350
I'll do this the best I can for you.

273
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,100
Sure, thank you.

274
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,840
- But only– 
 - But only?

275
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,600
You must be thinking of a condition. What is it?

276
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,910
Can you teach me to the best of your ability too?

277
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,070
I want to learn music properly.

278
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,010
Is that your condition?

279
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,180
Come on this day.

280
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,410
I get a pass, just like that?

281
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,280
It's not just like that.

282
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,350
I have intuition.

283
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,780
- Did you leave something behind? 
 - Hi.

284
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,050
You didn't even contact me.

285
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,120
Why is it so quiet?

286
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,090
You're one second too late.

287
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,930

288
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,690
Tonight's dinner is ramyeon.

289
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,430
You worked hard.

290
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,690
Of course, I had a really hard time.

291
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,160
That's right. I went all over looking for mushrooms and roots!

292
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,310
What?

293
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,660
Never mind. I have nothing to say to you.

294
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,410
Forget it! Just give me my phone.

295
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,420
Taking full advantage.

296
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,230
 We couldn't even talk that day. Shouldn't we meet?

297
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,770
 What's your schedule like today?

298
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,840
 Why aren't you responding?

299
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,820
 Are you reading these messages?

300
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,520
There's going to be traffic on the way to your next schedule, so it's going to take a while. You should take a nap.

301
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,000
What next schedule?

302
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,530

303
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,220

304
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,320
 I can probably see her when we're number 1.

305
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,200
 I have a good feeling.

306
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,410

307
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,080
You told me to sleep.

308
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,900
Sorry.

309
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,330

310
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,360
You look like you have a lot on your mind.

311
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,970
No.

312
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,790
You don't have to pretend you're okay. We can adjust your schedule.

313
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,690
Let's go.

314
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,710
Hello, Sunbaenim.

315
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,400
Sunbaenim, what are you doing here?

316
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm La Ri Ma. Of course, I'm here.

317
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,190
But what are you, Lee Ma Ha, doing here?

318
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,350
That's right.

319
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,480
Is it okay if we have a moment?

320
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,960
We're on our way to a schedule.

321
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
Okay, I got it.

322
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,350
Don't be scared! I saw your performance. You look like you have some guts.

323
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,610
Am I scary?

324
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,030
Do I look scary?

325
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,910
No.

326
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,610
You stole and used my concepts as much as you could.

327
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,600
Are you being nervous now?

328
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,590
Sorry, Sunbaenim.

329
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,800
I did not call you to nitpick.

330
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,650
Sit down.

331
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,650
You are so cool

332
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,150
that I kept watching your videos and ended up learning your performances,

333
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,720
and since everyone said we look similar,

334
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,820
without realizing it, I started to copy you.

335
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,890
It must have been offensive,

336
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,990
I apologize.

337
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,560
You are my role model.

338
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,580
I want to become like you.

339
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,980
Role model? Me?

340
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,980
Well, I don't hate the sound of that.

341
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,660
But I can't let you have Kwon Ryeok.

342
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,000
What?

343
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,920
I... like Kwon Ryeok.

344
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,860
I like Kwon Ryeok,

345
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,770
so

346
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,250
even though you say I'm your role model, and you're a cute Hoobae to me,

347
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,480
Kwon Ryeok is off limits.

348
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,030
Okay?

349
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,460
La Ri Ma and Lee Ma Ha are different.

350
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,840
Next time, let's have a more casual conversation.

351
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,600
But that...

352
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,050
Okay?

353
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,350
I guess we'll have to see each other again, right?

354
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,910
- Hello, I'm Tea Party's Lee Ma... 
 - I'm SHAX's Do Jin...

355
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,900
Oh, it's Ma Ha.

356
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,430
Are you guys also auditioning for the sitcom?

357
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,410
Ah, no audition for SHAX.

358
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,440
We are here for a director's meeting. Are you auditioning?

359
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,810
Yes.

360
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,760
But

361
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,470
what about your other members?

362
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,660
It's just us two. Kwon Ryeok has no interest in a sitcom, and our schedule has been pretty free lately,

363
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,050
same for the other members.

364
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,040
You should move your arm..

365
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,600
I don't want to, though.

366
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,100
Please sit.

367
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,580
Hurry.

368
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,540
Are you going to use me like this?

369
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,560
- Looks like we might be late. 
 - Radios, meetings–

370
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,150
I haven't been able to sleep at all.

371
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,550
- Is it enough for me to just change clothes? 
 - We don't have much time until the meeting with the director.

372
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,020
Hyung Ji Hak!

373
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,490
Yes.

374
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,940
 What are you here for?

375
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,860
 Audition?

376
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,170
 Love Virus?

377
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,460
 Did she pass?

378
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,450
 Not yet.

379
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,090
 Oh, yes.

380
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,310

381
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,500
 Everything is going according to plan.

382
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,390
We need to be careful when things are slowly starting to work out.

383
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,610
Don't let your guard down.

384
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,970
And watch the kids more closely.

385
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,210
Yes, I understand.

386
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,340
Lee Ma Ha is going to be cast in the sitcom that Hyuk and Do Jin are in.

387
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,520
Lee Ma Ha? The one that Ji Hak brought into Tea Party?

388
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,290
Yes.

389
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:05,300
Why does Ji Hak keep following me around like gum on my shoe?

390
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,550
I'm getting tired of it...

391
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,140
Where did he get that girl?

392
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,290
There are rumors that they are the Omega kids that CEO Kim had under them.

393
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,010
CEO Kim?

394
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,020
Yes.

395
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,100
After that incident happened with that one member, Lee Ma Ha was the replacement.

396
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,850
The remaining three girls made a new group called Tea Party.

397
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,760
It was CEO Kim's girls?

398
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,130
No! No, no, that's not how you do it!

399
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,410
The noodles!

400
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,840
It's like the noodles became too overcooked even before I eat them!

401
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,350
You should elegantly spit the notes out and bring them back.

402
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,320
You're just getting the notes from above your head.

403
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,530

404
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,920

405
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,190
Oh, hello! CEO Park!

406
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,420
How are you doing? What is the occasion?

407
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,480
Get in. Let's go, let's go.

408
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,400
Goodbye. We will call you again.

409
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,250
Thank you. Since you're our first cast member,

410
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,230
I think it'll be a huge hit!

411
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,810
I'm a little worried because there are a lot of action scenes.

412
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,590
I'll leave it to you, Director.

413
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,570
Let's film it without any accidents.

414
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,030
I'll see you on the set.

415
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,210
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes.

416
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,030
Hello!

417
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,330
Hello.

418
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,860
Okay, let's skip the parts that won't make money.

419
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,450
The background is good. Their faces have also come out well.

420
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,380
This is perfect.

421
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,620
Hey Byeon, no matter how you look at this, it's definitely Kim Ji Min, isn't it?

422
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,270
Make a lot of money.

423
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,320
I need to grab a few more shots for this to hit big.

424
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,010
- But what are you doing? 
 - Something that won't make money.

425
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,670

426
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,570
I thought you didn't like taking pictures.

427
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,680
I don't like staged pictures because that's not who I am.

428
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,650
I wanted to become a photographer.

429
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,390
A photographer who is able to capture a genuine moment.

430
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,950

431
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,210
Its paired all they from the end.

432
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,780
Does that even make sense?

433
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,480
How frustrating. It's like I ate 100 sweet potatoes.

434
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,510
Hyung, your dark circles!

435
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,100
Why is your schedule so packed these days?

436
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,840

437
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,980
- Sitcom? 
 - Guess who Do Ma Ha is.

438
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,780
- Do Ma Ha? 
 - My noona!

439
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,270
My girlfriend.

440
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,780
- What? 
 - We're filming a sitcom with Noona Ma Ha.

441
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,150
It's a sitcom, so we're using our own names and our characters are very similar.

442
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,540
Then what kind of role does Lee Ma Ha have?

443
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,120
Noona Ma Ha is a law student, and a dance YouTuber.

444
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,680
She has to make a lot of dance covers, so she went straight to practice.

445
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,490
She probably has a lot to practice.

446
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,920
I'm the vocal for a rock band. Doesn't it sound fun?

447
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,730
Yes, it sounds fun. You all must be happy. Fighting.

448
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,290
What's with that facial expression of loneliness?

449
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,860
You're right.

450
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,580
- Hyung! 
 - What?

451
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,020
Dark circles down to your jaw. Heavy shoulders.

452
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,820
- Sad eyes filled with tears. 
 - What are you saying?

453
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,490
Something must not be working out well. I wonder what that might be.

454
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,990
 It wasn't me.

455
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,090
Ha! Seriously!

456
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,400
Keep knocking! It'll open.

457
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,050
Be a man. Face it headlong.

458
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,710
Go! Even if you can't win!

459
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,550
Why are you referring to "Go Stop" right now?

460
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,850
But doesn't it mean the same? You have to turn around to win!

461
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,610
 They are different!

462
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,200
Go even if I can't win?

463
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,250
These brats have only learned bad stuff!

464
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,350
It's because you talked about "Go Stop"!

465
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,110
1 go, 2 go, 3 go. No?

466
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,490

(crow-tit = someone who tries hard)

467
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,160
Head on.

468
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,600
You're working so hard.

469
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,990
Should I act, too? I can do action.

470
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,830
Let's not presume things, and let's get going.

471
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,360
Practice. We're leaving.

472
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,930
Keep at it.

473
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,650

474
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,190
 Yoo Jin, what are you doing?

475
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,820
 I just finished with practice, so I'm going to leave.

476
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,820
 Ma Ha is at practice by herself.

477
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,600
 Lia and I are already done with our schedules, so we're already home.

478
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,870
 Can you come with her?

479
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,250

480
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,860
Hyun Ji! Aren't you going to the practice room?

481
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,350
Ma Ha is there by herself. Let's go pick her up!

482
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,710
- It's fine. 
 - But Ma Ha must be lonely practicing all by herself.

483
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,390
- If we go and be with her— 
 - Yoo Jin will go.

484
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,710
I asked him for a favor since Ma Ha is by herself.

485
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,470
Ma Ha is probably more comfortable with Yoo Jin than Kwon Ryeok with his bad personality.

486
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,040
Ryeok!

487
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,600
Ryeok, are you sleeping?

488
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,580
 Lee Ma Ha!

489
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,780
Lee Yoo Jin!

490
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,800
- What are you doing here? 
 - I passed for a movie audition.

491
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,360
Really? Lee Yoo Jin!

492
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,400
It's not that big a deal.

493
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,540
Congratulations!

494
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,070
 Thank you.

495
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,470
But were you always interested in movies?

496
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,170
I didn't know.

497
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,750
You have debuted in movies first. So Sunbaenim, teach me well.

498
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,090
That's true.

499
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,040
I shall deign to teach you.

500
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,710
Thank you. Then I will recompense you with tteokbokki right now.

501
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,150
Really?

502
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,390
Sunbaenim Kwon Ryeok?

503
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,260
What are you doing here?

504
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,180
Get in.

505
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,370
Hello. I keep running into you in the most unexpected places.

506
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,820
You're done, right? Let's go. I'll take you home.

507
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,450
No, it's okay.

508
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,190
I barely got out so that I could take you home. Get in.

509
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,900
You should head in quickly. If someone happens to see you,

510
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,760
it will be Ma Ha who will come under hot water.

511
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,190
What?

512
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,450
Even if it's you, I don't see a reason for you to act like this according to your will.

513
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,890
You always talk pretty whenever I see you.

514
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,430
Yoo Jin, it's not like that. It's okay.

515
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,270
Yoo Jin.

516
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,030
I'm sorry, but I'll see you next time.

517
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,330
I got it, so let's go quickly.

518
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,590
 Hyung Jae Woo is looking for you right now.

519
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,450
 We're in your bed pretending to be you.

520
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,530
 Hurry and come home before Hyung Jae Woo finds out.

521
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,890
Oh god!

522
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,660
You sided with me, right?

523
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,690
What side?

524
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,520
Earlier.

525
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,920
You agree, that you took my side?

526
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,390
Why did you come?

527
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,790
Because I missed you.

528
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,420
 Hyung! Please look at your messages.

529
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,770
 If you saw them, contact us!

530
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,700
 Hurry and come!

531
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,430
 Emergency! Emergency!

532
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,580
Why didn't you respond? I kept sending you messages.

533
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,560
You changed your number, didn't you?

534
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,470
Give me your number.

535
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,140
How did you know?

536
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,790
Give it to me.

537
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,720
Drop me off over there.

538
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,060
No, I don't want to. Give it to me.

539
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,660
I'm a member of Tea Party. You saw Hyun Ji and Lia, right?

540
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,590
Please drop me off over there.

541
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,000
No...

542
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,920
I'm not trying to do anything. I just want to send you messages.

543
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,080
 I hate all this crying and whining.

544
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,260
 Seriously!

545
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,600
I dated you for a few months because you were an NOG trainee.

546
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,050
If you call me once more, I won't say nice words.

547
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,740
So annoying.

548
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,490
What were you listening to?

549
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,860
You stand out a lot these days. Be careful.

550
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,500
Hyung, you should be the one to be careful.

551
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,870
That bastard.

552
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,300
Where did you take my car?

553
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,060
Ryeok. Did you forget that we wouldn't keep secrets from each other?

554
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,430
- It's nothing. 
 - Turning a blind eye...

555
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,100
I'm not going to do it anymore.

556
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,350
Explain the situation properly.

557
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,550
Answer me, Kwon Ryeok!

558
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,450
- Let go. 
 - Calm down.

559
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,980
Wow, wow.

560
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:19,410
Get lost. I'm not joking. I'm asking him as the leader of SHAX.

561
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,430
Jae Woo, talk later.

562
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,070
I'm sorry.

563
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,940
The only thing I can say right now is that I'm sorry.

564
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,510
I'm sorry.

565
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,080
- Hey! 
 - Hyung.

566
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,860
Don't forget that you're a part of SHAX!

567
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,680
Hyung!

568
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,750
 I like Kwon Ryeok.

569
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,360
 I can go by myself from here.

570
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,330
 Goodbye!

571
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,720
 Sunbaenim.

572
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,650
 Don't forget that you're a part of SHAX!

573
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,640
 Okay! We'll continue after a five-minute break.

574
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,170
You haven't even eaten properly.

575
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,960
Drink this.

576
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,790
It looks like you're overworking yourself.

577
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,450
You're the one who told me not to think of other things and focus on work.

578
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,820
That was...

579
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,600
It's fine. I'll end up having a hard time twice over whenever I have time anyways.

580
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,640
Since it keeps on coming to mind.

581
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,420
What!

582
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,360
 Hello!

583
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,910
What's this? Why are you here?

584
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,270
It's a small role, but I'll do my best!

585
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,940
Please take care of me.

586
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,650
Sure.

587
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,570
I'm sorry.

588
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:55,180
I'm sorry.

589
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,000
It's okay.

590
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,680
Let's go again.

591
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,180
Are you okay?

592
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,490
You must have been nervous. I'm sorry.

593
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,340
It's okay.

594
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,200
Hey!

595
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,960
Are you okay?

596
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,160
I'm okay.

597
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,600

598
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,070
How many dance covers are there?

599
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,760
Are you practicing all of them?

600
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,370
Yes.

601
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,390
It must be tiring.

602
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,970
Don't think about other things and just practice, or you'll get hurt.

603
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,680
You're right.

604
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,520
You have been blanking out often these days. It's obvious that your mind is cluttered.

605
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,290
I'm sorry for that day.

606
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,150
I was too ahead of myself.

607
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,580
I'm sorry I couldn't be encouraging.

608
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,690
No, I'm sorry.

609
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:41,500
I won't blank out anymore, and I'll get my act together. So don't worry too much.

610
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,790
I'm okay!

611
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,820
Let's go together!

612
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,550
Where?

613
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,920
 Let's go, let's go, let's go!

614
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,540
You stay and the rest, follow me.

615
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,020
Show more anxiety with your eyesight.

616
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,580
- Okay. 
 - I think that will do.

617
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,730
It was good, right?

618
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,230
Alright, let's prep for the drifting scene!

619
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,210
1, 2, 3!

620
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,790
Cue!

621
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,300
Alright. We'll do it this way!

622
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,680
Because you're doing it yourself, it looks really good.

623
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,640
 We'll go over the action moves and then go straight into shooting.

624
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,050
Let's go over them and then try to get it in one take if you're okay with it.

625
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,130
We'll try it in one take!

626
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,870
Yoo Jin, first! Straight!

627
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,230
Dodge. Throw a fist, and then kick.

628
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,330
Alright, grab him, overthrow him.

629
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,170
Kick from the back.

630
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,060
Grab, and kick.

631
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,580
Then, throw him over.

632
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,530
Yoo Jin goes in, left, right.

633
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,260
Alright, grab.

634
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,200
Switch places.

635
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,060
Push!

636
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,350
Then, kick!

637
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:38,930
Looks good.

638
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,820
We'll go with that.

639
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,550
Yes. Let's get going.

640
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,620
Yes.

641
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,150
Alright, now with your left hand.

642
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,050
Yes. Now hook.

643
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,420
Alright, one, two, three.

644
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,920
Great. We'll go like this.

645
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,450
Hey! Lee Yoo Jin!

646
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,630
Remove the kicking,

647
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,700
I'll just add some action here.

648
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,310
Yes. Let's go with that.

649
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,810
Yes. I got it.

650
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,220
We'll start shooting!

651
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,290
1, 2, 3... Fighting!

652
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:18,400
 We're ready.

653
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,220
 Okay, sure.

654
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,310
Wow.

655
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,850
Ma Ha! Are you here to watch?

656
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,040
Hello.

657
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,980
We're ready, right?

658
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,720
Alright. If you're ready, we'll get going!

659
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,460
 1, 2, 3!

660
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,360
 Cue!

661
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,450
 Ryeok!

662
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,950
 Ryeok!

663
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,890
 Ryeok!

664
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,510
 Ryeok!

665
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,740
 Ryeok, wake up!

666
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,000
 Ryeok!

667
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,870

668
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:51,070

669
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:54,760
There are no troubles amongst the members these days, right?

670
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,350
Don't be afraid and tell me.

671
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,130
You're the leader, Jae Woo.

672
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,890
It's all for the team, so just tell the truth.

673
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,780
It's just that...

674
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,960
I think Eun Jo has a girlfriend.

675
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,230
One that he's been dating for a while.

676
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,170
Is that so?

677
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:25,200
Tell me more.

678
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,780

679
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,430
 Come to your senses.

680
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,660
 Ryeok. Come to your senses.

681
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,690
 How much did he try to do?

682
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,800
  It's clear he did it on purpose.

683
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,520
 There's not much you can do here.

684
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,790
 But I still want to be here until he wakes up.

685
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,480
 You're probably not here to grab a coffee.

686
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,340
 Eun Jo is back in Korea, isn't he?

687
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,560
 Where is he right now?

688
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,150
 Have you thought about what I said last time?

689
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:55,000
 I think I told you I don't want to have anything to do with SHAX.

690
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,690
 Please get up quickly.

691
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,730
 I like you, Sunbaenim!
