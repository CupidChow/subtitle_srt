1
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,420

2
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,950

3
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,690

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,980
How much longer do we have to go?

5
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,120
We only have to walk up a little further, but...

6
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,590
how do you have so much energy?

7
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,960
For me, I hike every day.

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,660
Hike...

9
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,540
You can give this to me!

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,460
Hey! Hey!

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,960
You should think about me, too.

12
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,940
This is so tiring.

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,930
It's so bright.

14
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,270
This is nice.

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,500
 There are a lot of stars.

16
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,360
There were a lot of stars that night too.

17
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,790
Every night, it's a night view,

18
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,380
but today, it's different.

19
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,140
That's because you're with me.

20
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,850
A little.

21
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,110
Okay, nice!

22
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,360
Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,460
My life...

24
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,650
- Was everything okay? 
 - Of course, nothing went wrong.

25
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,770
You crazy punk. You're loving this so much.

26
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,840
Let's go, Hyung!

27
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Give me the key. Ryeok! Key! My star key! I said give me the key.

28
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,130
 This is nice.

29
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,430
I caught Kwon Ryeok, but

30
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,260
who is the girl next to him? This is my first time seeing her.

31
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,870
Can we increase the heat a little?

32
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,330
What the? Haven't you left work yet?

33
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,520
No, not yet.

34
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,050
Something really big must have happened. Your face says you caught a big one.

35
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,670
Kim Ji Min or Kwon Ryeok, which is bigger?

36
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,430
Why do you even ask?

37
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,150
Right?

38
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,910

39
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,530
I have to watch the music show.

40
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,850
I need to watch my drama. It's an important episode.

41
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,930
You little. Trying to watch a drama. Go and sleep so you can grow taller.

42
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,910
I'm taller than you.

43
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,320
What? You little!

44
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,040
What did you say? I'm older by two minutes.

45
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,440
Just at times like this!

46
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,290
You are provoking a sleeping lion.

47
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,970
You're the one who provoked me. I won't let you go.

48
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,560
You... You come here!

49
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,900
Give it to me. Oh, just give it to me!

50
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,830
- I don't want to! 
 - Oh, why are you so strong?!

51
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,060
 Cut! Okay!

52
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,760
 Good job. You guys worked hard!

53
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,840
Wow! It felt so real!

54
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,160
I thought you were having a kendo fight.

55
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,050
My head is spinning.

56
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,570
You worked hard. Are you okay?

57
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,490
Yeah, I'm okay. I was sleepy, but now I'm awake.

58
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,490
Are you sleepy?

59
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,830
You probably couldn't sleep...

60
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,230
Okay, okay.

61
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,470
The new script has arrived. Please come and get it!

62
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,430
♫  La, la, la, la, la, la  ♫

63
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,300
♫  Come back, back to me  ♫

64
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,820
♫  I shine, I'm a diamond  ♫

65
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,590
I don't have any energy. I don't think I can do this anymore. Let's rest.

66
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,060
I can hardly move without getting tired because I've only been eating vegetables.

67
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,720
The chicken we ate that night keeps reappearing in front of my eyes.

68
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,670
Shh! Be quiet. And just fill up on this.

69
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,330
Love Virus?

70
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,570
I don't know what she's been doing with the camera, but Ma Ha got a lot prettier.

71
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,100
- Her dance came out well too. 
 - Lee Ma Ha. She's going to get pretty big.

72
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,720
Do you still talk to her? It seems like Ma Ha's been really busy.

73
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,650
Of course, we do.

74
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,970
Doesn't that mean she turned you down?

75
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,960
No need to get so serious. I was kidding.

76
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,680
Hyung, let's go wash up.

77
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,190
Going to record a radio with Se Young.

78
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,220
Oh! Good luck.

79
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,090
We're going!

80
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,710
I had that cool line and thought I wrapped up my feelings.

81
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,210
How pathetic, Yoo Jin.

82
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,430
I know, right.

83
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,990
Did you stay up all night again?

84
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,100
You should go in and rest!

85
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,860
You must be tired.

86
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,010
What's that?

87
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,520
Hyung Ryeok is a true actor, right?

88
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,230
- He's a professional. 
 - Do you want me to help you with the script?

89
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,810
No, no, not that.

90
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,680
Well, we have to...

91
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,570
I'm tired, but

92
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,870
I'll do it for my lovable brothers.

93
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,610

94
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,320
It's nothing much.

95
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320

96
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,190

97
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,250
Hey! Is this why you hid it from me?

98
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,390
As expected, our hyung is different. He's an actor.

99
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,090
- I was scared for nothing. 
 - Acting should be acting only.

100
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,940
And it's just a peck, not a kiss. Focus on your role.

101
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,300
It's not my role.

102
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,140
It's not my role either.

103
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,790
When is the shoot?

104
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,510

105
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,920
Thanks for the drink. Thank you.

106
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,930
- You've worked hard. 
 - You're so good looking!

107
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,450
I should have noticed when you told me you were coming to see Hyuk.

108
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,590
That was also part of the reason.

109
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,150
Your skills are getting better. Your dating skills.

110
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,570
 Kwon Ryeok.

111
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,810
You came to the shooting spot yourself. Nice to meet you.

112
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,430
No. It's my pleasure, Sunbaenim.

113
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,560
Please take good care of my teammates.

114
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,690
Of course.

115
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,590
You should have something to drink.

116
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,080
Thanks for the drink. See you later.

117
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,220
See you later.

118
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,390
It must be nice for Ma Ha.

119
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,610
I know, right.

120
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,660
It's a good opportunity for her to learn acting from a senior.

121
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,820
- Acting? 
 - Why?

122
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,680
It's obvious that you're pretending.

123
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,780
- What? 
 - Do you think I don't know you?

124
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,320
You're burning inside, right? It's churning, isn't it?

125
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,420
This is why you can't date anyone.

126
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,110
It's support and encouragment.

127
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,480
Jealousy? That's too childish for me, Kwon Ryeok.

128
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,800
Love isn't that simple.

129
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,930
Love is...

130
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,020
Never mind. Forget it. What can I talk about with you?

131
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,450
Straighten up. The director is coming.

132
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,100
Kwon Ryeok, you came here yourself. Your loyalty is also cool.

133
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,230
 Now that you have come, why don't you watch the shoot and go?

134
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,550
We are busy, so we'll leave.

135
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,290
Then shall we watch and go?

136
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,970
 Sure. Come this way.

137
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,580
Let's go.

138
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,080
Yes.

139
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,020
I'm going crazy.

140
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,390
 Hey! Do Hyuk!

141
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,730
Are you ditching again?

142
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,960
No.

143
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,930
Yeah, right.

144
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,420
I won't tell Mom. You have some of your allowance left, don't you?

145
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,950
How dare you!

146
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,430
Give it to me before you go.

147
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,890
 Do Ma Ha?

148
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,560
 It is, Do Ma Ha.

149
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,660
 - Bin Oppa? 
 - Cut! Okay!

150
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,420
 You two look pretty good together.

151
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,530
The next scene...

152
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,470
He's good looking.

153
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,040
Hyung, you are.

154
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,790
 You two did well.

155
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,080
- Ma Ha did everything. 
  - You both are great.

156
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,400
 - We have one scene left. 
 - He's good looking.

157
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,910
You really—

158
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,420
 - Wait a minute. 
 - Let's go.

159
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,100
Oppa, our first date?

160
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,210
- Oppa? 
  - Not oppa. Teacher.

161
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,860
I don't want to. I'm going to keep calling you Oppa.

162
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,270
I want to hear her call me Oppa, too.

163
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,150
I'm going to be your girlfriend later.

164
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,720
He said he doesn't want it. Why does she keep insisting?

165
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,840
So you can't have a girlfriend.

166
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,010
Girlfriend?

167
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,940
After I take the entrance exams, it'll be our first day as a couple.

168
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,450
- So you have to wait, okay? 
 - Day one?

169
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,720
 - Study.  
 - This is nuts.

170
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,510
Promise me.

171
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,970
- Promise? 
 - Hurry. Promise me.

172
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,140
Alright.

173
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,970
- Are you going to study hard? 
 - That pinky—

174
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,900
He's a total player, that guy.

175
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,020
Ma Ha—

176
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,660
Two-shot!

177
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,260
Yes, since they need a two-shot.

178
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,320
Talk quietly.

179
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,230
 Bust!

180
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,620
Director.

181
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,860
 Hey. Don't look.

182
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,080
 Tight bust!

183
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,820
How many times are they kissing?

184
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,700
This is making me mad.

185
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,710
 Cut! Okay!

186
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,750
Hey, Park Jung Hoon!

187
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,230
You've got a lot to do. Acting as a bridge.

188
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,570
It's killing me.

189
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,330
You already know. If he's into something, he gets really invested.

190
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,610
Don't worry too much. They're within my radar.

191
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Are you joking? Are you going to act like this?

192
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,700
Your expression!

193
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,370
Here, look!

194
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,260
The person you like is over there with someone else!

195
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,960
Doing that! How does that make you feel?

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,920
Don't you feel horrible?

197
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,490
Fill your eyes with those horrible emotions.

198
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,230
- Fill. 
 - Yes.

199
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,430
More!

200
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,470
It's hot! Aish!

201
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,940
Cheer and encouragement? Why aren't you rooting for her?

202
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,980
Stay out of it, you single person.

203
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,680
No wonder he's hot. He's always running like that.

204
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,910
 Make a right from the set. Then a left when you see the equipment car.

205
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,130
 Enter through the metal doors.

206
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,030
 Come down the stairs.

207
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,320
 Then turn left.

208
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,810
 Enter through the metal doors, and go straight.

209
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,620
- Sunbaenim! 
 - You pretended to not know me the entire time during filming.

210
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,100
Then should I have acted like I know you?

211
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,850
The kiss scene was intense.

212
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,190
It wasn't a kiss, just a peck.

213
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,620
"I'm going to be your girlfriend, Oppa."

214
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,270
Oppa?

215
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,160
Are you getting jealous of Yoon Bin?

216
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,260
Jealous? Yeah, right.

217
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,480
  I think you only need to take care of those two.

218
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,450
- Sunbaenim, I'm sorry! 
 - Forget it.

219
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,100
You did it well and stuck to him during the shooting.

220
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,640
It's not like you were getting rid of a bug.

221
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,550
Hey.

222
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,590
You were glued to him like you were a piece of gum. What about me? Am I a pervert?

223
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,860
Sunbaenim...

224
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,740
I don't know. I want to go.

225
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll get going first.

226
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,150
If you're going to do it—

227
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,820
You should have done it on the lips.

228
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,140

229
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,860
 Where did he go?

230
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,610
Let's get going, Actor Kwon. We need to go and do your schedule.

231
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,620
Hyung, give me just ten minutes.

232
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,170
Ten minutes? Yeah, right. Hurry.

233
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,420
Hold on!

234
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,280
Hold on.

235
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,290
Ryeok came out well, didn't he?

236
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,380
- I'm back! 
 - Welcome.

237
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,810
Can I have a vanilla latte?

238
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,410
Yes.

239
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,050
How was Yoon Bin?

240
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,260
He was really good-looking, wasn't he?

241
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,940
As if he had a light shining on him.

242
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,630
Daebak! I'm so jealous.

243
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,360
Are you out there for their good looks?

244
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,050
Actors are all the same.

245
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,450
Ma Ha filmed with Yoon Bin.

246
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,510
Sure.

247
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,240
Actor Yoon Bin. Don't you know him?

248
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,340
I don't have a TV.

249
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,460
He's also in movies.

250
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,820
I don't have enough time while preparing to apply for jobs.

251
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,810
Then do you know Kwon Ryeok?

252
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,820
Then do you know Noh Yang Jin?

253
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,190
A star lecturer on YouTube with 1 million subscribers.

254
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,420
We have different interests, so of course, we wouldn't know.

255
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,640
But SHAX's Kwon Ryeok is a real star.

256
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,200
Noh Yang Jin, among test takers,

257
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,900
is a real star, too.

258
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,610
But he's incomparable.

259
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,110
Kwon Ryeok is a famous person with a big fandom.

260
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,500
Star lecturer fandoms are just as big.

261
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,750
Kwon Ryeok—

262
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,520
For test-takers who dedicate themselves to studying,

263
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,320
a star lecturer is a famous idol to them.

264
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,660
How long do idols' careers last anyway?

265
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,610
After time passes, fans move on, too. Isn't it just a phase?

266
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,850
Kwon Ryeok is different.

267
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,920
Test takers dedicate themselves to studying for years just to achieve their dreams.

268
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,360
It's a realistic dream.

269
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,300
Isn't it all to earn money?

270
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,500
But—

271
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,660
Stop!

272
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,050
Ma Ha, why are you getting so worked up?

273
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,460
Worked up...

274
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,430
What's with you two?

275
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,400
Hyun Ji...

276
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,390
To tell you the truth, I went to the hospital that day.

277
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,420
To see Sunbaenim Kwon Ryeok.

278
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,820
- What? 
 - After seeing him at the hospital, I saw him a couple more times.

279
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,330
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

280
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,330
Lia... did you know about this?

281
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,730
What?

282
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,010
Am I the only one to find out now?

283
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,160
Hyun Ji, it's not like that.

284
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,360
Hyun Ji, about your schedule—

285
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,020
I'm enjoying going on a schedule with you, Hyun Ji.

286
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,090
- Yes... 
 - Are you mad that you haven't had something scheduled for a while?

287
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,590
No, it's not that.

288
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,250
I'm sorry.

289
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,300
Calling myself a CEO, and this is all I could do.

290
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,120
It really isn't because of that. Why are you being like that?

291
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,970
Cheer up.

292
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,380
You'll make wrinkles on your pretty face.

293
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,820
Don't think that you were left out.

294
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,560
 Hyun Ji, I'm sorry.

295
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,280
She's not picking up her phone and not responding to my messages.

296
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,760
 Good luck with your schedule!

297
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,490
Hyun Ji must be really mad.

298
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,740
She's not picking up my calls either.

299
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,140
I guess we were pretty indifferent.

300
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,230
She must have been disappointed.

301
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,960

302
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,040
Does it not look good?

303
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,680
It's different from the fitting size.

304
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,080
What?

305
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,070
- Hyun Ji, are you on a diet? 
 - No.

306
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,600
Are you stressed out about something?

307
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,940
How hard is he making you work?

308
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,890
Unni, it's not.

309
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,830
Take care of yourself.

310
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,180
If you get sick, you won't be able to do anything.

311
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,570
Alright.

312
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,260

313
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,340
Daebak. Kim Ji Min is first on the real-time searches.

314
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,700
What?

315
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,480
Relationships everywhere.

316
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,900
It's dark, but no matter how you look at it, it's definitely Kim Ji Min.

317
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,870
Why is Kim Ji Min dating Lee Sang Woo? She's too good for him.

318
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,250
But why did that make the real-time search charts?

319
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,710
People are so interested in other people's dating lives.

320
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,980
Aren't they in their prime for dating?

321
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,420
Isn't it natural that a female and male date?

322
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,430
- What if that were Kwon Ryeok? 
 - Hey.

323
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,350
Why are you bringing up Oppa Kwon Ryeok?

324
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,050
Kwon Ryeok is also a young male.

325
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,570
Still, it can't be him.

326
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,950
Ki Yeon...

327
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,440
SHAX's Kwon Ryeok is an exception.

328
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,370
Not male or female, but a national treasure.

329
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,450
There to take care of and admire.

330
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,990
Our oppa is that kind of person.

331
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,230
Oh! It's Oppa!

332
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,610
Yes, I understand.

333
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,770
Hyun Ji finished her schedule and went home.

334
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,130
Should we go home?

335
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,490
Let's give her some time.

336
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,270
- Why? 
 - And you two, be careful.

337
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,860
Scandal.

338
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,800
 Kim Ji Min?

339
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,810
 Kim Ji Min!

340
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,920
You're back.

341
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,640
You weren't sleeping yet?

342
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,500
I don't have filming anyway.

343
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,050
You just got out of the hospital. Think of yourself, and take it easy with your schedules.

344
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,660
Don't overwork yourself.

345
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,400
Go in.

346
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,860
Get some rest.

347
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,410
Jae Woo.

348
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,350
It's been six years as SHAX.

349
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,850
I want us to go on without any troubles.

350
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,390
You know what I mean, right?

351
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,520

352
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,790
Hello? Sunbaenim.

353
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,450
You were so full of energy. Why are you so down now?

354
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,120
I'm tired because too many things happened today that surprised me.

355
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,320
Me?

356
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,350
No. Yoon Bin.

357
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,100
Lee Ma Ha. You—

358
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,510
What's wrong?

359
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,700
 A small problem within our group.

360
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,720
I should have told Hyun Ji earlier.

361
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,800
And I have to consider them, too.

362
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,300
As a team member, it must have been disappointing.

363
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,590
It's a given since you're on the same team.

364
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,450
Thinking that something might happen because of me.

365
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,300
It'll worry you, too.

366
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,480
Since that happens to me, too.

367
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,650
Sunbaenim, you, too?

368
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,260
But I still believe in my team.

369
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,620
Six years didn't pass for nothing.

370
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,560
You should trust the time you've had together, too.

371
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,840
Alright.

372
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,160
By the way.

373
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,450
 Sunbaenim,

374
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,160
by any chance,

375
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,250
have you seen the news?

376
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,850
Which news?

377
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,190
Never mind. How does your schedule look?

378
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,650
It's filled with filming schedules.

379
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,780
I'm free Friday afternoon.

380
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,790
- Oh! I have that day off, too! 
  - Do you?

381
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,050
Let's meet up that day.

382
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,010
Alright!

383
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,080
Alright, see you then.

384
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,460
 It's been six years as SHAX.

385
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,780
Who's the one to talk?

386
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,050
 We've arrived.

387
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,260
It's been a while CEO Kim!

388
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,420
CEO Park! You must be busy. I'm so honored that you invited me.

389
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,000
Of course, I need to treat you when you're out there doing so much for the music industry.

390
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,570
Have a seat.

391
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,910
I heard you've been busy promoting a trot singer these days.

392
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,960
Yes, well...

393
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,490
Not promoting.

394
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,070
You got a good hunch on things.

395
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,830
- The kids are on the rise these days. 
 - What?

396
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,090
You know...

397
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,180
Omega III or whatever.

398
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,640
Oh, them.

399
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,330
You dedicated so much to them. It's not right that someone else is getting the benefits.

400
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,420
It happened after that one incident.

401
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,080
That was that.

402
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,090
I think I have to teach about this business' morals.

403
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,320
I don't think it'll benefit me really...

404
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,250

405
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,560

406
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,630
Lia!

407
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,050
- Yes, tell me Ma Ha. 
  - CEO!

408
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,390
We just received mail that says they're suing us for ending the previous contract.

409
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,450
Yea, I got it, too.

410
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,460
What should we do?

411
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,760
Do you perhaps have the Omega III contract?

412
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,230
I already threw it away! I got so mad when he abandoned us. I ripped it apart.

413
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,770
It must be somewhere, though.

414
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,020
- First, find the contract. 
 - Ok.

415
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,020
And most importantly, do you know

416
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,230
anyone who can prove that the company forced the contract on you?

417
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,820
- Who can prove it? 
 - Yes.

418
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,500
Who can prove it?

419
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,610
Take your time and think about it. Don't worry too much.

420
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,560
We'll take care of things one by one.

421
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,910
Alright.

422
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,120
Guys.

423
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,430
- Hyun Ji. 
 - What are we going to do?

424
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,890
It's okay.

425
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,070
Contract...

426
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,980
Contract...

427
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,660
I found it.

428
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,080
Who can prove it? Who can prove it?

429
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,100
Who can prove it?

430
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,220
- Manager Oppa. 
 - What manager?

431
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,540
Go Ba Hwi? That person who left you and ran away?

432
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,850
He's the only one that can be our witness.

433
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,140
Yeah, right.

434
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,170
We don't even know what he's up to or where he's at.

435
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,590
No. He will.

436
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,560
Didn't you throw it away?

437
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,220
No. Because my dad used this number.

438
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,630

439
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,920

- Why!

440
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,050
Hang up. Hang up. Okay.

441
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,050
- Hello? 
 - Why aren't you here yet! I order it so long ago!

442
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,850
Oh, yes, I just left.

443
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,280
I'll be there soon.

444
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,990
- Yes, I've just arrived. 
 - Hello?

445
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,290
This is Lee Ma Ha.

446
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,850
Hello?

447
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,710
Wow. Why can't I hear all of a sudden?

448
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,030
 Hello? If you called, you should say something.

449
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,570
- I can't hear anything. 
 - Manager-nim.

450
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,650
Wow, I can hear now. Who is this? Our Ma Ha!

451
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,650
Manager-nim, please help us.

452
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,830

453
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,420
- Who is this? 
 - What is there to even take away from our kids?

454
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,460
What's with the lawsuit now? You should know it's an obvious outcome.

455
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,880
I know it, too.

456
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
But you'll still put in the effort, time, and money?

457
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,100
It's none of your business.

458
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,720
That means you have nothing to lose, right?

459
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,330
What else could I do?

460
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:29,890
If you want to get even a single piece of meat from the master, you have to be right.

461
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,360
You can leave now, and let's meet in court.

462
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,110
They came back with a lot of difficulties.

463
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:48,440
If you will also stomp on them, at least clean your shoes before that.

464
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,160
What is that?

465
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,960

466
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,450
Why are they showing that all day, when it's not even that big of an issue?

467
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,250

468
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,380
What to do? What will we do?

469
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:36,570
Let's go. The CEO can't come. We shouldn't let this affect our schedule.

470
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,090
Ah! My head aches.

471
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,560
Let's go. Even I have to go to the recording room.

472
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,450
I'll leave first.

473
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Let's also go.

474
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,120
I think the shoot will get delayed a bit.

475
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,760
They're doing all sorts of things.

476
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,470
What is it that you're looking at like that?

477
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,320
- Tea Party. 
 - Ah!

478
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,430
Now that they're doing well, these bullies want to step all over them.

479
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,160
Is it the first time?

480
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,080
But are they even worth spotlighting on the news?

481
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,000
Exactly. They aren't even a big deal.

482
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,530
Is there no news coverage?

483
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,330
They must have been caught by some bad person.

484
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,050
Looks like it'll end quickly.

485
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,550
I knew about Ma Ha when she was rejected by our company.

486
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,590
And all she had was Omega.

487
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,180
Things aren't working out well.

488
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,930
There wasn't anyone more hard-working than Ma Ha as a trainee.

489
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,350
I did just as much.

490
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:57,820
Yea, Hyun Woo. You sure did, flirting, and dating.

491
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,130
 So you guys should also do well. Don't trust others when they say they'll give a lot of money.

492
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,930
  You guys aren't at that level yet. If you start looking here and there, you'll just get debt and find trouble.

493
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,260
Do well when the company is helping you. Don't lose your focus.

494
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,730
Yes!

495
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,840
It will work out well.

496
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,890

497
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,690

498
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,220
Yes, Yoo Jin.

499
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,460
- You had a hard time today, right? 
 - Yes.

500
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,480
We were all over the place.

501
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,440
But thankfully, we had the phone number of the manager.

502
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,840
So our CEO—

503
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,660
- How is Ma Ha? 
 - What?

504
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:54,430
It has not been long since her sitcom started. I am quite worried.

505
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,750
Hello?

506
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,660
You... are you just worried about Ma Ha?

507
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,010
- What? 
 - I was also part of Omega.

508
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,370
I also got the content certification.

509
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,800
Maybe not as much as Ma Ha, but I have also been busy.

510
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,940
And the magazine shoot got canceled because of the shoot, so I am whiling away my time here.

511
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,450
I am sorry, Hyun Ji.

512
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,940
If you are so worried about Ma Ha, then just ask her directly from now on.

513
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,820
 Hyun Ji—

514
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,940

515
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,250
I also want some consolation today.

516
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,560
Hello.

517
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,700
I am here.

518
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,380
You're here? Are you alright?

519
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,580
Why wouldn't I be?

520
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,980
You were on the news.

521
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,300
Why wouldn't I be okay? We have not done anything wrong.

522
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,520
Of course, you are tough.

523
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,890
Our CEO will take care of it all.

524
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,350
I believe he can.

525
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,290
But isn't SHAX busy?

526
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,490
What?

527
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,880
You are always here...

528
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,400
It's quite obvious that a musician will be in the studio.

529
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,880
You're here.

530
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,550
Does he own shares of this studio?

531
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,530
He is always here when I show up.

532
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,910
I do have... shares.

533
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,020
Hello, Knockoff.

534
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,580
I frequently see you around the broadcasting station.

535
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,540
Hello.

536
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,340
Sit down.

537
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,890
I saw the news.

538
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:10,160
Knockoff, you have not done anything wrong. Don't get scared.

539
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,070
I am not scared of what people say.

540
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:22,060
The truth would have come out in some time anyway. And I believe that

541
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,430
sincerity gets through to people.

542
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,360
That's unexpected. It's good that you have so much energy.

543
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,590
I am off.

544
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,570
Sunbaenim!

545
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,470
The weather is really good. Dress warmly.

546
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,460
This is my suit of armor.

547
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,930
Always getting ready for the next battle.

548
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,250
That is La Ri Ma.

549
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,960
Okay?

550
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,890
See you again.

551
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,680

552
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,780

553
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,520

554
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,980
I knew you would be doing this.

555
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,550
You'll get hurt like last time if you cannot concentrate!

556
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,320
They will be alright, right?

557
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,010
Alright? Can't you see them eagerly waiting for you?

558
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,150
 Come out.

559
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,140
Come out quickly.

560
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,180
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

561
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,670
Hello.

562
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,140
Everyone's working really hard in this cold.

563
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,680
All outdoor shoots around this time are like this.

564
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,590
Oh, right, is Lee Ma Ha doing okay?

565
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,040
Why are you asking that to Ryeok?

566
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,700
They filmed together and everything... I thought they were close.

567
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,820
That's not it. They are absolutely not close.

568
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,450
 She is doing okay.

569
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,250
Oh, right, she came to see you on the day of the accident, right?

570
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,610
- Yes, she came to encourage me, because I was acting for the first time. 
 - I see.

571
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,260
She is so polite and useful, I thought of introducing her to other directors.

572
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,950
It will be resolved. I appreciate your concern.

573
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,790
 It's so cold!

574
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,620
Let's go in before the sun sets.

575
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,220
Yeah, let's do that.

576
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,550
 Move.

577
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,620
 Ji Hak.

578
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,670
 Move!

579
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,320
Park Ji Man.

580
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,930
It's all your plan, right? The article and the lawsuit?

581
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,690
Why is it my plan that CEO Kim is looking for his kid's shares?

582
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:14,700
Because your mark is me, not Tea Party.

583
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,720
So it's not CEO Kim, but you behind him.

584
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,650
What do you think of yourself?

585
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,890
That look...

586
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:37,110
That look from three years ago as if you would slap me.

587
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,360
You called me brother and followed me. Then you were ungrateful enough

588
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,400
to insult and leave here.

589
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,030
Also, when coming back to this field,

590
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,070
you never apologized to me once.

591
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,760
Why don't you bulge out your veins, like that day?

592
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,730
I am sorry to say, but

593
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:15,430
your actions are so petty, that my veins won't bulge.

594
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,370
This is warning.

595
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,960
Don't mess with my kids.

596
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,350
I am sorry, too...

597
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:36,080
I also want to listen to you, but here is another disaster waiting to happen.

598
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,260
What do you want to do?

599
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,830
You should correct what you are saying.

600
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,010
"Don't mess with them!"

601
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,580
Either command me.

602
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,840
"Please don't touch them."

603
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,490
Or make a request. Think it through.

604
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,580
Shall I see you out?

605
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,740
Are you alright?

606
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,450
Yes, I think it will work out well.

607
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,030
Thank god.

608
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,650
It's okay as long as you guys are okay with it.

609
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,720
It looks like you worried about me a lot.

610
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,680
Not really. It's just my concern as a sunbae.

611
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,520
Don't worry too much.

612
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,150
See you on that day.

613
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,690
Sure.

614
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,820
It's such a relief!

615
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:19,520
 There wasn't much else besides the dorm deposit, rent, food money, and fuel money.

616
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,100
 The kids also took turns wearing old clothes.

617
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,450
 The lowest possible maintenance fee was spent.

618
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:31,320
Rather, the kids were the ones who had a hard time with the lights and water going off.

619
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,320
The company incurred no losses.

620
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,850
 The kids were the ones who did not receive their dues.

621
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,820
I did not get a penny either.

622
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,980
He is the ass— It's the CEO who unilaterally violated the contract.

623
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,960
I will testify for these pitiful kids.

624
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,330
If you are this kind,

625
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,150
how could you run away, leaving Ma Ha up on that cold mountain?

626
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,750
Hey.

627
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,220
I am sorry, Ma Ha.

628
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,440
I can trust that apology, right?

629
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,790
Are there documents that could act as evidence?

630
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,730
While cleaning out the office there, I took whatever could make money.

631
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:17,000
I brought everything. The notebook, tablet, and desktop.

632
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,890
What you just said... can you say that in court as well?

633
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,030
Of course. I'll bring it all out.

634
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,920
I think this might be enough to sort things out.

635
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,590
You guys went through a lot.

636
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,520
Your schedules are free today so rest up.

637
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,010
Ma Ha, can we talk briefly?

638
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:52,700
Since this happened, let's just forget about the past and start fresh!

639
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,790
Forget the past?

640
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,710
Give us our money!

641
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,560
You jerk!

642
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,480
 This idol is beating up someone!

643
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,070
Picture?

644
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,710
You and Kwon Ryeok.

645
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,750
I can take care of the lawsuit, but this is different.

646
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,620
I'm sorry, CEO.

647
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,170
Responsibility comes with action.

648
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:41,710
I've always respected your opinions and will continue to do so.

649
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:48,550
But Ma Ha, I can't let you take care of this by yourself.

650
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,070

651
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,400

652
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,220

653
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,570
He must be busy.

654
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,280
 Sunbaenim.

655
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,340
What is it at this hour?

656
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,660
We have a problem.

657
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,990
They have a picture of us.

658
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,730
Hello? Are you listening?

659
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,550
Yes.

660
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,080
There are a lot of pictures like that.

661
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,360
Really?

662
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,990
Yes.

663
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,770
Don't worry too much.

664
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,680
 I'm going to hang up now.

665
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,880
Over here!

666
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,530
What's the occasion?

667
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,490
You are calling me first.

668
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,650
I have a favor to ask.

669
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,920
- Favor? 
 - Can you release an article?

670
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,690
What type of article?

671
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:47,930
A follow-up article regarding the companies of Omega and Tea Party.

672
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,060
Oh, that?

673
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,630
Resources...

674
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,080
are all here, so take a look, and you can decide.

675
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,970
Is it a request?

676
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,390
No, the truth.

677
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,330
These articles are always written to make an issue, but the conclusion is never talked about.

678
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:11,650
Since it doesn't make money or anything of that matter.

679
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:16,230
But I thought you would.

680
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,490
- I'll look at it. 
 - Thank you.

681
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:31,050
But did you know, if I write the article, then you'll owe me one?

682
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,480
Ryeok. Why are we here?

683
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,770
 But it's bothering me because it's a photo from the same night as Kim Ji Min's photo.

684
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,320
What are you guys doing?

685
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,790
CEO, you're at work till late.

686
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,930
You two are having fun, aren't you?

687
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,790
Hey.

688
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,850
Hey.

689
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,590
I told you to take care of him.

690
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,490
Hyung doesn't know anything.

691
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,420
Doesn't know?

692
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,230
Doesn't know?

693
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:19,780
I'm sorry, CEO!

694
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,170
Hyung, step out for a minute.

695
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,950
She's doing anything and everything to get famous using you.

696
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,170
What good does it do for you to meet someone like her?

697
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,750
 Ryeok, you should have met someone that's at your level.

698
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,580
And think about it,

699
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,970
would you be the one that's affected more or her?

700
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:07,930
You need to think about who's more at a loss.

701
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:13,020
Have you gone blind just because you're so popular?

702
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,130
Do you think you achieved everything because of yourself?

703
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,280
SHAX? You can leave it now also if you want.

704
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,360
I have nothing to lose. Why?

705
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,320
I've earned enough.

706
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,840
Do the other guys know?

707
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,890
 That you're dating?

708
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,580
Do they know?

709
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,750
 Would you be the one that's affected more or her?

710
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,950
 You need to think about who's more at a loss.

711
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,140
 That's a relief. I feel at ease because you said that.

712
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,030
 Do the other guys know?

713
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,370
 That you're dating?

714
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,340
 SHAX has been together for six years.

715
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,370
 I want to go till the end without getting distracted. Do you get it?

716
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,450
 Director.

717
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:40,810
If you were still SHAX's manager, what would you have done in this situation?

718
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,780
What would you have done?

719
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,770
If I were still SHA'sX manager, I would have prevented things.

720
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,790
But not now.

721
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,560
What's important is you.

722
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:05,000
I would have left it up to you to decide.

723
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,890
Thank you for your advice.

724
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,170
 And I'm sorry for calling you for something like this.

725
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,880
Did you wait long?

726
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,730
No.

727
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,080
How long has it been since we've seen each other?

728
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,590
Has it been about a week?

729
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,510
I think so.

730
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:54,040
No wonder. I really missed you.

731
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,660
There really must be something going on.

732
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,590
Ma Ha.

733
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,950
What is it?

734
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,800
What do you need to say that you're having so much trouble with?

735
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,510
I don't have the strength to say this while looking at you in the eyes.

736
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,350
Let's...

737
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,960
break up.

738
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:55,690

739
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,160
 I only show you my bad side.

740
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,960
 I'm really sorry.

741
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,320
 Hyung, what's wrong?

742
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,250

743
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,170
 I feel disgusting.

744
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,630
 Have a drink and let it all out, okay?

745
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,050
 Good days will come.

746
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,950
 Ji Hak.

747
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,070
 I can't live like this anymore.

748
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,850
 I won't live like that anymore.

749
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:39,680
♫  What if either of us...  ♫

750
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,460

751
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,590
 Ryeok is back.

752
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,980
 I'm back to normal.

753
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,020
 I'm not seeing him anymore.

754
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,530
 If you were going to break up so easily, why did you have to make people around you so uncomfortable?

755
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:54,570
 An anonymous person sent this picture and information about Eun Jo's girlfriend, mentioning that this is the reason why Eun Jo disappeared.

756
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,990
 I told you I don't want to get involved with SHAX.

757
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,870
 - I'm interested. 
 - You know Kwon Ryeok, don't you?

758
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:00,930
 They said they fought over a woman.

759
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,090
 He can't get it together. He's becoming like someone I know these days.

760
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,790
 When you were after Ma Ha, were you not sincere?

761
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:10,920
 How is she so not phased by anything? Makes me even more worried.
