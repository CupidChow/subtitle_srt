1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:08,180

2
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,360

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,250
♫  Show me ♫ 
 ♫ I’m sorry, I’m a little busy ♫ 
 ♫ Tell me  ♫

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,710
♫  Oh this is your Tea Party  ♫

5
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,530
- Ah. 
 - Oh, I am tired.

6
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,740
Hey, kids, your clothes are finally here.

7
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,780
- Our stage outfits? 
 - Amazing!

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,340
Our stage outfits.

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,130
Daebak!

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,190
You can't see me at all, can you?

11
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,910
Hello!

12
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,590
And this is your outfit to wear on your way to the music show.

13
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,290
You should draw attention from the very beginning.

14
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,120
It's so cute!

15
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,740
You guys don't see me either, do you?

16
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,060
It came out at last.

17
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,570
Annie, our album came out.

18
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,760
Are you watching?

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,610
I am not here to ask you to make our debut go well.

20
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,030
Just don't be hurt anymore and be at peace.

21
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,100
You can't be upset that we are 'Tea Party' now instead of 'Omega III.'

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,930
It is an Omega III song sung by Tea Party.

23
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,670
The song that you practiced.

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,810
You will tell us that we did well and congratulate us, right?

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,790
I will do my best to fill your shoes.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,430
I was a bit late.

27
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,190
Doesn't this feel like déjà vu?

28
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,820
Don't say anything.

29
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
We need to start moving from early morning.

30
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,120
Let's not think about anything and sleep quickly.

31
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,170
Can't you sleep either?

32
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,590
No. We need to sleep.

33
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,900
Then let's hold hands and sleep.

34
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,290
Okay.

35
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,640
- I like you guys so much. 
 - Me too.

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,030
- Sleep tight. 
 - Sleep tight.

37
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,700
I will park and follow you guys. It's your day, so don't feel down. Fighting!

38
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,640
Fighting.

39
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,710
Yes, PD-nim we just arrived.

40
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,930
  Come to the meeting room quickly.

41
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,110
Sure.

42
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,660
 Hello, we are always happy Tea Party!

43
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,020
Let's go.

44
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,490
 Hey, Yu Jin.

45
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,780
Hey, Ma Ha.

46
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,270
We finally meet here.

47
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,980
This day finally came.

48
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,340
- Congratulations! 
 - You, too.

49
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,100
We need to reduce the screen time for the rookies.

50
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,320
How can you do this suddenly?

51
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,290
I am also a salaryman. If they ask me from the top to take them out, I have to follow that.

52
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,010
Still, this is not right.

53
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,670
Do you think I am doing this on purpose?

54
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,360
Who knew that Shax, who never come to live music shows, would turn up out of nowhere like this?

55
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,240
Anyway, as the rehearsal is in an hour,

56
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
prepare an MR of two minutes. 
  (T/N: MR is music recorded)

57
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360
But—

58
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,620
PD-nim!

59
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,270
- CEO Park... 
 - Doesn't this mean that our kids won't be able to debut today?

60
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,820
 They are truly the Devil's children.

61
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,770
 Why is Shax coming to this show?

62
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,400
 Why are they asking us to prepare something for two minutes?

63
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
How did it go?

64
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,370
It is hard.

65
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,130
Just three minutes.

66
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,810
Ah, you scared me! Congratulations, Hyung!

67
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,920
Ah, it's really hard.

68
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,390
It looks like they got a spot.

69
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,330
Looks like I still got it.

70
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey, Park Jin Man!

71
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,030
Don't be so angry, Ji Hak. It's not good for your health.

72
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,140
It was your doing, right?

73
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,600
You said that the business in this field with the kids is an easy one.

74
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,980
That it involves blowing their noses and cleaning up their shit.

75
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,310
You have it all wrong. This is not a business at all.

76
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,780
It's a dream, a dream that the kids put their life on the line for!

77
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,250
You will definitely pay for this.

78
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,360
I taught him everything he knows.

79
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,750
Get hazed properly once.

80
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,160

81
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,550
This does not make any sense. Then what's gonna happen to us?

82
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,160
You will perform on the stage, what else?

83
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,690
Ah, this is befuddling. Why did Shax have to appear out of nowhere?

84
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,100
Hyung, we are fine, right?

85
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
It's only a problem for the teams who are debuting today.

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,960
Tell me about it. What is with those 'Tea Party' people, repeatedly?

87
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,830
The place makes a person.

88
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,650
So you guys also need to make this a hit to avoid looking bad.

89
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,180
If you don't want to do this, then do you want to go back home?

90
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,260
At this rate, you guys will get off the stage in two seconds instead of two minutes.

91
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,990
How do we prepare for a two-minute show right away?

92
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,880
I think we are back to square one.

93
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,370
Argh, we are done for thanks to Shax!

94
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,230
We are so done for.

95
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,480
 - You have to do well, you get me? 
 - Yes.

96
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,120
 Stop. Stop! Omega III can't go on air today.

97
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,720
Then do you want to give up?

98
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,520
I'll make sure what happened three years ago doesn't happen again.

99
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Trust your CEO.

100
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Because I trust you, too.

101
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,680
What's with this morning radio? Even the roads are free of cars!

102
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,240
You're right. We need to stop your CEO, who sends you all over the place.

103
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,690
- What is it? 
 - Notifications are going crazy regarding SHAX.

104
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,720
What about SHAX?

105
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,040
Apparently, they're going on music shows.

106
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Really?

107
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,850
What is this? Coming to your senior's dressing room.

108
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,820
It's quite noisy for someone who has their stage ahead.

109
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,970
What you said at that press conference three years ago, looks like it was all bluffing.

110
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,100
"From now on, SHAX doesn't plan to appear on music programs."

111
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,860
 We will not on go music programs for the benefit of our junior singers.

112
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,990
  We have a lot to do.

113
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,770
 When we debuted, we also cut down our precious song to fit a two minute stage.

114
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,070
  As time went on, we thought,

115
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,100
 "just like we experienced,"

116
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,730
 "Are we taking away our juniors' time?"

117
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,690
  If we don't stand on the stage,

118
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,600
For junior singers, that time

119
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,310
would allow them to perform the song in its entirety. That's what I heard.

120
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,730
Hey! Don't you know your place?

121
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,320
Don't make a big deal out of this and leave!

122
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,550
Tell me!

123
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,860
To you, the three minutes is a way for you to earn money but

124
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,410
for us, every minute on the stage

125
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,750
is our dream.

126
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,880
 What's with the vibe here?

127
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,570
I wanted to give my congratulations on your comeback after a long time but

128
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,280
you, don't you know there's a time and place for everything?

129
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,030
How long has it been since you've debuted?

130
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,530
Do they or the company decide whether to appear on music programs?

131
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,760
You must know that already.

132
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,020
It doesn't look like I should congratulate you.

133
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,870
Contact me once you feel better.

134
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,240
No, call me if even if you don't. Okay?

135
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,700
Must be embarrassing.

136
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,640
La Ri Ma was here.

137
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,600
All of us in SHAX share the same opinion.

138
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,210
We've promised our fans to see them at our concert, and

139
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,940
this is a matter to respect for our junior singers.

140
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,150
Please exclude our appearance this time.

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
Ryeok.

142
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,380
Back then, we let you do the interview because we were proud you were thinking about your juniors.

143
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,220
Music programs that don't bring in much profit and have an effect on sales...

144
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,290
it was about time we stopped anyway.

145
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,590
The contract that the members don't know about

146
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,780
is still valid.

147
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,600
What are you doing this early?

148
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,850
Sorry. I got this urgent project to work on.

149
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,300
What is urgent? You must be urgent to make money!

150
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,350
You kept going on and on about turnover. Don't ruin my work because you want to make a small sum.

151
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,500
How much do you need?

152
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,360
It's not money! They need my song.

153
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,110
I'm going to release this under my name.

154
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,290
You need my song but...

155
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,380
What?

156
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,910
♪ We will give everyone a sorcery melody ♪

157
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,880
♪ Now I want to cheer up the sky ♪

158
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,810
It's here. The MR.

159
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,790
They're probably sensitive because it's been a while since they've had a comeback.

160
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,720
Don't misunderstand anything.

161
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,060
We aren't mentioned. Why only Ma Ha? What about us?

324
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,230
Right, Hyun Ji?

325
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,760
Right.

326
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,180
Obviously.

327
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,420
Lia, Hyun Ji, and Ma Ha. We're Tea Party.

328
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,720
Should we each make a wish?

329
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,860
Okay! Hyun Ji, you start.

330
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,920
Do I have to say it?

331
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,630
What is this secretive talk between us?

332
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,220
What is it?

333
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,840
You do have something, right, Hyun Ji?

334
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,690
Okay. Whatever the wish is, I hope it comes true.

335
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,930
I'd like that too.

336
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,380
Let's make the wishes quicker.

337
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,190
- I'm hungry. 
 - Me too.

338
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,040
Even if it wasn't a jackpot, it's a relief the reaction was better than we thought.

339
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,460
You guys worked hard. Let's wait for our next schedules.

340
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,590
Yes!

341
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,730
- Take a lot of rest. 
 - Thank you.

342
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,860
It would have gone better if someone didn't butt in.

343
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,680
It's ok. Stop thinking about it.

344
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,350
We can just do better next time.

345
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,420
Let's go out. We don't have anything scheduled.

346
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,230
I'm a bit tired.

347
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,050
Next time.

348
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,860

349
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,290
 We ate the cake. You're the only one I have!

350
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,760
 I don't have anything scheduled for tomorrow. Do you want to meet?

351
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,100
 Tomorrow isn't possible. How about the day after tomorrow?

352
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,250
 Let's meet at the cafe.

353
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,090
 Okay.

354
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,440
"You're the only one I have".

355
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,820
 Hyung! Help me out.

356
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,680
 Lift it properly!

357
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,200
 Omg! Omg!

358
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,460
Seok hyung!

359
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,260
Lift it properly!

360
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,550
Hyung!

361
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,370
Hyung!

362
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,360
I couldn't come to my mentor's studio with empty hands.

363
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,170
Congratulations.

364
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,130

365
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,360
Well, it's a bit small,

366
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,660
but you are Ammonite, the best in the whole universe.

367
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,550
Thank you.

368
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,910
How is it?

369
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,010
It's always a little lacking.

370
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,090
I like it.

371
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,440
What is it?

372
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,940
Seong Ah Hyung is being investigated for taking propofol.

373
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,450
What are you talking about?

374
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,460
I don't see any news article, though.

375
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,430
They are holding it back as they asked not to disclose it yet.

376
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,410
But because this is related to Lee Jong Wook...

377
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,390
 - Can you really stab me? 
 - There is no reason I cannot.

378
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,580
 I am the Ijojeonrang's daughter.
 (T/N: Ijojeonrang was a very high ranked govt. official in the Joseon era.)

379
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,350

380
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,690
What happened?

381
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,300
The source sent to the fact check side before was about Lee Jong Wook's propofol drug abuse.

382
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,830
But it all got tied together.

383
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,430
They are the ones who gave a cause to film again, so manage the contract properly.

384
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,560
Anyway, ask them not to drag this on for long.

385
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,770
I won't do it.

386
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,300
Why not?

387
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,160
It's a role that you wanted so much, acting next to Kwon Ryeok.

388
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,500
I have repeatedly told you, right?

389
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
Acting is not for me.

390
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,150
The moment I start acting, the image I have built up will flow out the window.

391
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,520
Kids who are worse actors are also doing it.

392
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,890
Ah, it's up to them.

393
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,960
And I am La Ri Ma.

394
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,600
I won't stand in for some druggie who got fired.

395
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,780
Still, it's Kwon Ryeok.

396
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,740
Even if it's Kwon Ryeok, I won't do what I don't want to.

397
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,720
Tell them I can sing the OST if it's a duet with Ryuk.

398
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,820
They contacted saying La Ri Ma won't be able to do it.

399
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,810
Is that so?

400
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,490
She fits the role perfectly. It's a shame.

401
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,930
Bring your standards down. High-profile people won't take up this role.

402
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,850
Nothing will come out of waiting.

403
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,220
Director, please take an audition. If you drop your standards a bit,

404
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,930
there are a lot of people who want to do it. There's no time. Let's reduce it to some people.

405
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,360
This is Lee Ma Ha, who I recommend. She is an idol.

406
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,270
Is she an up-and-coming idol these days?

407
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,780
She became a bit popular as she debuted with quite an impact.

408
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,320
Tea Party?

409
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,090
She's done minor roles too. She's appeared in our movie as well.

410
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,820
Our movie?

411
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,620
The one where she got stabbed by Ryeok.

412
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,590
Ah, it does look like she'll be good for the role, but...

413
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,200

414
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,260
- Yes, Ma Ha? 
 - I am sorry, Yu Jin.

415
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,910
What?

416
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,520
Ah, I am such a scatterbrain...

417
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,200
I was too busy because of the audition. I forgot that I had to postpone our meeting.

418
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,620
 Audition?

419
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,080
Yeah, it's a movie audition. It's because I got it in a rush.

420
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,870
Okay.

421
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,860
It can't be helped.

422
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,060
It's not even once or twice. I am sorry for doing this again.

423
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,930
It's okay. Work comes first.

424
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,280
I am telling you it's fine.

425
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,820
Don't worry about me and have a good audition.

426
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,570
Okay.

427
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,860
"Really,"

428
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,070
"can you really stab me?"

429
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,410
"It's such a relief."

430
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,630
Is it a comedy or a thriller? Looks like a new genre.

431
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,860
What do I do?

432
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,960
Why? It looks like you will do well.

433
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,700
"Lee Ma Ha develops a new genre."

434
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,120
I am really really serious.

435
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,290
They did not even give me more than a day to look at the script.

436
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,210
You will burn a hole in the script if you look at it a day more.

437
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,930
Ma Ha, believe in yourself.

438
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,840
All the time you spent on this will prove it.

439
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,330
Okay, then shall we begin?

440
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,550
Yes.

441
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,140
Don't be nervous.

442
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,250
Let's read scene 26.

443
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,120
Page 38 for scene 26.

444
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,120
"Eun's glittering sword gets closer slowly." 
 (T/N: Eun is the character played by Ryeok.)

445
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,780
"Yeon So, who has turned pale."

446
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,400
"Their wavering gaze settles."

447
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,960
"She opens her mouth with a chilly expression."

448
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,210
"Will you really be able to stab me?"

449
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,080
"There's no reason I cannot."

450
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,220
"I am the Ijojeonrang's daughter."

451
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,590
"Can you actually stab me?"

452
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,420
Wait, wait. You don't have to read the stage directions or other parts.

453
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,330
I was too nervous. I am sorry.

454
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,390
It looks like you memorized all this.

455
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,910
Yes, the script was fun. I kept on practicing too...

456
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,470
I am thankful she came to us because it was fun.

457
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,930
Okay, read Yeon So's parts.

458
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,610
Okay.

459
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,350
"Can you really stab me?"

460
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,160
How did the audition go?

461
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,480

462
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,060
It has her name, too.

463
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,960
Ma Ha you are cool!

464
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,370
"Yeon So." What kind of role is it?

465
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,860
I don't have many scenes.

466
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,020
But it's a bit worrying

467
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,570
because Kwon Ryeok is the main lead.

468
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,290
SHAX's Kwon Ryeok?

469
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,990
You got this role all on your own. Don't worry about it.

470
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,590
Still, there's the jacket ruckus from last time.

471
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,560
Insults, curses,

472
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,050
all the way to our debut stage, we are the ones who are suffering.

473
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,040
This is an opportunity that you got all by yourself.

474
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,990
So don't think about anything else and stop worrying.

475
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,360
I told you to believe in yourself, right?

476
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,920
Why did that role go there? Does this even make sense?

477
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,660
Ryuk, shall I tell something to the director?

478
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,780
If you guys get roped in together again, and the CEO comes to know about it, he will be really angry!

479
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,790
What is it that will make me angry?

480
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,500
Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party in Ryeok's movie...

481
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,390
The director chose her himself.

482
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,920
It's a bit weird if we do something...

483
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,000
I am still a newbie in acting and can't exercise power on casting.

484
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,180
Will you be okay?

485
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,260
Other than a few scenes, there's nothing big that will involve us. Don't worry.

486
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,670
What about the kiss?

487
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,790
You be the judge of it.

488
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:20,010
But I hope this is the last time that you are involved with her.

489
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,290
Hello!

490
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,460
Hello!

491
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,710
Ms. Ma Ha.

492
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,730
Hello.

493
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,430
I do have eyes. She's totally Yeon So.

494
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,030
Thank you.

495
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,680
Thank you for giving us this good opportunity.

496
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,780
She is the one who grabbed it.

497
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,720
Oh Mr. Ryeok.

498
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,590
I am the CEO of JH Entertainment, Ji Hak.

499
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,340
She is still inexperienced, but I leave her in your care.

500
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,360
Looking forward to your cooperation.

501
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,230
This is a good atmosphere.

502
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,370
 Okay, let's go and film!

503
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,020
 Stand-by, cue!

504
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,990
Will you really be able to stab me?

505
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,270
I am the Ijojeonrang's daughter.

506
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,400
Will you really be able to stab me?

507
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Cut!

508
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,830
Ma Ha, you are doing fine according to the script...

509
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,330
But something seems to be missing. Do it with more impact.

510
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,250
But then you cannot overdo it. You have to feel like it's actually you.

511
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,690
Let's not cut this time and take it till the very end. I think something will come out of that.

512
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,500
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

513
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,750
Okay, then let's not cut, and go till the very end.

514
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,980
I am sorry.

515
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,930
Did you see Song Ah Young act?

516
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,060
Yes, the Assistant Director asked me to refer to it.

517
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,420
The camera sees the Yeon So played by you.

518
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,920
Don't imitate other people.

519
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,060
Don't think about other things.

520
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,250
From now on, you are Yeon So, and I am Eun who is trying to kill you.

521
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,130
Yes.

522
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,000
 Okay, we will get ready again. Standby!

523
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,320
 Standby!

524
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,890
 Cue!

525
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,400
Really,

526
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,160
will you really be able to stab me?

527
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,800
There's no reason I cannot.

528
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,920
I am the Ijojeonrang's daughter. Will you really be able to stab me?

529
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,850
Since when?

530
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,570
Since when were you the Ijojeonrang's daughter?

531
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,000
These clothes. This face too.

532
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,570
- Oh? 
 - Let's not disrupt and go on for now.

533
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,270
Were they always yours?

534
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,960
Did you really not even

535
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,420
know who you were imitating?

536
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,320
Why?

537
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,620
Are you suddenly scared of dying?

538
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,400
You exude something

539
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,810
that cannot be hidden or covered with anything.

540
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,790
You reek of a lowly background.

541
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,890
Cut!

542
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,810
Okay, that was really good!

543
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,060
You were cool.

544
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,360
Ms. Ma Ha, are you alright?

545
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,540
 She should be alright, right?

546
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,480
 It looks like she's quite shaken.

547
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,750
 Was I too hard on her?

548
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,050
 I feel sorry.

549
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,450
Did you say you will follow me?

550
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,630
I killed your father.

551
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,320
My father also took the life of your father.

552
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,440
Even if I have to change my name and identity and live my life on the run,

553
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,770
I can bear them all if I am with you.

554
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,660
Cut! Cut! Cut! Again!

555
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,390
Cue!

556
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,360
 Cut!

557
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,570
I am sorry.

558
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,130
Cue!

559
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,710
Cut!

560
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,410
You two, don't get all tensed up. You are saying your last goodbye.

561
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,780
A kiss that will remain in your memories forever.

562
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,200
Memory. Okay?

563
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,860
 Okay, again.

564
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,680
 Cue!

565
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,240
Cut! Cut! Cut! Again!

566
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,230
I am sorry.

567
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,790
Is this your first time?

568
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,830
I have done it before.

569
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,050
Then do a good job.

570
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,660
It's a kiss scene out of nowhere. You were just trying to kill me so...

571
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,100
I don't feel it.

572
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,250
I am embarrassed too.

573
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,090
There is no Ma Ha or Kwon Ryeok in front of the camera.

574
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,550
No staff either.

575
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,410
 Okay, we will go again!

576
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,600
 Standby!

577
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,860
Cue!

578
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,700
Even if I have to change my name and identity and live my life on the run,

579
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:57,320
I can bear them all if I am with you.

580
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,990

581
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,930

582
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,670
Your coffee is here.

583
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,390
Ah, okay.

584
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,030
Thank you.

585
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,580
Hope you like it.

586
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,520

587
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:39,970

588
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,410
Who writes these things in the script?

589
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,700
You look good. You must have had a hard time.

590
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,950
It's all because you taught me with a heavy hand.

591
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,060
It's still the same, your eyes for spotting talent.

592
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,120
It's her first time acting, but the strength in her gaze...

593
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,490
But Ryeok still seems to be sensitive.

594
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,570
You know he had a hard time because of Eun Jo.

595
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,880
He got a bit better, but he's still like that.

596
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,150
But it's still a relief that you are beside him.

597
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,010
Not at all.

598
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,770
Yeon So!

599
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,090
It's a relief.

600
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,280
That I can protect you like this.

601
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,060
You cannot leave like this...

602
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,380
Yeon So!

603
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,700

604
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,680

605
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,700

606
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,820
I had a lot of fun filming with my seniors.

607
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,530
Please watch it and have fun. Thank you.

608
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,590
Starting from tomorrow, you have to appear on stage in other places for a week.

609
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,160
We have to go to Busan, Daegu and then up to Daejon.

610
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,890
Ah, I am tired.

611
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,520
Kwon Ryeok is really something. There are so many people this late.

612
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,060
What is so embarrassing? They did not even invite Ma Ha to the preview.

613
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,380
Tell me about it. It would have been good if we had come together.

614
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,870
She got an important schedule at this time.

615
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,490

616
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,210
Let's go. The movie is about to begin.

617
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,510
Let's go.

618
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,630
Yu Jin. Let's go.

619
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,970
 Really,

620
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,630
 will you really be able to stab me?

621
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,230
She came on.

622
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,620

623
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,920
- Do a good job. 
 - Please take care of Kwon Ryeok.

624
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,410

625
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,530
Hello, please take care of Kwon Ryeok.

626
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,560
Bye.

627
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,420

628
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,900
Are you giving these out?

629
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,590
Lee Ma Ha?

630
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,350
Aren't you giving these out?

631
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,610
We are, but...

632
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,630
But why are you here?

633
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,630
I am here to make stage appearances.

634
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,980
Thank you.

635
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,790
Fighting!

636
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,980
- The kiss scene... 
 - Why are they involving her in the stage appearance too?

637
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:21,430
Fins, there's an additional mission to blocking crazy fans.

638
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,760
Block Lee Ma Ha!

639
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,070
Hello, I am Lee Ma Ha in the role of Yeon So.

640
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,290
Hello Ms. Ma Ha.

641
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,830
Hello, Director-nim.

642
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,330
Hello.

643
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,370
 We will get going.

644
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,720

645
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,220
Yes, it was really fun filming and I learned a lot from it.

646
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,780
I would appreciate it you look favorably upon it. Thanks.

647
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,450
 We will eat dosirak on the move for our meal. 
(T/N: Dosirak refers to Korean lunchboxes.)

648
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,990
I will get there first. Go safely.

649
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,210
- Hello, Mr. Ryeok. 
 - Yes?

650
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,340
- Did you eat? 
 - Thanks.

651
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,770
Have a good meal.

652
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,540
Does your company starve you?

653
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,350
No, our company gives really nice food.

654
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,320
Then why are you eating like this?

655
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,470
It's tasty.

656
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,340
Have a good meal.

657
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,810
Hello.

658
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,670
 Look here once.

659
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,550
Breakthrough 5 million!

660
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,390
Breakthrough!

661
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,360
- I will go again. 
 - Okay.

662
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,600
Do it properly.

663
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,200
Exceed 5 million!

664
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,060
Breakthrough!

665
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,950
5 million!

666
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,140
Okay, 5 million sounds good. Promise something.

667
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,570
If we exceed 5 million views,

668
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,260
I will reenact the best scene chosen by you all.

669
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,330
Right in front of you all.

670
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,140
In front of them?

671
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,820
Yeah, sure.

672
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,620
- In person. 
 - In person?

673
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,320
Let's go to 5 million!

674
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,730
Let's go!

675
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,390
 Five million!

676
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,460
 Okay, that was good.

677
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,900

678
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,050

679
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,450

680
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,860

681
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,690

682
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,760

683
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,980

684
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,580

685
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,180
 Did he catch me doodling?

686
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,020
 No way!

687
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,790
 Is she smiling at me right now?

688
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,340

689
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,000
Crazy fans are scarier than ghosts. Be careful.

690
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,290
And more careful! Rest up.

691
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,390
Don't open the door. Never.

692
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,370
Where did it go?

693
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,390
- What? 
 - My gargle.

694
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,020
What—

695
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,730
Okay.

696
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,360
 What is this?

697
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,320

698
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,940
No!

699
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,870
Gargle...

700
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,580
Isn't it here either?

701
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,590
Why did he ask me to buy stuff that they don't sell?

702
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,690
 Your call cannot be connected.

703
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,250
Why isn't he picking up again?

704
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:53,620
Ah, this picky guy, he will send me again if he does not like it.

705
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,120
I don't know anymore.

706
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,430
Let's just buy it all. He can pick from it.

707
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:00,090
I will use the rest of them.

708
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:10,210
We have confirmed that Oppa is inside. We will retreat for the day.

709
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,560
I am a bit anxious, but let's go back for now.

710
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,820
There, the one with the cannon lens, stop!

711
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,910
Hey!

712
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,160
What is going on?

713
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,300
Hey, you guys!

714
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,770
Ah, not again.

715
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,660
Why does he keep doing this?

716
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,620
What sort of a manager does not even take the keys?

717
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,530
It's 1425, right?

718
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:14,940

719
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,240

720
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,390
- What is so great about you? 
 - Really cannot do this with you.

721
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:25,040
She thinks she's a princess.

722
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:15,850
You, don't get into a girl group.

723
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,650
Your dancing, singing, visuals, everything is great, but...

724
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,310
but here, you won't be able to hang on from here.

725
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:33,610
I have put in so much effort till now.

726
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:36,560
Are you asking me to quit now?

727
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,540
I never asked you to quit, just not to form a girl group.

728
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:51,720

729
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,510
 You look into my eyes properly. Nothing really happened, right?

730
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,560
 This is a huge bomb waiting to go off!

731
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,510
 You be careful. Don't get involved with Shax.

732
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,090
 I want to try drama and movies too.

733
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,430
 I want to request mine too.

734
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:06,130
 Really? Shax Lee Hyun?

735
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,530
 He asked you to work together with him?

736
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,800
 Aren't you thinking of me, looking at my knockoff?

737
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,670
 Shall I like or dislike what you said?

738
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,300
 I am reporter Byun from 'Fact Check.'

739
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,850
 What do you want to know?

740
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,970
 Eun Jo. I am really curious about him.

741
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:21,360
♫  Is it so frustrating?  ♫
