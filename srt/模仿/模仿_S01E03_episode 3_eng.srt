1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,580

2
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,120

3
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:45,150

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:52,210

5
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,640
♫  Lalala, even though it's a repeating pattern  ♫

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,000
♫  Lalala, I’m letting it go. What did you do yesterday?  ♫

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,370
Wow! That was a great performance by Shax's youngest.

8
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,330
Alright! Idol Outing's official introduction time.

9
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,020
Let's continue. Next up is Third Eye's Yoo Ji!

10
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,490
Hello! I'm Third Eye's leader Yoo Ji. Please look after me kindly!

11
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,610
 Ma Ha. You don't have to do this.

12
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,820
 I'm okay.

13
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,480
 I have to do my best on behalf of Lia and Hyun Ji. And for Tea Party.

14
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,190
 Thank you!

15
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,870
 Thank you for your hard work.

16
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,600
Our last introduction. A rookie appearing on Idol Outing for the first time.

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,930
It never crossed my mind that this person would have a younger sister!

18
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,950
La Ri Ma's younger sister, Lee Ma Ha! Please come out!

19
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,400
Hello! I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

20
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,350
Today, I'll try to imitate my sister

21
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,000
properly.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,380
 Play the music!

23
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,330
♫  It’s me, it’s me La Ri Ma  ♫

24
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,810
♫  To be my lover   ♫

25
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,980
♫  To be my lover   ♫

26
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,190
♫  To be my lover   ♫

27
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:15,510
♫  3, 2, 1 drop. Let me hold the wine. Today, I feel fine. Drinks and up all night   ♫

28
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,330
Will you help me Sunbae-nim?

29
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,710
 She has held her hand out for help.

30
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,680
 Will he take her hand?

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,270
 Will he!? Will he take her hand?

32
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,230
Don't do it. Don't do it.

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,200
He took her hand!

34
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,190
Why is he acting like that today?

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,140
♫  It’s me, it’s me La Ri Ma  ♫

36
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,020
♫  To be my lover  ♫

37
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,230
♫  To be my lover  ♫

38
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,760
♫  To be my lover  ♫

39
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,100
♫  To be my lover  ♫

40
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,540
Really! This was a performance that will be remembered on Idol Outing!

41
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,300
Did you two practice beforehand?

42
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,910
No.

43
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,940
It's such a great song.

44
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,720
A great song?

45
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,130
Thank you.

46
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,570
Ah, okay.

47
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,570
This was Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party, who will always be happy.

48
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,620
Thank you!

49
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,810
This was Idol Outing! See you next week!

50
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,990
Okay! Cut!

51
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,930
Great job, everyone!

52
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,610
You've worked hard!

53
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,710
You've worked hard!

54
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,210
Great job today.

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
You've worked hard today.

56
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,120
Ryeok.

57
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,590
It's been a while.

58
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,740
Ryeok!

59
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,210
Let's grab a drink next time.

60
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,110
Let's go.

61
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,890
Okay.

62
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,040
- Great work today! 
 - Great work today!

63
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,770
Why isn't he picking up?

64
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,280
Ryeok, the car is right outside. Give me five minutes!

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,740
What? Hyung!

66
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,340
Good job today!

67
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,700
It was so hectic.

68
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,320
You were the best, in my opinion. You did really well.

69
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,280
Let's go.

70
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,190
PD-nim! PD-nim!

71
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,860
Can you edit the opening dance part?

72
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,440
It came out pretty good, though.

73
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,240
It wasn't something Ryeok would normally do, and it wasn't part of the script.

74
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,420
Please!

75
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,880
 Sunbae-nim!

76
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,860
You asked if the only thing I could do is imitate.

77
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm just doing the best that I can in my current position.

78
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,350
Although it might not look much to you.

79
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,170
You surprised me.

80
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,060
What was that?

81
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,460
What was what?

82
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,950
When did you get here?

83
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,720
Before she said, "Sunbae-nim!"

84
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,140
What is it?

85
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,520
Go in.

86
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,770
Let's see.

87
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,890
It is our padding!

88
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,790
 Will you help me Sunbae-nim?

89
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,380
I got stomped all over

90
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,520
by a mere copycat!

91
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,120
- Can you go by yourself? 
 - Yes.

92
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,550
I can go with my eyes closed.

93
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,440
You worked really hard today.

94
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,070
You've worked hard today.

95
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,750
Get home safely.

96
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,830
Drive safely.

97
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,080
- Yoo Jin. 
 - What's with the long face?

98
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,180
Shouldn't you not be out?

99
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,070
How were you able to come out?

100
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,420
It's my last outing before our comeback.

101
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,700
Before your comeback.

102
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,790
Comeback? Really?

103
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,110
We received a song today.

104
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,720
Congratulations!

105
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
Things are going to be hectic from now on.

106
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,430
The last album didn't too well, so it'll be tougher this time around.

107
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,040
You know it's hard to continue if you don't have a hit song by your third year.

108
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,920
Are you trying to show off?

109
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,800
I didn't mean to...

110
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,870
Why are you scared?

111
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,290
How are things for you guys?

112
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,730
Not yet. Apparently, we'll be receiving a song soon, so we'll just have to be patient.

113
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,130
You'll get a lot of good songs.

114
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,080
Of course, it's our album.

115
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,580
How was the shoot today?

116
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,270
Tact, tension, fear,

117
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,310
embarrassment,

118
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,880
surprise.

119
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,050
Among those, excitement and joy.

120
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,910
Excitement and joy?

121
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,270
Yoo Jin! I danced with a star today.

122
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,160
A star?

123
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,580
La Ri Ma?

124
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,620
No.

125
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,150
A brighter star, one that is hard to approach.

126
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,760
A star that's hard to approach?

127
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,550
I don't know! Watch it when it airs.

128
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,430
Aren't I taking too much of your time?

129
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,030
- No. 
 - Don't overdo it.

130
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,550
Make sure to keep the path to music shows clean! I'll follow right behind you.

131
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,180
Alright, hurry and follow.

132
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,590
- I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it. 
 - You just have to do it here.

133
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,820
It's fine.

134
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,180
Unni is here!

135
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,790
Ma Ha!

136
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,420
Did the recording go well? What was the atmosphere like?

137
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,340
Sunbae-nim La Ri Ma was there, too, wasn't she? I heard she's terrifying. Was it okay?

138
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,030
I was worried she might say something to you.

139
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,890
Why would she say anything? What did Ma Ha do?

140
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,620
You know. I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

141
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,230
Forget it. Don't worry about it.

142
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,730
What are they saying?

143
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,330
They told me I was really good, and for me to imitate her more!

144
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,020
I completely flexed on them.

145
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,750
La Ri Ma Ha flex!

146
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,120
Well, our Ma Ha really is a good dancer.

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't know. I don't know if I did well or not.

148
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,660
But I did do my best.

149
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,450
Check it when it airs!

150
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,490
Say something!

151
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,980
Say what?

152
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,100
So

153
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
the padding you gave last time was this?

154
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,840
You saw it too, Hyung.

155
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,140
You're crazy! How many times did I tell you to be careful!

156
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,010
How could you give this to anyone?

157
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,030
- Hyung! 
 - Blood is going to come out of Ryeok Hyung's ears.

158
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,920
- What is it? 
 - Look at this!

159
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,390
It's our sixth anniversary padded jacket.

160
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,170
It's obvious that this is the jacket from Shax's fans.

161
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,450
If you don't look at it carefully, you wouldn't be able to tell.

162
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,040
Hyung asked for the logo to be smaller because it would look tacky if it were bigger.

163
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,430
As if it's barely there. That's all about fashion.

164
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,930
But still, giving this away at the filming site.

165
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,780
Alright, I'm sorry. I was wrong. Let's end it here.

166
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,970
Giving and taking the jacket, talking to her, dancing. Don't you know that once the sasaeng fans bring out their cameras, it's game over?

167
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,990
Do you remember last time? They zoomed in to see if you were wearing a designer hat or not.

168
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,410
You're such a softie. She has a boyfriend that picks her up from Mungyeong.

169
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,270
Alright, alright.

170
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,330
 Our schedule tomorrow is packed too.

171
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,700
 Lee Ma Ha!

172
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,100
 There was a reason why she didn't get in the car.

173
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,240
 Get home safely!

174
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,680
Ryeok, you must be tired, too. Go in and get some rest.

175
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,810
Sorry.

176
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,410
What about Hyun?

177
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,030
Where else?

178
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,420
You have a studio filled with equipment at your company. Why bother me here?

179
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,550
- My mentor isn't there. 
 - You sure talk pretty.

180
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,870
Didn't you say that song selection is completed?

181
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,300
Yes.

182
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,490
I think we received about 1400 songs? The company is going through them.

183
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,450
- But something is missing. 
 - You're being greedy.

184
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,420
Why don't you just write all the songs!

185
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,100
If I had the time, I would love to do that.

186
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,980
But

187
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,160
you need to move out, too.

188
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,130
I like my monthly salary. I don't even have the proper weapons to go out into the jungle,

189
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,490
- nor the courage to do so. 
 - You can gather courage.

190
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,780
I'll help you with weapons.

191
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,420
This is whatever.

192
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,810
Let's start again.

193
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,210

194
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,920
Your coffee order is ready. Enjoy.

195
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,530
It's up!

196
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,460
Ma Ha's first weekend variety show!

197
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,260
- It's Ma Ha! 
 - Please!

198
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,160
It's starting now.

199
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,510
 Alright! Idol Outing!

200
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,750
A day off for once. Is there anything fun to watch?

201
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,310
Pass!

202
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
Oh!

203
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,920
Oh! It's airing today!

204
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,600
The opening was killer.

205
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,720
Hyung! We haven't had a day off in a while. Let's watch the broadcast.

206
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,530
♫  What did you do yesterday?  ♫

207
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,880
♫  Lalala  ♫

208
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,320
♫  It’s a repeating pattern but lalala  ♫

209
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,950
♫   I’m letting it go. What did you do yesterday?  ♫

210
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,440
 La Ri Ma's younger sister, Lee Ma Ha! Please come out!

211
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,860
 Hello! I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

212
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,870
 Alright! Idol Outing's official introduction time. Let's continue.

213
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,330
- What is this? 
  - Next up is Third Eye's Yoo Ji!

214
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,150
It was edited out.

215
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,080
It was so good, though.

216
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,170
This isn't Ma Ha or La Ri Ma's younger sister.

217
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,740
Hey! Isn't this what they call evil editing?

218
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,100
You said you had danced during the opening!

219
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,970
I did.

220
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,490
This is weird. Why is Ma Ha on the real-time search chart?

221
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,290
Really?

222
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,600
What?

223
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,630
CEO Park, your driver is a work of art.

224
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,070
You sure flatter me...

225
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,800
I always learn from you.

226
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,340
There are rumors that you'll be hearing good news soon.

227
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,140
Ah, what good news...?

228
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,110
They're just rumors.

229
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,460
Are you going to act like this among us? Please give us concrete information.

230
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,140
CEO Park,

231
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,850
there's been a problem.

232
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,740

233
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,230
Ryeok! Ryeok!

234
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,750
Look at this!

235
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,410
 Why was the official padding jacket that was made for Shax members for their sixth anniversary

236
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,730
 in the hands of Singer A?

237
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,410
 This action of Kwon Ryeok shows that he looks down on the fandom.

238
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:05,210
We are expressing our grievances against NOG, which acted as a mere spectator at this act of deceiving the fans.

239
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,080
Until NOG and Shax give appropriate feedback on this,

240
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,110
we will stop supporting each of them, boycott their music, goods,

241
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,460
purchasing DVDs, etc.

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,980
 Cut! Okay!

243
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,110

244
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,590

245
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,440

246
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,810

247
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,790
Hyung, I'll leave the rest to you.

248
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,460
Hyung! The video of you dancing is everywhere!

249
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,300
What is this?

250
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,890
♫  It’s me, it’s me La Ri Ma  ♫

251
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,730
 I danced with a star today.

252
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,170
What are you doing? Everyone's been busy because of the comeback,

253
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,380
but you're on your cell phone. You've lost your mind, haven't you?

254
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:04,390
She's really trying hard. Using Kwon Ryeok to cause an issue.

255
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,640
Wow, you are scary.

256
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,200
So in order for you to have something with her, you need to be at least Kwon Ryeok's level.

257
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,810
Is it not? This is so fun.

258
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,350
So rude.

259
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,210
Ah!

260
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,750
Why is the copycat standing out so much? I put in so much effort

261
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,250
for you to get a good shot with Kwon Ryeok.

262
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,000
This is a strategy to sell you out and for her to get famous.

263
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,530
What strategy? I was the one who dressed her up and had her makeup done.

264
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,070
But I'm feeling terrible.

265
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,680
I want to release an album.

266
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,990
Do you? We're always on standby.

267
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,200
A duet with Kwon Ryeok.

268
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,740
You know that's hard to do. CEO Park.

269
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,640
Does he still think I'm inferior?

270
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,610
CEO,

271
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,510
I am La Ri Ma. Now both La Ri Ma and Kwon Ryeok are top stars.

272
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,540
Won't putting us together look good?

273
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,820
How much do we have left on our contract?

274
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,790
You...

275
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm going to do it no matter what. No matter what.

276
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,490

277
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,000

278
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,290
- What do I do? 
  - "You are an awful person. You counterfeit La Ri Ma!"

279
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,720
Ma Ha...

280
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,690
 Fake La Ri Ma.

281
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,220
Forget it. Don't be scared.

282
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,370
He's being cursed at because of me, right?

283
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,830
Kwon Ryeok?

284
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,510
Should I explain myself? If I say that it was nothing and say it was a misunderstanding, won't the fans understand?

285
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,760
I'll go with you.

286
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,620
Why? Are you going to hold a press conference?

287
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,020
Or are you going to write "Please don't misunderstand" on the online forum?

288
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,190
Let's just stay put, instead of instigating Shax fans.

289
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,590
'Fins' is the fanclub of Shax. They are a huge fandom.

290
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,830
They can actively demand what they want.

291
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,500
They can even drive the public opinion for Shax.

292
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,330
They have an equivalent footing as Shax.

293
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,140
Then what should I do?

294
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,190
Ma Ha, there's nothing you could do,

295
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,830
except keeping an eye on it.

296
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,080
Then what about our Ma Ha...?

297
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,560
Our Ma Ha...

298
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,420

299
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,060

300
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,870
 - She's looking down on Kwon Ryeok's fans.  
 - Looking down on?

301
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,220
 "Look at him smiling while dancing with that imitation." "This is the first time I have seen Kwon Ryeok smile."

302
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,620
 - He sees his fans as easy. Kwon Ryeok should withdraw from the group.   
 -  Withdraw?

303
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,640
What am I going to do?

304
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,310
Stop looking at it!

305
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,920
Just like our CEO said, let's just stay still until it gets quiet.

306
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,280
He should have just sent it by mail. Why did he give it in person? I'm getting frustrated the more I think about it.

307
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,760
The one who gave you the padded jacket was Kwon Ryeok!

308
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,940
And it's not like you forced him to dance.

309
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,090
How could I be so senseless and not think that he was a Shax?

310
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,930
But to say, "He sees his fans as easy."

311
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,060
Isn't that taking it too far?

312
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,090

313
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,400
 Isn't it a misunderstanding to assume that he belittled his fans?

314
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,400
 Why would Kwon Ryeok like someone like her?

315
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,910
 Her and Kwon Ryeok? That makes no sense.

316
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,510
Why? What happened?

317
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,620
 Hello. This is Kwon Ryeok from Shax.

318
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,240
 First of all, I'm sorry to have caused worry due to my insufficient behavior.

319
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,440
 The circulating stories about the padding are different from the truth.

320
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,480
 I let the supporting actress, who was shivering from the cold, borrow my jacket.

321
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,040
 Since I met her again through a variety show, I just got it back.

322
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,250
 The warmhearted gesture towards a supporting actress is the love of the fans.

323
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,790
 The video of us dancing in the program is a scene filmed under the program content.

324
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,480
 It was edited out, so I hope there are no misunderstandings about that.

325
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,410
 Fins, I am always grateful for your love.

326
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,770
I'm happy because of all of you. I love you. Kwon Ryeok.

327
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,740
Warmheartedness towards a supporting actress? Ah, so disrespectful...

328
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,020
That's right. It was warm.

329
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,340
Ah, what? I don't have to worry about it anymore. It's such a relief.

330
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,830
I was worried for no reason.

331
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,080
You look like you are worried.

332
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm not!

333
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,280

334
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,820

335
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,980
Trying to look cool by yourself.

336
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,710
Come out.

337
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,920
I apologize again for causing you to worry.

338
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,790
Sorry.

339
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,280

340
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,630
I'm going to continue to keep a close eye. You all should be careful.

341
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,900
You already know you're all that we have.

342
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,880
We will repay you with good music soon.

343
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,950
Just look at me.

344
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,010
It's a relief that they understand our hearts.

345
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,440
I think I can go to sleep comfortably now.

346
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,260
Don't be caught off guard. Both La Ri Ma and her copycat.

347
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,590
They are both on top of the list to be wary of.

348
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,610
- Oppa. 
 - Oppa!

349
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,920
- Why? 
 - I was upset.

350
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,080
- She called me. 
 - It was me, me, me.

351
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,320
It's a relief.

352
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,740
Giving a written explanation and hosting a fan meeting?

353
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,770
Even so, can you just write a posting without even discussing it with the company?

354
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,690
I didn't want to cause concern to the company because of this little thing.

355
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,880
We're one team, and it's a situation caused by us.

356
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
So we should be the ones to take care of it.

357
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,850
It's been resolved.

358
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,460
Okay. I understand your heart. You suffered a lot. Go rest.

359
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,220
"We're one team, and it's a situation caused by us. So we should be the ones to take care of it."

360
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,230
Their brains have grown quite a bit.

361
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,320
I think we raised them too well.

362
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,420
- I'm sorry. 
 - Forget it.

363
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,220
Who did you say was the person involved in this situation?

364
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,150
- Tea Party. 
 - Who are they under?

365
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,620
JH Entertainment.

366
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,900
- JH Entertainment? 
 - The one that Ji Hak created.

367
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,030
We are intertwined like this...

368
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,100
I said that I would settle this first. Me.

369
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,510
Why did you post it first? Why?!

370
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,620
I also know.

371
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,530
About where I stand...

372
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,330
JH Entertainment makes sure you get all three meals a day.

373
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,480
Ta-da! Eat well.

374
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,470
Thank you.

375
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,230
Do you perhaps know what today is?

376
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,190
A day among many days.

377
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,850
What day is it?

378
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,140
How do you salaried employees not know when your pay day is?

379
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,600
I deposited it!

380
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,620

381
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,790

382
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,650

383
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,650
I don't know if I can accept this...

384
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,150
Aren't we still in the minus?

385
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,550
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

386
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,760
Thank you.

387
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,340
And also, we need to release an album.

388
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,420
It arrived. The songs that you've been waiting for.

389
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,450
Really?

390
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,300
How many songs?

391
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,120
Twenty-three songs.

392
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,940
- Yes! 
 - Success...

393
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
Hurry and eat!

394
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,610
Hurry and eat!

395
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,480
Thank you for the food!

396
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,320
♫  Love me, love me, love me, love me baby  ♫

397
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,350
♫  Love me, love me baby  ♫

398
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,340
♫  Love me, love me, love me, love me baby  ♫

399
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,130
♫  Love me, love me baby  ♫

400
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,620
♫  When I try to get close to you,   ♫

401
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,190
♫  You wanna push me away  ♫

402
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,210
♫  Boy, why?  ♫

403
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,520
♫  I know  ♫

404
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,640
♫  I'm not the one who said that we were done   ♫

405
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,900
♫  I'm not the one who said that I had enough  ♫

406
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,000
♫  I'm not the one  ♫

407
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,970
♫  I'm only waiting for you  ♫

408
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,950
♫  You can take my heart  ♫

409
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,000
♫  You see you. I only see you  ♫

410
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,980
♫  You are the only one that's sweet  ♫

411
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,020
♫  You can take my heart  ♫

412
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,000
♫  Hurry up and steal it  ♫

413
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,200
♫  Hurry up and steal it  ♫

414
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,300
What do you think?

415
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,220
How should I say this...?

416
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,440
It doesn't sound like our song...

417
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,020
Okay, I will put in a request again.

418
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,350
Oh, no, no! Should we listen to them again?

419
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,220
Yes, yes. If we keep listening to them...

420
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,230
No, you don't need to do that.

421
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,500
Your expressions are saying it all.

422
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,700
Our expressions?

423
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,970
It's not the expressions that became one with the music and played excitedly.

424
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,680
I...

425
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,690
don't want to make you into a commodity.

426
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,510
Your own identity.

427
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,460
Identity?

428
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,720
I feel more burdened now that we received our salary.

429
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,190
Can we do well?

430
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,480
What?

431
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,510
Music show debut. I feel worried for no reason.

432
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,600
And I keep remembering that voice.

433
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,260
During the Omega 3 stage when we got ready,

434
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,670
and as soon as the music started, "Stop, we don't have time."

435
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,910
"Please get them down!"

436
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,610
Someone said that, and we had to get off the stage.

437
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,100
 Today is a monumental night. Should we take a picture like this?

438
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,830
 Should we?

439
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,540
 Awaiting tomorrow's sun, Omega

440
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,450
 Three!

441
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,990
 That expression that you made when you became one with the music.

442
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,460
Our song.

443
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,500
Omega Three's debut song.

444
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,980
Our own identity.

445
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,780

446
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,230

447
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,840
F Rieze told us to come to the recording room.

448
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,750
A guide will come out within this week. Don't worry about it.

449
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,830
The last EP's B-side track came out well.

450
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,850
Of course. Ah,

451
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,360
don't worry...

452
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,900
Yes, yes, yes.

453
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,830
That's what I'm saying. Yes, yes.

454
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,550
Okay, bye.

455
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,520
Trying to hurry me while reducing the song commission, ugh!

456
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,320
You're here.

457
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,440
The one I mentioned to you last time, we have to do that first.

458
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,700
The one that came in.

459
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,180
The one that makes money. Hey, pink suits you a lot.

460
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,680
Hello?

461
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,210
I don't know if you remember, but three years ago, Frieze....

462
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,960
Producer.

463
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,130
Produce Frieze gave a song to Tea Pa–

464
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,080
Omega Three.

465
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,720
We are Omega Three.

466
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,180
Yes?

467
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,650
Yes.

468
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,020
Yes, thank you.

469
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,630
What is this? Why was it so short?

470
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,270
He just wants to meet.

471
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,860
Okay, don't be tensed. We are also performers who have a stake in Omega III.

472
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,990
Seeing that he wants to meet us, he will probably allow a remake, right?

473
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,580
We won't know until we meet him.

474
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,230
Should we have told our CEO?

475
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,150
Nothing has been confirmed yet. It's a bit early to tell him.

476
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,230
Even if we tell him, let's make it a surprise.

477
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,820
Anyways, let's make it clear... Our objective.

478
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,630
Are you Ammonite?

479
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,590
There are a lot of other songs. Why that particular song...?

480
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,420
Because it was like us.

481
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,820
It was the song that we stood on stage with three years ago.

482
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,920
We didn't even get to sing, and we were dragged off the stage.

483
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,400
We have the opportunity to stand on stage again.

484
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,960
- But that song is still... 
 - I still think about it.

485
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:12,420
I want to release it... Like us.

486
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,710
I keep spilling stuff like this.

487
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,180
Hey, are you done? Huh?

488
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,990
Are you done?

489
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,060
Are you still doing it?

490
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,010
I'm done.

491
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,960
- Hyung... 
 - What?

492
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,660
Do you remember Omega Three?

493
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,350
What...? Is it a medication?

494
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:43,080
We gave them a song three years ago named "Call Me."

495
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,130
Me?

496
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,700
It's a song that I made. Although it was released under your name...

497
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,040
Is it a song that will make money?

498
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,200
No, just... used.

499
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,160
It's not a song if it doesn't make money. Aigoo...

500
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,440
Transfer it to me.

501
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,170
Is it an apartment to transfer?

502
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,810
Hyung...

503
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,340
♫  Going crazy  ♫

504
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,400
♫  Shining, I'm a diamond  ♫

505
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,720
 I danced with a star today.

506
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,310
♫  Yes, I am a diamond  ♫

507
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,860
♫  Shining, I'm a diamond 
Lalalala  ♫

508
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,400
♫  Oh, oh, oh. La, la, la, la  ♫

509
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,530

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,070
♫  Shining, I'm a diamond  ♫

512
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,660
Let's work together. I will produce it.

513
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,560
But there is a condition.

514
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,720
As long as we change the song.

515
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
We were going to say that.

516
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,210
You guys write it with your story.

517
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,790
- That is my condition. 
 - Yes!

518
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,820
And we can only use the recording room for two hours in the morning. That's the only time that it's free.

519
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,960
That's fine. We don't mind if it's even earlier.

520
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,500
Dawn? Midnight?

521
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,530
♫  I really want to delight  ♫

522
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,130
♫  I’ll leave this in your hands  ♫

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,890
♫  We are special. Certainly, we are not ordinary  ♫

524

♫  We are special. Certainly, we are not ordinary  ♫

525
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,260
♫  A fantasy blooms  ♫

526
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,390
♫  And turn into a crystal clear flower  ♫

527
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,910
♫  This is a mysterious adventure. We gotta go  ♫

528
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,640
What are you doing?

529
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,220
Why are they like that?

530
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,360

531
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,820
Ammonite?

532
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,370
Ha Seok?

533
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,190
The world is very small.

534
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,390
To see that Tea Party are your kids.

535
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,480
I was wondering what they were up to.

536
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,320
Let's keep it a secret that we met.

537
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,430
And also, this.

538
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,060
This isn't much, but song expense.

539
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,410
If you do this, I feel so burdened that I can't work.

540
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,550
Take it.

541
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,190
Whether it's them or you, you're the same.

542
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:05,290
I also came to deliver this to you.

543
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,210
The Tea Party kids also gave this... song expense.

544
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,190
Use this for them.

545
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,350
Since Tea Party revived a song that I even forgot about.

546
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,040
Why isn't it blending?

547
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,950
Guys, have you guys seen my hoodie?

548
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,590
My knit? Haven't you seen it?

549
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,760
Where is it?

550
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,260
Don't be nervous. Let's start.

551
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,760

I'm nervous.

561
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,160
Where's the restroom?

562
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,840
It's good.

563
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,770
Can I try again from the eighth bar?

564
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,670

00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,700
What is this at this hour?

570
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,570
Recording. Why are you here at this hour?

571
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,050
I sent you a message. I wanted to have Ryeok listen to a song.

572
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:14,770
Was that today?

573
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,800
I told you. Ryeok, who has ears for top ten songs, said this is the only time that works for him.

574
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,560
That makes me sad.

00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,830
Who is that?

578
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,580
My first producing team, Tea Party's vocal.

579
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,430
Your producing? Tea Party?

580
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,960
Hello. I'm Tea Party's Hyun Ji.

581
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,360
Where's Ryeok?

582
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,850
Excuse me, Sunbae-nim.

583
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,780
Thank you.

584
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,740
I was going to post an apology letter first.

585
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,910
For what? What apology letter?

586
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,570
What?

587
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,450
I'm grateful for what you have done for me, but why are you like this every time?

588
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,740
Last time I thanked you for letting me use your jacket.

589
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,530
But you got mad at me, asking if the only thing I could do was imitate La Ri Ma.

590
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,840
And this time, I put you in an awkward position, asking you to dance.

591
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,380
So I was going to post an apology first.

592
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,330
But you posted an apology first!

593
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:02,060
So I'm trying to thank you, but you keep pretending like you don't know.

594
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,780
Why are you being like that to me?

595
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,280
Anyways, thank you so much.

596
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:28,430

597
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,660
My mistake.

598
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,580
You're here?

599
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,490
Are you already done?

600
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,320
Wow! Tea Party's vocal, Lia, is the best.

601
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,690
Thank you.

602
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,550
SHAX's Lee Hyun.

603
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,340
It's early, but you sang well.

604
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,240
Yes.

605
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,610
Ma Ha, you're ready, right?

606
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,690
Yes!

607
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,590
Let me do some work.

608
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,430
I'm going to start.

609
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:22,980
♪ Sorry ♪

610
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,730

611
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,990
You're flat, again.

00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,320
♪ Sorry ♪

613
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,490

614
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,020
♪ Sorry ♪

615
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,730
Again.

616
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,820
You were so confident when imitating La Ri Ma, but now that you're doing your own thing, you're scared?

617
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,810
If you're going to do it like that, imitate others your whole life instead.

618
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,420
Let's start again, from the beginning.

619
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,730
Finally, it's better now.

620
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:18,330
♪ We are special. Certainly, we are not ordinary ♪

621
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,580

622
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,380
Why only five members?

623
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,630
They should have made it double the members, to make double the profit.

624
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,790
The songs are out now, so pick out the right concept with the choreographers.

625
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,970
The date of the album release doesn't matter, right?

626
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,490
We need to decide so other people can schedule their album release.

627
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,800
The twenty-second then, the twenty-second!

628
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,830
Let the stylists know so they can prepare the outfits along with the right concept.

629
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,950
You know we never have the outfits overlap with each other.

630
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,750
Our schedule is full till next month.

631
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,700
Okay, sounds good.

632
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,600
Yes?

633
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,700
SHAX's promotion period is four weeks. Tell them no less than 100,000,000 won.

634
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,050
- What about negotiations? 
 - Never!

635
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,620
And tell them to hurry and send the song.

636
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,080
Also their dance.

637
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,260
Yes, I understand.

638
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,920
How am I supposed to make clothes out of nothing?

639
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,260
 You have a guest.

640
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,350
I'm not expecting anyone.

641
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,400
Who is it?

642
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,480
I'm in a rush. Can I ask you for a favor?

643
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,210
We're expensive.

644
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,620
I know you're expensive. That's why I'm asking for a favor.

645
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,960
I heard the rumors. Was it a trio? What about the song?

646
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,980
Not yet.

647
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,550
When the song comes out, make sure to send the kids over to me.

648
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,680
Never mind! I'll go.

649
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,700
It's better for one person to go than to have them come.

650
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,740
The showcase this time was amazing too!

651
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,580
Sold out in 30 seconds!

652
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,950
Of course. Who are we!

653
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,750
We are the devil's children!

654
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,010
SHAX!

655
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,910
- Wow! 
 - Good work.

656
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,910
Just thirty seconds!

657
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,720
Good job.

658
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,650
Let's start.

659
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,230
Hold on. Yoo Jin, you take the center position.

660
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,950
What?

661
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,090
Okay.

662
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,150
Alright, for this promotion period, Yoo Jin will be the center.

663
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,160
What? Me?

664
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,720
Why? Don't you want to do it?

665
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,550
No! I'll do my best!

666
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,860
There's not that much time left before the comeback. Be ready!

667
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,300
- All of you did a good job. 
 - Thank you, sir.

668
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,280
Thank you for your hard work.

669
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,680
Lee Yoo Jin!

670
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,620
Congratulations on being the center!

671
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,420
Thank you for your hard work.

672
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,600
Thank you for your hard work!

673
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,790
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

674
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,590
Let's make sure to show Sparkling's color this time.

675
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,750
Hyung, when is SHAX's comeback?

676
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,200
The twenty-second.

677
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,490
Their release date is similar to ours, but SHAX doesn't appear on music shows.

678
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:46,820
If we do it the same way we just did, we can rock the stage.

679
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,450
Oh! Yoo Jin, that gaze, it's great!

680
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,190
It's great!

Yay!

690
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,190
 You did well!

691
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,390

708
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,360
- How is it? 
 - It sounds exactly like Tea Party.

709
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,980
It's good.

710
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,950
Yay! Thank goodness!

711
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,520
Yay!

712
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,320
Good. It's really good.

713
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,080
I have worked a bit on the choreography too.

714
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,180
What is wrong with the practice room?

715
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,870
It was difficult to find, wasn't it?

716
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,640
I probably made 100 rounds.

717
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,550
Still, you have made the best of it.

718
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,030
- Who? 
 - Oh!

719
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:56,260
Say your greetings. Our savior, who will manage Tea Party's style and outfit from now on.

720
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:02,880
You don't need to greet me. Instead, can you show me what you were doing from the beginning?

721
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,050
It was this, right?

722
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,090

723
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,490
Okay, the deliberations finished at a go.

724
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,510
Next is...

725
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,460
It's Tea Party. Their songs are really good.

726
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,600
Please listen to it.

727
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,790
Yes.

728
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,970
We will listen to it.

729
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,820
Thank you.

730
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,700
Hyung-nim.

731
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:06,940
Face time? You had a free pass before with Shax.

732
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:12,720
Tell me about it. I did not know it was this difficult to get a spot for a rookie.

733
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,560
Did you get a lot of spots?

734
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,620
Four?

735
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,580
Makes me remember the past.

736
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,520
JH Entertainment can come in.

737
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,760
Ah, yes!

738
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,820
I'm going to go.

739
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,980
Hyung, you will do well!

740
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,880
Fighting!

741
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,320
This is Tea Party.

742
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,780
Tea Party...

743
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,230

744
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,510
finally have their first single (album) out.

745
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,360
I even have the video here.

746
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,250
Please take a look.

747
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,660
They look cute.

748
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,540
♫  I’m sorry, I’m a little busy  ♫

749
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,140
Here you are.

750
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,610
We will eat well!

751
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,320
I will eat well.

752
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,620
But... you guys will have to stand on stage soon. Is ramen okay?

753
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,920
Since you weren't here, we starved all day.

754
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,120
We practiced all day long, so it doesn't matter.

755
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,950
Well, we might as well.

756
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,690
But we got a date.

757
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,790
When?

758
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:33,960
In two weeks.

759
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,790
You let your guard down, Shim Hyun Ji!

760
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,550
Why are you telling us now?

761
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,800
I will leave first.

762
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,430
Ramen tastes the best when it's eaten on time.

763
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,910
Aren't you eating?

764
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,580
Just wait a little more.

765
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,450
Ma Ha's going!

766
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:23,680
We are really, really going this time!

767
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:33,610
Yoo Jin.

768
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,480
Congratulations, Lee Ma Ha.

769
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,970
And we are standing on the same stage on the same day.

770
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,980
Really?

771
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,720
Ma Ha, let's eat up the stage together.

772
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,820
Yes, let's eat it up!

773
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,170
So that we can stand on the same stage on the same day,

774
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,550
I always prayed.

775
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,920

776
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,100
Let's greet them.

777
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,380
1, 2, 3.

778
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,450
Hello! We are Tea Party who's always happy.

779
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,810
Let's go.

780
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,690
 Hey, Yoo Jin!

781
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,600
Ma Ha!

782
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,070
We are finally meeting here.

783
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,880
A day like this really did come.

784
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,160
Congratulations really!

785
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,990
You too.

786
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,030
 1, 2, 3!

787
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,940

788
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:06,110

789
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,050
I'm late.

790
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,100

791
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,380

792
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,120
First time auditioning?

793
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,210

794
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,560
I was like that at first.

795
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,180
If you keep doing it, you will get used to it quickly.

796
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,010
Fighting!

797
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:01,770
Excuse me—

798
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:05,080
Lee Ma Ha.

799
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,570

800
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,150
 We need to reduce their single's time.

801
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:13,190
 How can you do this suddenly?

802
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,790
 How do we prepare a 2-min performance right away?

803
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,650
 Making a clamor three years ago in Mescom must have been easy.

804
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:24,050
 How many years has it been since your debut? Who do you think will decide whether they will go on stage, them or the company?

805
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:25,390
 Oh, so cool!

806
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:28,170
 But I am worried because Kwon Ryuk is the main actor.

807
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,550
 You will be in a lot of trouble if the CEO comes to know about this.

808
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,230
 What will bring you into trouble if I come to know it?

809
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,600
 She is still new. Please take care of her.

810
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,650
 Don't think like that.

811
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,860
