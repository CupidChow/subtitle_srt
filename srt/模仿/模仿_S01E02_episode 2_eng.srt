1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,780

2
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,110

3
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,270

4
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,860
Sorry to bother you, but how can I get to town from here?

5
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,200
It's a bit far.

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,320
You need to head straight that way.

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,660
Thank you.

8
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,290
Thank you for your hard work today.

9
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,110
- Thank you for your hard work today. 
 - Goodbye.

10
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,630
You met a bad owner, and now you're suffering, too.

11
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Let's go.

12
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,720
See you tomorrow.

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,630
Okay, see you tomorrow.

14
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,160
Everybody always leaves work so quickly.

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,590
- Hyung. 
 - What?

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,180
The number got leaked again.

17
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,760
It hasn't even been six months.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm tired.

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,570
I'll buy you a new one. Let's go.

20
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,290
You need to rest up for your interview tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,010
- Thank you. 
 - Get in.

22
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,630
Okay.

23
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,450
Put on your seatbelt, Ryeok.

24
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,280
What's that?

25
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,850
Hyung, what was that just now?

26
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,770
I heard there are a lot of ghosts around here.

27
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,040
What kind of ghosts?

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
You get out and check. Go, quickly.

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
You're the manager, Hyung.

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,510
Ryeok! You make more money than me.

31
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,140
Quick, check now.

32
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,900
What? Is something there?

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,290
I don't see anything.

34
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,840
Really?

35
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,350
Why? Why?!

36
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,600
There is something.

37
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,960
- It's that kid. 
 - What are you saying?

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,620
The kisaeng you stabbed to death today!

39
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,590
I heard that a manager ran off without his actor. Was that her manager?

40
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,600
What are you talking about?

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,570
The manager ran away.

42
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,460
I've heard of managers leaving their van and abandoning a nutcase actor,

43
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,840
but a manager taking the van with him is a first.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,400
Hyung.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,170
Back up.

46
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,790
- To give her a ride? We can't! 
 - Why not?

47
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,170
You know the company policy. No.

48
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,680
Hyung.

49
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,650
Hello.

50
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,730
- Get in. 
 - What?

51
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,580
Oh, I am fine.

52
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,190
The town is just over that hill.  It won't take long.

53
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,060
Right, so get in.

54
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm in the industry, too. I know you can't just let people into the van.

55
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,880
I don't want to complicate matters for you over such a small thing.

56
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,650
Thank you so much for the offer.

57
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,810
Goodbye.

58
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,880
You might be fine now, but you'll catch a cold once the sweat dries!

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,510
If you're doing this

60
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,490
because of what happened before, you really don't need to be concerned.

61
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,930
I just want to take a walk, so you should go your way, too.

62
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,780
Try hard.

63
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,370
What, did he know?

64
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,700
It's cold!

65
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,890
 Do you know Stevie Wonder?

66
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,980
 "I Just Called to Say I Love You."

67
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,330
 He's my dad's favorite singer.

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,940
 We saw Stevie Wonder on TV once.

69
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,390
 He's blind, but he writes music and sings.

70
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,290
 On that show, he said,

71
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,530
 "We all have our abilities.

72
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,890
 The only difference is that

73
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,390
 some people use those abilities, and some don't."

74
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,740
 My dad heard that and said to me,

75
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,550
 "Ma Ha,

76
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,010
 I hope you live like him."

77
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,210
 So that's why you suddenly showed up and asked to join our team?

78
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,910
 Yes.

79
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,780
 That's why I want to move to Seoul.

80
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,420
 I don't think he'd let you do that.

81
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,560
 Dad, you'll let me, right?

82
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,690
 You can't really see the stars in Seoul,

83
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,010
 because of all the lights.

84
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,400
 That's kind of lame.

85
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,010
There are so many stars.

86
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,360
How long have you known?

87
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,660
Since you started avoiding me.

88
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,510
No, I wasn't avoiding youâ€”

89
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,970
Keep following behind me.

90
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Okay.

91
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,850
If anything seems off, Hyung will race over here.

92
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,660
This is me.

93
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,300
It's still cold.

94
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,560
Is this really where you needed to go?

95
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes, I know where to go from here.

96
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,670
My friend is coming.

97
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,790
You might as well have given her a ride.

98
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,690
She didn't want to, and there's the company policy, too.

99
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,900
You know I always follow the company's orders.

100
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,920
Never mind.

101
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,610
 Idiot!

102
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,560
- Hyung. 
 - Yes?

103
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,930
- Let's slow down a little. 
 - Okay.

104
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,110
What is that?

105
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,670
Lee Ma Ha!

106
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,890
Oh, so there was a reason.

107
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,540
What happened?

108
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,670
- Lee Yoo Jin? 
 - Are you hurt anywhere?

109
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,120
No, I am not, but what are you doing here?

110
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,900
That's a relief.

111
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,930
Hyung, I am tired.

112
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,790
- Let's go quickly. 
 - Okay.

113
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,550
Why did you come?

114
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,230
 Hello, Yoo Jin? I can't reach Ma Ha.

115
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,920
 She may be in the middle of filming. Maybe she did not see it.

116
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,800
 I cannot get a hold of her manager either. It's just weird. Nothing's wrong, right?

117
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,780
 Hang up for now.

118
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,490

119
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,130

120
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,900

121
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,600
 A movie shoot just came up, so I'm on my way to Mungyeong.

122
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,990
Were you that worried about me?

123
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,590
I can only rely on my friend.

124
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,730
- My soulmate. 
 - It's so far.

125
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,460
How could you walk around there by yourself at night?

126
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,690
I just ran.

127
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,130
The wind was nice and it felt good.

128
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,770
And there were a lot of stars.

129
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,600
Did you not have even one person to ride back with?

130
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,100
There was...

131
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,960
But I thought I wouldn't be comfortable riding in that car.

132
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,530
I really feel comfortable with you, Yu Jin.

133
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,600
Anyway, what's wrong with your manager?

134
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,930
How could he just leave you by yourself and run away?

135
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,660
Report him right away! You should not let people like him off the hook.

136
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,730
He may cause trouble elsewhere.

137
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,100
Nevermind. I was the one who held onto him.

138
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,080
And he's not that bad a person.

139
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,770
He must be feeling very sorry right now.

140
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,900
Hey, but what are you going to do if you are found out?

141
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,870
It's fine.

142
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,230
Just sleep. You must be tired.

143
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,150
Shall I?

144
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,560

145
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,730
Shax?

146
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,360
When did we arrive? You should have woken me up.

147
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,560
Hyun Ji, you're here, too.

148
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,900
They said they could not get in touch with you, so I was worried.

149
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,530
Are you all right?

150
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,040
Yes, I am fine.

151
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,900
Yu Jin, you are going to be late. Go back quickly!

152
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,960
Okay, you worked really hard. Just rest up.

153
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay.

154
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,990
Thank you so much, and drive carefully on your way back.

155
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,830
Go safely.

156
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,110
Let's go.

157
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,110
Where did you go all night after stealing your manager's car?

158
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,990
- I'm sorry. 
 - I don't care that you are sorry. Just tell me where you were!

159
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,140
Did you go see a girl?

160
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,120
Wow, that silence seems to be agreement.

161
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,370
Why? Do you think you can just go out like that because we don't have any fans coming to see us?!

162
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,860
Do you think the others are stuck here because they have nowhere else to be?!

163
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,370
I won't ever do anything like this again. I am sorry.

164
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,970
You, get a grip on yourself.

165
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,870
Do you or do you not know that we have to risk everything for our comeback this time?

166
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,100
If we don't get good results this time, I don't know what will happen to Sparkling.

167
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,470
Let's just go in now. Head in.

168
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,870
- Hyun Oh, you should also stop. 
 - That bastard.

169
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,690
He pretends to be obedient all by himself.

170
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,500
But where did he really go?

171
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,430
Weren't you scared?

172
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,960
I told you, right?

173
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,760
That guy reeks of betrayal just by looking at his profile.

174
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,380
You also should have stormed out like us earlier.

175
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,350
I knew from the beginning that this would be a hit or miss.

176
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,230
Did you do it despite knowing that?

177
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,570
Just...

178
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,160
I just wanted to hold onto that thread tightly.

179
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,330
I felt like I would lose it forever if I did not hold on to it.

180
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,940
I can't believe that he just left someone at the filming site and ran away.

181
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,420
While coming down the mountain,

182
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,160
do you know what I was sad about and scared of the most?

183
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,780
That the thread I was barely holding onto...

184
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,370
got severed again.

185
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,970
I finally realized my place.

186
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,770
That place that I had dreamed of

187
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,020
showed up so close as if I could catch it.

188
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,640
But I could not get any closer to it.

189
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,050
I kept on turning back for some reason.

190
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,610
So I felt worse.

191
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,050
I think this is it.

192
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,950
I decided while I was on my way back.

193
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,960
I am going to let go of my dream now.

194
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,180
I think I did everything I could do.

195
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,590
I want to prepare for the GED (qualification examination).

196
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,820
- Ma Ha! 
 - Hey!

197
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,780
We are twenty-two right now.

198
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,010
We may be treated as old goods as idols,

199
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,830
but we are actually still young elsewhere.

200
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,850
We can start from scratch again.

201
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,490
True.

202
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,380
Let's quit together.

203
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,420
Lia, why do want to quit?

204
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,820
I worked part time, singing at a festival yesterday.

205
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,430
I was sad for no reason. Reality hit me suddenly.

206
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,410
When I was young,

207
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,380
I went from this house to that house,

208
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,830
singing songs at every party in our neighborhood.

209
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,240
And until now, I was still singing at someone else's party.

210
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,990
I wondered if I worked that hard to be doing this now. I was so ashamed.

211
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,520
True, I am going to quit, too.

212
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,570
I heard people say I was pretty since I was little.

213
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,000
So I thought I was actually pretty,

214
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,460
but there were goddesses (pretty women) everywhere.

215
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,690
I guess the time when I acted all high and mighty because of that,

216
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,790
was the end of my golden years.

217
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,920
And I don't even have talent like you guys.

218
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,310
Why are saying that?

219
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,480
Don't, stop it.

220
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,270
70,080 hours,

221
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,190
2,920 days,

222
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,580
and eight years.

223
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,430
I am so tired of it all.

224
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,230
Yes, let's start again from tomorrow!

225
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,100
Reboot!

226
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,390
 We are Shax.

227
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,320
 Hello. Nice to meet you.

228
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,510
Mr. Kwon Ryeok, are you filming a new historical movie?

229
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,030
Yes, I had a lot of worries, as this is the first historical movie I filmed.

230
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,690
So with a rookie mindset,

231
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,080
I am practicing hard and putting my all into the filming.

232
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,800
I am curious about what kind of new look you will show.

233
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Please visit the movie theatre and see that for yourself.

234
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,370
Then finally, please tell us how you feel about Shax's sixth anniversary.

235
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,000
I will comment first, as I am already talking.

236
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,940
When we are separate, we are lacking and full of flaws,

237
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,080
but when we are together, we fill in the gaps and we can last for the next 10 or 20 years...

238
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,040
No,

239
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,270
I wish we can be a group until we die.

240
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,350
Wasn't Shax originally a group of six?

241
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,450
There are many people who are still curious about Eun Jo...

242
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,670
Is there no possibility of Eun Jo coming back?

243
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,570
Please only ask from the list of confirmed questions.

244
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,220
Kwon Ryeok and Eun Jo were the closest, right? Do you not keep in touch?

245
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,790
Let's call it a day. Good job.

246
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,900
 Thank you.

247
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,750
Good job!

248
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,030

249
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,630
Alcohol must be drunk with comfortable people.

250
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,010
The alcohol even tastes sweet today.

251
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,670
It's Sparkling, right? Your group?

252
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,690
I heard they're being talked about a bit now.

253
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,280
Just being talked about isn't all that great.

254
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,440
If they can't release a hit song three years after their debut, they're out.

255
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,590

256
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,150
Are you going to move again?

257
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,820
You've got an amazing song ready, right?

258
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,000
Or did you find an investor?

259
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,740
What happened to the Fact Check people? They're doing things they didn't do before.

260
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,900
They're probably doing that because our group is very quiet and they need some useful sources for their article.

261
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,740
They don't think of working hard on their own.

262
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll try to find something that will make a good article.

263
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,980
- How about Ryeok? 
 - He completed his schedule and went to his dorm.

264
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,670
He received treatment, and three years have passed, so it's probably better by now.

265
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,060
You should still be careful. He may break down all at once.

266
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,700
Ryeok is putting food on the table for us right now.

267
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Yes, sir.

268
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,540
 Shax! Shax! Shax!

269
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,630

270
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,340
 Eun Jo!

271
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,000
Eun Jo!

272
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,130
Eun Jo!

273
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,350
Eun Jo!

274
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,390

275
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,690
I thought so.

276
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,480
You're feeling sorry now.

277
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,140
Yes, thank you.

278
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,320
Have a nice day.

279
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,810

280
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,110

281
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,250
Hello!

282
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,380
Ah, yes. I see.

283
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes. I'm sorry. Yes.

284
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,260

285
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Hello!

286
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,100
I am Lee Ma Ha, but

287
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm not interested.

288
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,860
Yes. Sorry!

289
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,570
God! This damn voice phishing!

290
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,270

291
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,320
I'm back.

292
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,510
What about your cram school?

293
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,070
What's with your hair?

294
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,690
Is it pretty?

295
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,790
I just listened to the cram school's options today.

296
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,810
But earlier, I received a weird call.

297
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,480
JH Entertainment, the CEO's name was...

298
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,730
Ji Hak!

299
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,960
- That's right. Ji Hak. Did you also get that call? 
 - Yes.

300
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,510
It must be a scammer.

301
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,280
I asked him how he knew about me, and he asked me to come for an audition.

302
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,260
Lia, you too?

303
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,090
There are all kinds of people!

304
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,810
I'm angry now!

305
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,650
Is it really voice phishing.

306
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,790

307
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,080

308
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,810
â™«  Hakuna Matata yo  â™«

309
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,360
 - Hi, Yoo Jin.  
 - Hey, Ma Ha. It has been a long time.

310
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,100
Get your senses together!

311
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,200
I'm sorry.

312
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,990
 Oh, Manager Tae Geun!

313
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,480
Have you been well?

314
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,200
I have been, but Yoo Jin is practicing the choreography now.

315
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,810
Then I will call back later.

316
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,440
If saying you'll call back later, means you can't tell me, then

317
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,330
don't call again.

318
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,310
 Pardon?  Ok.

319
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,980
Did you not get a call from Ji Hak?

320
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,010
Okay. Thank you.

321
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,780
Why? Did the manager pick up?

322
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,960
It must be because of last time.

323
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,950
But about that scammer...

324
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,110
It seems he isn't a scammer. He was a manager at NOG.

325
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,030
NOG?

326
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,620

327
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,230

328
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,590

329
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,850
Do they hold the audition in a cafÃ©?

330
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:13,410
He must be a scammer, just lying about NOG and Shax.

331
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,280
But we still came all the way,

332
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,890
shall we just go in?

333
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,990
I'm going in because you are pitiful.

334
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,360
If not, let's just have some tea.

335
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,390
Let's go.

336
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,910
You've come.

337
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,920
The one in the middle is Lee Ma Ha?

338
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
Yoo Lia?

339
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,170
And Shim Hyun Ji.

340
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,730
Yes, you're right.

341
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,790
Nice to meet you.

342
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:15,510
I am JH entertainment's CEO and the owner of this cafe, Ji Hak.

343
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,050
Since you're all here, can we start once you're ready?

344
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:25,860
Can we perform together?

345
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,960
The audition is just an excuse. We came to make a memory.

346
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,840
We want to make a memory to remember.

347
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,520
Ah, is that so?

348
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,720
It may be a bit embarrassing butâ€“

349
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,810
It is our first time.

350
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,230
Us three performing together.

351
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,690
We were actually one team before.

352
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,320
I know that you debuted as a three-member girl groupâ€”Omega 3.

353
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,870
We didn't debut. We were close to it.

354
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,990
There was an accident the day we were supposed to debut.

355
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,780
That you were forced to go down when you were doing your rehearsal for the music show?

356
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,920
Yes, I know that too.

357
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,880
It's become so difficult to put young people out there.

358
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,840
What will you do bringing together older kids who have nowhere else to go?

359
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,300
With your profile and eyes for singling out talent,

360
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,850
"I am Ji Hak from NOG. I am Ji Hak from Shax."

361
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,450
It was thanks to the title. It was not me.

362
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,610

363
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:38,290
She was a trainee and got cut without even debuting.

364
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,220

365
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,360
She sings someone else's song on someone else's stage.

366
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,850

367
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,560
She does cheap events and has not been able to do any proper activity.

368
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,320
Kids who have fallen to the very bottom, with a debut that never came to fruition.

369
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,500
Stories like these work these days.

370
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,060
Even you know that their capability fills just a page.

371
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,860
Not obviously practiced smiles... but barefaced kids.

372
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,880
And after that,

373
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,320
I will draw attention to them with a completely different method quickly.

374
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,600
It's not much of a stage, but go ahead and make your memories.

375
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,580
The three of you, as much as you want.

376
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,750
â™«  OMEGA III  â™«

377
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,840
â™«  You're for me baby. You make my heart tremble  â™«

378
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,100
â™«  Oh my  â™«

379
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,610
â™«  You make my heart beat  â™«

380
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,890
â™«  I know it boy  â™«

381
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,950
â™«  Youâ€™re so perfect, youâ€™re my ideal man  â™«

382
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,920
â™«  You make my eyes are filled with hearts  â™«

383
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,110
â™«   Youâ€™re the love Iâ€™ve been waiting for  â™«

384
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,310
â™«  Your whispers make me fall in love  â™«

385
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,220
â™«  All day   â™«

386
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,680
â™«  I keep looking at the phone   â™«

387
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:24,220
â™«  Again and again, You make my heart trouble me  â™«

388
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,570
â™«  I want to hear you, my boy. I want to hear your sweet voice   â™«

389
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,410
â™«  When I hear your voice, I melt for you, ring my bell  â™«

390
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,800
â™«  Whenever Iâ€™m by your side, Iâ€™m so happy, itâ€™s amazing   â™«

391
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,810
- You worked really hard. 
 - Thanks for the performance.

392
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,670
Thank you!

393
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:58,560
If you three are okay with it, I want to work with you.

394
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,450
 What?

395
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,140
Is something wrong with him?

396
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,660
I am scared because this opportunity came without a single warning.

397
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,790
Is the role of an entertainment agency CEO,

398
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,250
one where you can have two jobs wearing an apron and serving in the neighborhood coffee shop?

399
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,340
True, it does not look like he has any part-timers either.

400
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,620
Yeah, that means that he has no money, right?

401
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,650
But when we were auditioning,

402
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,820
there was something in the way his eyes looked.

403
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,130
That I acknowledge.

404
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,910
But did you all fall for it?

405
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,880
What do you mean?

406
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,790
I cut my hair too.

407
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,930
My indomitable will!

408
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,280
Anyway, we are not going to do it. Shall we have fun putting forth some tough conditions for the contract?

409
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,140
The fantasy of the underdog?

410
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,320
Well, because you want us to work together...

411
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,460
We will put forth our condition.

412
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,650
This is the contract proposed by me.

413
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,550

414
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,220
 1,822,480 won (about 1,618 dollars)

415
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,360
Will you give us a salary?

416
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,690
At the same time when entering into a contract with us?

417
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,120
Does this make sense?

418
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,350
It's the minimum hourly wage right now,

419
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,960
but after we make a profit from your activities, I will distribute it according to what is written in the contract.

420
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
That does not make any sense.

421
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,450
Are you a fraud or something?

422
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,040
Will a fraud own up saying he is one?

423
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,030
You don't want us to do something weird, right?

424
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,440
"If Party A makes unreasonable requests not stated in the contract,

425
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,090
Party B is entitled to get compensated for breach of contract."

426
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:03,280
Are there really no restrictions on using smartphones, going out, or dating?

427
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,160
I am sure you all know they are things you can't really prevent even if you try to.

428
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,700
But actions have to have consequences.

429
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,180
You just have to be responsible for your actions.

430
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
Just a minute.

431
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,620
Welcome. Please come in.

432
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,520
Follow me out.

433
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,580
We wanted act tough...

434
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,120
He was tougher, and everything made sense!

435
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,620
What shall we do?

436
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,350
I am really tempted.

437
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,470
Even so, does this make sense?

438
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,820
It's just that we have heard clauses like this for the first time. But it does make sense.

439
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,320
Apparently, celebrities are paid salaries in Japan.

440
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,760
But we have seen a lot of kids having a hard time after signing a bad contract.

441
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,060
The contract period is one year.

442
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,110
I only have that much to pay you salaries.

443
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,600
And if you don't see any hope after this time, we can break off the contract without any repercussions.

444
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,320
What if we do well?

445
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,700
Then we have to redraw the contract, coming to an understanding of each other's conditions.

446
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,460
Of course, only when both parties want to.

447
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,560
 Excuse me!

448
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,720
Yes, I am coming.

449
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,150
It's just a year.

450
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,360
Exactly one year.

451
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,220
I want to prolong my dream for another year.

452
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,660
Let's take a risk and do it for exactly another year.

453
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,290
Anyway, we have nothing to lose.

454
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:47,430
Yes, let's do it.

455
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,580
As someone who said that they have nothing left to lose,

456
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,140
let's trust each other and do this.

457
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,660
Then what shall we begin with?

458
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,150
You did not read the contract in detail.

459
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,760
The contract period starts tomorrow.

460
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,180
Go rest up at home because we will be busy from now on.

461
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,300
Thanks for the tea.

462
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,370
- Thanks for the tea. 
 - Sure.

463
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,730
We are starting again from tomorrow on.

464
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,980
Don't we need a new team name too?

465
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,390
 To new beginnings.

466
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,620
What would sound nice?

467
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,360
It is hot!

468
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,760
Be careful. Drink it slowly.

469
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,020
 Tea Party!

470
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,980
It's Tea Party when you say it from the beginning,

471
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,360
and Tea Party when you say it backward!

472
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,690
Hello! We are always happy,

473
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,110
Tea party!

474
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,160
 Tea Party said from the front and back.

475
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,590
 Hello, we are always happy, Tea party!

476
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,720

477
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,080

478
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,020

479
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,010
When did you prepare all this?

480
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,320
This totally reminds you of the old days, doesn't it?

481
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,080
If we get the song, decide on a concept, practice the choreography and prepare for our debut,

482
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,290
we have to live here for about six months.

483
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,050
We will have you debut at the earliest.

484
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,260
But we don't have a song yet.

485
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,500
You have a team name, don't you? 'Tea Party'.

486
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,900
The first broadcast may happen this week.

487
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,580
Why not just ask us to take down a mugger and appear on the news for that?

488
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,590
Well, that works too.

489
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,940
Our concept is 'complete reality.'

490
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,390
Just who you actually are.

491
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,900
Contract?

492
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,490
Hey, Ji Hak! It has been a long time.

493
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,570
It hasn't changed at all here.

494
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:53,320
I thought you emigrated because there was no news about you.

495
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,900
Did you make a comeback?

496
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,620
I barely made a three-member girl group.

497
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:04,530
Hey, the program that you are doing was good with strong questions.

498
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:09,360
You even monitored it because you're my friend. Thank you!

499
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,880
Let me ask you a favor.

500
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:17,890
I'm a PD now. I can't help you like before.

501
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,350
Look at this just once. Look at it and then tell me.

502
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,610
What is it?

503
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,420
Look at it.

504
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,540
Idol who gets a monthly salary?

505
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,260
They're still idols, so they should at least release a song before they appear on TV.

506
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,830
I told you that the concept is 'Complete Reality'.

507
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,560
First, let Tea Party get the attention.

508
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,500
Then their song will follow.

509
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,990
Gather a list of company's that can be taken over easily.

510
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,040
You know, right? That the women in our company are weaker?

511
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,860
Yes.

512
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,330
Good.

513
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,930
They say Ji Hak is back.

514
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,650
Learning is stealing?

515
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,910
Is there anything else he knows to do?

516
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,400
Shall I look into it?

517
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,190
Let it be.

518
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,290
It must be hard so he must have just collected people who do events.

519
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,930
- You may leave. 
 - Yes, sir.

520
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,280
Ji Hak?

521
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,250
CEO! CEO!

522
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,350
You didn't even explain to us what kind of show it is.

523
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,120
What should we do if you just drag us into a show?

524
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,690
We haven't prepared anything!

525
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:46,820

526
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,460
This is the long-awaited first stage of Tea Party with the three of you.

527
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,530

528
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,720
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to. I'm not forcing you.

529
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,580
But if you go out now... you can't come back.

530
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,860
Sisa People, where we interview the hottest people!

531
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,660
Today we have a special idol group who

532
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:41,840
are debuting through this live broadcast instead of a music show.

533
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,070
Please introduce yourself.

534
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,520
One, two, three!

535
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,350
Hello! We are always happy, Tea Party.

536
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,890
We are leader Lia,

537
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,180
Hyun Ji,

538
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
and Ma Ha.

539
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,720
Even your introduction is refreshing.

540
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,750
Please take care of it.

541
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,850
Likewise.

542
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,130
Thank you.

543
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,270
See you later.

544
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,980

545
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,960
- You did a good job. 
 - You too.

546
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,050
What's the next schedule?

547
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,400
That's all for today. I will get the car so wait a bit.

548
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,560
Let's go together.

549
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,800
Come quickly.

550
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,730
 We get a monthly salary.

551
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,750
 When I was a trainee I had more than one part-time job.

552
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,400
 We had to do many part-time jobs when we were trainees.

553
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,390
 Singing at weddings, working at shops, and even doing deliveries.

554
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,040
It's nice that we don't have to do all that and that we can just practice.

555
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,790
 If it's not rude of me, can you tell us about your salary?

556
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,820
It is â‚©1,822,480 (around 1,822 dollars).

557
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,350
It's minimum wage.

558
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,930
Isn't it the first time that there is such a contract?

559
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,320
Actually, people don't talk about this but the money invested in trainees

560
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,650
is also counted as debt in many places.

561
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,990
My friend has a debt of one million won, so even though she debuted three years ago,

562
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,590
she hasn't been able to get paid.

563
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:55,220
This system seems to have its merits and demerits. I am curious.

564
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,220
Who is this CEO that made such a crazy contract?

565
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,590
Does he have a lot of money?

566
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:07,060
No. Our CEO is definitely not rich.

567
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,530
I saw the loan documents.

568
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,520
We have to do well before we get all the money.

569
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,930
Fighting!

570
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,010
I really want to encourage you.

571
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,910
I really hope you succeed.

572
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,070
Thank you. Thank you.

573
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,260
Shall we change the mood?

574
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:27,820
Nowadays, Idol groups all have personal talents.

575
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,350
Can you show us your personal talents?

576
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,910
Yes, I will go first.

577
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,610
â™ª I'm a cold woman â™ª

578
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,050
â™ª So don't swear at me â™ª

579
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,100
If you did more, I would have sworn at you that you are a cold woman.

580
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,350
Thank you.

581
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,110
It is really refreshing. Wow!

582
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:50,870
Then the next person.

583
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:54,680
I don't have a personal talent so...  Ta da!

584
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,690
 Oh, you're the visual and the center.

585
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,470
 It is really lovely.

586
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,900
 Then lastly, Ma Ha?

587
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:07,850
 I will perform a sing-along song that I performed at a small village festival.

588
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,120
 - I need a moment to get ready. 
 - Oh, sure.

589
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,980
What are you looking at?

590
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,380
 I am La Ri Ma's sister.

591
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,290
 La Ri Ma Ha!

592
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,610
Are you looking at it because she's like me?

593
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,310
Just look at me then. Why look at a fake?

594
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,400
What's up?

595
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,650
The same as you.

596
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,990
"Idol Outing"?

597
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,520
I got you this gig.

598
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,050
If I don't do this, will I even get to look at your face?

599
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,480
Then I will see you during the recording.

600
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,590
What? Are you just going?

601
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,680
â™«  I donâ€™t want an awkward relationship  â™«

602
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,370
I have a full schedule today. Bye.

603
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,580
â™«  Donâ€™t think so much.  â™«

604
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,860
â™«  Donâ€™t get confused  â™«

605
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,100
 It was Tea Party's Ma Ha!

606
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,960
Annoying!

607
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,080
This small girl!

608
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,820
What the hell did we do?

609
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,150
I don't remeber.

610
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,380
I couldn't even talk. I only laughed.

611
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,200
Grandma? Did you see it?

612
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,620
Did all of you gather and watch it?

613
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,760

614
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,600

615
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,720

616
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,740

617
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,070
Ma Ha, my mom said that I worked really hard.

618
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,860
I keep crying. My makeup is about to go bad.

619
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,720
I want to get emotional, too.

620
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,270

621
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,060
Expect? As if.

622
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,360
 New message

623
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,680
 New message

624
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,750
 New message

625
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,910
 New message

626
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,940
Hey!

627
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,160
What is happening?

628
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,340
(Ringtone: you have a new message answer quickly)

629
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,030
Seems like many people saw it.

630
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:16,190
- Another one. 
 - What?

631
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,910
Another.

632
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,050
Another.

633
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,330
Tea Party!

634
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,790
Shall we go?

635
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,850
Yes, sir.

636
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,930

637
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,360

638
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,460

639
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,730

640
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,330
What is this? This is nuts.

641
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,350
It is Tea Party, a group that's slowly becoming hot.

642
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,120
Shall we also cast them once?

643
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,180
Isn't it just word of mouth right now?

644
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,000
They have a story and have good characters as well.

645
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,520
I think they could ride this wave at least a month with that imitation of La Ri Ma.

646
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,610
Maybe we can cast them because they're becoming hot.

647
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,220
How can a La Ri Ma knockoff come looking like this?

648
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,390
I'm Tea Party'sâ€“

649
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,730
- Hey! We have a wig, right? 
 - Yes.

650
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,390

651
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,360

652
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,090

653
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,150
Three years ago and now,

654
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,780
appearance fees haven't changed at all.

655
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,980
But still, you did your best.

656
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,790
So how much did we earn?

657
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,390
What?

658
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,460
That isâ€“

659
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,330
Oh, how much is it?

660
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,940
Your debut broadcast at Sisa People earned 187,600 won  ($166) .

661
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,300
Because 6 p.m. Hometown was filmed in the countryside, 288,600 won.

662
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,890
He and I was also filmed in the countryside, so 252,000 won.

663
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,620
Can you give us a salary if we earn this much?

664
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,290
We should do events to earn money.

665
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,100
"Why does she keep copying La Ri Ma?"

666
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:49,240
"Someone who goes by other artist's songs, you're just a copycat."

667
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,390
Ah, seriously!

668
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,410
If it's going to bother you, don't look at it.

669
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,290
I'm looking at it because it bothers me.

670
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:01,570
At first, everyone said it was fun.

671
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,590
Are you going to speak casually from now on?

672
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,520
They keep calling us "copy-idols." It is impossible not to look at them.

673
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
If you don't have the confidence to not look at them, why don't you study the mean comments?

674
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,690
Look at the mean comments and the things you cannot change with your will and actions, disregard them.

675
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,430
The things you can change with your will and actions, go and fix them.

676
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,950
Lastly, collect the remaining trash comments that don't belong anywhere, and report them.

677
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,850
Okay?

678
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,380
We understand.

679
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,770
One of these can really hurt your self-esteem.

680
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,900
"They don't even have their own song. What are they doing there?"

681
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,810
I think so, too.

682
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,440
This is JH entertainment's Ji Hak.

683
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,720
"Idol Outing"?

684
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,120
"Idol Outing"?

685
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,080
"Idol Outing"!

686
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,890
Yes, I understand.

687
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,550
Yes.

688
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,720
Yes, thank you.

689
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,950
Thank you.

690
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,050
What is it, are we going on the show "Idol Outing"?

691
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,110
Awesome!

692
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,420
Oh my gosh, next week's lineup is amazing. Even Shax is on it!

693
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,960
Awesome!

694
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,650
But what do we do?

695
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,910
Only Ma Ha is appearing on it.

696
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,490
Congrats.

697
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,730
Fighting!

698
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,020
Go do great.

699
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,950
"Idol Outing" will be our last schedule before working on your first single album.

700
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,900
 Working on a single album?

701
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:53,570
The songs I requested from the publisher are coming out soon.

702
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,620
Awesome!

703
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:59,310
Hello, I'm Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party!

704
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:03,350
Hello, I'm Tea Party's Lee Ma Ha!

705
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,670
There's nothing to be nervous about.

706
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,380
Since it's the first time don't get greedy. Think before you act.

707
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:13,020
If they ask you to do anything, don't decline and do it well.

708
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,870
Since I came as Tea Party's representative for today, I'll work hard.

709
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,560
Yes, Chief.

710
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,080
Just a moment.

711
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,290
Ma Ha, since everyone is a senior to you here, make sure you introduce yourself to everyone well.

712
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,940
Just a minute.

713
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,630
Yes, Chief.

714
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,480
Yes, yes.

715
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,590
Hello, I'm Tea Party's Lee Ma Ha!

716
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,870
Hello, I'm Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party!

717
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,890
Hello, I'm Tea Party's Lee Ma Ha!

718
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:43,160
It's La Ri Ma!

719
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,970
She looks even more beautiful in real life.

720
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,170
It's La Ri Ma...

721
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,600
Hello, Sunbae-nim!

722
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,550
It's you then? My copycat.

723
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,770
What is this? You don't look a single bit like me.

724
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,800
Are everyone's eyes broken?

725
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,930
Miss La Ri Ma, you're here.

726
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,410
PD!

727
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,870
But is she on the show, too?

728
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,320
What?

729
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,990
You're the one who asked for her.

730
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,560
Yes.

731
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,610
Since things turned out this way, we will just have to have some fun.

732
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,710
She's my copycat. It's the first time we're coming out in the same shot.

733
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:38,210
How about coming out with the exact same make-up as me?

734
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,240
Unni.

735
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,850
You have another set of these clothes, right?

736
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,480
Yes.

737
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,950
Nice!

738
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,910
As expected, you know how to make a show.

739
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,270
It's okay, right?

740
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:57,560
Wouldn't you at least need to mimic me... to come out for a few more days?

741
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,960
Of course you should do it.

742
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,730
What are you doing? We don't have any time, move quickly!

743
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,020
Yes, sir!

744
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,590
It's Manager Ji.

745
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,860
Manager Ji?

746
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,410
He made a girl group called Tea Party, they must be making an appearance today.

747
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,610
Ryeokâ€“

748
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,660
Hyuk, let's go.

749
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:39,050
If I go out on air like this... I'll get more hate, won't I?

750
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,490
Hello, Sunbae-nim.

751
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,290
Thank you very much for last time.

752
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:07,090
I carried around the padded coat every day to give it back to you, in case I managed to meet you again one day.

753
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,350
The only thing you know how to do is to imitate La Ri Ma?

754
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,590
Pardon?

755
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:30,780
 Wouldn't you at least need to mimic me... to come out for a few more days?

756
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,960
 The only thing you know how to do is to imitate La Ri Ma?

757
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,920
Now, it's the last segment.

758
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,230
She's a newbie idol, making her first entrance at "Idol Outing."

759
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,970
I didn't even think that this person had a little sister.

760
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:14,200
La Ri Ma's little sister, Lee Ma Ha! Come out!

761
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,910
Hello. I'm La Ri Ma's little sister, Lee Ma Ha.

762
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:30,180
Today, I'll try to mimic my unni properly.

763
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,900
Play the music!

764
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,580
It's me La Ri Ma!

765
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,350
â™«  To be my lover  â™«

766
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,650
â™«  To be my lover  â™«

767
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,360
â™«  To be my lover  â™«

768
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,900
â™«  3, 2, 1 drop  â™«

769
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:04,530
â™«  Let me hold the wine, today I feel fine  â™«

770
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:08,890
â™«  Drinks and up all night, all night till dawn  â™«

771
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,940
Will you help me, Sunbae-nim?

772
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,660
She has held her hand out for help!

773
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,290
Will she grab that hand?

774
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:39,700

775
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,750
She came again.

776
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,820
It's already been one month.

777
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,090
I think she came up from the countryside.

778
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,430
I admit, she's enthusiastic.

779
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,550
Give me your number.

780
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,990
Pardon?

781
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,990
Okay.

782
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,870
Here...

783
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,610
I'll think about it by tomorrow.

784
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,020
Thank you!

785
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,080
Try hard.

786
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:52,060

787
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,070

788
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,190
 Giving her your coat, talking with her, dancing!

789
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,730
 Don't you know it's the end for you if the fans catch on?

790
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,750
 - How is it? 
 - It doesn't seem like our song.

791
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,390
 Our song. Omega III's debut song!

792
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,890
 There'll be loads of other songs. Why does it have to be that song of all songs?

793
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,400
 Because it seems like us...

794
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,720
 I want to bring it out.

795
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,550
 Why is Ma Ha trending on the search engine?

796
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:15,790
 Hey, look at this.

797
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,580
 Who got mixed up with Ryeok?

798
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,200
 JH Entertainment, Ji Hak made them.

799
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,860
 Kwon Ryeok, who thinks of his fans as laughable: expel him.

800
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,000
 Expulsion?!

801
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,200
