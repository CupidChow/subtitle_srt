1
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,480

2
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,120

3
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,550
Did you wait for a long time?

4
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,570
No.

5
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,260
It's been so long since we've seen each other, right? Like... a week?

6
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,320
Yes... I think it's been about that long.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
No wonder... I really missed you.

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:12,410

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,310
Ma Ha...

10
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,680
What is it?

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,400
What is it that you look so troubled?

12
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,060
I don't have the courage to say this to your face.

13
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,890
Let's...

14
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,480
break up.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,700
Of course, we should leave each other. Did you want to stay together all night?

16
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,090
Were we a thing?

17
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,080
It's the same for me from the beginning, fanship.

18
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,090
Fanship?

19
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,460
Even before you debuted.

20
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,130
Since it was before Fins was even created...

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,340
I am a real fan, right?

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,050
Ma Ha...

23
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,120
By imagining it, you're a dangerous person.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,820
This is not a melodrama with a sad ending.

25
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll be leaving now.

26
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,740
I'll drop you off.

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,560
♫  We must to go our separate ways  ♫

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,230
It's okay. It's okay.

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,030
 From now on, Hoobae Lee Ma Ha will support you a lot.

30
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,730
Fighting!

31
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,930
♫  I didn’t know   ♫

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,640
♫  I cry the same way a child does when he lost  ♫

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,690
♫  You looked at me and said   ♫

34
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:56,490
♫  Until the sadness fades away  ♫

35
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:03,750
♫  I’ll stay with you  ♫

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,100
♫  And if one of us  ♫

37
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,810
 Where are you? Are you not coming back?

38
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,950
Hello?

39
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,530
Hello?  Ma Ha?

40
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,870
- Yes, Lia. 
 - Where are you?

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,330
Well...

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,930
Where am I?

43
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,720
What happened? You're scaring me.

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,930
I'm almost there. I'll be home soon.

45

♫  Someday we must to part. Deep in my heart   ♫

48
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:16,070
♫  I’ll be confused  ♫

49

♫   And if one of us still doesn’t want to break up   ♫

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,900
♫  What am I gonna do if I still want you to stay with me?  ♫

51
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,560
♫  I’ve got a hunch that we’ll miss each other as the time goes by  ♫

52

53
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,630
♫  Just like I did   ♫

54
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,970
♫  The day we met  ♫

55
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,520
Why is she acting as if nothing happened?

56
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,680
Why is she so okay?

57
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,110
Why is she pretending like that?

58
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,880
It makes me feel more concerned.

59
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm going to take a shower.

60
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,920
Wait!

61
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,400
You have to take that off before you go in.

62
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,910
I'm out of it. It's one bad thing after another.

63
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,460
What is this weird feeling?

64
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,780
Where did you go that you're coming back now?

65
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,780
Do Jin, Hyuk, Lee Hyun, let's eat a late-night snack!

66
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,370
You? At this time? Late-night food?

67
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,420
On a day like this, I should try some, too.

68
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,420
Why are you doing things that you never did before? What about the diet?

69
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,740
I can just start tomorrow.

70
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,930
Eat. You told us to.

71
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,210
It's been some time since we ate together.

72
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,860
Right. It's been so long.

73
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,490
This feels a little scary.

74
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,240
It's a little excessive. Let's just eat.

75
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,900
What are you waiting for?

76
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,090
Fine. Let's eat.

77
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,970
Thank you.

78
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,370
 - Who else wants to eat chicken?  
 - Me!

79
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,090
Hyun Ji, where's the other half of your face?

80
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,350
Half of your face is gone! My face is really bloated.

81
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,720
Don't tell me... that you haven't been eating because of me?

82
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,190
Hyun Ji. Please forgive me, okay?

83
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,190
- Beautiful Hyun Ji! 
 - Stop it, you're embarrassing me.

84
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,040
I'm not going to meet him anymore.

85
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,870
I broke up with Kwon Ryeok.

86
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,470
Well, it's a bit too much to say we broke up because we didn't even see each other that often.

87
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,660
All this time, I was very inconsiderate of you guys. I'm sorry.

88
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,790
I have no more secrets now.

89
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,790
What are you doing?

90
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,020
Are you coming now and breaking up? If you guys were going to break up so easily,

91
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,500
why would you start in the first place and make us go through all of this?

92
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,570
I was worried and couldn't sleep, and what are you saying to me now?

93
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,550
What do you mean by that? Ma Ha is also having a hard time.

94
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,890
Sure. I'm sure she's having a hard time.

95
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,940
Ma Ha, you know that there are a lot of people who were hurt and going through a hard time because of you, and yet you still...

96
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,210
- What? 
 - You're only thinking about yourself.

97
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,890
Hyun Ji. This is a little overboard.

98
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,590
- Hyun Ji, I... 
 - Tea Party!

99
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,480
It's been a long time since you guys had a group schedule.

100
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,000
Will you guys be okay?

101
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,390
Of course.

102
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,710
We must let them see us more often so that they invite us to perform on the MML.

103
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,290
I have the car ready for you.

104
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,230
Aren't you coming, too?

105
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,880
  Hello, guys!

106
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,840
What are you doing here?

107
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,210
From today onward, I am JH Entertainment's Tea Party's manager.

108
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,890
Go Ba Hwi.

109
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,660
I didn't know our CEO was Buddha.

110
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,220
Why is he so merciful?

111
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,650
I, Go Ba Hwi, will make you, Tea Party, only walk on a flower path–

112
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,020
Flower road? How?

113
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,520
I'll have to burn myself. Fire!

114
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,950
He does speak well, though.

115
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,150
- Please take care of us. 
 - Okay, Ma Ha.

116
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,390
We're going to keep our eyes on you.

117
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,520
But what is our schedule today? The CEO also wouldn't tell us.

118
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,300
Outdoor ground photoshoot. With male idols Sparkling.

119
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,040
Sparkling?

120
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,520

121
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,430
Break time, break time.

122
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,090
Get up. Let's do it once more.

123
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,770
I'm going to die.

124
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,650
I've been tricked. I can't do this.

125
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,780
Yo, Ryeok is back.

126
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,910
He's back to normal.

127
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,370
This stubborn jerk. If you were going to be like this, why did you feed us?

128
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,620
Then do well.

129
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,940
Let's do it once more. Get up quickly.

130
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,890
He finally feels like Ryeok again.

131
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,160
Okay, let's do it once more.

132
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,250
Five, six, seven, eight.

133
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,960
 Yes, that's good. One more shot.

134
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,970
 Good, good. Looks great. Now together.

135
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,130
- Their concept must be Roly Poly. 
 - What do you mean?

136
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,820
 They got kicked out of Musicholic and still survived.

137
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,830
They survived even after being dragged down the stage.

138
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,040
 We're having a photo shoot for the first time in the three years since our debut.

139
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,820
If you're so jealous, ask them to add you as a member of Tea Party.

140
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,090
Just wait and see. They'll only have disbandment and scandals left.

141
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,030
They'll hear you.

142
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,170
- They've become celebrities. 
 - Pardon?

143
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,170
When they arrived at the set, maybe they fought,

144
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,290
and they weren't getting along.

145
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,660
But as soon as the camera turns on, they're getting along so well.

146
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,840
Their poses look natural too.

147
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,160
Yoo Jin, the couple cut is about to start, so get ready.

148
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,630
Okay.

149
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,720
 Looks really good.

150
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,360
 Move around a bit and pretend to be close.

151
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,100
 Yoo Jin and Hyun Ji, hold each other's hands affectionately.

152
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,410
 Okay, I'll take the shot.

153
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,270
 This is good. Really Good. Keep your hand natural.

154
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,400
You have a shoot. Why did you practice so hard?

155
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,830
Dae Kwon.

156
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,720
What do I have on my schedule?

157
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,670
There were a few movies that came in, but I'm still picking.

158
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,400
Give me something to do as soon as possible.

159
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,830
Let's take it one step at a time.

160
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,500
We have to do it all when we can. And it's not like you to ask me to rest.

161
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,870
Ryeok, you're not yourself, either.

162
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,950
This is how I am.

163
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,130
Oh, is this because I warmed up after a long time?

164
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,790
Energy's overflowing.

165
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,530
How can you warm up for half a day?

166
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,940
Something's going on, right?

167
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,360
Forget it and get me a schedule.

168
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,860
Is he suddenly energized?

169
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,780
There is something going on.

170
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,880
Where's Hyun Ji?

171
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,510
She went to the bathroom.

172
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,150
I can't find the right time to apologize.

173
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,300
It's my first time seeing Hyun Ji that mad.

174
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,970
Geez! You clueless girl.

175
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,010
 Hyun Ji.

176
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,670
Your hand is still cold.

177
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,970
Take this.

178
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,660
Use this when it's cold.

179
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,350
I'm sorry, Hyun Ji.

180
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,850
I made a mistake that day.

181
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,210
I didn't know how you felt. I'm really sorry.

182
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,700
You'll accept my apology, right?

183
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,250
That's a relief.

184
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,110
Is it because we already did this together?

185
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,630
You and I looked the best together.

186
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,200
I overheard the staff earlier.

187
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,940
What's your schedule for this week?

188
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,380
- Me? 
 - If you're free, do you want to meet up?

189
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,650
 Are you going to release it or not?

190
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,520
You said you'd release an album long ago.

191
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,170
You should release something so that people don't forget your face.

192
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,580
You reject everything that comes in.

193
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,900
There's nothing different, that's why.

194
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,640
La Ri Ma.

195
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,380
I climbed Mt. Halla last week, you see. For ten hours.

196
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,930
Do you how long it took me to come down after all that pain?

197
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,400
I took a few pictures and came down in fifteen minutes.

198
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,030
Your position won't last for long.

199
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,340
I know that, too.

200
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,140
If you do, release an album, and show your face on an entertainment show!

201
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,990
Okay.

202
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,080
In return, I decide what goes on the album.

203
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,550
I won't just go on any entertainment show either.

204
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,850
I will only perform in the most popular shows. Okay?

205
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,870
If you want, you can be the CEO, too.

206
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,270
I'm the boss. How does she get the say?

207
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,690
Then how's everything going?

208
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,550
Music Holic and S.J. Entertainment are closing the deal soon.

209
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,700
What about Queen Entertainment?

210
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,510
Not yet.

211
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,300
Our girls are weak, so I told you to pay attention to Queen Entertainment.

212
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,020
La Ri Ma is a bit expensive.

213
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,430
Why are you making things so difficult? Since when did we do business with money?

214
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,100
If you make the best out of a situation, the money comes in.

215
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,920
What we need is a decent title text.

216
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,030
Fix a meeting with Queen's CEO.

217
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,610
Hyun Ji.

218
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm sorry for being clueless.

219
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,820
Because my feelings were complicated,

220
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,480
I made you and Lia uncomfortable.

221
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,310
I didn't know how you felt.

222
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,730
Why are you like this suddenly?

223
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,410
You've always been worried for me.

224
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:08,530
It was my mistake not considering you because you are a close friend.

225
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,310
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

226
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,860
But there's something I need to tell you.

227
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,550
 I used to like you.

228
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,940
 Since we were trainees.

229
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,990
 Yoo Jin.

230
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,930
 You're surprised, right?

231
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,830
 What is this suddenly?

232
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,960
 I just wanted to tell you how I felt.

233
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,360
 Now I feel free.

234
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,740
 You are like a goblin.

235
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,680
 I couldn't see it because I was looking at someone for a very long time,

236
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
 but now I see.

237
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,970
 The same eyes looking at me that I had when I looked at you.

238
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,500
He rejected me as soon as he confessed. Bad jerk.

239
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,160
I couldn't tell you because I wasn't in my right mind these days.

240
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:23,080
Yoo Jin's feelings are for you now.

241
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,690
You know better than me that he's a good guy.

242
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,350
He's a warm and sincere guy.

243
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,820
Yes.

244
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,350
Hyun Ji.

245
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:47,830
Ever since I joined Omega, I wasn't lonely, thanks to you.

246
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:55,400
I was always grateful, and I'll treat you better from now on.

247
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,350
I won't get distracted and only focus on Tea Party.

248
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,190
I'm also sorry for throwing a tantrum.

249
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,980
And... thank you.

250
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,070
Ayo, B!

251
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,150
Look away and maintain distance.

252
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,410
Hey.

253
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,830
Yes?

254
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,670
 Hey!

255
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,470
Hello, Kwon Ryeok.

256
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,760
Yes. You have to be like this when there are a lot of people.

257
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,550
We're going for lunch.

258
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,710
Have you eaten yet? If not, come with us.

259
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,840
Eat what? We have to go to our meeting.

260
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,770
Today was the day of the entertainment meeting.

261
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,030
I'll get going first.

262
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,030
Do well with your shoot.

263
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,720
Good job. Don't even look at her in public.

264
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,220
- Isn't something strange? 
 - Both A and B.

265
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,910
- There's something. 
 - Something we don't know.

266
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,720
 Thank you.

267
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,070
I am more thankful.

268
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,280
I don't know what the rumors are about, but PPLs are just...

269
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,550
Of course, he's Kwon Ryeok for a reason.

270
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,050
Since things have turned out this way, let's increase the scale.

271
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,880
For real.

272
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,420
I look forward to your cooperation.

273
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,960
 Let me thank you.

274
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,380
Yes, sure.

275
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,960
It feels good to busy.

276
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,700
I told you.

277
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,140
 It's been a long time, Kwon Ryeok.

278
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,700
I thought that a couple of fools in love would be happy,

279
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,720
but I was wrong.

280
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,550
Did you fight?

281
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,790
Please lower your voice.

282
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,740
How old are you?!

283
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,270
I'm glad I got it out of the fishing grounds.

284
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,930
Hello.

285
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,100
You're here.

286
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,260
I called her.

287
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,430
Was it too much?

288
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,610
I'll be going.

289
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,890
I went overboard.

290
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,030
Tell me.

291
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,690
What?

292
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,370
"What?"

293
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,390
You two!

294
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,600
It's... It's not what you think.

295
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,340
What do you mean, it's not?

296
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,380
We decided to remain as good Sunbae-Hoobae.

297
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,560
That is... supporting each other and wishing success for one another.

298
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,050
And... and...

299
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,020
That's enough. Stop.

300
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,310
What's this?

301
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,000
You can't leave before eating all of this.

302
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,210
Eat quickly. It'll get cold.

303
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,940
Okay.

304
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,190
It's tasty.

305
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,990
Right?

306
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,590
 The coffee scent is very nice.

307
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,010
You won't kick me out now that your work has been done?

308
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,770
Of course not.

309
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,270
Oh, right, its looks like they're going to drop the charges.

310
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,590
It's all thanks to you.

311
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,880
I didn't do much.

312
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,800
You wrote the article well. Thank you.

313
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,830
I just wrote down facts as a reporter.

314
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,250
And well, I didn't write it for free.

315
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,750
I've told you before too, but if it's about Eun Jo—

316
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,430
Not the one who doesn't have the right to be forgotten.

317
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,750
It's just that he can’t forget what happened.

318
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,410
  SHAX!

319
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,470
 He’s already wearing the harness.

320
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,690
  I'm sorry Eun Jo.

321
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,910
  Annie.

322
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,050
 I deeply regret that I wasn’t with you.

323
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,890
I'm sorry.

324
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,840
Annie.

325
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:42,330
Eun Jo and Annie had been dating since they were trainees.

326
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,360
They had the same dream.

327
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,550
Eun Jo became a trainee at NOG.

328
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,430
Annie went to Omega.

329
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,940
Eun Jo debuted with SHAX and went straight to the top at.

330
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,890
And Annie

331
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,320
could not even debut.

332
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,220
But one day,

333
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,090
a picture came in with a tip-off.

334
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,510
Annie was involved in something bad.

335
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,490
Some time ago, this photo came in saying this is the reason Eun Jo's disappeared.

336
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,680
 An anonymous tip-off came in with this picture about his girlfriend.

337
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,350
 You don't even have many days left till your debut. Why the heck did—

338
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,120
 There must have been other ways.

339
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,830
 Did you have to do this?

340
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,520
 I am sorry.

341
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,290
 I am not saying this

342
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,600
 because you are dating Eun Jo.

343
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,270
 Did you not think that this could hurt both of you?

344
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,600
Because she thought if people came to know Eun Jo was dating her, this would become a roadblock to him.

345
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,050
Did you tell this to Eun Jo?

346
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,570
No.

347
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,140
Eun Jo does not know about this.

348
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,960
 Do you not know how important this time is for you right now?

349
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,760
 It's better to break up for the both of you.

350
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,660
 So hold it in and wait till I take care of this.

351
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,440
 Then what are you going to do? Answer!

352
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,660
 I cannot break up. I am sorry.

353
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,400
 If you behave like this, SHAW will disband.

354
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,760
 Are you going to end it like this?

355
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,360
 SHAX?

356
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,870
 It's all my fault.

357
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,040
Rather than caring about Eun Jo's feelings,

358
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,720
I grilled him about SHAX's existence.

359
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,680
It's because you were their manager.

360
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,200
The reason why Annie chose death

361
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,810
and why Eun Jo disappeared,

362
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,890
it's all my fault.

363
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,540
So you made tea party

364
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,390
to atone for what you did.

365
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,290
Atonement, you say...

366
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,190
I am not sure.

367
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:46,540

368
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,850
The night is getting deeper, and I have no scoop either.

369
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,820

370
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,140
But why did you choose now after three years passed by?

371
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,610
 I was thankful that you came looking for me to the U.S.

372
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,290
 At that time,

373
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,020
 the things you said too...

374
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,910
 The thing you said about living doing what I wanted...

375
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,120
 it helped me a lot.

376
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,710
 The me who was too exhausted back then.

377
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,750
 Also, I know that you

378
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,550
 looked for Annie till the very end.

379
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,380
 Thank you.

380
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,570
 Your condition right now,

381
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,730
 is not something that you wanted to do, is it?

382
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,280
 You should do what you really want.

383
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,680
 Just like you told me once.

384
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,740
 I am still at the dorm.

385
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,270
 Make sure to eat well even if you don't have any schedule.

386
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,110
 Yes. Have a good day.

387
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,270
- Oh, I am hungry. 
 - Me, too.

388
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,470
It's Eun Ji.

389
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,920
I will treat you guys today.

390
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,010
The atmosphere totally changes when Hyun Ji smiles.

391
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,630
That's right, that's the real tea party.

392
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,250
That's true.

393
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,020
That is quite weird.

394
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,580
It's been a while since Tea Party smiled all together.

395
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,080
 - Tea party!  
 - Oh?

396
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,660
Hello.

397
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,660
You guys look happy today.

398
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,630
Then do you want to hear the good news first or—

399
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,700
 What is the bad news?

400
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,830
There is no bad news.

401
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,810
The lawsuit has been dropped. The contract has been taken care of.

402
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,790
It's such a relief.

403
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,950
Oh, another thing. It must have been credited to your accounts.

404
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,160
Credited? Today is not our salary day.

405
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,290
It's what you earned over and above, for the first time.

406
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,490
It's not much, but check the balance account statement on your emails.

407
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:26,850
You have earned your first pay. I look forward to working well together in the coming days.

408
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,160
Why are you guys not answering?

409
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,770
 Yes!

410
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,730
What is this?

411
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,700
Copyright payment, music production payment, performance payment.

412
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,380
- Copyright payment? 
 - Music production payment?

413
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,180
You guys are the artists and lyricists for Tea party's "Show me."

414
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,830
So you should obviously receive all those payments.

415
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,360
This is really good news!

416
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,350
We did not even think about that.

417
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,460
I will work harder on making songs.

418
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,090
Please do that.

419
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,510
♫  I really like this, I can't faint  ♫

420
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,580
♫  This is a mysterious adventure. We gotta go  ♫

421
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:16,750
- It's our first real payment. 
 - We actually got paid!

422
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:22,160
♫  Now, show me and I’ll show you, ha, ha, 
 Seriously come to me. Come to me, la, la  ♫

423
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,110
- I am dizzy. 
 - I am having a hard time too. 
 - Yes—

424
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,880
♫  I’ll leave this in your hands. I’ll leave this in your hands  ♫

425
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,080
Then next, we will hear a toast to our first payment.

426
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,490
Take this.

427
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,230
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

428
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,130
Here.

429
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,470
Cheers!

430
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,660
Then there will be a commemorative photoshoot next.

431
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,540
A commemorative photoshoot sounds great!

432
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,220
Okay.

433
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,510
Here, come together!

434
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,790
Let's go. One, two, three!

435
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,660
One, two, three!

436
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,390
Done!

437
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,830
Also, the both of you.

438
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,220
Don't ever fight in front of me again.

439
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,250
When did we? Did we fight?

440
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,710
Yeah, when did we?

441
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,990
Wow, you guys... Seriously.

442
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,400
This won't do. I have to take one as evidence.

443
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,060
Two of you shake hands. Here I go, I am taking the picture.

444
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,180
One, two, three!

445
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,140
Ma Ha, if you are going through something difficult, open up to me too.

446
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,600
I will also do the same.

447
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,090
Sure.

448
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,890
You guys!

449
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,260
I love you!

450
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,480
We have received our dues and the copyright payment too. What are you guys going to do with it?

451
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,420
I am not sure.

452
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,890
I have not thought of it either.

453
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,780
- You? 
 - Then let us...

454
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,860
Why don't the three of us spend it in a meaningful way?

455
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,460
What is this determined look that you guys have?

456
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,180
You are giving me too much space. It's making me anxious.

457
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,810
We will invest in JH Entertainment.

458
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,940
Even though the amount is not much.

459
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,520
Invest?

460
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,320
We thought about it from the beginning. We don't just want this to be a company we have signed with,

461
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,820
but a base that all of us create along with you, Mr. Ji Hak.

462
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,590
Because you trusted us and started this.

463
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,950
We also want to go till the very end with JH Entertainment.

464
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,810
We may have become an issue, but people don't know us yet.

465
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,920
We want to go along with a color that suits us.

466
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,930
Your unique color?

467
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:10,360
Not first or second, figures that you can only see with your eyes.

468
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,620
But a happy Tea Party.

469
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,750
"Hello, we are always happy Tea Party," just like our introductory line.

470
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,030
While communicating with our fans.

471
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,230
We got anxious due to the accident at the music show, but

472
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,760
I will never forget that joy I felt performing on the stage.

473
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,820
 - It was thrilling.  
 - I am happy that I am with you guys.

474
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,460
Fighting!

475
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,570
Old reaction.

476
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,420
Me, too.

477
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,880
Me, too.

478
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,240
Then CEO, you know, right?

479
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,120
Always happy, Tea Party.

480
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,360

481
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,440

It suits you well.

488
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,960
Thank you.

489
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,540
Pretty girls look pretty no matter what they wear.

490
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,790
This is Tea Party's song. Please listen to it once.

491
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,280
Tea Party's girls are unique.

492
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,510
This is Tea Party's song. Please listen to it once.

493
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,410
Please, enjoy this.

494
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,390
Okay, it's done.

495
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,480
This is... our practice room.

496
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,950
Yay!

497
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,010
Ah!

498
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,700
- It's pretty, right? 
 - It's very pretty, right?

499
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,040
The comments are really fast.

500
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,930
 Have you seen that Ma Ha?

501
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,580
 We also love you all.

502
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,330
 Our heart to you all.

503
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,140
Is this from before Tea Party debuted?

504
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,540
Yes, that song is called "Show Me." It’s from when they were Omega III.

505
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,720
 They're the real deal.

506
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,250
Something feels empty.

507
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,300
This is full enough.

508
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,540
I told you that I don't want to talk to SHAX.

509
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm interested.

510
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,190
Not any other intention.

511
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
I'm interested in your voice.

512
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,810
You're really greedy.

513
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,760
After changing it like this, add your voice to it.

514
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,210
Are you guys just flirting, or are you actually dating?

515
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,280
What's this suddenly?

516
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,300
Hello!

517
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,600
Do you know how many times I knocked?

518
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,070
Are you also involving yourself with Tea Party?

519
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,110
No. There's no bad intention.

520
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,580
Whether or not there are bad intentions, that you both can figure out.

521
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,940
Who is the owner of this place?

522
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,250
Hyung Ha Seok.

523
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,060
Ammonite.

524
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,450
But what is this song?

525
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,290

526
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,160

527
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,450

528
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,830

529
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,080

530
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,770

531
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,890
Good song, good dance, even their visuals are good.

532
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,200
I'm joining their fandom today.

533
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,680
I'm watching this over and over again.

534
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,610
Wow!

535
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,980
What is this?

536
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,740
How did Omega III's choreography video get uploaded?

537
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,380
♫  8282119  ♫

538
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,870
I posted the viral video that helped Tea Party to climb the music charts.

539
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,940
Go Ba Hwi.

540
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,990
- What? 
 - I said that I would do my best as your manager.

541
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,990
I think you did it to make up for what you did to Ma Ha.

542
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,000
Lia, let's end things on a good note.

543
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,460
I am very petty so.

544
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,550
I am very petty so. Eh!

545
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,450
Thanks to you, we were trending at number one.

546
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,110
Thank you very much.

547
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,380
We are really happy.

548
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,350
Wow, Tea Party, great job.

549
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,650
You guys don't need me anymore.

550
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,960
CEO! You have to be here.

551
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,620
You should push us.

552
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,790
And hold us together.

553
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,530
Ma Ha, we have to go. You have a schedule.

554
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,380
Okay.

555
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,000
Bye.

556
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,890
- Bye. 
 - I'll be back.

557
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,400
Bye.

558
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,990
♫  Ring my bell  ♫ 
 ♫  Whenever I’m by your side   ♫

559
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,760
♫  I’m so happy, it’s amazing  ♫

560
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,420
This is suffocating.

561
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,370
Why am I here?

562
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,790
Why did I come here?

563
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,370
 Are you crazy? Did you think I'd get scared if you discovered my schedule and come to the shooting site?

564
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,860
 No. It's not like that, Oppa.

565
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:52,020
 You don't answer my calls, and won't meet me, so I miss you a lot. That's why.

566
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,400
If it's because of the company, I'll do well and hide our relationship.

567
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,830
Huh?

568
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,190
If we broke up, we did so forever. Stop bothering me.

569
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,980
Hey, will you take responsibility if a scandal pops up?

570
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,580
No, I mean I can't live on without you.

571
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,090
Don't stick to me.

572
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,850
 Oppa.

573
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,990
 From now on, Hoobae Lee Ma Ha will support you a lot.

574
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,350
 Fighting!

575
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,770
 I'm going to die.

576
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,490
Do whatever you want.

577
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,750
Kim Hyun Oh.

578
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,210
Is that what you got to say?!

579
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,410
 Who do you think you are?

580
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,270
Someone is fighting.

581
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,790
 What's happening?

582
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,970

- George Elliot

583
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,190
Love hurts to die.

584
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,060
 You know SHAX's Kwon Ryeok, right?

585
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,100
 He got into a fight with someone.

586
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,660
 - Kwon Ryeok? 
 - They say they fought over a woman.

587
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,190
What are you saying?

588
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,360
Is SHAX's Kwon Ryeok in a love triangle?

589
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,510
Yes. There was a total mess saying that they couldn't leave each other.

590
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,170
What is this?

591
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,240
Are you sure that it is SHAX's Kwon Ryeok?

592
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,120
- What did you say? 
 - The love triangle, who cried and made a mess.

593
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,620
- Is that Kwon Ryeok? 
 - No.

594
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,860
- Our Oppa Ryeok? 
 - Woman?

595
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,650
Love tri–

596
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:04,280
Shhh! Keep quiet. They're only rumors, and there is no evidence.

597
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,560
You guys keep your mouth shut.

598
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,690
24/7, we will be attentive to what may happen.

599
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,520
Save Kwon Ryeok.

600
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,070
 Save!

601
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:21,490
 Kwon Ryeok fought with him because he messed with his girlfriend.

602
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,950
So it’s true what they say about him. He’s dating with his juniors.

603
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,980
I told you. He is a womanizer.

604
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,390
Wow, this is amazing.

605
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,850
 I thought it was only a rumor.

606
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,110
 What are you saying?

607
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,710
We are also not sure.

608
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,010
 We have to go get ready.

609
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,630
Call Hyung Dae Kwon.

610
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,700
Hello?

611
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,380
Kwon Ryeok, what's going on?

612
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,990

613
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,000
Do you not know what kind of place the broadcasting station is?

614
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,030
It's not a day or two for you.

615
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,350
If you fall, they will say you are dead.

616
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:53,240
If you hit someone once, they will say that he has been wheeled to the hospital.

617
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,370
What exactly...?

618
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,710
I'm sorry.

619
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,450
I'll be careful from now on.

620
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,190
I should have known when you caused an uproar asking me to get schedules for you.

621
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,080
Your face is your asset and look at its state now!

622
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,560
Look how he left your face.

623
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,710
Is not Hyun Oh your hoobae?

624
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,090
Why doesn't Tae Geun take care of his boys?

625
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,630
I was the one who started it.

626
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,780
So what?

627
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,450
Raise your head! You are Kwon Ryeok of SHAX! Stand up straight!

628
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,200
Get on.

629
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,270
Quick!

630
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,710
Yes, sir.

631
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,180
What happened?

632
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,870
They told me that you fought with someone and that you were arrested, but I see that is not true.

633
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,380
That you fought is a fact.

634
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,370
You’re not a kid to be fighting anymore.

635
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,920
It turned out that way.

636
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,590
Ma Ha told me that you guys broke up.

637
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,400
Is that right?

638
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,410
Mind your own business.

639
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,470
I know that I'm nosy too.

640
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,690
Why don’t you want to talk about it?

641
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,180
Was your love just an affair?

642
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,460
Or is she too easy?

643
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,900
It's not like that.

644
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,720
Well, you’ve been working in this industry for a long time,

645
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,090
but you still dared to have a relationship,

646
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,240
without even preparing?

647
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,940
I’d like to know what she has that made you so pathetic.

648
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,450
When you were after Ma Ha, weren't you sincere?

649
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,090
Let’s end this conversation. I don't want to talk about that.

650
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:05,900
Kwon Ryeok, you complicate things yourself by allowing someone to control you

651
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,950
I thought you were different from other guys,

652
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,340
but you are a coward.

653
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,590
Yes, sir.

654
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,480
Then the problem of the fight is solved like that.

655
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,640
Yes, thank you.

656
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,190
Okay. Thank you.

657
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,830
Do I have to endure the media calling me and telling me all this?

658
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,250
I'm sorry.

659
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:51,000
Since I stopped this scandal, Kwon Ryeok and two members of Shax

660
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,790
will have to go to the YMSA show.

661
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,330
Two more?

662
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,470
Are you stupid?

663
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:02,990
All shows want to invite SHAX, but only three members will go to one of them. They'll go to YMSA.

664
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,130
So don’t reply me and schedule it.

665
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,190
Yes, sir.

666
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:22,730
Ryeok, why can’t I control you? Every day you look more like him.

667
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,850
 Who wants to go to YMSA?

668
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,000
To YMSA out of nowhere?

669
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,100
Kwon Ryeok has to go.

670
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:35,960
Why Ryeok?

671
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,910
Why do you think?

672
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,770
You've been working hard.

673
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:48,170
Since the scandal was avoided, two of you must accompany him. So who wants to go?

674
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,100
If it’s to help Ryeok, I’ll go.

675
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,090
Even if I lose, I’ll go, too.

676
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,380
Then Hyuk and Do Jin will go with you.

677
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,550
Thanks.

678
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,550
Who will all be there?

679
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,630
The lineup's not confirmed yet.

680
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:09,210
Okay. SHAX and La Ri Ma will come to our show.

681
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,780
Then we can fill up the rest with new faces.

682
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,360
If SHAX is coming, why don’t we invite this guy of Sparkling?

683
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,110
I heard he got into a fight with Kwon Ryeok when they were on a music show.

684
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,510
Don’t you think it would be interesting to have them both on our show?

685
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,710
Really? Contact him.

686
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:24,930
Okay.

687
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,740
- What about the girls? 
 - Blue Velvet and Honey Pink?

688
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,230
Both groups will be on another show that has the same schedule that ours.

689
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,640
Ah, wait a minute.

690
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,290
How about them?

691
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,140
Tea Party? Is this the revelation group?

692
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,250
They’re only good for music shows.

693
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:46,090
Their video went viral.

694
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,030
After that, they appeared on the music charts. They are so famous right now.

695
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,830
Are they that famous?

696
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,570
Tea Party is at its best time.

697
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,780
♫   I can't faint  ♫

698
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,950
 What's the lineup?

699
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,960
Yoo Jin will go, but they also want one of you to go to the show.

700
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,020
Why do they want me?

701
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,230
You won't have anything for a while.

702
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,880
- What? 
 - Our agency has decided that you have to rest, so there’s nothing you can do.

703
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,200
Kwon Ryeok hit me first. Look at this.

704
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,460
Do you think it's because of this time?

705
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,970
Do you think no one knew you were with that girl?

706
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,630
- Hyung. 
 - Hyun Oh, you better keep in mind what you did.

707
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,540
Got it?

708
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:36,080
SHAX will also go to the show, so you better prepare your best song.

709
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,090
You should go with Yoo Jin.

710
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,870
No, it's alright.

711
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:45,510
Tae Geun, I think it's better if Min Soo goes with Yoo Jin.

712
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,770
What do you say, Min Soo?

713
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,070
Thanks.

714
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,980
It's alright.

715
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,380
Ryeok, what are you doing?

716
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,660
The lineup's been revealed.

717
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,060
I wonder who's attending.

718
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,000
Yoo Jin and Min Soo. Yoo Jin's not that great.

719
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,750
La Ri Ma.

720
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,950
Ryeok, Tea Party!

721
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,130
Yes.

722
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,390
Yes, okay.

723
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,330
Tea Party.

724
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:53,580
Hyun Ji! Confirmed for a commercial! Lia and Ma Ha confirmed for a show!

725
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,730
Do you mean for "You and Me Singing Again"?

726
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,410
Yeah.

727
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,780
Ma Ha, Lia!

728
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,370
Daebak! This is so great!

729
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,150
I knew we could do it!

730
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,480
Hyun Ji, you too!

731
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,340
What's going on?

732
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,450
Is this a dream?

733
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,970
This is your power.

734
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,980
Tea Party!

735
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,350
So awesome!

736
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:29,460
 Alright, Kwon Ryeok and Ma Ha now have the chance to decide.

737
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,270
Both of you, who will you choose as your team member?

738
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:42,950

739
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,130

740
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,620
Ah, yes, CEO.

741
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,770
I can't reach CEO Park.

742
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,360
He's probably in a meeting regarding the takeover.

743
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,230
- Probably? 
 - Yes...

744
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,480
CEO Park is working hard to build up the company,

745
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,830
but you don't even know the CEO's schedule?

746
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,680
- It's not that. 
 - Forget it.

747
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,230
I'm hanging up.

748
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,130
I'm sorry, sir.

749
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,180
That's why it's important who you choose to have by your side.

750
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,110
Who did all the work?

751
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,820
Who did it all?!

752
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,490
Always only talking about CEO Park.

753
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,540
What am I supposed to do with people like this?

754
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,580
La Ri Ma's price is quite high.

755
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,970
Why are you making things so difficult?

756
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:54,140
All of them. They only look down on me.

757
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,670
I don't want to live like this anymore, working under someone.

758
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:05,850

759
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,770

760
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,650
 What would have happened if I ran and grabbed on to Ma Ha back then?

761
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,190
 I told you to stay quiet!

762
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,690
 And we're going to merge with NOG soon.

763
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,300
 Guys with problems may be forced to leave.

764
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,580
 Did you know this, Unni?

765
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,110
 I can't move to a new company like this. Our relationship ends here.

766
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,770
 Can't you see anything? The hidden truth.

767
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,470
 This is–

768
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,750
 Ma Ha seems to have had it hard.

769
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,590
 Ryeok!

770
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,330
 What are you doing here? Why are you here like this?

771
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,560
 I'm sorry for leaving your hand.

772
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,460
 Please let me hold your hand again.
