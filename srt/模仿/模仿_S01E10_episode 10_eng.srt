1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,010

2
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,950
 Now it's time

3
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,630
 to choose his teammate.

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,900
Hey. Sit back down.

5
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,970

6
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,070
 Kwon Ryeok, open your eyes.

7
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,910
 Who will be there behind you?

8
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,210
 Turn around!

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,240
 Unfortunately, no one came.

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,750
I'll give you some time.

11
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,680
Does no one here want to do a duet with Kwon Ryeok?

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,750
It looks like everyone finds it difficult to do a duet with Kwon Ryeok.

13
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,150
It's unfortunate. Team decision failed.

14
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,910
Now, it's time for Kwon Ryeok and Ma Ha to choose.

15
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,560
Who will you choose as your teammate?

16
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,180
Who will it be?

17
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,820
I'll choose...

18
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,450
I'll choose Yoo Jin.

19
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,250
Okay. I'll be with Kwon Ryeok.

20
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,040
 Okay. Then, Ma Ha and Yoo Jin,

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,570
 and La Ri Ma and Kwon Ryeok are doing duets.

22
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,590
 And with this, all of the teams have been decided.

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,020
You four may go back to your seats.

24
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,810
That was mean.

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,040
 We will now see the song choice! This is for Yoo Jin and Ma Ha.

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,470
Yoo Jin and Ma Ha! What year will it be?

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,200
 A 1990's male solo song will be Yoo Jin and Ma Ha's song!

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,050
Now, this is the last.

29
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,050
We will see what song Kwon Ryeok and La Ri Ma will have.

30
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,190
Kwon Ryeok and La Ri Ma, what year will come out?

31
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:09,850
 Kwon Ryeok, La Ri Ma... 1980's male solo!

32
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,960
Now the songs have been drawn.

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,320
Let's take a look at all of the songs that have been chosen.

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,980
Big Little and Mi Rae, 1980's male group. Joo Ho and Soo Ah, 1970's female solo.

35
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,170
 Si On and Yul, 1990's girl group.

36
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,590
 Min Soo and Sera, 2000's coed group.

37
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,220
 Do Jin and Hyuk, 2010's coed group.

38
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,690
 Hyun Woo Jin and Lia, 1990's female solo.

39
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,090
 Yoo Jin and Ma Ha, 1990's male solo,

40
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,490
 Kwon Ryeok and La Ri Ma, 1980's male solo.

41
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,200
 Now with this, the song choices are set.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,630
 By next week, each group will have perfectly prepared their songs.

43
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,970
 We will wait for next week.

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,550
Why did you choose me there?

45
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,560
Didn't you come out so that I could choose you?

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
Let's do well, Brother!

47
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,790
But Hyung, we are like this, but why didn't you pick Ma Ha?

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,810
We broke up.

49
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,210
Did he dump her?

50
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,310
Did he get dumped?

51
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,980
 Drink this while you work!

52
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,240
It'll be very comfortable to be working with Yoo Jin, right?

53
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,000
Ma Ha.

54
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,630
What?

55
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,350
What are you thinking about?

56
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,660

57
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,530
What about this song?

58
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,610
 Are you even listening to me?

59
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,500
What?

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,530
Why do you keep thinking about something else?

61
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,190
What song did you say? Let's do that.

63
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,410
Without even listening to it?

64
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,610
Let's do whatever you want. Isn't that good enough?

65
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,120
It's not going to hit my emotions, but it sounds perfect for you right now.

66
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,610
♫  You are an inmmature person  ♫

67
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,810
♫  You want to take my everything  ♫

68
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,810
♫  You are a person with a heart of stone  ♫

69
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,740
♫  Couldn't you tell me because you were shy?  ♫

70
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,710
Is that what you were going to tell me?

71
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,090
- What song we sing isn't the problem now. 
 - No.

72
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,450
- You do it, Hyung. 
 - No.

73
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,370
- Do it! 
 - No.

74
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,540
- It'll fit you well. 
 - No.

75
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,990
- This can be charming too. 
 - No.

76
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,140
- Then let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors for it. 
 - No.

77
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,460
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

78
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,110
Rock, Paper, Scissors! Rock, Paper, Scissors!

79
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,960
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

80
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,270
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!

81
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,770
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!

82
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,170
Ah, stop it!

83
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,190
Let's decide this through Go Stop.

84
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,630
Where are you going to find Go Stop?

85
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,570
Why do you have that?

86
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,850
I always carry it.

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,190
A real Korean.

88
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,250
Give it to me.

89
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,670
Give it to me!

90
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,510

91
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,520
♪ Just a moment a day ♪

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,270
♪ Meeting you through the phone ♪

93
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,390
It sounded so good!

94
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,480
- Really? 
 - Yes!

95
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,540
What a relief!

96
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,840
 Woo Jin, it's time for your next schedule.

97
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,580
Ah, sorry.

98
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,570
What about practice?

99
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,080
I have to go to my schedule. Let's practice next time.

100
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,530
When are we going to practice... Ah...

101
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,230
From here to here, I'll sing, and then from here to here, you sing.

102
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,370
What do you think about dividing the parts like this?

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,940
I've been thinking about it... and I think the emotions would be conveyed better if one person sang it.

104
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,750
So what if you sing the whole song and I'll do the harmony?

105
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,660
What do you think?

106
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, let's do it that way.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,800

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
There has been a big accident.

109
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,230
It seems like he's badly hurt. I feel bad for Hyun Woo Jin.

110
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,910
It seems like it happened on his way to his schedule.

111
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,010
It's tomorrow. What is she going to do?

112
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,210
Have you been able to reach her?

113
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,560
She went to the recording studio.

114
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,390
What is she going to do alone?

115
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,930
I think the desk is stronger than your head.

116
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,180
Why are you so down? That's not like you.

117
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,070
What do you mean?

118
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,890
I'll do it.

119
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,900
Since we've already worked together, I don't think it'll take long.

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,470
You're going to... work with me?

121
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,410
If I say I'll come out, the broadcasting station will welcome it.

122
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,130
Well, then I won't refuse your offer.

123
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,310
You must be really thankful.

124
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,400
Your face is really red.

125
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,030
You can show me your appreciation through something else.

126
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,730
Something else? What?

127
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,210
Let's first record. We don't have much time.

128

00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,280
You took my spot in NOG, and now you're trying to ruin my life?

329
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,250
- What? 
 - It all started when you showed up.

330
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,300
SHAX members were chosen through auditions.

331
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,280
You know that.

332
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,990
Audition? Don't make me laugh.

333
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,670
Your position was supposed to be mine.

334
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,420
It was decided that I would become a member of SHAX.

335
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,000
You—

336
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,950
I'm sorry I hurt you.

337
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
What are you trying to do?

338
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,560
Hyun Oh.

339
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,180
- Stop it. 
 - Move aside.

340
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,220
I said, stop it!

341
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,040
What does NOG have to do with Music Holic?

342
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,470
- What? 
 - What if you're SHAX? What if you're Sparkling?

343
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,170
You know what the problem is.

344
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,120
Think of how much you've sweat for your dream.

345
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,040
Don't hide behind these unreasonable factors.

346
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,940
Don't act all high and mighty, you punk!

347
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,040
I'm just going for a meal.

348
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,870
I didn't say anything.

349
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,740
I'll be back. Take care of the house.

350
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,470
Relax and come.

351
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,070
I look forward to your cooperation.

352
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,500
Me, too.

353
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,560

354
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,180
- Did you know? 
 - What?

355
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,990

356
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,900
I did hear the rumors about NOG inquiring around.

357
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,880

358
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,020
What do we do now?

359
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,310
If the merge happens, are we all going to be let go?

360
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,640
At least one person probably will.

361
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,560
We only looked forward to our debut and practiced like hell.

362
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,890
Bastards.

363
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,520
It's a good opportunity for you, too. You've worked hard at a small company.

364
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,060
- CEO. 
 - Yes?

365
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,610
I liked Queen Entertainment.

366
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,480
Because they know how to make contact with talented kids.

367
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,590
Wouldn't it be a waste?

368
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,780
Although this wasn't a big entertainment company, I still had pride in it.

369
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,670
By the way, since when did talent become money?

370
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,580
- That's not it. 
 - You're selling me for the union of the companies.

371
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,420
And you will just send away the kids?

372
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,210
Why are you worried about them? You're going in different directions.

373
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,630
All of this is business.

374
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,180
This name plate, I was the one who

375
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,390
worked hard for you to get it.

376
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:39,390
Exactly. I opened the door to the world for you.

377
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,850
World Class!

378
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,970
CEO.

379
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,820
You still don't know me.

380
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,080
What are you doing?

381
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,610
It looks like the name plate was also fake, seeing how easily it broke.

382
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,800
You crazy—

383
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,450
Did you just remember? I'm crazy!

384
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,240
CEO Hwang, live a real life.

385
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,990
I can't move the nest alone.

386
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,620
Our ties are over.

387
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,990
I won't do business.

388
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,780
- What? 
 - I won't break our contract.

389
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,430
You will.

390
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,500
If you are going to sue me, then use a real lawyer.

391
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,340
Don't cheaply use fake ones.

392
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,370
Okay?

393
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:41,050

394
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,430
Where is everyone? I told them I was coming.

395
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,970
Mom!

396
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,890
What's going on? Why is no one here?

397
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,250
This is weird...

398
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,590
Where did everyone go?

399
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,890
Unni!

400
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,360
What's this! How have you guys been!

401
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,180
Are you here?

402
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,260
It's been a while Ms. Jung!

403
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,180
I need to get the laundry,

404
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,730
and make some side dishes. You can be my extra pair of hands.

405
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,890
Hurry and go in!

406
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,370
Okay!

407
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,620
Noona!

408
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,430
Where are you going?

409
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,910
♫  The lonely alley  ♫

410
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,840
♫  Do you remember?  ♫

411
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,360
♫  Even now,  ♫

412
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,240
♫  I remember  ♫

413
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,870
♫  I couldn't say I love you  ♫

414
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,620
♫  Been worrying about those days  ♫

415
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,650
 Let's break up.

416
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,630
 From here on out, Hoobae Lee Ma Ha, will be cheering on her Sunbae Kwon Ryeok!

417
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,630
 If I hadn't said that then...

418
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,360
 If I had grabbed onto Ma Ha instead...

419
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,910
 What would it have been like?

420
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,630
♫  Come to me  ♫

421
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,140
Ma Ha must had a hard time.

422
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,730
I feel so bad.

423
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,790
I wasn't thinking about Ma Ha's heart and was only thinking about mine.

424
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,860
It looks like she just needs more time. Don't worry too much about her.

425
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,560
After a few days, she's the type to come back bravely flying.

426
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,300
 Welcome!

427
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,080
  Omg. It's Kwon Ryeok?

428
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,450
Oh?

429
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,810
Ryeok!

430
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,410
Do you want me to deliver all of this by myself?

431
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,520
Well, then do you want to do those dishes instead?

432
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,630
I haven't been home in months, and you're going to use me like this?

433
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,500
Of course. Who knows when you'll come back! I have to take advantage!

434
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,730
I will go straight back to Seoul!

435
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,640
Who said you can?

436
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,270
You can come whenever you want, but you can't leave on your own accord.

437
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,740
What kind of orphanage takes care of the elderly?

438
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,620
Why are you so slow with your actions!

439
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,290
Who's been calling you Volunteer Teresa?

440
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,840
You're totally the devil!

441
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,650
I'll help you!

442
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,430
It's okay.

443
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:05,140
You should go. This is my ninth time saying it.

444
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,620
Isn't it hot? And tiring? Should I just call a food truck?

445
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,070
Can you even be doing this right now?

446
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,210
You should go now.

447
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,620
Are you sure it's that way?

448
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,980

449
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,170
Go back a little bit.

450
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,660
Oh! Over there!

451
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,990
If you're going to help, do it properly!

452
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,120
It's over there.

453
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,400
- Here you go. Have a good meal. 
 - Thank you

454
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,330
I'll eat this well.

455
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,440
Here.

456
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
Go up.

457
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,840
I'll do it!

458
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,480
We can just go up here.

459
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,830
When are we eating?

460
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,250
- Thank you 
 - Have a good meal!

461
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,410
- Sir! 
 - The lunches are here!

462
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,550
We're grateful.

463
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,430
Ah, it's here.

464
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,700
Dae Kwon... Really.

465
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,140
Wait! The wagon! Wagon!

466
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,480
I caught it! I did it.

467
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,570
What are we going to do about these lunches?

468
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,060
Did you get hurt?

469
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,780
Here. For you hard work.

470
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,880
We finished, so you can go now.

471
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,240
The wind is refreshing.

472
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,840
Why didn't you answer your phone?

473
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,960
Why were you calling me?

474
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,260
I mean... I can call you.

475
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,940
You said you're my fan.

476
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,980
Unless you promise that you'll answer your phone, I'm not leaving.

477
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,420
This isn't it.

478
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,040
What about the kids?

479
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,320
The kids were so excited from seeing you, they must have been tired.

480
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,740
All of them fell asleep as soon as they laid down.

481
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,630
They have more energy than I do.

482
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,390
That young guy...

483
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,260
We're not anything!

484
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,700
I didn't say anything about that.

485
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,990
You're too independent.

486
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,060
You could show some weakness, you know.

487
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,040
You always said I should take of things by myself since I was young.

488
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,130
When I first adopted the kids from the orphanage,

489
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,610
I had to take care of them a lot.

490
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,190
I felt bad at times because of that.

491
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:30,140
Seeing you take care of everything on your own, I was proud.

492
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,690
My Ma Ha... doing everything on your own

493
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,880
must have been lonely.

494
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,910
Every once in a while, I thought that I wanted to be an only child to have all of the love.

495
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,830
But I was happier being born as you and dad's daughter.

496
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,270
Really?

497
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,720
Of course.

498
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:56,050
You have golden hands that make heartbroken kids feel warm.

499
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,990
Golden hands?

500
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:03,490
When I'm with you, I feel warm inside, as if snow is melting.

501
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,880
How could I not love a mom like that?

502
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,240
I'm sorry and grateful for you.

503
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,300
But mom, are you not tired?

504
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,180
You should take care of yourself.

505
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,900
Are you calling me an old lady?

506
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,280
People still call me a newlywed.

507
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,700
Sure, Miss Newlywed.

508
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,080
Miss Newlywed, I've laid the blanket out for you, so hurry off and sleep.

509
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,520
It's been so long, should we sleep together?

510
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,630
Oh, I'd love that!

511
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,470
 He probably left, right?

512
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,430
 Has he not gone?

513
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,840
 Oh! I don't know.

514
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,300
 I can't stop worrying.

515
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,840
He won't even let me sleep!

516
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Even if she doesn't mean it, she should at least send me a message that she is thankful,

517
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,060
or that I worked hard. What is so hard in doing that?

518
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,130
It's cold.

519
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,620
Why is he out like that without going back?

520
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,890
It's colder because it is near the sea.

521
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,940
Should I have brought a blanket?

522
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,890
It's cold.

523
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,900
Cold!

524
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,110
I guess he will leave now.

525
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,430

526
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,040
Oh! Dae Kwon Hyung.

527
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,770
 Where are you?

528
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,920
 Pick up your calls!

529
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,570
 Where did you run off to? Hey Kwon Ryeok!

530
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,270
It's cold.

531
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,500
Cold.

532
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,890
What?

533
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,850
No!

534
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,120
No!

535
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,870
You didn't leave?

536
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,130
- Lend me some money. 
 - What?

537
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,320
My car ran out of diesel.

538
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,910
You should have just called a service.

539
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,820
If I had done that, Hyunh Dae Kwon would have had a fit. It's his prized possession.

540
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,590
I have no energy from shivering all night.

541
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,940
It's done, right?

542
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,390
I'll drop you off. Hop in.

543
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,200
No, bye.

544
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,260
Eat a lot. Don't get sick.

545
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,640
 - Eat a lot.  
 - Thank you for the food.

546
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,050
 Eat a lot.

547
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,670
What are you doing here? Why are you doing this?

548
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,750
What do you mean, "What are you doing?" to a person who came to help us?

549
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,100
No, that's not what I meant.

550
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,060
He says you've been friends since you were kids.

551
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,520
I thought he only looks cool, but he is actually cool.

552
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,340
 He even came here to help.

553
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,800
He said that he helped yesterday too.

554
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,150
I couldn't do well because it was my first time. I will do well today.

555
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,530
Hyung Dae Kwon!

556
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,110
It seems like you didn't inform him that you came.

557
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,570
You should go back.

558
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,620
Noona, give me fried eggs.

559
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,030
I'll get you your fried eggs.

560
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,970
Get in arguments with her from time to time.

561
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,400
Our Ma Ha came home after a long time because of you.

562
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,850
Arguments from time to time.

563
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,470
Leave it up to me.

564
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,150
Pretty, lovey-dovey. You know, right?

565
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,930
Lovey-dovey?

566
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,450
Fried eggs are here.

567
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,370
Who ordered these?

568
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,670
 Me.

569
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,040
Eat it.

570
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,110
 - Thank you.   
 - You're welcome.

571
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,970
I told you to go, but you didn't.

572
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,950
Why do you keep appearing and making it hard for me?

573
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,160
Do you hate me now?

574
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,580
What are you trying to do suddenly?

575
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,230
You were the one who suggested we should break up.

576
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,350
Let's at least contact each other.

577
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,460
What did you say?

578
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,150
You being my junior and my fan...

579
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,580
We can contact each other, right?

580
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,280
We don't have to act like strangers.

581
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,550
You do remember the

582
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,670
padding incident, right?

583
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,540
I understood, how

584
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,220
sensitive your fans are.

585
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,140
What's fascinating is that

586
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,580
they knew my feelings before I even realized myself.

587
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,010
We are people who have to receive everything.

588
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,340
Interest and love, we have to receive them all.

589
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,770
We will only get caught by the fans

590
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,400
the longer we date.

591
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,720
Tea Party has finally started getting attention.

592
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,880
I want to do well in Tea Party with Lia and Hyun Ji.

593
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,100
But the scandal with you

594
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,290
should not happen.

595
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,210
Ma Ha.

596
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,410
What are your feelings,

597
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,980
regardless of SHAX, Fins, and Tea Party?

598
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,880
Your feelings towards me, right now?

599
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,760
Can't you see anything?

600
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,190
What should I be seeing?

601
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,520
The hidden truth.

602
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,760
It should be visible.

603
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,540
This is...

604
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,760
I wonder where Eun Jo is and what he's doing.

605
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,490

606
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,850

607
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,830
They say La Ri Ma left Queen Entertainment.

608
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,940
What should I do about Queen Entertainment?

609
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,290
You've already used the words you needed. Why do you care?

610
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,220
Yes. I understand, sir.

611
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,160
Start releasing the promoting articles.

612
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,850
"All members of SHAX to resign their contracts after MML concert"

613
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,980
Release it in a lovely manner like this.

614
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,870
Yes. I understand, sir.

615
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,710
Leave.

616
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,080
Let's walk together.

617
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,310
- How many times do I have to tell– 
 - The path you're walking on,

618
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,200
let me walk with you.

619
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,350
Ma Ha.

620
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,050
Ma Ha.

621
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,380
I'm sorry for letting your hand go.

622
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,950
I'm also sorry for hiding like a coward.

623
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,350
Let me

624
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,520
hold your hand again.

625
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,410
Ma Ha.

626
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,830
Pick up your phone. They're waiting for you.

627
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,960
♫  I turned around and walked again  ♫

628
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,240
I am also waiting for your response.

629
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,030
I won't go back till you respond.

630
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,660
So tell me your feelings honestly.

631
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,380
♫  I might be left behind  ♫

632
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,920
What do you want me to do after all this?

633
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,990
What should I do?

634
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:31,390
♫  I cry the same way a child does when he lost  ♫

635
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:34,220
♫  You looked at me and said   ♫

636
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,700
♫  Until the sadness fades away  ♫

637
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:48,220
♫  I’ll stay with you  ♫

638
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,410
♫  And if one of us  ♫

639
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,110
♫  Still doesn’t want to break up  ♫

640
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:05,460
♫  What am I gonna do if Istill want you to stay with me?  ♫

641
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:11,360
♫  I’ve got a hunch that we’ll miss each other as the time goes by  ♫

642
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,640
♫  If you stay with me I’d give you my everything   ♫

643
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,630
We have to go back now, right?

644
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,110
Is it fine with your schedule?

645
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,370
♫  I will not wait any longer   ♫

646
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:34,330
But what do we do

647
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,630
when we go back?

648
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,850
Why?

649
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,740
Are you worried?

650
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,350
♫  From the beginning we were unconscious  ♫

651
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,230
Of course, I am.

652
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:49,600
♫  If we had foreseen, 
 what was going to happen we wouldn’t miss each other  ♫

653
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,020
♫  If you stay with me I’d give you my everything   ♫

654
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:57,640
♫  Just like I did  ♫

655
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,260
♫  The day we met  ♫

656
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,620
 Ryeok! You were careful when driving this, right?

657
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,960
Following the speed limits?

658
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,070
I'm not going to get any tickets from you speeding or not following other laws, right?

659
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,500
You know, right?

660
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,680
I've been taking care of you without scratching you once.

661
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,870
 I hope you didn't scratch My Star, too.

662
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,450
Why aren't you answering?

663
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,850
Hyung.

664
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,950
What?

665
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,450
I want to date publicly.

666
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,680
Are you crazy? Public relationship?

667
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,890
Aren't you out of your mind?

668
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,050
What did you just say?

669
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,950
This is a big bomb.

670
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:50,960
Public relationship?

671
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,560
You're nuts. You're totally nuts.

672
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,270
I had a strange feeling since Kwon Ryeok came to the café.

673
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:05,230
I'm sorry for making the situation like this. I was afraid of affecting SHAX's image.

674
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:10,630
So I did hold back my feelings for quite some time, but I can't hold back anymore.

675
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,510
Please understand me this once.

676
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,000
I know. I know I'm being selfish,

677
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,240
but I just can't do this anymore.

678
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,360
Please understand me this once.

679
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,640
Hyung.

680
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,870
I don't want to date her while fooling you and Fins.

681
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:34,410
 That is why I thought of this.  This is the best method.

682
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,900
- Public relationship. 
 - Hey! You crazy fool.

683
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,960
Yes, let's reveal everything.

684
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,400
Since this is for SHAX, let's reveal it all.

685
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,300
Yes, reveal it. Let's reveal everything.

686
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,320
Cool down.

687
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,110
Why didn't you tell me first?

688
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,860
I'm sorry.

689
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,650
Don't forget it's going well!

690
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,030
I am this team's leader.

691
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:09,340
You should have consulted with me before dropping such a big bomb.

692
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,240
I'm sorry.

693
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,970
I know how hard you are working for SHAX.

694
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,750
That is exactly why it was hard for me to tell you.

695
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,200
Please trust me this once.

696
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,790
I will make sure it doesn't affect SHAX.

697
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,610
I don't want to lose you just like we lost Eun Jo.

698
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,140
SHAX is going to go all the way.

699
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,800
Ahn Jae Woo, why are you dragging Eun Jo into this?

700
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,940
I will do anything within my power for the team.

701
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,030
Will you be alright?

702
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,640
I'm also scared after holding hands with him.

703
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,700
I'm more aware of reality this time, compared to the last time.

704
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:26,010
But I don't want to fool

705
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,060
myself and others.

706
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,370
What will we do now?

707
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,880
You guys don't have anything to lose, isn't it?

708
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,580
No, that's not what we mean.

709
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,110
I understand your feelings.

710
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,660
I do, but this isn't the right timing.

711
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,410
We need a solution.

712
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,570
You guys are making me exhausted.

713
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,430
Guys, I am busy.

714
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,040
I even have to look around for a good company, and I have lots of work to do.

715
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,840
I have to release a song and promote it soon.

716
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,820
When will you give me my song?

717
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,700
It's settled that we will be the only ones knowing,

718
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,380
and they won't go public about their relationship.

719
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,610
You all agree, right?

720
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,710
Then where do they meet?

721
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:16,830
What if we don't let them meet?

722
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,860
The guy would be in straight mode. 
 (T/N: only looking straight ahead)

723
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:23,420
So you guys are worried that they will get caught by the sasaeng fans like last time.

724
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,890
They can't go to popular places.

725
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,780
They can't go to parks or mountains either.

726
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,670
They will take care of it themselves.

727
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,650
 No!

728
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,820
That will make it easier for them to get caught.

729
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,540
Anyway, I'm not going to care.

730
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,830
Since earlier, why are you watching a fire from across the river? 
 (T/N: acting as a spectator in the situation)

731
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,330
Then what should I do? Get them a hotel room?

732
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,600
Hotel room? Hell no!

733
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,770
What hotel suddenly?

734
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,080
They will take care

735
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,950
of it anyway.

736
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,320
We will have the hardest time.

737
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,540
Hey! You guys, seriously.

738
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,960
Have you guys not dated before? The safest hideout is your dorms.

739
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,570
- Dorms? 
 - Is your dorm ok or not?

740
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,500
Definitely not.

741
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,030
There are so many eyes there.

742
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,650
No, no. I will feel uncomfortable.

743
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,590
How about you guys?

744
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:02,160
What? The thing is...

745
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,450
Our neighborhood can be considered silent.

746
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,150
Lia and Ma Ha only stay.

747
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,400
Hyun Ji!

748
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,910
Ok. Then they will meet there.

749
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:12,330
Oh, no!

750
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,060
These are all pictures of me practicing.

751
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,780
I did practice a lot.

752
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,320
We also ate food and drank coffee here, it's all nice but

753
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,330
why are my eyes stinging?

754
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:37,920
Ah, Sunbaenim. There is something I have to get from you.

755
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,220
What is it?

756
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,290
Wait a moment.

757
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,520
They're all cute.

758
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,730
Where did I see her before?

759
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,860
Why don't you sit down if you're not here for an inspection?

760
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,170
But who is she?

761
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,840
Unni Annie?

762
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,790
Annie?

763
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,450
She was one of the original members of Omega III.

764
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,970
Ma Ha came in after Annie left.

765
00:59:54,930 --> 01:00:00,720
Sunbaenim. It will be complete once you sign here.

766
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,690
Eun Jo.

767
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,050

768
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:10,510
It's also snowing, where did he go?

769
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,310
 I should be dropping you off at home.

770
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,280
 It's ok.

771
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,970
I'm sorry for not bringing you back.

772
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:20,190
 It must be cold, go back quickly.

773
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,350
 Call me after you get home.

774
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,950
Bye.

775
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:35,060

776
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,760
Who is that?

777
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,450
Ryeok!

778
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,730
My girlfriend.

779
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,790
Girlfriend?

780
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,310
I'm sorry for not telling you before.

781
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,810
It's our 3000th day so I had to go.

782
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,750
3000th day?

783
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,880
3000 days of dating without the members knowing?

784
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,740
Ryeok!

785
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:12,990
♫   And if one of us   ♫

786
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,760

787
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,540
 What is wrong?

788
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:22,250
 It's strange that you suddenly left like that and that you were asking questions about Annie.

789
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,070
 - It's the same. 
 - It's been three years already.

790
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:28,170
 Who do you think is trying to tell the world about Annie?

791
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,470
 Is this your company?

792
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,410
 I will sign the contract on the condition of you signing my juniors.

793
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,470
 How is it, my proposal?

794
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,160
 The day Annie died, Eun Jo disappeared.

795
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,080
 Was there something wrong with Annie?

796
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,510
 This was it. The reason why Eun Jo disappeared.
