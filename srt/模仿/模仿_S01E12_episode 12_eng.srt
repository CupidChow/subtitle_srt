1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,610

2
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,160

3
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,370
Oh, Ryeok.

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,750
Your face looks really bad.

5
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,950
I told them to reduce your schedules. You need to take care of yourself, too.

6
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,090
What is it?

7
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,760
Talk comfortably, Ryeok.

8
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,570
We want to try preparing for this year's MML performance by ourselves.

9
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,320
Then what can we do to help?

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,760
We'll refuse the support.

11
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,100
As I just mentioned, I want us to prepare for it ourselves.

12
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,590
Are you going to do something you've never done before?

13
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,480
What a waste of energy.

14
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,650
What is it that you are so concerned about?

15
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,010
Don't worry. I won't disappoint you.

16
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,520
Of course, you shouldn't.

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,620
You haven't forgotten our contract, have you?

18
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,230

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,730
  What are you saying?

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,420
 - About what? 
  - About you claiming for damages against Eun Jo?

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,840
  Isn't it obvious?

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,050
 If he caused damages, he needs to compensate for them.

23
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,190
 I will take responsibility.

24
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,220
  Who? You?

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,640
  Do you know how much it is?

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,350
  I—

27
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,620
 I'll take responsibility.

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,610
  So don't bother the SHAX members, Eun Jo included.

29
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,160
 The damages that Eun Jo caused... You will take responsibility for them?

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,690
 So don't touch you guys?

31
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,230
  Fine, let's do that.

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,180
  I'll have to write the contract again.

33
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,490
You and I can never part ways from each other.

34
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,950
The members all said they would do it, to sing with the company again.

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,430
So let's not do anything foolish to each other.

36
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,530
Then I'll assume that you've given permission and go, CEO.

37
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,570
What can you guys do without the company?

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,120
Acting like he's so tough...

39
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,940

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,370
Guys, what do you think about preparing for the MML performance by ourselves this year?

41
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,930
Did someone else make it in the past?

42
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,180
We made the choreography in the past too.

43
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,870
The design too.

44
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,780
No, I mean everything! From the planning to the concept and everything else.

45
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,490
All of it?

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,860
Let's sing Eun Jo's song this time.

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,490
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,540
It's an important performance.

49
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,220
And not because MML is your last performance?

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,440
  You haven't forgotten our contract, have you?

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,570
What exactly is the contract that we don't know about?

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,180
It's nothing.

53
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,460
- Ryeok. 
 - No, it's not like that.

54
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,420
Don't try to take responsibility for SHAX by yourself.

55
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,420
Han Jae Woo, you worry too much.

56
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,870
 A Child Who Has Been Forgotten, But Should Have Never Been Forgotten in the First Place.

57
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,090
 I have to put out the article.

58
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,120
Journalist Byeon.

59
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,680
I know why you're worried,

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,320
but I can't stop here.

61
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,620
Those kids want to be forgotten.

62
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm a journalist.

63
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,980
I will deeply consider what you and the children want.

64
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,240
In order to convey the lyrics, the song has to sound sweet!

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,870
No, we have to make it more dramatic by emphasizing the main melody.

66
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,890
You want to make it more dramatic by using an orchestra and a pipe organ and all that?

67
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,080
Yes.

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,910
The real greedy person was sitting right in front of me.

69
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,670
You said I was greedy and wanted me to take everything out except for their voices!

70
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,660
No... I mean...

71
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,790
Mix the two.

72
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,590
Make it dramatic with the voices!

73
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,910
 Make it dramatic with the voices?

74
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,360
Is my song complete?

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,620
You told me to stop by because my song was complete, but why are you guys flirting here instead?

76
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,430
Yours is already complete.

77
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,550
Really?

78
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,380
But... what's this?

79
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,990
It sounds nice.

80
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,570
This is nothing.

81
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,230
Whose is it?

82
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,700
- Our song. 
 - Ours.

83
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,410
- Ours. 
 - It's ours.

84
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,810
It's Ma Ha's song.

85
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,000
It's Ryeok's song.

86
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,130
I heard about the song's concept from Lia.

87
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,960
It's going to be so cool.

88
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,130
If you sing that song at MML.

89
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,450
How did you think about doing that?

90
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,800
As expected, I have an eye for people!

91
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,580
Annie must be happy.

92
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,760
Which is why I wanted to tell you...

93
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,580
 Really? At MML?

94
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,450
Us, too?

95
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,120
- Are we going to sing? 
 - Is that possible?

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,820
That's what I'm saying. We're doing it, too.

97
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,520
I can't believe this.

98
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,130
I feel so excited just at the thought of it.

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,030
Lia, about that song...

100
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,990
I think it'll be perfect if I do it.

101
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,690
What do you think?

102
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,410
Sunbaenim, there's something I want to tell you.

103
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,440

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,370
Let's go.

105
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,860
Hyun Oh.

106
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,010
 What should we do here?

107
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,650
Let's put in some more.

108
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,730
I think it will sound better with a male voice.

109
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,390
With a low register?

110
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,310
Or high?

111
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,470
I think this is enough for now.

112
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,000
How long would it take?

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,580
We don't have much time.

114
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm a bit expensive.

115
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,830
But since I'm so proud and fond of you,

116
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,840
I'll help you.

117
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,150
Thank you!

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,530

119

122
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
What are you doing? I said one more time.

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,380
- Kwon Ryeok! Please! 
 - Hyung... Please!

124
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,690
Alright. Rest for ten minutes, and then let's do it a few more times.

125
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,190
Does anyone have a tranquilizer gun? So I can take him out.

126
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,380
Hey, hey!

127
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,720
MML is right around the corner. We can't do this!

128
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,850
We can't.

129
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,140
Let go. Are you not letting go?

130
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,340
Stop. We can't!

131
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,730
  Aren't you letting go?

132
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,210
  I won't let go.

133
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,870
 Let go.

134
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,560
Why? What?

135
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Double contract!

136
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,680
Hyung...

137
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,220
 Hyung Ryeok.

138
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,670
It's nothing.

139
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,600
- Okay? 
 - Ryeok.

140
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,180
Ryeok.

141
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,610
Lee Hyun.

142
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,850
 Hyuk, Do Jin.

143
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,620
I'm really sorry.

145
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,260
- What happened? 
 - I told the CEO

146
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,460
about Eun Jo's girlfriend.

147
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,690
And when he would ask about you guys, I reported to him about you guys from time to time.

148
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,880
Ryeok, you were holding such a heavy burden for SHAX.

149
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,330
I thought I was doing that for SHAX.

150
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,290
Jae Woo, I don't think you betrayed us.

151
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,250
When you found out about Eun Jo, and after that,

152
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,590
you did that because you were afraid of SHAX falling apart.

153
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,030
Because I did that, too.

154
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,980
SHAX.

155
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
I was afraid it was going to fall apart.

156
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,880
- Hyung... 
 - Hyung...

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Your actions...

158
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,370
I hate them.

159
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,910
But I understand because it's you.

160
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,820
Because I know you did that for the team.

161
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,520
So stop crying and stand up.

162
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,820
Get up.

163
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,760
Ryeok, I became sure after I heard about your double contract.

164
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,250
My wrongful actions, and the time you suffered alone...

165
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,970
Give me a chance for us to go through it together.

166
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,540
I know you did it for SHAX.

167
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,360
But we are SHAX, too. We promised to do everything together.

168
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,160
Hyung, five is better than one.

169
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,270
Don't you think so?

170
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't steal our spots. We're all SHAX.

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,950
SHAX.

172
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,020
 Don't do that again, okay?

173
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,850
 Hey!

174
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
 Hey! Stop holding me!

175
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,360
 Hey! Hey!

176
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,390
I'll be back.

177
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,640
 What a relief.

178
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,810
Hello, I'm Lee Ma Ha from Tea Party.

179
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,920
I really wanted to meet you at least once.

180
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Thank you for letting us sing that song.

181
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,620
A lot of people will sing it together tomorrow.

182
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,150
I had never met Unni Annie,

183
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,400
or you,

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,130
but when I heard that song I knew.

185
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,890
How much you loved each other.

186
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,330
I have someone special, too, so I was able to feel it.

187
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,780
I'm sure Unni Annie was happy.

188
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,740
She was able to hear the true feelings of her beloved.

189
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,290
I will do my best to portray your emotions.

190
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,910
- I hate you. 
 - Me?

191
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,960
You didn't even wipe down your sweat after practice.

192
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,050
You'll get sick being out here in the cold.

193
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,490
Don't worry.

194
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,800
Here.

195
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,490
What's all this?

196
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,770
My tribute.

197
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,670
I'll take care of you today.

198
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,250
Then, of course, I have to try it.

199
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,690
Is it good?

200
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,540
I can feel the strength coursing through my veins.

201
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,810
 The CEO won't leave us alone.

202
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,360
 Let's go back to the beginning of SHAX.

203
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,380
Okay, you can go.

204
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,420
What are all of you here for?

205
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,640
This MML stage is the last stage as SHAX.

206
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,020
The last?

207
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,220
Yes, after the MML concert ends, we're going to leave NOG.

208
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,120
Jae Woo.

209
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,190
I agree with the members.

210
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,260
Really?

211
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,450
We will leave after solving Ryeok's contract problem.

212
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,420
Solve?

213
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,930
All of SHAX will take responsibility,

214
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,480
so please stop bothering Ryeok.

215
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,220
 This is upsetting.

216
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,730
I raised a few ducklings, but now they're trying to fly away from home, and they're even making false accusations.

217
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,750
Do you think you can pull off the performance?

218
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,860
You knew, didn't you?

219
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,990
About Eun Jo and his girlfriend?

220
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,460
- What? 
 - I have nothing else to say.

221
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,330
Should I let MML know that SHAX won't be performing?

222
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,520
Are you crazy?

223
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,680
Send out that article.

224
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,640
Sorry?

225
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,660
Do I have spell everything out for you?!

226
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,120
Who dares to mess with my things?

227
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,680
Put out an article that SHAX and NOG are on good terms!

228
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,430
And remember to keep their mouths shut until after MML.

229
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,290
Ryeok can't fly away anyways.

230
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,610
Let's figure this out after MML.

231
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,760
Yes, sir.

232
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,210
And what's this about Eun Jo's girlfriend?

233
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,860
Sorry?

234
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,090
 Can't you take care of the members more properly?

235
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,670
 You didn't even know that he was meeting a girl like this..

236
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,550
 And now there are pictures.

237
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,320
 Ji Hak is no longer one of ours. We have nothing to do with him.

238
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,310
 - Do you understand what I'm saying? 
 - Yes.

239
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,400
 So he's not even allowed to say the N in NOG.

240
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,410
 I didn't even think of that.

241
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,310
 But my actions were worth it!

242
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,320
What do you mean?

243
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,290
What did those guys just say and leave?!

244
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,320
Eun Jo's girlfriend... Omega Entertainment.

245
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,330
It's that girl.

246
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,790
The door was open.

247
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,120
CEO Park, your expression is hard to discern.

248
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,270
Could it be that you didn't know Eun Jo's girlfriend was from President Kim's company?

249
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,140
If it comes out like this, my topic becomes a little complicated.

250
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,050
During such an important period of time where NOG is trying to expand,

251
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,750
who would send in an edited photo like this?

252
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,250
You bastard.

253
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,570
I think we'll be seeing each other very often from here on out, so don't avoid my calls!

254
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,530
I'll close the door on my way out.

255
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,400
Secretary Kim.

256
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,030
What kind of foolish things have you been doing?

257
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,190
 Well?

258
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,970
 What have you done?

259
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,280
Since it's matched to the song...

260
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,970
We can't mess up the positions.

261
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,180
I'm already nervous.

262
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,790
I'm saying this again,

263
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,270
but please let our Hyun Ji get past her stage fright and rip this stage apart!

264
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,730
- Amen. 
 - Amen.

265
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,370
Amen.

266
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,430
I shouldn't be doing this right now.

267
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm going to do the studio.

268
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,060
Lia, don't work too hard.

269
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,270
Got it. I'm going!

270
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,190
Bye!

271
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,890
I also have to get our outfits.

272
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,720
Alright. Be careful!

273
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,200
Okay.

274
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,450
See you later!

275
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,010
Min Sung.

276
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,960
I hope you can come.

277
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,220

278
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,090
I'll see if I can.

279
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,730
♫  Come closer closer  ♫

280
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,110
♫  In this sweet time  ♫

281
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,930
♫  Suddenly, the time is midnight  ♫

282
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,250
♫  The two of us, all night  ♫

283
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:22,400
♫  Come closer closer. This moment will last forever  ♫

284
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,720
What's this? Are you trying to practice?

285
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,250
Yes.

286
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,920
Are they cockroaches in the practice room, or what?

287
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,030
I mean, what kind of company has only one practice room?!

288
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,780
Sunbaenim, thank you so much for taking care of us when we had nowhere to go.

289
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,160
What is this, so tacky?

290
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,300
If you're thankful, then pay me back.

291
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,490
Let's stand together at MML next year.

292
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,650
Okay.

293
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,430
Don't risk your life though!

294
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,420
Just do it while you're having fun, while having fun.

295
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,250
- Okay? 
 - Yes.

296
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,930
Let's carry them together. It must be heavy.

297
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,160
It's not heavy.

298
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,020
You should rest after practice. Why come here?

299
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,350
I heard you haven't slept in days.

300
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,820
Your face looks worn.

301
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,220
Really?

302
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,330
Where?

303
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,880
I look worn out because I couldn't see you. Let's go.

304
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,760
Let's get one more clip.

305
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,040
We're running out of time...

306
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,780
You still have some time left.

307
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,510
There! It's a little weird there.

308
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,130
Why are you making mistakes you usually don't make, Lia?

309
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,210
It's okay.

310
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,800
If you make a mistake, I'll cover for you.

311
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,350
You said you weren't interested in me, right?

312
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,580
Is that not true?

313
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,160
No...

314
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,000
I... That's...

315
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,320
So... If you don't know how you feel,

316
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,090
just follow my lead.

317
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,820
You don't want to?

318
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,030
No... I'm not saying that...

319
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,130
Aigoo, his face is all red...

320
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,800
You should be taking care of yourself. Can you be going out like this the day before the concert?

321
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,690
I have been taking care of myself all this time. You,

322
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,490
ran out as soon as I called.

323
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,100
It's my first time performing on such a big stage.

324
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,450
Honestly, I'm so nervous I can't sleep.

325
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,430
Our Ma Ha

326
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,150
will do well.

327
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,080
Really well.

328
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,900
After tomorrow... what will happen to us?

329
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,690
What do you mean?

330
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,840
You'll still be

331
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,330
shining like that star.

332
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,360
I'll be shining next to you.

333
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,140
It's a satellite.

334
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,290
What?

335
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,970
My star.

336
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,200
Oh, it's moving.

337
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,370
Still, I'm glad.

338
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,730
It's coming to me.

339
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:55,350
It's much better than being separated while we're in the same place.

340
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,990
We'll be separated for a moment,

341
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,730
but you'll come back to me.

342
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,210
I'll wait for you without changing so you can come find me.

343
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,850
I'll come to see you dozens of times a day.

344
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,180
Always with a happy heart.

345
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,310
The title for the song!

346
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,720
What do you think of  Constellation ?

347
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,350
 Constellation ?

348
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,100
I like it.

349
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,310
♫  You don’t give it up. Boom boom boom yeah  ♫

350

♫  Boom boom boom yeah  ♫

352
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,090

353
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,660

356
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,420
Thank you.

357
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,930
 Okay! Let's clean up the set.

358
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,990
After this song ends, we have one minute until the video for the next song starts,

359
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,540
and 1 minute 30 seconds after the video starts.

360
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,860
Let's move more quickly.

361
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,240
- Okay. 
 - Yes.

362
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,590
But is SHAX doing a finale?

363
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,400
I don't know. It's written, so they probably will, right?

364
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,910
If you just write the finale song here, is that okay? Are they going to go up without anything?

365
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,780
There's no way.

366
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,820
Manager Ji.

367
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,430
I'm late. This is the finale's video file.

368
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,270
Even for SHAX, if you do this, it's not okay.

369
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,870
You haven't changed.

370
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,620
Dae Kwon will set the timing for you.

371
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,120
I will?

372
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,080
But did you take over again?

373
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,380
No.

374
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,820

 MML's "Constellation," A Consolation Message to Many Trainees

606
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,220
 Three years ago, a child, who jumped into the Han River and killed herself,

607
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,460
 was "A," a trainee of hundreds of thousands,

608
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,480
 who endured difficult training every day,

609
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,590
 while dreaming a small dream in a cruel world.

610
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,160
 "If you don't debut, you're nothing!"

611
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:54,390
 Therefore, leaving behind the days of having to endure the mistreatment

612
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,690
 with that dream as collateral until becoming an idol. It was a decision made out of extreme despair.

00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:18,460
 May light shine in the blind spots that were hidden by their songs and

 give comfort to the stars who are shining at this moment without purpose.

 "A," a trainee of hundreds of thousands, even at this moment,

00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,890
We, SHAX, will end our contract with NOG

640
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,590
with the MML performance.

641
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,780
Is it related to yesterday's article?

642
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,930
 What are you transferring to?

643
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,760
Are you working with Eun Jo as a six-member group?

644
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,270
 Why did you create a secret performance for MML?

645
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:02,000
 Is  Constellation  a new SHAX song?

646
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,760

647
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,420
 What are your future plans?

648
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,260

670
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,820
 In the era of one million idol trainees,

671
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,210
  the probability of successfully debuting is only 0.1%.

672
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:19,270
 Those intense times that I tried to become that 0.1% star.

673
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,160
 Two, three!

674
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,720
 Like sparkling bubbles!

675
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,970
 Hello, we are Sparkling.

676
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,870

677
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:36,100
 A time of emptiness spent eating away the competition and comparison.

678
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,820
 Hello, we are the always happy, Tea Party!

679
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,130
 Tea Party! Tea Party! Tea Party!

680
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,220
 The countless moments of crisis that I've struggled with,

681
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,390
 to become a star through imitations and not as myself.

682
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,620
Straighten your shoulders. Keep your head up!

683
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,690
You practiced a lot. Don't be discouraged.

684
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:14,650
Open that door and show them who you are,

685
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,200
then when you come out, close the door and forget about it.

686
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,680
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

687
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,220
Fighting!

688
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,120
Let's go!

689
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,780
Fighting!

690
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,880
Did they go in?

691
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,270
What time is it? Why did you only just get here?

692
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,900
No... That's... SHAX...

693
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,100
I'm not even the manager. Why...

694
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,780
I'm so nervous. They'll do well, right?

695
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,450
You're laughing?

696
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,750
No.

697
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,100
 Lonely moments, armed with armor, hiding my fears,

698
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,930
 living a life not as me.

699
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:08,620
How is there no one that's worth anything?

700
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:14,800
 Time of temptation and frustration that has been constantly pushed by anxiety about the future!

701
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,120
Hey! Again!

702
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,120

703
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,780
 SHAX! SHAX!

704
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,540
Ryeok!

705
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,030
 La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma!

706
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,390
 Tea Party!

707
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,830
Your coffee is ready.

708
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,980
Thank you.

709
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,660
Yeah!

710
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,400
Thank you.

711
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,340
Hello, Sunbaenim!

712
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,710
You need to bow down lower.

713
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,770
Hey! Where'd you learn such rude things?

714
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:58,780
I learned it from you.

715
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,770
Enough!

716
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,680
Sit, sit!

717
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,630
There's a chair over there.

718
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,350
What do you guys want to drink?

719
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,000
- It's too small now, it's cramped. 
 -  I want an iced vanilla latte.

720
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,280
Hey, let's all agree to one type of drink, yes?

721
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,320
Forget it. I'll take the orders.

722
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,510
Drink what you want.

723
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,830
Iced caramel macchiato for me.

724
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,260
Iced vanilla latte for me.

725
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,400
- Do you have pretzels? 
 - Of course we do.

726
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,960
I'll have an iced americano.

727
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,380
Iced americano for all of you? Okay.

728
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,200
Yes.

729
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,950
 In the moment of crisis, those who escape the cycle of calamity

730
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,620
 will meet again,

731
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,080
 and realize its meaning with a soothing heart.

732
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,450

733
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,390
That wasn't hard at all.

734
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:56,950

735
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,090
We've only had our pictures taken. We don't have any pictures of the two of us.

736
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,580
Oh my!

737
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,160
I'm sorry but can you take a photo for us?

738
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,790
Yes.

739
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,140
Alright, I'm taking the photo.

740
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,480
One, two.

741
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,320
Say cheese!

742
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,080
I'll take one more.

743
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,220
One, two.

744
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,210
- Thank you. 
 - I'm a huge fan.

745
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,180
Thank you.

746
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,560
Here, check it.

747
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,340
The weather is nice,

748
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,580
and the sky is amazing.

749
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,970
 There is a star by my side right now.

750
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:58,440
 Even if it's not fancy or big, we now know that

751
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,420
 countless stars in space are shining with their own sparkle.

752
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:07,950
 We’re all already shining stars now.

753
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:16,020
