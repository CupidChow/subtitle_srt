1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,440

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,360

3
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,340
Sunbaenim!

4
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,930
Once I have your signature, it'll be complete.

5
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:19,960

6
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,330
What was that? Is he just leaving like that?

7
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,900
After seeing unni Annie's picture?

8
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,850
As soon as our talk is over... Ryeok goes right into action.

9
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,750
What do you think he's doing?

10
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,090
It's Friday night!

11
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,360
No way—

12
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,370
Ryeok!

13
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,540
Why are you already back?!

14
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,460
It's Friday night!

15
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,400
They're the same.

16
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,840
Sunbaenim, what's wrong?

17
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,670
By any chance, are you in contact with Annie?

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,810
Ma Ha. Are you listening?

19
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,910
Annie is no longer here...

20
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,760
on this earth.

21
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,860
  The dead body found in the Han River. I heard it was an Omega III trainee.

22
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,190
  My daughter... What am I going to do?

23
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,110

24
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:19,010
We heard about Annie's incident the day when Omega III was going to debut.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,060
Sunbaenim!

26
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,080
Yes.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,460
But what's the matter?

28
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,540
You left so suddenly, and now you're asking about Unnie Annie...

29
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,460
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,410
I'll call you after I'm done with tomorrow's filming.

31
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,910
I'll tell you the details when we meet in person.

32
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,070
Lia.

33
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,080
You scared me.

34
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,620
Ma Ha has something to say.

35
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,630
What is it?

36
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,350
What kind of person was Unni Annie?

37
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,970
Why are you asking about her all of a sudden?

38
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,490
I was just curious.

39
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,270
Just curious?

40
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,370
Why? What's going on? Well?

41
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,400
Kwon Ryeok leaving like that earlier... Is something wrong?

42
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,990
It's nothing! Don't worry about it.

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,190
NOG is totally hot these days.

44
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,570
But a scandalous tip-off at a time like this...

45
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,470
It's been three years now,

46
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,470
who would want to tell people about Annie's story?

47
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,170
The timing of the tip-off that Eun Jo came to Korea, and

48
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,780
the timing of this tip-off is strangely coincidental.

49
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,430
It's probably nothing.

50
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,320
Is that so?

51
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,620
I guess I'll have to match the puzzle well, right?

52
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,380
 The coffee tastes great.

53
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,990

54
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,320
Comeback stage.

55
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,690

56
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,370
The day that Eun Jo disappeared.

57
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,320
♫  Stop bothering me  ♫

58
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,910
♫  With your jokes.  ♫

59
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,230
♫  Please, leave me alone.  ♫

60
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,510
♫  Please stop put away your honeyed words.   ♫

61
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,660
♫  This time is different.  ♫

62
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,470
♫  Please, it is no use anymore.  ♫

63
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,790

64
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,200
Eun Jo's birthday. 0814.

65
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,530

66
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,770
SHAX debut day. 0404.

67
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,940

68
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,820
The day Fins was founded. 1214.

69
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,320

70
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,120

71
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,430
The only thing I know is SHAX.

72
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,550
What happened?

73
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,490
Sunbaenim.

74
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,820
Yes, Ma Ha?

75
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,220
I'm sorry for calling you even though you might have been filming.

76
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,070
It's okay. I was happy to see Crow Tit calling me.

77
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,750
I wasn't able to sleep because of you.

78
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,590
That's...

79
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,800
Sunbaenim, I'll call you back.

80
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,660
Is this your company?

81
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,720
Hi.

82
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,410
Hi.

83
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,990
No, I mean...

84
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,630
Hello, Sunbaenim!

85
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,760
We have to film while Ryeok's condition is good.

86
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,260
Yes, I understand.

87
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,040
Give me a call.

88
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,180
You guys aren't really answering your calls...

89
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,990
Sorry!

90
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,420
Aren't you a little too immersed in your character, Actor Kwon?

91
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,940
You guys definitely fought. I'm sure of it.

92
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,780
According to Hyuk, you came home really early. Did something go wrong with your plan?

93
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,420
- Hyung. 
 - What?

94
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,840
What's your phone's passcode?

95
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,470
1234. Why?

96
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,030
Right, someone who doesn't have secrets wouldn't even need a secretive passcode.

97
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,730
Should I have gone with 0000?

98
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,800
Let's drink coffee. What do you want?

99
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,180
Go alone. I'm going to drink coffee with Ma Ha.

100
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,080
You guys didn't fight? You're confusing me!

101
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,260
I thought about setting it up myself, but thinking about it gave me a headache.

102
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,360
I won't wish to receive paychecks like Tea Party.

103
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,990
It's not like you're a philanthropist.

104
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,750
But make sure you take care of us well.

105
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,450
As I said, my only condition is that you take my juniors, too.

106
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,800
If not, then don't bother.

107
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,880
What do you think about my offer?

108
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,100
As expected... you must have a lot to think about with taking in so many members.

109
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,520
Well then.

110
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,490
It's not a decision for me to make alone.

111
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,800
Our company's shareholders have been eavesdropping.

112
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,280
Tea Party?

113
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,560
So you're saying the condition is to include the Queen Entertainment trainees?

114
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,690
And you're not going to receive a deposit?

115
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,610
You're saying you want to do this profit sharing that doesn't make sense?

116
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,360
Yes.

117
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,290
What's with those eyes of respect?

118
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,270
At your level, you could have gone anywhere.

119
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,120
I know. Any company would take me in.

120
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,850
But your CEO,

121
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,680
although he doesn't seem to have the means,

122
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,440
he seems like he'll be noblesse oblige. 
 (T/N: the idea that people with advantages should help others, a moral obligation.)

123
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,100
I think he will do his best as

124
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,050
a CEO of an entertainment company.

125
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,190
That is why I want my juniors to

126
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,600
be under the care of JH Entertainment.

127
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,360
What do you think?

128
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,040
I'll make sure to take the responsibility of the payoff.

129
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,610
Okay?

130
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,130
 ♪ I shine, I'm a diamond ♪

131
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,070
 ♪ Uh, woo, oh ♪

132
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,250
 - Let's practice it three more times. 
 - At least once more.

133
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,490
 Okay, okay.

134
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,240
 - I won't make a mistake. 
 - We don't have much time left.

135
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,050
 This is our last time.

136
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,170
  Good work.

137
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,750
  Cheers?

138
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,150
 For the success of Diamond.

139
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,830
 Hey, it's like this.

140
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,590
 Hoo tha ra ra

141
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,050
 This is it.

142
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,660
I liked music and dancing

143
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,380
and you guys too.

144
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,570
 Hyung.

145
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,180
Are you

146
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,790
really going to abandon Sparkling?

147
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,900
We aren't Sparkling without you.

148
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,450
 Yes, without you

149
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,560
I admit we are plain water, not soda.

150
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,740
I'm nothing.

151
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,650
Let's try again.

152
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,600
Just like old times.

153
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,840
We don't have a choice.

154
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,620
That means you also regret it.

155
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,010
Okay.

156
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,330
We will do whatever we can. You trust us, right?

157
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,820
Sunbaenim!

158
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,040
Sunbaenim La Ri Ma suddenly came to us in the morning.

159
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,070
- La Ri Ma? 
 - She says she'll sign with our company.

160
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,640
Bringing with her Queen Entertainment's trainees.

161
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,910
It's just like La Ri Ma.

162
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,310
I was really surprised,

163
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,500
and it was so cool.

164
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,960
Sunbaenim, please tell me now.

165
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,450
Why do you have this?

166
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,240
It's Eun Jo's.

167
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,740
Eun Jo and Annie were dating.

168
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,000
This is their secret couple phone.

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,870
I knew that after seeing Annie's phone at your place.

170
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,750
Then...

171
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,930
that means that this is Sunbaenim Eun Jo's phone, right?

172
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,500
And the one at our place is Unni Annie's phone.

173
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,300
Three years ago, Eun Jo disappeared just before our comeback stage.

174
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,470
He didn't even know he dropped this phone.

175
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,720
Did he disappear?

176
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,020
The articles said that Eun Jo Sunbae was sick so...

177
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,900
Three years ago!

178
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,080
SHAX's comeback stage.

179
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,690
MML?

180
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,350
- Right. 
 - October 28.

181
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,520
That's the day Unni Annie died.

182
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,360
I remember.

183
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,340
The magnificent lights of the main stadium.

184
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,100
Eun Jo disappeared the day Annie died.

185
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,950
What must have happened to

186
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,370
the two of them that day?

187
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,490
I want to know, too.

188
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,900
That's why I have to unlock this.

189
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,270

190
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,090

191
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,740
Mine's 1120.

192
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,260
What would it have been for Unni?

193
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,410
We're done after we record the vocals.

194
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,940
You don't know how demanding she is now that we're in the same company.

195
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,020
That's just like La Ri Ma.

196
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,630
Right.

197
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,820
You and me,

198
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,460
I think we are a good match on stage and for making music.

199
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,250
I'm not sure.

200
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,110
Don't you guys have to leave?

201
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,970
I also have a mountain of work to do.

202
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,740
I need you guys to give me my space back.

203
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,330
The practice room is so...

204
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,350
plain.

205
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,820
 - La Ri Ma! 
 - La Ri Ma!

206
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,040
 - La Ri Ma! 
 - Noona La Ri Ma!

207
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,680
 - La Ri Ma! 
 - Is this JH Entertainment?

208
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,770
 - Shhh, quiet. 
 - La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma!

209
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,920
 - Don't get excited. Cool down. 
 - La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma!

210
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,840
 La Ri Ma! La Ri Ma!

211
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,770
This is really something to see.

212
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,410
Who is this La Ri Ma now?

213
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,280
It's tiring, right?

214
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,570
It is all part of the job.

215
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,540
You're here?

216
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,440
It will be noisy for a while, right?

217
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,880
Where is the person who is the cause of this?

218
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,650
Practice room.

219
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,750
Look at that.

220
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,740
She's totally taking over the practice room.

221
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,370
I know, right.

222
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,260
Sunbaenim.

223
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,860
Sunbaenim!

224
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,140
Oh. What happened?

225
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,620
- How's the song? 
 - You just have to record it.

226
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,300
Also, this is our practice room.

227
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,910
Now it's ours.

228
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,100
Your fans are outside.

229
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,630
Many of them have been there since this morning. Aren't you curious?

230
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,200
When do I have time to be curious? MML is around the corner.

231
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,030
Ah! Of course, you're participating this year too.

232
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,400
Wouldn't it be possible for Tea Party to participate in the Rookie Group category?

233
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,300
Us?

234
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,060
From hate comments for being a copycat to the music show debut issue

235
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,590
and climbing the music charts. You did a variety of things.

236
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,850
It seems like there's nothing you don't know about us.

237
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,680
Of course, I know it all.

238
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,040
My lookalike. Composer of my song. And you...

239
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,750
Let's get closer.

240
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,250
Now, no matter what others say, it's your Tea Party so look forward to it.

241
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,480
It's been decided that this year's headliners will be SHAX and La Ri Ma again.

242
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,220
For the rest, we will discuss the list I have distributed.

243
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,760
Best Boy and Girl Dance group

244
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,620
will be Sparkling and Sha Sha Sha, who got the most votes.

245
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,370
Then we have to decide the best Rookie Group.

246
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,700
How about Tea Party?

247
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,200
Their debut song Show Me entered the charts, and

248
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,050
they've been active on radio and music shows.

249
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,610
The ranking on the chart was higher for MiniMe.

250
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,110
MiniMe released three new songs this year,

251
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,500
they are also popular as variety idols.

252
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,430
The candidates are supposed to be chosen only with respect to their music.

253
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,390
Thinking of Music is My Life, I immediately thought of Tea Party's broadcast accident.

254
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,400
When the MR got cut,

255
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,140
they dramatically changed the worst stage,

256
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,450
it was impactful compared to other newbies.

257
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,820
Figures.

258
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,640
The impact of the return of Omega III's Call Me was also huge.

259
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,330
Does anyone want to recommend any other group?

260
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,700
Yes, yes, thank you. Yes.

261
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,220
You came at the right time.

262
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,150
Sparkling is going on MML.

263
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,280
What happened in the audition to replace Hyun Oh?

264
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,760
There is no time, so get it ready quickly.

265
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,790
Actually, I came by because I have something to say about that.

266
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,420
Come in.

267
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,580
What is it with you?

268
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,350
I am sorry CEO Kim.

269
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,870
"I am sorry CEO Kim"?

270
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,720
Please let me remain a part of Sparkling.

271
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,100
I won't go to the club ever again, and I won't I fight with people.

272
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,950
I won't date uselessly either.

273
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,280
If you are going to be so outspoken—

274
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,250
Just once, give him a chance.

275
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,030
Chance?

276
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,430
We are sorry.

277
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,190
Alright, raise your heads.

278
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,410
I will decide based on how you practice for MML.

279
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,630
Understood?

280
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,690
Thank you.

281
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,110
Hurry and go practice!

282
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,470
Yes, sir!

283
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,080
Have you not been able to do it yet?

284
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,370
No.

285
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,790
I cannot unlock it.

286
00:21:53,790 --> 00:22:00,890
If it is a phone only the two of them used, they must have used a passcode that others would not guess easily.

287
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,810
I realized I don't really know much about Eun Jo.

288
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,880
He could not even open up to anyone properly before disappearing.

289
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,620
And I just drove him into a corner.

290
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,690
Just like us right now, laughing together,

291
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,010
breaking up,

292
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,820
and then getting back together because we missed the other person.

293
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,620
Were they also like this?

294
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,130
I could not understand Eun Jo back then.

295
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,990
He must have been really lonely.

296
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,830
Ma Ha, if it were you, what would you have used?

297
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,250
This is a secret.

298
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,770
My passcode is...

299
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,940
1120?

300
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,650
The day we first met.

301
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,480
 Let's become stars. 11.2013.

302
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,880
The day I first went to see 'Star is Born.'

303
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,820
Do you remember that?

304
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,960
Of course.

305
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,150
It's the day my dreams started.

306
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,640
It's also the day I first met you.

307
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,060
 Hello, I am Lee Ma Ha.

308
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,230
 I want to learn from the best dance team 'Star is Born.'

309
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,690
It's an important date to me, too, now.

310
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,030
November 20.

311
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,390
 I am sorry I could not tell you. It's our 3,000th day.

312
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,730
Is it perhaps that day?

313
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,180
What day?

314
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,070
He said that was the 3,000th day.

315
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,510

316
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,670
October 1.

317
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,740
The day Eun Jo and Annie first met.

318
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,990

319
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,420

320
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,850

321
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,670
 Eun Jo.

322
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,330
 It's me, Annie.

323
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,400
 Don't forgive me... for not being able to do more than this.

324
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,000
 You just need to eat with them, okay?

325
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,030
 Whatever they say, you just need to smile.

326
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,170
 You need to see how the mood is.

327
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,490
 It'll be fine.

328
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,160
 We will raise the kids to make a global business within a short amount of time.

329
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,170
 Why don't we conclude talking about the formal stuff for now.

330
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:36,610
 I thought if I just close my eyes once, it would not be a big deal.

331
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,220
 That it would not be a big deal at all.

332
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,610
 Come quickly.

333
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,700
 Where are we?

334
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,190
 You said I just had to have a meal.

335
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,150
 Just show your face for a moment.

336
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,600
 I don't want to. I am going.

337
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,410
 Hey! "I don't want to"?

338
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,300
 Am I doing this for my own good?

339
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,910
 If I knew it was a place like this, I would not have come to begin with.

340
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,630
 Are you not going to debut?

341
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,350
 It's not easy to get spotted by the CEOs of big entertainment companies.

342
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,330
 Just think of it as making a sponsor

343
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,660
 who is going to make it easy for the road ahead.

344
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,020
 I don't need it.

345
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,000
 Do you not care if Omega II does not make it?

346
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,630
 If you miss this chance too, you won't be able to debut.

347
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,860
 The same goes for Lia and Hyun Ji.

348
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,020
 Are you going to let this opportunity go with your own hands?

349
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,390
 It's just once okay? Ah, yes.

350
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:41,200
 I swear, I did not do anything that would do you wrong.

351
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,400
 You, don't even dream about debuting.

352
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,230
 This opportunity was so rare! How dare someone like you let it go?!

353
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,290
 I made it clear that I did not want to do it.

354
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,760
 Eun Jo from SHAX. I am going to let it go this one time.

355
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,510
 I made an appointment in a few days, so prepare accordingly.

356
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,750
 Don't think about wriggling away from this.

357
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,170
 Then everyone around you will be ruined.

358
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,980
 But I just could not get myself out of it.

359
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,340
 I was already sinking into a swamp.

360
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,470
 If you have come all the way here due to CEO Kim's connections,

361
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,960
 CEO Kim, CEO Kim.

362
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,640
 What has he really done for us?

363
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,520
 - Unni... 
  - No matter how hard I screamed,

364
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,900
 - Unni... 
 - Hey!

365
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,460
 it was a horrific swamp

366
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,680
 that swallowed up my voice.

367
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,960
 When I saw pictures that were different from what had actually happened,

368
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,290
 I got really scared.

369
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,690
 Because of me.

370
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,010
 If I destroyed you, too, Eun Jo...

371
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,480
 Unni! Unni!

372
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,040
 I would not be able to forgive myself.

373
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,690

 I know it's tough but I hope hearing this makes it better.

382
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,650
 Eun Jo...

383
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,100
 I cannot stay beside you right now.

384
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,350
 So you should forget about me, too.

385
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:38,000
 Next time, if we are born again... Eun Jo...

386
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,200
 I want to become an ever-shining star in your heart then.

387
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,200
 I am so sorry, Eun Jo.

388
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,400
What is this?

389
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,400
What really happened to Annie?

390
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,230
 He's talking to him for a long time.

391
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,860
 Do you not know how important a time this is right now?!

392
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,200
 It is better to stay apart for the both of you.

393
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,740
 So just hold it in and wait till I take care of it.

394
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,040

398
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,140
 How can you be singing in this situation?

399
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,630
 I don't know what you are doing, but please don't do something that will hurt the team.

400
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,660
 Whatever that may be.

401
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,150
 I never did anything that would hurt the team.

402
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,220
 No, I couldn't.

403
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,830
 Both Manager Ji Hak and you

404
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,180
  are just worried about Shax.

405
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,320
 Because we're a team.

406
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,380
 You and I both put everything on the line for SHAX. And that's why SHAX is the way it is now.

407
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,180
 You already know that as long as you're in the team, it's not something you could hide from.

408
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,630
  - Fate... 
 - Because of your feelings...

409
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,730
 I'm telling you not to ruin SHAX all for a girl.

410
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,580
 If you need to let go of something, you need to make a decision.

411
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,630
 If I, or any other member, get into trouble because of you, then...

412
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,090
 even if it's you, Eun Jo, I won't let it go.

413
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,600

414
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,940
 To my love, Eun Jo. I'm sorry

415
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,140
 that I couldn't stay by your side.

416
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,510
This was it.

417
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,610
The reason why Eun Jo disappeared.

418
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,300
Unni Annie?

419
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,470
I think I can understand.

420
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,340
Unni Annie felt the same as you did.

421
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,090
Just the way you wanted to break up with me for me,

422
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,410
Unni Annie wanted to protect Eun Jo Sunbae as well.

423
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,070
 You should have dated someone at your level.

424
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,320
 You should have known who would be the one to lose more in this situation.

425
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,400
 Then I'm going to get going.

426
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,540
Alright, you worked hard.

427
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,590
We made a week's worth of sales in ten hours.

428
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,540
Then I'll step aside so you two can talk.

429
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,070
Is this something I need to hear?

430
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,520
I thought you needed to know. Or maybe you already do.

431
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:20,250
 Eun Jo, it's me. Annie.

432
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,750
 Don't forgive me

433
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,920
 for not being able to do more than this.

434
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,400
 To my love, Eun Jo. I'm sorry.

435
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,500
 I couldn't stay by your side.

436
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,020
I said those things out of consideration for their futures.

437
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,150
I always thought that Eun Jo abandoned SHAX, but that wasn't it.

438
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,960
I can finally understand Eun Jo's decision from back then.

439
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,550
Eun Jo

440
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,680
is in Korea.

441
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,250
 Eun Jo.

442
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,210
Ryeok.

443
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,520
How— How have you been?

444
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,760
 The fact that nobody recognizes me,

445
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
 it's comforting and I'm grateful.

446
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,610
It seems like you've been doing well. I'm relieved.

447
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,740
I worried a lot about you.

448
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,050
Before....

449
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,950
I received Ji Hak's phone call, things weren't that great.

450
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,480
I'm sorry. I listened to Annie's message without your permission.

451
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,600
So I thought I needed to give it back to you.

452
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,480
 I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise. I know it might be hard...

453
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,830
 But I hope you'll gain some strength after listening to this.

Thank you.

459
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,680
We can't let those people who did this to Annie get away.

460
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,810
No, I don't...

461
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,270
I don't want to taint Annie's name by talking about her anymore.

462
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,420
Eun Jo, but still...

463
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,560
What could we do? There's nothing.

464
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:46,660
Annie... I just want to keep the memories of her smiling.

465
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,650
Please let me do that.

466
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,870

467
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,230
Seeing you came all the way here, I guess something's up.

468
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,430
The anonymous informant isn't Eun Jo.

469
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,510
And Annie's situation... is a lot different from what you think it is.

470
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,240
Different?

471
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,820
I was able to listen to Annie's voice message.

472
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,110
Is there a voice message?

473
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,410
The last message she left for Eun Jo.

474
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,970
- You did meet Eun Jo. 
 - Let's leave it up to here.

475
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,140
I'd like it if we didn't look further into Annie's situation.

476
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,410
Eun Jo doesn't want that.

477
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,310
We have the key to Pandora's box, yet you don't want to open it?

478
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,010
Let me hear the voice message first.

479
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,730
Please respect

480
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,670
- Eun Jo's wishes to forget the incident. 
 - Respect?

481
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,710
Then what about Annie?

482
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,440
How lonely must she have been! How scared must she have been!

483
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,420
I can't let go!

484
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,770
Wasn't it already decided when you returned with Tea Party?

485
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,890
A decision not to create a second or third wronged child!

486
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,080
The sincerity to change without following the flow of the plate (to go your own way).

487
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,860
If this is not known,

488
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,750
the decision is nothing more than an empty shell!

489
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,840
It must have been hard. How were you able to get through it?

490
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,200
It was thanks to Manager Ji Hak.

491
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,140
 Did you run away so you could be like this?

492
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,740
 Well?

493
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,700
 I know you feel guilty, but—

494
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,340
 It's about time you come to your senses.

495
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,230
 And do what you want to do!

496
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,130
 That's what she probably wants you to do.

497
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,810
  That you shouldn't get hurt.

498
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,820
  She only worried about you.

499
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
 That girl.

500
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,930
  So live so

501
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,260
  others won't have to worry about you.

502
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,910
Did you ever regret your decision from back then?

503
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,860
If you're talking about Eun Jo from SHAX,

504
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,630
my decision from when I was standing on the lift,

505
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,420
I don't regret it.

506
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,130
I trusted you guys. And even without me,

507
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,980
I knew SHAX would still exist.

508
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,790
Even if I couldn't help stop Annie from leaving,

509
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,200
I would have made the same decision.

510
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,610
At that time, I was all that she had.

511
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,960
You might not understand.

512
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,580
I wonder...

513
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,340
I'm not going to throw a punch at a tough guy for nothing...

514
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,160
I'm not going to be a crazy workaholic either...

515
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,880
Above all, I won't do anything that would hurt the ones that are precious to me.

516
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,270
I couldn't understand you then,

517
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,080
but I think I can now.

518
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,420
Weren't you curious?

519
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,610
Curious?

520
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,480
I would hear about you anywhere.

521
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,790
- Don't get hurt. 
 - I guess you were worried after all.

522
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:31,230
Even if I didn't want to, everyone was talking about it. So how could I not?

523
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,710
I should get going.

524
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,460
Don't you...

525
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,490
want to see the members?

526
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,820
No.

527
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,180
How could you answer so quickly? So harsh.

528
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,800
SHAX is SHAX, even without me.

529
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,580
Jae Woo, Lee Hyun, Do Jin.

530
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,070
Hyuk. It's better that they don't know about me.

531
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,510
I don't want the members to be swayed by me.

532
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,590
I'm going back to the United States soon.

You didn't even notice I came.

00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,110
Did you have a good conversation?

542
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,250
I guess something is troubling you.

543
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,430
Ma Ha.

544
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,970
Let's not get hurt,

545
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,740
or break up, or cause each other pain.

546

Crow Tit.

549
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,560
 There's a lot of talk regarding the fact that SHAX is the headliner this year too.

550
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,200
Would they be MML headliners for the third year for no reason?

551
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,870
It's always those who have nothing going on that can't stand to see others do well.

552
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,050
So make sure to show them this time.

553
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,020
Why NOG is the best, and why SHAX is the best.

554
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,370
Yes!

555
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,630
There's not much going on with them, right?

556
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,110
Yes.

 It was very interesting.

 I will be writing the article according to the file that I've attached.

 After reading through it, please let me know if there is anything you'd like me to edit.

00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,780
The melody is good.

571
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,060
Are you already thinking about the album?

572
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,640
No.

573
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,820
What are you so serious about?

574
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,060
Why are you so concerned about someone else for once?

575
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,490
Sing it again. Are you done writing the lyrics?

576
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,500
I think it'll be good after some touch-ups.

I'm headed to the studio.

582
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,810
What song were you singing?

583
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,130
It's nothing...

584
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,350
The song is good.

00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,190

00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,920
 What was the song you just sang?

587
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,610
 I've never heard it before.

588
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,270
 Eun Jo and Annie's song.

589
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,440
 What?

590
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,080
 The song Eun Jo sent to Annie.

591
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,770
 It's the last song Annie heard.

592
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,940
What are you doing?

593
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,420

- Ryeok's song. 
 - Ma Ha's song.

599
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,430
Sunbaenim!

Ma Ha!

Eun Jo and Annie's song...

604
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,300
Do you want to finish it together?

605
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,320
Music has a way to move hearts and comfort someone.

606
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,640
That heart that Eun Jo wanted to show.

607
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,150
It hurts to see it left behind like that.

608
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,320
Because it's like Eun Jo and Annie,

609
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,880
I can't ignore it.

610
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,230
You're as cool as always.

611
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,600
Sounds good. Let's do it together.

612
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,740
Sunbaenim! There's somewhere you need to go with me.

613
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,770
 Hyung!

614
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,930
Hyung! Wake up.

615
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,990
Ah!

616
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,820
 What are you two doing here so early in the morning?

617
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,680
This... Lia knows it, too.

618
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,420
Yeah. That...

619
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,300
It's nice.

620
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:22,480
  Annie... I just want to keep the memories of her smiling.

621
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,750
What do you think about us finishing this song?

622
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,080
The mood of the song is so different from our other songs.

623
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,310
I still need the original composer's permission. I wanted to listen to your opinions first.

624
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,750
The original composer? Isn't this your song?

625
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,700
Whose song is it?

626
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,710
Eun Jo.

627
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,860
Eun Jo?!

628
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,210
What are you talking about? Eun Jo?

629
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,680
It's Eun Jo's last song.

630
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,520
I want to... send a message to the world with this song.

631
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,340
This! Whose song is this?

632
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,540
I went to the studio, and Lee Hyun Sunbae was singing this same melody.

633
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,180
Really? The same?

634
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,800
Yes!

635
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:43,210
This song... is by Annie Unni and Eun Jo Sunbaenim.

636
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,060
What?

637
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,140
Unni Annie?

638
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,070
Eun Jo?

639
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,220
Eun Jo from SHAX?

640
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:55,020
Unni Annie and Eun Jo were dating for a long time.

641
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,720
What are you saying?

642
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,200
Unni Annie.

643
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,720
She wasn't a person to have gone so irresponsibly like that.

644
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,320
 Yes.

645
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,920
I understand.

646
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,830
Thank you.

647
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,060
Tea Party, you guys really—

648
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,370
You guys are really the best!

649
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,450
I got a call inviting Tea Party as one of the rookie artists for MML.

650
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,600
What?

651

652
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,330

653
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,700
What? What?

654
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,800
What's going on?

655
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,190
That song?

656
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,680
Your order is ready.

657
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,610
That song is not mine anymore.

658
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,420

659
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,600
Yes?

660
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,540
Sunbaenim, we got a chance to perform on the MML stage.

661
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,930
Really?

662
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,450
Yes, MML.

663
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,340
Congratulations.

664
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,830
Tea Party's a star now.

665
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,590
Not yet.

666
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,390
You're going to be busy getting ready.

667
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,370
Practice starts today.

668
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,710
I'm really happy that I'll be on

669
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,670
the same stage as you.

670
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,720
Me, too.

671
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,740
I've always dreamt about it, but it came so soon.

672
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,480
So I'm a bit scared too.

673
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,520
It's your skills.

674
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,690
Like Lee Ma Ha, like Tea Party.

675
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:44,910
You know, right?

676
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,810
Yes!

677
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,860
Let's do this!

678
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,350
That's like Lee Ma Ha.

679
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,850
Cheer me up too.

680
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,210
Sunbaenim,

681
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,540
fighting!

682
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,370
Fighting!

683
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,650
 You need to understand the decision this time around.

684
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,710
  Weren't you being too hard on Eun Jo?

685
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,280
  - About what? 
 - The claim for damages.

686
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,630
  Isn't it obvious?

687
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:26,170
  Leaving without authorization, therefore disrupting the performance. Affecting team promotions.

688
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:32,040
  Taking into consideration all the broadcasts and CFs that were canceled... Wow... How much money did we lose because of him?

689
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,250
  But you still should've talked to Eun Jo in person—

690
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,710
  Even if I did, will the money we lost come showering down?

691
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,790
 Investment, time, opportunity cost, 3.4 billion won.

692
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:46,870
 The contract says he has to pay three times the amount, then at 10.2 billion won Eun Jo got it cheap.

693
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,240
 Park Jin Man!

694
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,100
  Ji Hak, don't get too angry.

695
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,480
 It's bad for your health.

696
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,750

697
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,110
  What are you saying?

698
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,860
  - About what? 
 - About you claiming for damages against Eun Jo?

699
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,330
  Isn't it obvious?

700
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,530
  If he caused damages, he needs to compensate for them.

701
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,590
  I will take responsibility.

702
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:16,640
  Who? You?

703
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,090
  Do you know how much it is?

704
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:20,010
  I—

705
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,030
 I'll take responsibility.

706
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,030
  So don't bother the SHAX members, Eun Jo included.

707
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:36,580
  The damages that Eun Jo caused... You will take responsibility for them?

708
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:40,190
  So don't touch you guys?

709
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,700
  Fine, let's do that.

710
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,540
  I'll have to write the contract again.

711
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,720
MML.

712
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:56,020
The team members are optimistic about re-signing the contract.

713
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,170
But Ryeok is still...

714
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,990
About Ryeok...

715
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:06,490
Let him be. Anything else?

716
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,010
There's nothing.

717
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:17,700
It's the last stage before re-signing. Concentrate on the performance.

718
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,620
Yes, sir.

719
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,350
Okay, you can go.

720
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,020
Ryeok.

721
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,140
Why are you here?

722
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,850
I was... just because.

723
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,400
Did the CEO call you in, too?

724
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,550
Let's talk later.

725
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,570
Why, is there anything—

726
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:58,170
Oh, Ryeok.

727
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,930
Your face looks really bad.

728
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:09,260
I told them to reduce your schedules. You need to take care of yourself.

729
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,350
What is it?

730
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,820
Talk comfortably, Ryeok.

731
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:21,830
I want us to prepare for MML ourselves.

732
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,460
Then what can we do to help?

733
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,950
We'll pass on the support.

734
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:38,910
As I just mentioned, I want us to prepare for it ourselves.

735
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:43,730
You're going to do something that you've never done before?

736
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,790
So inconvenient.

737
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,830
What is it that you are so concerned about?

738
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:53,150
Don't worry, I won't disappoint you.

739
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,700
Of course, you shouldn't.

740
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:00,950
You haven't forgotten our contract, have you?

741
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,850

742
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,170
 Only our numbers are saved in these phones.

743
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,620
 But there are some rules we need to follow.

744
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:28,230
 To talk only through this phone. Even if we can't reach each other for a long time,

745
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,540
 that we won't be too worried.

746
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,210
 You can't send any files or texts.

747
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,410
 And don't let anyone find out.

748
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:49,030

749
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,970
 I'm sorry.

750
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,880
 I like it.

751
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,550
 Secret phones only we know about.

752
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,220
 Secret phones.

753
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,130
♫  What if either of us  ♫

754
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,630

755
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,620
 I'm thinking about us preparing for the MML stage ourselves this time.

756
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,940
  What can you guys do without a company?

757
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,680
  Really? On the MML stage?

758
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,580
  Us too?

759
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,570
  Sunbaenim, I have something to tell you.

760
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,690
  We have to put the article out. We can't stop here.

761
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,630
  What is the contract we don't know about?

762
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,940
 Are you crazy?

763
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,830

♫  I would've given you everything.  ♫

764
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,470
  I think it will be really cool

765
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:37,670
  if you sing that song at MML.

766
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:41,330
  This MML concert is the last stage as SHAX.
