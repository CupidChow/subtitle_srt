1
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,990

2
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,380

3
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,790

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,730
- 1, 2, 3. 
 - Let's go!

5
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,870
 Let's get ready!

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,850
 Ryeok!

7
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,440
 Ryeok!

8
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,270
 Ryeok!

9
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,350
 Call 119!  
  (T/N: number of ambulance in Korea)

10
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,880
 Ryeok!

11
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,340
 Hurry and call an ambulance!

12
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,590
 Come to your senses!

13
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,740
Wake up.

14
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,890
Quick, quick.

15
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,610
 Ryeok!

16
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,860
 Ryeok, wake up!

17
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,490
 Wake up, Ryeok.

18
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,150
 Ryeok. Come to your senses.

19
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,690
Ryeok. Come to your senses!

20
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,870
 Wake up!

21
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,500
 Open your eyes.

22
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,780
Ryeok.

23
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,130
 Wake up!

24
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,510

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,230
Why isn't he coming out?

26
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,900
- Can you see? 
 - I can't.

27
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,880
There's no news article yet.

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,250
It's frustrating. We can't even go inside.

29
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,980
What if his condition doesn't get better...

30
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,090
Though I'm sure that's not the case.

31
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,680
Ma Ha,

32
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,220
if something happens,

33
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,570
there will be an article about it.

34
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,480
You're leading two different lives.

35
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,230
I don't think you've come all the way here for coffee.

36
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,450
You told me last time to look for all the evidence.

37
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,630
I was looking for them and ended up here.

38
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,570
Was that right?

39
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,030
Eun Jo is back in Korea, isn't he? Where is he right now?

40
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,680
You've come to the wrong place.

41
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,990
If it's about Eun Jo, it'll be quicker to talk to CEO Park.

42
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,970
Oh, come on.

43
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,440
CEO Park was only in charge of SHAX in terms of money.

44
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,250
At the time, as the manager back then, CEO Ji, you were the one

45
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,440
who has the big data behind SHAX.

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,670
Oh, seriously!

47
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,560
- I'm busy— 
   - Sorry,

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,840
  Kwon Ryeok from SHAX was in an accident.

49
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
  His car turned over while filming.

50
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,210
- What? 
   - I thought you should be the first to know.

51
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,410
- Is he hurt a lot?   
 - I don't know, but NOG must be blocking the news.

52
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,850
That's it for today. Something urgent came up.

53
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,820
Which hospital?

54
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,060
Hospital?

55
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,450

56
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,700

57
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,630

58
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,680
Yes, this is Ji Hak.

59
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,550
 Manager.

60
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,170
Eun Jo.

61
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,180
The stunt man was on call.

62
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,460
Why did you have him do something useless?

63
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,580
The stunt wasn't difficult.

64
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,920
Ryeok said he could do it himself.

65
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,520
Hey!

66
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,750
- Is he Tom Cruise? 
 - I'm sorry.

67
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,320
He brings us so much money. If his face scars,

68
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,350
- will you take responsibility? 
 - I'm sorry.

69
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,820
Take care of him properly.

70
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,100
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,770
Keep it from the reporters until tomorrow.

72
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,340
When you do, come up with a good story and hand it over.

73
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,810
His passion and spirit for the movie.

74
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,990
You know, right?

75
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,070
Yes, sir.

76
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,940

77
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,400
Yes, Ji Hak.

78
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,130
Excuse me, CEO Park!

79
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,400
How is Ryeok doing?

80
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,510
I'm Journalist Byeon from Fact.

81
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,210
Oh, Fact.

82
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,620
You sure catch up quickly. I don't know the details, either.

83
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,660
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, sir.

84
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,820
He's not that hurt.

85
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,300
Why isn't he getting up?

86
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,940
The doctor said he's fine.

87
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,560
He said nothing happened to him.

88
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,660
The doctor said he'll be okay.

89
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,120
Let's go out so Ryeok can get some rest.

90
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,420
How's Kwon Ryeok?

91
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,920
Fortunately, it's not that serious.

92
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,430
It was a car accident, after all, so we need to wait for his progress.

93
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,280
Those trashy reporters.

94
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,500
How much did he try to do?

95
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,240
It's clear he did it on purpose.

96
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,090
How long did he—

97
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,600
Did he even get any sleep?

98
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,750
That...

99
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,340
Cut some slack.

100
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,530
At least I've seen him.

101
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,510
- That's ₩135,000. 
 - Thank you.

102
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,380
Enjoy your food.

103
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,770

104
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,920
Are you really not going to eat?

105
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
You guys can eat it all.

106
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,290
Let's eat and clear up quickly. It will smell.

107
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,190
Yoo Jin's shooting all night, and it'll take a long for Dae Kwon to come.

108
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,150
Okay!

109
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,210
Where's Dae Kwon?

110
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,140
He dropped me off and left.

111
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,500
You were pretending like you're some big-time actor because you were filming all night, but you're back early?

112
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,550
Did it end because of Kwon Ryeok's accident?

113
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,180
Accident?

114
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,890
That bastard must have been showing off too much.

115
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,830
Anyway, that guy doesn't have any middle ground.

116
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,720
How can you say that when someone got hurt?

117
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,860
Wow, I'm speechless.

118
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,640
Watch what you say.

119
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,590
When was the time you were fighting him?

120
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,050
Oh, now that you've been filming with him, do you think you have some kind of bond now?

121
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,820
Stop it. Yoo Jin must also be shocked.

122
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,960
- It's a relief it wasn't you. 
 - Let's not waste our energy.

123
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,090
 Kwon Ryeok!

124
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,930
- Hey, Ma Ha. 
 - Yoo Jin, did you hear any news from the movie staff?

125
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,830
Okay.

126
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,770
If you hear any news, let me know.

127
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,330
What did he say?

128
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,860
Lee Ma Ha. There is nothing else you can do right now.

129
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,810
They are all crowding over there. Do you think you can go in like La Ri Ma? Can you do that?

130
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,810
I still want to be here until he wakes up.

131
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,890
You guys can leave first.

132
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,740
Your ears are red right now. And your lips are blue.

133
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,720
Do you want to be hospitalized, too?

134
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,130
Ma Ha, remember tomorrow is the first day of the sitcom's shooting.

135
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,190
Let's go home.

136
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,470
If you don't go, we can't go, either.

137
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,240
I mean, we won't go.

138
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,190
What do you want to do?

139
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,270
 La Ri Ma!

140
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,450
Why is that girl here?

141
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,670

142
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,870
Lee Hyun,

143
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
I fell asleep.

144
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,060
- Where are the others? 
 - They went to their schedules.

145
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,090
How is Ryeok doing?

146
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,810
There is no bad news, so we'll just have to keep watching.

147
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,810
That's a relief.

148
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,560
- We should go too. 
 - Let's go.

149
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,880
Hyung!

150
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,630
We're going to go now, too!

151
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm so sorry, Ryeok.

152
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,690
I shouldn't have sent you to the countryside...

153
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,720
nor pushed you to do this movie...

154
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,540
I was pushing you too hard. You were saying that you would think about doing this,

155
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,340
but I still pushed you.

156
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,560
This is my fault.

157
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,360
I'll let you do whatever you want, so please wake up!

158
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,690
Do you promise?

159
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes, I said I would!

160
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,960
This is for real.

161
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,030
You said that you would let me do whatever I want.

162
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,630
I slept well.

163
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,880
Getting to sleep off all of that sleep loss that piled up feels refreshing.

164
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,300
What's wrong?

165
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,590
Did you cry?

166
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,880
Why would I cry?

167
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,560
I could have picked you guys up.

168
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,400
Is something going on?

169
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,280
No!

170
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,720
We came to see Ma Ha off for her first sitcom.

171
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,260
Ma Ha, good luck today!

172
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,820
Fighting!

173
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,340
Your face... Did you not sleep well?

174
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,920
Since it was my first shooting, I couldn't sleep that much.

175
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,960
Take care of your body.

176
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,180
Sorry.

177
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,590
Try to sleep some more on our way.

178
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,070
Okay.

179
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,490
Alright, so Ma Ha, you will be dancing here.

180
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,800
You two will look at her like, "why is she dancing this way?"

181
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,280
Ma Ha, can you try dancing?

182
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,670
Yes.

183
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,770
No, no, not seriously. Try dancing funnily, in a funny way.

184
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,230
That way, these two can give a reaction.

185
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,110
Okay, that's good.

186
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,740
 Rehearsal is finished! Everyone can eat, and we will resume shooting at 2!

187
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,690
She practiced so hard. Why would they suddenly change it?

188
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,090
 I don't know. Let's go.

189
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,400
Excuse me...

190
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,240
Are you okay?

191
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,070
Yeah, I'm always doing pretty good. No problem.

192
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,440
- I think she's asking about Ryeok. 
 - Ah...

193
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,710
Did he get hurt a lot? Is he okay?

194
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,230
You don't need to worry. You can see it later when it comes out on the news.

195
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,480
How can I not worry?!

196
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,980
Sunbae is hurt, but how can I not worry?!

197
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,790
Okay, okay.

198
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,410
 Hyung! What are you doing here?

199
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,040
How's Ryeok doing?

200
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,100
He woke up.

201
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,950
That's a relief.

202
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,700
What are you doing? Are you looking for someone?

203
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,110
Is Lee Ma Ha also done?

204
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,060
Ma Ha? Why are you looking for Ma Ha?

205
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,980
Hey, you guys, move aside. Hyung! Hyung!

206
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,550
Hey, Dae Kwon.

207
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,260
Hyung, I'm sorry but can I have two hours...

208
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,620
What?

209
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,690
There's nothing on the news yet

210
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,420
and the members say he's doing okay.

211
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,500
I just want to confirm with my own eyes if he is okay.

212
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,370
We found A, didn't we?

213
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,290
Yes.

214
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,760
Go ahead.

215
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,840
Surprise~

216
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,380
Hyung! What's the plan?

217
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,520
- Why are you guys here?! 
 - Let's go to the hospital.

218
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,210
 They're here! They're here!

219
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,310
 Stop!

220
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,260
Only ten minutes! Only to confirm that he's alive.

221
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,470
If Ma Ha comes in...

222
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,850
I should be lying down here

223
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,080
pretending to be hurt,

224
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,140
and then slowly get up,

225
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,630
and then she would ask if I'm okay.

226
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,170
For such a big accident, the injuries are minor. Did I make you worry, Ma Ha?

227
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,730
Thank you for coming.

228
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,900
Sunbaenim...

229
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,720
They said you weren't hurt that badly...

230
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
then why are you like this?

231
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,690
There's still something I haven't told you yet.

232
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,500
Since back then, I actually was a really, really big fan of yours.

233
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,470
When the manager abandoned me,

234
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,170
I wasn't cold at all because you walked with me.

235
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,640
And when you asked me if all I knew was to imitate La Ri Ma,

236
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
I didn't hate you.

237
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,270
Sunbaenim, you held my hand.

238
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,690
You danced with me.

239
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,130
So please wake up soon!

240
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,500
You have to give me my pouch.

241
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,740
Sunbaenim, I wanted to see you.

242
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,150
I prayed so much that the kiss scene would be picked as the best scene.

243
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,720
I like you, Sunbaenim.

244
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,880
I like you a lot.

245
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,880
You mean it, right?

246
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,660
Did you mean what you said?

247
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,750
Sunbaenim.

248
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,110
So that—

249
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,600
Well...

250
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,890
Here, take a really deep breath.

251
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,160
You just need to hold your breath and cover your ears like this.

252
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,100
Just like how you wanted to personally give me my coat,

253
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,220
I wanted to personally give you your pouch.

254
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,260
 I missed you.

255
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,820
I also like you Lee Ma Ha.

256
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,440
In my heart, my best scene was this.

257
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,970
There was a car accident during the filming, and he was promptly sent to the emergency room, where he received treatment.

258
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,010
From now on, the SHAX members will be with him through his recovery.

259
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,180
From here on out, so he can get the medical help he needs and for him to rest,

260
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,410
please refrain from further articles about this matter.

261
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,950
 How is Kwon Ryeok's condition right now?

262
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,560
- Has he regained consciousness? 
 - Yes.

263
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,930
Yes, we will end the interview here.

264
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,220
 Please tell us more!

265
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,030

266
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,010
Hello?

267
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,170
Did you get home safely?

268
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,340
Yes.

269
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,210
I miss you.

270
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,880
Why aren't you responding?

271
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,410
Hello? Ma Ha?

272
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,800
Ma Ha?

273
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,140
I miss you.

274
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,920
Me too...

275
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,520
It's really late! You should rest.

276
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,790
She's cute.

277
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,570
Lia... Aren't you asleep?

278
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,670
Lee Ma Ha.

279
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,770
You looked like you were going to faint anytime, but now you're full of life.

280
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,060
What?

281
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,150
Seeing as you're coming back with blushed cheeks, it's obvious.

282
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,530
What are you saying?

283
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,490
You saw him, didn't you?

284
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,680
- Sorry. 
 - Really?

285
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,590
Why? Wait, how did you go alone?

286
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,890
Are you even thinking?!

287
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,800
It's not that... We are...

288
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,770
We? You and Kwon Ryeok? We?

289
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,530
No... I mean... I... I am... Sunbaenim is...

290
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,910
What are you going to do?

291
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,120
There is something between you and Kwon Ryeok for sure.

292
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,470
What can there be? There's nothing yet...

293
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,970
What about Hyun Ji?

294
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,910
Are you going to tell her?

295
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,470
Lia! Look at your red eyes.

296
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,610
You must be so tired. What time is it?

297
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,330
Wait. What is this smell?

298
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,060
This smell on your clothing... Oh!

299
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,800
It's because I just bought this. Hurry and go to sleep.

300
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,840
Hurry and sleep. Lie down. I'll go wash up. Sleep!

301
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,860
- Oh. 
 - Oh.

302
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,290
Mission complete. We kept our promise, Ryeok.

303
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,970
I can't do this another time.

304
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,460
Let's just end it with this.

305
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,310
Don't look.

306
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,990
Make sure you don't get caught by the CEO.

307
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,410
It's all up to how you two behave.

308
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,940
Let's keep the secret between us for now. The more people know, the further it will spread.

309
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,920
Let's do a "fighting."

310
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,580
Don't look!

311
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,450
 Good morning!

312
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,910
 Welcome.

313
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,890
Hello... Who are you...?

314
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,860
I'm the part-time worker.

315
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,410
Oh, they finally found got one.

316
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,600
Nice to meet you. I'm—

317
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,820
Are you going to order?

318
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,560
Vanilla latte...

319
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,520
That's 5,900 (~$5.90).

320
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,270
I'm a member of Tea Party, an artist under JH Entertainment.

321
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,730
I'm a part-timer for Cafe H.

322
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,890
Tea Party or whatever, I don't really know.

323
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,430
The price for Cafe H's vanilla latte

324
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,170
is 5,900₩.

325
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,340
Would you like to order?

326
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,070
Ma Ha!

327
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,260
She doesn't give in.

328
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,910
- Boss! 
 - CEO.

329
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,350
You need to pay.

330
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,140
I had to, too.

331
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,140
By any chance, can I put it on a tab?

332
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,820
Since a reliable part-timer has arrived...

333
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,470
I will comfortably go do some work.

334
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,080
I'm going to get discharged.

335
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,860
You can't!

336
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,030
There's an order to things. Be patient!

337
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,860
I'm okay. I'm totally fine.

338
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,610
I'm worried about the filming for the movie,

339
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,390
I've been lying down all day and feeling stiff. I feel like I need to work.

340
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,670
I can see through it all. Do you think I don't know what you're thinking about?

341
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,020
Don't you dare move!

342
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,750
- Really? 
 - Let's just rest for a few days!

343
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,530
I said I'm going out!

344
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,910
Don't go. I said, I can't let you go like this!

345
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,600
Stop blocking my way.

346
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,210
Please!

347
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm not going back!

348
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,570
There's an order to things, you crazy!

349
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,160
Accidents can happen unexpectedly, but

350
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,890
Jae Woo, you need to pay more attention to the group.

351
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,190
Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

352
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,770
Dae Kwon does supervise, but

353
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,360
he's too nice of a person. I can't trust him completely.

354
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,230
Yes.

355
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,330
Jae Woo, you and Ryeok are at different levels.

356
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,100
Yes, I know.

357
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,930
As the team leader, make sure to keep your position well.

358
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,130
Make sure to report immediately if there's anything we need to know about.

359
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,890
I'll make sure you have nothing to worry about.

360
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,940
Alright. Hold on.

361
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,220

362
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,360
Yes?

363
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,470
Does it make sense that an injury ends in a day?

364
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,880
Get it together,

365
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,360
and keep him in the hospital.

366
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,750
What am I supposed to do with guys like that?

367
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,860
What I mentioned earlier...

368
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,110
Yes, I've scheduled a meeting.

369
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,010
  What are you doing?

370
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,360
  I've been told to rest, so I'm still at the hospital.

371
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,980
  Don't worry, I'll be discharged in two days.

372
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,320
  Ma Ha, wait for two days.

373
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,750
 I'm on my way to my schedule. It must be frustrating.

374
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,760
 Think of it as a nice break and hold on for two more days. Cheer up!

375
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,370
Have you learned all your lines?

376
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,840
I memorized everything completely.

377
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
And the dance?

378
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,810
I'll do my best!

379
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:28,520
Your lines and the dance are not a problem, but I'm worried.

380
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,940
As long as you don't show your feelings too much.

381
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,500
There are a lot of eyes and talks there.

382
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,950
I'll make sure what you're worried about won't happen.

383
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,410
Ma Ha, I've no intention of interfering,

384
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,290
but... always keep this in mind.

385
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,590
That you're more precious than anyone else.

386
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,810
No matter what happens, you must not forget that.

387
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,500
I treasure you more than your feelings.

388
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,010
Got it.

389
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,020
Stingy. I'm not looking!

390
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,140
Isn't she cute?

391
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,550
Are you bragging to someone who has never dated?

392
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,520
What should I reply with?

393
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,860
What's the problem?

394
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,270
I'm a bit frustrated because there's no one here but you.

395
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,740
Here, a heart. What should I send next?

396
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,430
Isn't it the same?

397
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,650
What am I talking about with you?

398
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,520
Like this!

399
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,350
What are you doing?

400
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,760
At least it's sent now.

401
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,290
That's why he has never dated.

402
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,980
  Hey!

403
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,070
Okay.

404
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,780
 Ma Ha.

405
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,700
You're contacting Ryeok, right?

406
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,670
Noona, things progressed quickly.

407
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,370
Don't forget it needs to be done quietly.

408
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,900
Remember?

409
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,910
I never forget.

410
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,830
Thank you.

411
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,620
From now on,

412
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,670
while dating him, if you ever feel frustrated or think, "This isn't it."

413
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,680
Knock anytime.

414
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Our Hyung is more immature than you would think.

415
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,090
Pure! He's innocent.

416
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,640
Yes, innocent.

417
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
- Innocent. 
 - Pure.

418
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,530
Okay, I'll knock sometimes.

419
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,390
Sounds good. Whenever.

420
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,750
What do you mean pure?

421
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,470
He's getting discharged from the hospital today.

422
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,390
 NOG asked us to publish this.

423
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,340
I knew he was alright.

424
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,490

425
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,250

426
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,660
We're home.

427
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
Guys!

428
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,370
Hey.

429
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,420
You've worked hard.

430
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,760
Yeah.

431
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,430
I mean...

432
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,310
He's back from the dead and you guy are—

433
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,260
Those punks.

434
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,510
It's hard for them, too. Stop it.

435
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,370
Okay. Go in.

436
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,920
My god!

437
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,260
 Congratulations on being released from the hospital!

438
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,490
 Don't startle people like that.

439
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,380
 Congratulations on getting released from the hospital.

440
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
When did they do all this?

441
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,520
  Don't get hurt, Hyung.

442
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,070
  Don't hurt from now on.

443
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,030
  I'm sorry.

444
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,720
Ignore what I said about being punks!

445
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
It's Ryeok.

446
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,330
 Oppa!

447
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,100
 Oppa!

448
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,420
 Oppa!

449
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,200
What to do!

450
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,340
Oppa!

451
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,320
Are you okay?

452
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,240
Yes.

453
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,520
Thank you.

454
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,310
Thanks.

455
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,460
What's this, you're hurt.

456
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,300
Oh, no.

457
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,570
Here, here. Step back!

458
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,240
So...

459
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,470
Thanks for worrying about me,

460
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,960
but I'm...

461
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,360
Better than you think.

462
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,850
I'm fine.

463
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,550
So cheer up!

464
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,760
Let's all cheer up.

465
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,100
Cheer up.

466
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,190
Yes, cheer up.

467
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,390
Cheer up.

468
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,630
What was that?

469
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,200
Is he still in shock?

470
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,360
Why is his head?

471
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,100
What's this sticky feeling?

472
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,990
"Cheer up"?

473
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,500
You should cheer up. You look crazy. I told you to watch your expressions.

474
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,630
Fine, I'm sorry. Stop nagging. I'm actually about to go crazy.

475
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,150
Are you feeling better?

476
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,820
Yeah, I'm fine.

477
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,640
 Congratulations!

478
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,210
 I don't see why you need to act this way, even if you're a sunbae.

479
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,330
Just a minute Dae Kwon.

480
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,900
Excuse me,

481
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,860
do you like Ma Ha?

482
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,800
No, I used to.

483
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,800
 We've been friends for a long time.

484
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,630
Friends?

485
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I knew her when I was young, too.

486
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,120
I'm a friend to her.

487
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,680
Though I didn't feel that way.

488
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,740
That's why I used to like her.

489
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:10,460
But I plan to stay her friend for a long time.

490
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,490
What?

491
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,720
Don't let your guard down. You seemed too relaxed.

492
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,400
It sounds good.

493
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,940
Did you think about what I said last time?

494
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,990
No.

495
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,090
Why?

496
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,190
I didn't feel like I had to.

497
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,840
But why?

498
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,290
I think I told you I don't want to be involved with SHAX.

499
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,570
I'll leave for today.

500
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,010
Okay, sure.

501
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,190
Hey...

502
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,150
Not as SHAX,

503
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,790
but think of it as just me, Lee Hyun.

504
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,830
What?

505
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,150
Think about it a little.

506
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,270
She does not give me a chance.

507
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,100
Hyung! It's this vibe we have going.

508
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,950
You know that... You wouldn't know.

509
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,250
Be careful.

510
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,990
Get some sleep.

511
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,010
- Hyung... 
 - What now?

512
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,760
Okay.

513
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,410
They say to lend your wife but not your car.

514
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,540
You don't have a wife.

515
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,350
Ryeok, Ryeok. Gently, gently!

516
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,270
You better not get a scratch on it.

517
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,970
Gently...

518
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,700
Seatbelt.

519
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,250
Yes.

520
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,840
Let's go.

521
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,220
Our first date.

522
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,170
 It's here, quiet and secluded.

523
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,340
Right, it is quite secluded.

524
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,650
But... they apparently take photos from across the river.

525
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,760
Across... the river?

526
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,680
Crow tit,

527
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,830
shall we kiss?

528
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,540
Oh, my!

529
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,630
Sure.

530
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,410
No.

531
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,410
Here.

532
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,360
A must-go holy place for dating.

533
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,620
 It's literally a holy place.

534
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,580
Let's go.

535
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,570
 Going on a drive is nice, right?

536
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,040
 Yeah, but the scenery is the same.

537
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,370
 I drive well, don't I?

538
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,410
 You are great at making turns.

539
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,940
 Sunbaenim... do you possibly have any medicine for motion sickness?

540
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,820
You were just on cloud nine with your excitement. Why are you moping again?

541
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,760
I really don't know.

542
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,180
You have a commercial shoot tomorrow, so sleep well. I'll wake you up at eight tomorrow.

543
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,470
Be punctual! Maintain your face!

544
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,610
I won't let you use the excuse of being sick twice.

545
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,490
Bye.

546
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,230
It's not easy, is it?

547
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,760
That's right. It's not easy.

548
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,670
You have to look out for Dae Kwon. You don't have any place to go to, neither any time on your hands.

549
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,350
You were just excited and all blown up till your bubble broke.

550
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,610
There was nowhere to go, so I just drove for two hours.

551
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,780
You didn't go to Han River, right?

552
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,510
That place is off-limits. No, no, no.

553
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,050
You know, they stake out there for all hours, right?

554
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,270
We didn't go there.

555
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,710
What about the arboretum? It's quiet and—

556
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,940
No way! An actor couple got busted there last week.

557
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,350
It's a known place now.

558
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:35,090
Wait, that means you just went round and round for your first date?

559
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,130
Round and round?

560
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,990
Want some help?

561
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,350
Help?

562
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,160
Should we help out this once?

563
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,130
March forward!

564
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,380
Forward!

565
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,740
 What are you so happy about?

566
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,450
Startled me.

567
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,510
Is something going on with you?

568
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,560
What is?

569
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,370
Is something troubling you?

570
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,720
Tell me. I'll listen.

571
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,550
So there's an A and a B.

572
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,090
- Hold on. 
 - Why?

573
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,650
- Use C and D. 
 - Why?

574
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,700
Because A and B already have a happy ending.

575
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,370
Go with C and D.

576
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,770
Okay, sure.

577
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,000
So there's C and D.

578
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,110
C is aggravating and annoying, but it's not exactly disliking.

579
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,170
Hold on. Things don't work out? Do you keep getting concerned?

580
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,210
Yes. Yes!

581
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,150
What am I supposed to do?

582
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,210
Hyung, please pick me up at five tomorrow. Be punctual.

583
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,720
 What? What do you mean five o'clock?

584
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,880
Oh, no, make it four. Four o'clock! I'll see you then.

585
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,250
Are you filming a drama in the middle of the night?!

586
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,250
Make sure to be there on time!

587
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,310
 Psycho!

588
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,610
Hello?

589
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,790
What are you suddenly doing here at this time?

590
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,900
What if someone sees?

591
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,030
Who is going to see?

592
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,520
Did you put on makeup?

593
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,150
In case someone saw...

594
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,360
Look at your arms. They are just rolling.

595
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,750
I saw your face, so I should get going.

596
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,080
- What? 
 - Shooting.

597
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,950
Hurry up!

598
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,830
I'll get going.

599
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,620
I said I know.

600
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,430
Hurry go, go.

601
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,280
We'll be late, go quickly!

602
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,930
 Leave quickly. We're late!

603
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,630
♫  To be my lover  ♫

604
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,210
♫  To be my lover  ♫

605
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,760
♫  To be my lover  ♫

606
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,940
Just a moment, please.

607
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,190
I am not having fun.

608
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,990
Unni!

609
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,620
Didn't he come yet?

610
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,340
Not yet.

611
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,770
But did you not say that I was filming together with Ryeok?

612
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,370
Hello.

613
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,100
 Are you okay?

614
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,140
I know you were hospitalized, but you should still be punctual.

615
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,560
Ah, what shall I say?

616
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,120
"I miss you."

617
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,150
"I am missing you"?

618
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,970
What are you doing?

619
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,740
What?

620
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,350
Who changed your aura like this?

621
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,000
Are you dating?

622
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,350
Is your silence a yes?

623
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,040
That's right.

624
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,210
- Who is it? 
 - Now, now...

625
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,620
I cannot tell you that.

626
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,380
Hey, Ryeok—

627
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,780
Since when did Ryeok start dating Lee Ma Ha?

628
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,360
What?!

629
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,760
Damn, I asked you not to tell anyone!

630
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,880
Do you think I would have told her?

631
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,980
Bingo!

632
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,610
My hunch is never wrong.

633
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,020
Please keep it a secret.

634
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,140
I thought it would be me. It's a bit shocking.

635
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,250
I am waiting. Will you come to me?

636
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,360
But I am not messing around.

637
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,880
Neither am I.

638
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,360
Please keep this a secret. This must not leak!

639
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,170
Okay.

640
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,260
Kwon Ryeok, stop smiling.

641
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,010
You are making it too obvious that you are dating.

642
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,900
Hey, I'm in the wrong, right?

643
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,320
It seems I am the one who made a blunder.

644
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,340
Do I really make it obvious?

645
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,200
Why?

646
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,190
I don't feel like filming today.

647
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,480
Shall we begin?

648
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,750

649
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,490
Will he smile at me if I behave like Ma Ha?

650
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,420
 When do you finish?

651
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,650
 I am still filming. I won't be able to see you today.

652
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,410
Ma Ha, they are doing the next scene.

653
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,100
Yes.

654
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,960
Here, eat.

655
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,570
I asked you guys to eat.

656
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,820
You are going to lose weight anyway. Better eat and then lose it.

657
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,700
At least, that is how you will get motivated to do it. Sit down.

658
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,890
Excuse me, Sunbaenim we really appreciate the gesture, but

659
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,150
if they the company finds out...

660
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,820
It's okay because I got it for you.

661
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,230
The company would not say anything. Come sit quickly.

662
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:34,550
Then I will help myself. I was really hungry.

663
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,320
Are you not going to eat, Sunbaenim?

664
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,650
Am I the same as you guys?

665
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,820
Then...

666
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,420
 thank you for the food!

667
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,350
 Lee Ma Ha!

668
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,130
It's too late.

669
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,600
I miss him.

670
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Then you can just see me.

671
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,640
How did you come here?

672
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,420
Hyeok told me that your schedule was done.

673
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,410
How about not running away this time?

674
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,910
Oh? Are you not taking deep breaths anymore?

675
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,780
You were super embarrassed on the call, though.

676
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,940
There will be more things to make you take deep breaths from now on.

677
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,770
Where is this place?

678
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,790
Just follow me.

679
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,050
Put your mask on.

680
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,130
 Really?

681
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,680
That's Kim Ji Min!

682
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,020
Pretend like you did not see.

683
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,960
It smells and tastes great.

684
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,390
I can't believe I am drinking coffee with SHAX's Kwon Ryeok at this time in the morning.

685
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,070
 A star shining brightly in the dark night,

686
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:24,280
 started shining brightly next to me, one fine morning.

687
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,790

688
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,260

689
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,140
Oh it's so hot!

690
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:33,420

691
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,490
Where did he hide it?

692
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,500
Seriously!

693
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,910

694
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,690
Found it!

695
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,950
This is how you feel about me.

696
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:58,750

697
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:02,510

698
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,380

699
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,660
♫  Let me dance  ♫

700
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,410

701
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:14,500
 There is a problem. We have been caught on camera together.

702
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,490
 I had gone to the hospital that day to meet Kwon Ryeok.

703
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,190
 Do the others know that you are going around dating?

704
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,710
 Do they?!

705
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,950
 Please write an article.

706
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:25,570
 You will owe me one if I write the article.

707
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,420
 He must be really embarassed.

708
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,070
 It's our sixth year as SHAX. I want us to go till the end without being swayed.

709
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,070
 Guys, what do we do now?

710
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,770
 Both the article and the lawsuit, it's all your plan, right?

711
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,340
 I am warning you. Don't touch my kids!

712
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,700
♫  Don’t think so much  ♫
