Ma Ha will be there soon!

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,230
Here. Give me your phone.

20
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,210
It's confiscated.

21
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,940
Get your head on straight. It's war from here on out.

22
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,550
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,310
 Shax, standby!

24
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,070
 Ryeok!

25
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,910
Let's show them what we prepared and enjoy it.

26
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,950
Let's go have fun.

27
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,100
Just like Shax should.

28
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,200
Like Shax.

29
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,080
Debut, Shax!

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,370

31
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,290
 What are you talking about? Nobody's on the lift?

32
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,830
 - Eun Jo's not there! 
 - Go look for him!

33
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,360
What's going on?

34
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,750
Come out.

35
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,260
- What? 
 - Come out.

36
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,270
You get on the wire instead.

37
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,980
What are you talking about? What about Eun Jo?

38
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,060
Is your stage going to end like this?

39
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,690
You and Eun Jo are only here because of Shax!

40
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,350
Come quickly.

41
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,390
If you don't lead the stage, Shax will fall apart.

42
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,790
Eun Jo's another problem altogether.

43
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,520
Don't think about anything else. Think only about Shax for now.

44
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,540

45
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,630

Hello!

52
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,360
 Five years. 1,825 days. 43,800 hours.

53
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,990

54
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,230
 Everybody gets the same amount of time.

55
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,450
 That time is not enough for me to fulfil my dreams, no matter how fast I work.

56
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:28,730
 It's an era where a million kids are idol trainees, and the probability of debuting is just 0.1%.

57
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,290
 In order to be in that 0.1%,

58
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,680
 I'm throwing myself all into the time I have.

61
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,480
Attention! Keep your attention to the front.

62
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,540
Don't relax and keep looking at the camera until the end.

63
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,290
- Got it? 
 - Yes!

64
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,510
Okay. A five-minute break.

65
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,390
Thank you!

66
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,740
It's so weak!

67
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,670
Is this NOG? They wouldn't blast the AC for us.

68
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,960
They should spend some money! The electricity bill isn't even that high.

69
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,830
I guess we are Music Holic's property.

70
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,120
I know because I've been at a large company.

71
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,890
Their class is different, their class.

72
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,000
That class looks good, right? It's all debt.

73
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,630
Even if I rack up lots of debt, I want to go to a big company.

Lee Hyun forgets to eat when he works, so make sure he eats. Even if you have to force him.

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,950
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,930
That's Shax's powerful and cute but scary maknae.

90
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,890
From now on you have to take care of them. Figure them out quickly.

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,970
This place is pretty nice too.

95
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,340
Some companies don't even have windows in their practice rooms.

96
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,510
And they don't have vocal rooms, so they have to practice in the bathroom to get some echo.

Why are you worrying?

And you're so good at dancing. You're going to get in.

You're going to get in too, Ma Ha.

You worked harder than anybody else. Don't worry.

The choreography came out ages ago. Why are you still confused?

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,950
Sorry.

130
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,230
We got the choreography yesterday.

131
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,980
Fourteen days until debut!

132
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,730
You guys came all this way thanks to the CEO's connections.

133
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,900
After that, you have to do well so the CEO–

- Did you say you were 23? 
 - Yes.

141
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,110
How long have you been training?

142
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,100
Seven years.

143
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,980
You must have had a hard time.

144
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,150
I heard you don't have long until your debut. So why?

145
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,860
What did you do?

146
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,380
What happened to your faces?

147
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,930
As you can see, we listen to the company very well.

148
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,360
We were told that if we argued amongst ourselves, we should resolve it right then and there.

149
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,500
How on earth did you guys fight that you ended up like this?

150
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,840
I tried to stop them as the team's leader, but the differences in food preferences were too extreme.

151
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,100
Pouring sauce versus dipping sauce?

152
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,310
Sorry to interrupt, but don't people originally pour the sauce onto their sweet and sour fried pork?

153
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,450
I wanted to eat while maintaining that classic Chinese culture.

154
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,870
"Originally?" Fried food should  originally  be crispy.

155
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,730
The crispy texture is classic, right?

156
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,960
You have no idea what you're talking about.

157
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,510
You don't even eat sweet and sour fried pork.

158
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,880
Be quiet! Quiet!

159
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,580
It depends for me, but today I'm feeling dipping.

160
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,450
I want to "eat eat" sweet and sour fried pork!

161
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,400
Sorry, I asked you in vain.

162
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,570
I like everything, but men pour sauce.

163
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,680
Good job, good job.

164
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,830
Thank you!

165
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,810
Pouring or dipping. Did you make this mess over that?

166
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,020
They childishly poured the sauce before hearing me out.

167
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,580
Who are you saying poured it? It wasn't me!

168
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,900
Who else would it have been?

169
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,020
I poured it.

170
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,040
Nobody asked me, just like now, so I just poured it.

171
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,820
In the future, I hope you respect my opinion, too. Since we're one team.

172
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,810
Okay. It's all resolved! Hyuk is the most powerful one in our team.

173
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,180
And Director Ji is almost here.

174
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,030
I'll speak comfortably to you all.

175
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,350
Go clean up and shower before something worse happens!

176
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,890
There's a cafeteria in the basement that other people are jealous of, so why are you all here?

177
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,090
I don't want to waste a minute of time. We have to practice.

178
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,470
Do you fight like this every day?

179
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,690
- Annie. 
 - Annie, are you okay?

180
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,330
Annie!

181
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,920
Are you okay?

182
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
Annie!

183
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,990
What is "eat eat"?

184
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,110
We should have just eaten the pork.

185
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,190
Stop it!

186
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,760
Eun Jo, come see me.

187
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,630
What? Me?

188
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,960
We almost got into big trouble.

189
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,850
But they're still hanging onto us.

190
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,990
 Don't you know how important this time is?

191
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,080
 This phone has been turned off. Please leave a message...

192
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,110
Ryeok.

193
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,120

194
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,340
So the boys are all set.

195
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,710
There aren't any fresh girls.

196
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,120
This one is tall, and her visuals are not bad.

197
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,010

198
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,970
Look at her age. How long do you think we'll be able to use her?

199
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,730
Take out all the girls without marketable qualities.

200
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,550
This is a business.

201
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:00,510
We have to calculate who will bring us the most profits. How many times do I have to repeat myself?

202
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,170
Let's separate our work and private lives. Like a business.

203
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,860
What about her?

204
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,820
Her vocals and dance are above average, but her visuals and personality are a bit hard to combine.

205
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,930
Take her out.

206
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,080
Ma Ha learns choreography well. If we wait a little longer...

207
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,220
Tae Geun...

208
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,430
Tae Geun! This is a business.

209
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,680
What about sending Ma Ha to Omega Entertainment?

210
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,450
Omega?

211
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,590
They have ten days until their debut, but one of their members just dropped out. They contacted me.

212
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,650
Looks like she got the short end of the straw.

213
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,040
Send her. Make sure we're not at a loss.

214
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,380
Like a business.

215
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,630
Ma Ha.

216
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,590
Yes, sir.

217
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,800
Come see me.

218
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,080
If I go there, I can debut right away?

219
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,860
Don't be too upset. This could be a good opportunity.

220
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,100
Yes, sir. I'll go.

221
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,960
 Daughter, tomorrow's your birthday. Sorry I couldn't get you much.

222
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,480
 I'll send you that cucumber gourd and perilla leaf that you like.

223
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,630
 Eat well and practice hard.

224
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,040

225
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,710
 Let's become a star. November 2013. Fighting, Lee Ma Ha!

226
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,070

227
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,040
Lee Yoo Jin, if you're going to follow me, help me.

228
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,030
It's heavy.

229
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,670
Okay.

230
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,960
It was so heavy.

231
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,260
Are you okay?

232
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,390
I thought that you would definitely make the debut group.

233
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,900
Why would they send you to another company?

234
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,290
I just want to be sold.

235
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,360
- What? 
 - It's the first time

236
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,880
I got chosen.

237
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,510
I don't care if I'm just a stand-in.

238
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,310
It's not my choice, but the results are like this.

239
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,530
- I can do well. 
 - Ma Ha.

240
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,210
I'm a bit sad that I can't be with you guys, but you never know.

241
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,560
After falling from a debut group in a big company, I could go to a small one and make it big.

242
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,630
Who knows if that'll happen to me, right?

243
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,560
I'm sorry.

244
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm no help.

245
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,730
Why are you sorry? Whenever I'm sad or down, I'm going to call you and pester you.

246
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,770
Will you avoid my calls?

247
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:48,990
Why would I? Call me anytime. Don't go through it alone.

248
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,920
Anytime.

249
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,480
Yoo Jin, I'm going to take over the music show first.

250
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,920
Just watch out. You're all dead.

251
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,730
Be well.

252
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,380
Why can't you get in position properly? The line!

253
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,540
It's messed up because we are used to a three-person formation.

254
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,770
Is Annie still gone? Is something going on?

255
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,820
Hey, don't say her name in front of me.

256
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,740
Especially you, Lia. Mind your words in front of the CEO.

257
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,160
We're going to debut no matter what, so get a hold of yourself. Got it?

258
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,920
Yes, sir.

259
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,910
From the beginning.

260
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,260

261
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,360
♫  You make my heart beat  ♫

262
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,630
♫   I know it, boy   ♫

263
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,500
♫  You’re so perfect, you’re my ideal man. You make my eyes are filled with hearts  ♫

264
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,340
♫   You’re the love--  ♫

265
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,790
Keep going. 
 ♫   Your whispers make me   ♫

266
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,040
♫   fall in love   ♫

267
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,850
♫  All day, I keep  ♫

268
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,190
♫  looking at the phone  ♫

269
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,710
Okay, keep going!

270
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,680
♫   You make my heart trouble me   ♫

271
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,860
♫  my boy, I want to hear your sweet voice  ♫

272
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,190
♫  When I hear your voice  ♫

273
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,020
♫  I melt for you, ring my bell. Whenever I’m by your side,   ♫

274
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,440
♫  I’m so happy, it’s amazing  ♫

275
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,470
♫  From now on call me, call me  ♫

276
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,490
♫  Really, 8282119  ♫

277
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,780
♫  I fell for you at first sight  ♫ 
 ♫  You will be my lover  ♫

278
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,560
♫  I’m so happy, it’s amazing  ♫

279
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,110
I'm sorry. I just wanted to watch.

280
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,890
Wait, did you just do the choreography just by copying them from behind?

281
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,710
You probably sent her the choreography video beforehand.

282
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,780
What are you talking about? The choreography changed yesterday.

283
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,160
I'm very interested in dancing.

284
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,110
I'm a bit good at following choreographies.

285
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,830
It's not just a bit. Since a new face is here, let's have a fresh start!

286
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,330
That was good. Yes, man!

287
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,700
Hey, this will work out.

288
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,580
What happened to Annie?

289
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,140
I feel sorry that there is someone new in her spot.

290
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,020
I don't know. I can't reach her either.

291
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,530
I'm not going to worry about someone who has been radio silent since discharging from the hospital.

292
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,510
But still.

293
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,560
- By the way, will she be okay? 
 - Who?

294
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,400
I mean, this place is a mess, so people ran away. What if she does too?

295
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,630
For starters, let's be nice to her, so she doesn't think about anything else.

296
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,180
What if the manager shouts and curses?

297
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,320
He can't because our debut is near.

298
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,040
What about there being no hot water and cockroaches? Should we not tell her?

299
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,500
We can say the boiler is under repair,

300
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
and the cockroaches...

301
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,920
I can just kill them.

302
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,860
She'll want to run away.

303
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,060
I won't run away.

304
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,570
I have nowhere else to go.

305
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,820
I've risked it all.

306
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,530
I'm sorry I replaced someone, but I really want to debut.

307
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,500
I can handle cold water and cockroaches.

308
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,380
So please take good care of me.

309
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,320
There were seven people who disappeared without a word in the past year alone.

310
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,170
Don't be so confident without even trying.

311
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,720
But since our goal is the same,

312
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,100
let's do well.

313
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,620
Me too.

314
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,820
Ma Ha!

315
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,700
  Shax! Shax!

316
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,220
  Shax! Shax!

317
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,120
  Shax! Shax!

318
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:48,480
 On our comeback day, Eun Jo disappeared into thin air.

319
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,090
  Eun Jo couldn't be seen at all at the comeback stage.

320
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,970

321
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,690
Don't steal?

322
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,090
There was someone who stole everything and took off, you see.

323
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,230
This is the room where we'll all stay.

324
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,820
You can use this bed, though it might be uncomfortable.

325
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,710
- Thank you. 
 - Take your time to unpack.

326
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,630
Is this the old girl's?

327
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,550
♫   Omega 3   ♫

328
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,190

329
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:22,010
♫  You're for me baby. You make my heart  tremble. Oh my!  ♫

337
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,370
Omega 3!

338
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,080
Okay, good job. Let's move.

339
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,360
Is that it?

340
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,080
♫   You make my heart trouble me   ♫

341

♫  Oh my boy,  I want to hear your sweet voice  ♫

342
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,480

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,280

348
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,440
♫  I’m so happy, it’s amazing  ♫

349
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,870
I'm hungry.

350
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,500
Drink some water.

351
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,760
Thank you.

352
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,660
Hey, it's hot.

353
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,520
- Come here, come here. 
 - Do it yourself.

354
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,610
We're hot, too.

355
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,730

356
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,630
Hey, it's hot.

357
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,980
Okay, you do it.

358
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,500
What are you doing?

359
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,990
I couldn't sleep.

360
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,250
Me neither.

361
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,760
I feel like this isn't real.

362
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,730
I starved myself, but it's still tight...

363
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,570
It won't burst when we dance tomorrow, right?

364
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,820
Then it will be caught on the camera and remain as our embarrassing past forever.

365
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,840
What to do? I'm nervous.

366
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,620
Our Hyun Ji, may you beat your nerves and

367
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,210
- I pray you eat the stage up! 
 - Amen!

368
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,070
I overact when I get excited.

369
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:11,020
And please protect our Ma Ha so she doesn't overreact and fall onstage.

370
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,090
- Amen.
 - Amen.

371
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,040
- We're good, right? 
 - Yes.

372
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,760
If we don't sleep, our makeup won't look good tomorrow. Let's go to bed.

373
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,150
Right. The sun is going to come up. Let's go.

374
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,960
Wait a minute.

375
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,290
It's a really special night for us.

376
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,160
Shall we take a picture together?

377
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,950
Shall we?

378
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,180
Are you ready?

379
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,930
Waiting for tomorrow's sun,

380
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,620
Omega 3!

381
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,840
 As Ms. A's autopsy showed no signs of an attack,

382
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,360
 the police announced the investigation has been concluded.

383
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,220
Hello! We're the group that'll sweep across K-pop, Omega 3!

384
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,540
Someone's coming.

385
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,810
One, two, three! Hello! We're the group that'll sweep across K-pop, Omega 3!

386
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,640
Hello! We're the group that'll sweep across K-pop, Omega 3!

387
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,290
Yes, this is Ji Hak.

388
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,860
Hello! We're the group that'll sweep across K-pop, Omega 3!

389
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,600
The police?

390
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,660
What's your relationship with Jang Yu Ri?

391
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,590
Jang Yu Ri?

392
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,320
Annie.

393
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,830

394
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,540
Come in.

395
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,240
The body found in the Han River was a kid under Chief Kim.

396
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,320
It shouldn't affect us because they haven't found the connection,

397
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,460
but even so, it looks like Director Ji is being investigated.

398
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,090
He won't say anything useless, but if by any chance–

399
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,950
Ji Hak isn't one of us now.

400
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,360
It doesn't matter to us.

401
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,550
- Do you understand what I'm saying? 
 - Yes.

402
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,260
- So make sure there's not even a whisper of NOG. 
 - Yes, sir.

403
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,600
As for Shax's schedule, we will adjust everything that can be cancelled—

404
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,620
Are you crazy? We spent so much on their comeback.

405
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,290
Continue their schedule completely as it is. Contact Fact,

406
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,490
and have them cover up the big stories with the girl's suicide.

407
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,540
Tell Public Relations to put out a story that Eun Jo is taking a break due to illness.

408
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,820
Yes, understood, sir.

409
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,950
And also,

410
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,990
before we enforce the breach of contract,

411
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,700
pull together every cent we can claim,

412
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,230
- and send it to Eun Jo's parents in the U.S. by certified mail. 
 - Yes, sir.

413
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,020
Leave.

414
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,680
What is that?

415
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,220
It didn't feel right to come empty handed.

416
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,330

417
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,590
Here?

418
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,420
Is it okay for us to go in?

419
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,360

420
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,740
  - This is not right! 
 - Lower your voice!

421
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,470
  Let's talk after the broadcast.

422
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,000
- Hello! We're the group that'll sweep— 
 - Ryeok!

423
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,820
We are Omega 3.

424
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,780
Hello, we are Omega 3.

425
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,090
Yes.

426
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,740

427
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,990

428
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,750
Have you not received the fan club's official kit yet?

429
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,740
I'm a newbie so...

430
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:47,130
For Shax, you can only use the official kit and signs approved by the fan club.

431
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,330
Especially at concerts or music shows.

432
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,210
You'll have to do this kind of homework.

433
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,980
Omega 3, get ready for rehearsal.

434
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,420
1, 2, 3...

435
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,630
Hello! We're the group that'll sweep across K-pop, Omega 3!

436
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,170
♫   Omega 3   ♫

437
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,160
 Stop!

438
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,660
Why? What? What is it?

439
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,120
Omega 3 can't go on air today.

440
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,250
Why suddenly?

441
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,070
- The body from the Han River... 
 - What body?!

442
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,160
They said she was a trainee in Omega 3!

443
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,500
 Annie!

444
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,830
First, clear up the place.

445
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,720
They're asking if it's suicide due to trainee abuse. It's all over the internet!

446
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,790
How are we supposed to air our show with these kids on board?

447
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,230
Right, empty the set! Take out Omega 3.

448
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,790
Get the next team ready.

449
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,250
Sorry, please leave. Sorry.

450
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,420
Please bring on the next team.

451
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,800
 Shax!

452
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,930
 Sorry, sorry.

453
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,350
 Next team, get ready.

454
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,130
 It's okay. It's okay.

455
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,960
It's okay. It will be alright. It's not true.

456
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,540
Annie!

457
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060

458
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,440
Why do they jump into the Han river?!

459
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,960
First, take down the Omega sign.

460
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,340
Pack all our things without leaving a trace.

461
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,630
What should we do with the girls?

462
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,510
They were performing in events, anyway.

463
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,990
Let them be. We can make other girls like them if we have money.

464
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,760
After the unfortunate passing of 'Miss A,' an entertainment company trainee,

465
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,180
 there are growing suspicions about the possibility

466
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,080
 that she was mistreated by her agency.

467
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,200
 The trend of K-pop is rising, yet there is a dissatisfying side to it.

468
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,410
 Looking at this as just a money-making market,

469
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,530
 there are many entertainment companies jumping in without a proper system set up.

470
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,490
 The trainees aspiring to become idols sign a contract first,

471
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,210
 and their youth is used as a mortgage.

472
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,890

473
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,990
The Best New Actor Award, Kwon Ryeok for  Criminal City .

474
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,560
I will present the award. The 43rd Baekho Film Festival's

475
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,480
Best New Actor Award goes to...

476
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,430
Kwon Ryeok for  Criminal City . Congratulations!

477
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,100
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

478
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,230
  Mr. Kwon Ryeok, congratulations.

479
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:16,640
 He dominated the music industry and now acts in movies and dramas.

480
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,540
Hello, I'm Kwon Ryeok of Shax.

481
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,970
First, I would like to thank Director Im Joon Bong,

482
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:34,210
who looked over the prejudice of me being an idol,

483
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,420
as well as all of the other staff members.

484
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,560
My fellow Shax members, who supported me throughout filming,

485
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,850
and our Fins, who are like family.

486
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,010
I will pay you back by working harder. Thank you.

487
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,200
 And now for the congratulatory stage, Korea's best singer!

488
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,180
 It's La Ri Ma!

489
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,270
♫  This is frustrating. This is frustrating. We’re stuck in a strained relationship .  ♫

490
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,590
♫  Are you frustrated, too?  ♫

491
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,190

499
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,550
I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

500
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,100

501
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,900
♫  This is frustrating. This is frustrating  ♫

502

♫  To be my lover  ♫

503
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,410
 Hey! Don't do that,

504
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,290
and sing some trot!

505

510
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,280
Who asks to be paid in cash these days?

511
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,170
I'm sorry.

512
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,010
The company accounts are a bit complicated.

513
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,280
But this rate is really cheap.

514
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,780
It's fake. Of course, it's cheap.

515
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,330
What are you going to do about this atmosphere?

516
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,680
Our Ma Ha is a player.

517
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,200
Don't worry. The atmosphere will brighten up.

518
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,960
Hello!

519
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,500
I'm La Ri Ma's sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

520
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,600
Look, they're having fun!

521
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,070
Everybody,

522
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,360
your reactions are a bit lame!

523
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,910
I'm here.

524
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,010
Surprise!

525
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,700
Actor Kwon! Actor Kwon!

526
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,270
Actor Kwon! Actor Kwon!

527
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,280
Whoo! Actor Kwon!

528
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,940
Stop.

529
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,750
Thank you.

530
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,210
Hyung, did lots of female actresses come?

531
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,080
Who's prettiest?

532
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,550
I don't know.

533
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,610
I have to shower and go to a shoot.

534
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,380
They should remove some episodes!

535
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,870
Hey, I want to act, too.

536
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,850
What now?

537
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,000
Hey, grab this for me.

538
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,900
- What is all— 
 - Wow!

539
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,320
As expected, Ryeok is on another level!

540
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,210
You should have adjusted his schedule today. He looked tired.

541
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,090
He said he would do it.

542
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,600
Who can stop that workaholic?

543
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,940

544
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,820
Whew!

545
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,680
Yeah, Yoo Jin.

546
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,100
 Did it end well? Are you on your way to Seoul?

547
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,840
No. A movie shoot just came up, so I'm on my way to Mungyeong.

548
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,190
So you're busy. You must be tired. What's the movie about?

549
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,820
It's a historical one.

550
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,550
It's my first job in a while, so I'm fine.

551
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,540
You should still eat well.

552
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,530
Don't worry. Have you ever seen me starve?

553
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,970
- Why did you call? 
 - Ah, that...

554
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,980
- Your birthday is coming up soon— 
 - Practice starts soon. Come in.

555
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,520
Yes.

556
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,810
- Hello? 
 - Go quickly. Don't get scolded.

557
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,350
Got it. Good luck with filming and travel safely.

558
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,020
- I will call you again. 
 - Yeah.

559
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,980
 I'm La Ri Ma's younger sister, La Ri Ma Ha!

560
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,110
Wow, daebak. It's on another level.

561
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,320
"I'm La Ri Ma Ha!"

562
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,170
Awesome.

563
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,470
It's on another level.

564
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,050
Try hard?

565
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,160
- Smell? (T/N: smell and try-hard rhyme.)  
 - The way she dances and sings

566
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,870
are not a perfect copy.

567
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,700
Copy? Smell?

568
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,750
Hey, if you have time to watch these, go watch some reference stages and practice.

569
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,360
Jae Ho.

570
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,740
Gosh.

571
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,980
What's wrong with it?

572
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,690
What is the movie about?

573
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,380
Oh, what was it again? I forgot again.

574
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,360
A minor role opened up. If you do well, it could get bigger.

575
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,660
I'm a stand-in.

576
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,050
Hey. You got the role quickly, but you're not a stand-in.

577
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,750
It's okay. It feels good to be busy in a long time.

578
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,320
Just hang in there a bit longer.

579
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,480
Our Ma Ha will definitely do well.

580
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,580
Is it because of the rice wine I drank earlier?

581
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,240
What is it? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

582
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,690
I can handle it.

583
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,460
There's still time, so let's stop by a rest stop.

584
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,280
The air is nice and nobody's here. It's perfect.

585
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,380
There are not many people here, so go to the bathroom. I'll get something to eat.

586
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,130
Got it.

587
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,690
I'll go get medicine, so rest here.

588
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,150
Thank you.

589
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,450
I'm sorry, so sorry.

590
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,540
What is it?

591
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,990
Where have I seen her?

592
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,400
It's cold. Get in.

593
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,920
Yes.

594
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,790

595
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,220
 Our scene order changed a bit.

596
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,350
 Yes, if you could get here just a bit earlier...

597
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,120
Yes, I understand.

598
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,750
Director, the  kisaeng  role has arrived.

599
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,260
- Hello. 
 - You're scheduled for the afternoon.

600
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,280
You're here really early.

601
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,900
Have you arrived?

602
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,220
Go get the makeup done.

603
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,430
They said it would be a morning shoot.

604
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:14,050
It's better than being on a tight schedule. We can get prepared and wait.

605
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,180
And you never know, we might finish early.

606
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,740
That's what I'm saying! Our minds think alike.

607
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,320
Go get your makeup done.

608
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,930
Ma Ha, right here.

609
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,270
Okay.

610
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,500
Who is this?

611
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,500
- Hello? 
  - Hey!

612
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,150
 Did you think I wouldn't be able to track you down?

613
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,770
CEO, I was about to call. If you can just wait a bit longer...

614
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,640
If you just give me five days– Three days–

615
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,690
Hey, why are you so impatient?

616
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,730
CEO, please save me.

617
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:48,070
 You're in Mungyeong, right? Don't take another step!

618
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:52,470
I'm not in Mungyeong, I'm in Busan! I'm in Busan!

619
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:56,490
You promised to be here all day tomorrow. This messes up the entire schedule.

620
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,790
It's an interview, so there's nothing I can do about it. Thanks.

621
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,390
I'm going crazy.

622
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,530
- You can get your outfit over there. 
 - Thank you!

623
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,900
The schedule's all messed up because of Kwon Ryeok.

624
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,060
So annoying.

625
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,360
He always does whatever he wants now that he's made it big.

626
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,580
 So annoying.

627
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,350
What? Does Kwon Ryeok play the lead role?

628
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,010
Go, Kwon Ryeok, run!

629
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,450
Slice to the right!

630
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,170
And slice!

631
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,230
Get him with your sword and kick him.

632
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:07,240
Then stab him through the middle.

633
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,990
 The kisaengs can exit down to the right.

634
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,340
Let's go.

635
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,310
Swing!

636
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,490
 The camera will zoom in on Kwon Ryeok's right side.

637
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,920
 And run away! Go chase Kwon Ryeok.

638
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,030
- Let's do it. 
 - Please monitor it!

639
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,710
I'll explain it one more time.

640
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,220
When he comes up, everyone moves to the side.

641
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,870
When he stabs him, the kisaengs can exit from that side.

642
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,590
The movements are a bit long, so please come out this way.

643
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,520
 Don't be confused.

644
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,690
 Alright?

645
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,560
Yes, sir.

646
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,970
 Okay, from the top!

647
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,700
Two Americanos.

648
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,530
Thank you.

649
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,390
Welcome!

650
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,410
Your Excellency.

651
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,980
Your Excellency!

652
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,450
Your Excellency.

653
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,550
Your Excellency.

654
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,390
Your Excellency.

655
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,350
Your Excellency.

656
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,810
Your Excellency.

657
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,270
This is hard.

658
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,150
The sun will set soon.

659
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,920
 They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

660
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,400
Not one person can leave this place alive.

661
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,540
It's a bit weak.

662
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,590
They're throwing a drunken party...

663
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,530
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

664
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:56,750
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

665
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,490
Not one person can leave this place alive.

666
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,300
What?

667
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,280
Did the paparazzi get a picture of me?

668
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,770
Where did Dae Kwon go?

669
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,010
Dae Kwon!

670
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,030
One second.

671
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,300
Excuse me. Ryeok hasn't been sleeping well lately.

672
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,420
He has a rash on his right side.

673
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,960
So what?

674
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,920
You can see it. If the fans spot it, they'll go crazy.

675
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,350
So can't he swing the sword and get a close-up on his left side instead?

676
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,200
If you ask this so suddenly, all of the formations will be thrown off.

677
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,660
I'll ask him not to mess up.

678
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,690
Please, thank you.

679
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,980
It'll be hard.

680
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,830
Excuse me. Ryeok...

681
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,090
Then let's do that.

682
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,010
Thank you.

683
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,320
 His Majesty!

684
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320
 Do it once.

685
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:34,160
They're throwing a drunken party with the hard work of the citizens.

686
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:41,030
Not one person can leave this place alive!

687
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:56,370
Cut!

688
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,370
Are you okay?

689
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,810
Did you get hurt?

690
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,370
Didn't you tell them the formations changed?

691
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,470
Sorry!

692
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,430
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

693
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,190
I forgot to tell you. I'm sorry.

694
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,790
It's okay. I'm okay.

695
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,750
I'm fine.

696
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,510
Are you okay?

697
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,870
Yes, I'm fine.

698
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,130
Are you sure?

699
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,030
Yes. Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

700
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,220
Sorry.

701
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,640
Sorry!

702
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,920
Okay, then let's take it from the top.

703
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,630
You're okay, right?

704
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,950
Sorry.

705
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,000
Sorry.

706
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,350
Standby!

707
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,300
Nice expression!

708
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,620
Okay!

709
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,280
Thank you.

710
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,920
Good work.

711
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,950
Good work.

712
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,180
Dae Kwon!

713
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,120
- I'll hold it. 
 - No, no, I will hold it.

714
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,460
Let's go. Good work.

715
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,660
I'm sorry, Ma Ha.

716
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,840
I'm really sorry.

717
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,130
I was wrong.

718
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,990
It's cold.

719
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,570
Oh, my...

720
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,840

721
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,260

722
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:39,000

723
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,020
Hello. I'm Lee Ma Ha.

724
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,460
I want to learn dance from the best team, "Star is Born."

725
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:04,800
We don't just accept anybody. Go.

726
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,390

727
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,530
 Even if you're okay right now, you will catch a cold from all the sweat.

728
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:17,930
 Did you know?

729
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,430
 I got a weird call earlier.

730
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,900
 JH Entertainment?

731
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,860
 Didn't Shax originally have six members?

732
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,780
 Is there no possibility that Eun Jo will return?

733
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,540
 If you three are okay with it, I'd like to work with you.

734
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,460
 - He's a scammer. 
 - Is it voice phishing?

735
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,530
 The only thing you know how to do is to imitate La Ri Ma?

736
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,180
 Just one year. I want to extend my dream one more year.

737
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:41,730
 This is the first stage you three will perform as Tea Party.

738
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,370
