1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,950

2
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,620

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,570

4
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,980

5
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,110
 We have arrived at the hotel.

6
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,880
Found it!

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,480
Here. I will come by at 6:30 to pick you up.

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,930
Is it okay for me to use such a nice room?

9
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,670
The movie company is providing it

10
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,890
so don't feel bad and enjoy it. You have worked hard.

11
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,260
Yes, CEO.

12
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,270
You should also have a nice rest.

13
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,410
Good night.

14
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,680
Goodbye!

15
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,920
What is this?

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,830
No.

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,550

18
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,240

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
No!

20
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,340
 Get out of the way! Shax!

21
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,470
Surprised me.

22
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,610
 Stop!

23
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,240
What is going on?

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,860
Stop! Stop! Stop!

25
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,520
Hey! Hey! What's wrong?

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,380
Sasaengs. I have to go!

27
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,390
 Going up.

28
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,390
 Manager Ji Hak?

29
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,030
It is you!

30
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,200
You're the CEO of JH Entertainment now, right?

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,180
And you are...?

32
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,070
I saw you once for a SHAX interview.

33
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,150
I'm Byeon Jung Hee, a journalist for Fact Check.

34
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,240
Oh, yes.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,030
My group sure got a lot more famous.

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,650
Enough for Fact Check to make a follow-up.

37
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:18,230
There were quite a few issues, but Tea Party isn't at that level yet.

38
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,970
Shall we grab something to drink?

39
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,770
I don't think I have anything to say yet.

40
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,700
The girl that dated Eun Jo.

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,100
The last person that saw her was apparently Manager—

42
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,660
It is said to be you.

43
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,860
Isn't this enough to grab something to drink?

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,880
Gosh, Koo Dae Kwon.

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,680
Why can't he stay quiet?

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,700
What manager doesn't take the key?!

47
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,430
It is room 1425, right?

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,450
I'm pretty sure they came up here.

49
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,540
Did they get inside?

50
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,950
 Oppa! Oppa! Are you okay?

51
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,720
Oppa!

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,810
Hey! Hey! Hey!

53
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,020
Hey! Go away!

54
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,850
Why are you guys like this?!

55
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,950
We will keep Oppa safe!

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,890
Quiet! If you act like this, you're no different than a sasaeng.

57
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,730
That's offensive.

58
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,990
 How dare you compare us to them!

59
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,190
I'll stand guard here. So Youn, you go down to the lobby and make sure the sasaengs have left the building.

60
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,820
Ki Yeon, you take a look at the emergency exits.

61
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,570
Go!

62
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,680
Don't look at me like that.

63
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,610
Ryeok!

64
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,710
Get in! Hurry!

65
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,290
I don't how they found out,

66
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,160
but we haven't caught the sasaengs yet so don't open the door.

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,140
- There is no one here, right? 
 - No one.

68
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,400
Hyung!

69
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,590
What's wrong? What's with the smile?

70
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,970
Hyung!

71
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,830
What should I do?

72
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,120
You know I love you, right?

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
What?

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,110
I really love you, Hyung.

75
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,420
But you don't look too good.

76
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,590
You need to rest. The only way is to get rest.

77
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,110
Did you drink?

78
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,590
I didn't.

79
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,430
Alright, I got it.

80
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,220
Why...

81
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,850
Why did the light turn on suddenly?

82
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,570
Hyung!

83
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,330
What!

84
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,250
I'm tired! I want to be alone and get some rest.

85
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,640
I was going to drop off the mouthwash.

86
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,710
Mouthwash? Give it to me.

87
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,170
I'll take it. I can do a good job taking it. I can do it.

88
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,990
If you're so good at it, you could have bought the mouthwash yourself!

89
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,550
Here.

90
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,600
Thank you.

91
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,030
Go get some rest.

92
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,260
- Don't you dare open the door. 
 - Got it.

93
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,890
I understand.

94
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,360
- I'm going! 
 - Yes.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Go!

96
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,590
Isn't this very interesting?

97
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,230
I don't know what the situation is, but Eun Jo's girlfriend—

98
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,740
It hasn't been revealed yet, but...

99
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,180
In any case, that girl died after meeting you.

100
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,200
And Eun Jo disappeared.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,760
And you left the industry as well.

102
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,710
And then years later,

103
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,430
you made a comeback with Tea Party.

104
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,020
But Tea Party is Omega III, the group the girl was in.

105
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,080
Stop talking in circles. What is it that you want to know?

106
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,860
Eun Jo.

107
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,200
I've been a huge fan since SHAX's debut.

108
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,630
I'm a founding member of Fins.

109
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm really curious about Eun Jo as a fan.

110
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,020
He's already someone who's been forgotten.

111
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,830
He has, but you know...

112
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,790
If you've been in the industry once, you don't have the right to be forgotten.

113
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,900
No right to be forgotten?

114
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,250
Since traces of the past have been widely publicized.

115
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,950
Then try finding him through those traces.

116
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,020
I have an early start tomorrow morning. I'm going to go.

117
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,790
I wasn't sure but it seems like it is.

118
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,680
Don't just stand there. Make yourself at home.

119
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,730
No, I'm okay.

120
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,630
But why did you come here?

122
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,890
Because of this.

123
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,360

124
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,330
Fans prepared this especially for you, Sunbaenim. And there was that incident with the jacket last time too.

125
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,150
Take a seat. It might be a while.

126
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,850
If it were me, I wouldn't have been able to do that.

127
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,720
You were really cool during the music show.

128
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,560
I always wanted to tell you that.

129
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,430
She's sleeping.

130
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,920
Forget about it then.

131
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,670
You got it wrong.

132
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,440
I... I...

133
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,970
 I will come by at 6:30 to pick you up.

134
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,420
It is six!

135
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,000
Quiet!

136
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,130
- What? 
 - My pickup is at 6:30.

137
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,120
6:30?

138
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,670
SOS this early in the morning.

139
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,710
Something is not right.

140
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,460
What is wrong?

141
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,010
Nothing is wrong.

142
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,180
Are you going to keep waiting?

143
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,980
We told you we will keep Oppa safe!

144
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,290
The sun is rising. Go get some sleep.

145
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,520
What is this?

146
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,020
Why is Lee Ma Ha here?

147
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,090
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

148
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,770
Stop.

149
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,770
Keep your head up. What are you sorry about?

150
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,010
I'm the one that brought you in.

151
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,760
You are crazy! How could you bring her into your room?

152
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,480
Do you know how many people are outside? What were you thinking, bringing her in?

153
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,610
Quiet.

154
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,800

155
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,900

156
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,790
Oppa! What's wrong?

157
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,210
Dae Kwon Hyung!

158
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,000
Dae Kwon Hyung!

159
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,670
Let's go.

160
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,300
Oppa!

161
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,350
Dae Kwon Hyung!

162
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,190
This is driving me crazy.

163
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,140
What is going on?

164
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,960
You don't have to carry me anymore. I can go by myself.

165
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,210
I'm faster.

166
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,670
- I'm heavy, aren't I? 
 - Yes.

167
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,250
Sorry. I worked out in the morning and didn't pick up because I was washing up.

168
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,880
You need to hurry. We are late.

169
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,590
Come out when you're ready.

170
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,210
Alright!

171
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,060
Oppa!

172
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,340
Acute hemorrhoids. It's okay.

173
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,350
Hemorrhoids?

174
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,100
- What is it? 
 - He said it's hemorrhoids.

175
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,780
Are you out of your mind?

176
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,180
Hyung, you have hemorrhoids.

177
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,780
What?

178
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,370
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

179
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,140
Hold on. Thinking about it is making me mad.

180
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,020
Why did you turn a perfectly fine person into a hemorrhoids patient? Say something!

181
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,050
If CEO Park knows about this, I'm dead!

182
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,550
What are you trying to do? Oh. This is after you caused the accident, so it's fine.

183
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,450
I guess if I get fired, I can work elsewhere.

184
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,320
Ryeok!

185
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,950
Did you see those Fins?

186
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,420
At least listen to me!

187
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,330
Where are my clothes? Huh?

188
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,400
 Won't you do it right?

189
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,480
You're not even listening to me.

190
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,750
Jeesh.

191
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,180

192
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,450
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,900
I'm sorry for being late.

194
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,220
Ma Ha! It is alright.

195
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,530
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,870
Lee Ma Ha.

197
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,790
Keep track of the time, Lee Ma Ha.

198
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,760
Can't you see that your sunbaes, hoobaes, and the staff have been waiting?

199
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
I'm sorry.

200
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,520
At least do the basics.

201
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,180
Keep your view sight outside the window.

202
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,490

203
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,570

204
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,660
It has only been five minutes

205
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,520
since I parked the car and followed you in.

206
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,050
How could someone with insomnia be so fast asleep?

207
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,400
How could you be sleeping so well!

208
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
After having a rough morning,

209
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,910
I should also get some sleep before going.

210
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,190
What! What!

211
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,000
What are you so curious about that you're like this?

212
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,390
Look at me. Are you sure nothing happened?

213
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,010
Hyung, you said that at least 516,969 times on our way home. Do you know that?

214
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,960
That's the number of Fins in the fan club.

215
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,660
I'm going to say this since you mentioned the Fins.

216
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,160
You had to apologize and go through all that ruckus because of that one coat.

217
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,460
This is like a nuclear bomb!

218
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,290
You know, right?

219
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,800
Hyung, I swear.

220
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,830
Really, nothing happened. Don't you trust me?

221
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,190
My heart is about to fall off because of your SOS.

222
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,040
You know I have a weak heart.

223
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,130
Anyways, take the drink that's in the suitcase.

224
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,930
It looked like you ran out of it the last time.

225
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,930
What an attentive guy.

226
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,480
By any chance,

227
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,500
even if something did happen, you have to act as if nothing happened.

228
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,430
You are aware of that. Many a little makes a mickle.

229
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm sure you'll take care of it well on your own, but don't you think that girl's heart will be stirred with your face right in front of her?

230
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,500
You... don't give her even a small opening.

231
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,360
Alright. Leave already.

232
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,590
Gosh!

233
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,950
Go wash up and sleep.

234
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,710
Thank you, Hyung.

235
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,460
Push through with one thing. You're all over the place giving out both illnesses and medicine.

236
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,830
Take the drinks.

237
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,970
You jerk.

238
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,430
Two of them. Hurry up and sleep.

239
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,840
 Unni is back!

240
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,830
Ma Ha! It was hard, wasn't it?

241
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,580
It looked really hot.

242
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,900
She has been acting like this since she watched the movie.

243
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,410
- Did you see it? 
  - You wouldn't even show us the script.

244
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,280
You didn't even invite us to the premiere. Your eyes were literally sparkling.

245
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,240
Stop it.

246
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,580
Are you sure you never dated? It looked so real.

247
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,510
Hey! It's just acting.

248
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,640
Acting prodigy Lee Ma Ha!

249
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,380
While filming, the staff members and Kwon Ryeok made me comfortable so it just came out naturally.

250
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,500
Who made you feel comfortable? That unprofessional jerk, Kwon Ryeok?

251
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,180
Jerk is a bit overboard.

252
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,360
Do you think SHAX is just SHAX?

253
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,360
They're actual devils. Devil jerks. Specially Kwon Ryeok.

254
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,400
He's a complete jerk.

255
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,470
He sticks by his manager and doesn't even pick up a single bean.

256
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,120
Rumors say that he is very rough and fussy

257
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,560
so I thought he was chic and cold, but he was actually a jerk.

258
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,370
Exactly. He's just a jerk.

259
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,120
If we were to bring up rumors...

260
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,630
That's not it. Rumors are simply rumors. He was very considerate and did everything to make me comfortable while filming.

261
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,590
He even made sure that my scenes would come out well.

262
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,240
So don't think of him that badly.

263
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,350
It was also the case last time. Why do you keep taking his side?

264
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,700
When did I take his side?

265
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,230
That... I think Lia got it right.

266
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,380
I mean that was...

267
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,920
Anyways, be careful. I almost ripped the screen off when you kissed Kwon Ryeok.

268
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,860
I wanted to grab your head and move it away.

269
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,900
Why grab my head?

270
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,200
In case it sparked something in the Fins, who would then attack us.

271
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,630
The Fins' reactions to the kiss scene... Because of the loud screams,

272
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,930
I don't even know how many times I had to ask Yoo Jin about the lines.

273
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,260
What? Did Yoo Jin also watch it?

274
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,120
What did he say?

275
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,660
I thought you went back to the dorm because the light was off. Were you still here?

276
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,260
Yes, Hyung.

277
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,430
Take a rest when you don't have any plans.

278
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,890
Okay.

279
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,770
Hyung.

280
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,430
I also want to try doing dramas and movies.

281
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,000
- You? 
 - Yes.

282
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,520
I thought you didn't have interests in other fields.

283
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,220
I wanted to try it.

284
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,710
I want to do it all and do it well.

285
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,390
 Oh? She is here again. She has been at it for a month.

286
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,550
What's wrong? What's with the snicker... Scares me.

287
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,380
Why? What?

288
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,760
You're acting weird.

289
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,850
For you to be smiling at times. What's the occasion?

290
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,160
What do you mean? Get out.

291
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
Nothing?

292
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,210
I don't know.

293
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,400
My tribute pack.

294
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,280
He hasn't taken a look at it, right?

295
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,460
Hello, welcome.

296
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,330

297
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,570
The regional tour has come to an end. It looks like we will be done once we finish recording the radio promotion.

298
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,230
- Nothing special happened? 
 - I'm sorry?

299
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,910
Nothing happened.

300
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,810
Tell Ryeok to hurry up and decide on a movie and drama screenplay he will be taking part in.

301
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,950
Sure.

302
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,380
Have him be careful with what he says.

303
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,200
Got it.

304
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,360
Ma Ha, you did well till the end of the movie. You worked hard.

305
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,210
You also worked hard driving to a place far away and taking care of me.

306
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,770
That kind of hard work wouldn't tire me even if I did it every day.

307
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,990
That's why Tea Party is growing just as much.

308
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,470
Also, we have a magazine photoshoot.

309
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,940
- Hyun Ji, what do you think? 
 - Me?

310
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,260
It's a fashion photoshoot for V Magazine. Eun Ji personally called for it.

311
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,450
I'm your CEO,

312
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,960
but I respect your decisions. If you don't want to do it, I won't force you to.

313
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,060
That's not the reason why... Will I be able to do it?

314
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,680
Why is Tea Party's goddess like this?

315
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,400
The goddess should

316
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,940
show us exactly how clothes should be worn.

317
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,270
Why are you going overboard in the morning?

318
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,720
It has been a while since we drank the coffee the CEO made for us so I felt good.

319
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,140
Something still doesn't feel right.

320
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,840
I'll do it. I'll try doing it.

321
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,340
Alright.

322
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,860
Also, Lia. Ha Seok wants to see you.

323
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:23,060
You want me to go through all this by the end of this week?

324
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,870
Go through them and make a decision quickly.

325
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,610
Aren't you being too much?

326
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,290
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to? The CEO said to start with the next thing already.

327
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,020
Hyung.

328
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,760
♫  I really like this, I can't faint  ♫

329
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,390
By any chance, don't think of doing anything silly.

330
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,080
What. What would I do?

331
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,790
Whatever it is.

332
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,100
- Turn it on. 
 - Just quickly read the script.

333
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,170
Can you give us a moment?

334
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,940
The kiss scene was no joke.

335
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,180
You must have enjoyed it.

336
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,870
I'm so grateful that you increased the viewer count.

337
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,410
I didn't watch it. I watched a clip and didn't want to watch it.

338
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,020
That's why I didn't do the OST.

339
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,190
By any chance, did you film that thinking it was me?

340
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,040
Were you thinking about me while filming with my imitator?

341
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,800
Stop it. It's not funny.

342
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,580
And you keep saying imitator.

343
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't want you to call her that.

344
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,900
You two are very different.

345
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,830
La Ri Ma and Lee Ma Ha

346
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,040
are different.

347
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,570
Am I supposed to like what you're saying?

348
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,890
Yes, come in!

349
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,350
Hello.

350
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,160
- Hello. 
 - Oh! Yoo Jin!

351
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,550
- Hyun Ji! 
 - Yoo Jin!

352
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,320
What is this? Do you two know each other?

353
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,230
That's great. Alright, then!

354
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,690
We will start with Hyun Ji's individual shot first.

355
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,190
Yoo Jin, let's get ready.

356
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,490
Alright.

357
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,400
 Okay.

358
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,890
Okay.

359
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,130
This shape is so pretty.

360
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,890
 Okay!

361
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,710
Okay! Hyun Ji, let's change outfits! Yoo Jin, get ready!

362
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,330
 Oh, Hyun Ji. Looking good.

363
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,260
Is this really your first shoot? You're doing well, considering it's your first.

364
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,250
It's because you are nicely looking after me.

365
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,130
I do like pretty girls.

366
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,170
Yoo Jin is doing really well for his first time, too.

367
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,340
He is nice and has manners.

368
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,330
And he has a really good personality too.

369
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,020
Always taking care of the people around him.

370
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,770
But

371
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,700
I don't think he's just a nice guy.

372
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,120
knowing that he completely beat Kwon Ryeok.

373
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,420
What? Kwon Ryeok?

374
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,220
Did something happen to Yoo Jin?

375
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,300
We don't know.

376
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,910
Who touched the sleeping cat?

377
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,930
Well, we will have to see who's the cat

378
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,900
and who's the culprit.

379
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,910
Are you disappointed that it's a guide?

380
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,780
No, it's not that. If it's something you're doing, of course, I should help.

381
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,870
Don't think that you're singing someone else's song.

382
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,660
- What? 
 - I don't ask just anyone to sing my songs.

383
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,190
You're bringing life to a song that has not come out in this world yet.

384
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,210
With your voice, you'll be able to make sure the song can live forever.

385
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,920
I want to ask you to sing mine as well.

386
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,490
Turns out I heard your private conversation.

387
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,680
When did you get here?

388
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,240
Not too long ago.

389
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,320
I want to ask you for that favor, too.

390
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,400
Really? Lee Hyun from SHAX?

391
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,890
- He asked to work with you? 
 - What did he say?

392
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,210
I guess SHAX is composing a song for girls too.

393
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,080
Lia, you're the best!

394
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,060
You must have been surprised.

395
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,600
Surprised? That's how they flirt.

396
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,810
How dare he use his tricks on me.

397
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,180
Anyways! Don't ever get involved with SHAX!

398
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,130
I'm right.

399
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,950
- No way. 
 - Really!

400
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,630
- You're Tea Party, aren't you? 
 - It is!

401
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,920
We don't have makeup on!

402
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,440
Show us your face!

403
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,740
Your faces are so small!

404
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,960
Unni! You were so cool!

405
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,330
It's my first time seeing a celebrity in this neighborhood. Daebak!

406
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,630
Celebrity?

407
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,720
Unni, you're Hyun Ji, right? And Unni, you're Ma Ha.

408
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,830
Unni, your singing is amazing!

409
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:41,420
You know our names too? Thank you.

410
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,620
Unni! Can we take a picture?

411
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,690
Pictures are a little—

412
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,750
Let's take it!

413
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,230
One, two, three!

414
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,470
We became fans of Tea Party after seeing your performance!

415
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,160
One, two, three!

416
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,090
Our first paycheck after three years.

417
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,920
My tears are fogging up my vision.

418
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,510
What should I buy?

419
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,730
Should I buy a new 350 horsepower car?

420
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,190
That might be possible if you pay in 360 monthly payments.

421
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,600
Why not?

422
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,100
- Let's go out! 
 - Where? 
 - Today is cheating day!

423
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,130
Shall we?

424
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,520
Yoo Jin! Aren't you coming?

425
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,900
- What about Hyun Woo? 
 - He is already gone.

426
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,560
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

427
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,010
They called us celebrities!

428
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,740
Are we celebrities?

429
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,020
Daebak!

430
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,910
I should have put some BB cream on.

431
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,640
Hey! Let's come back after we put some on.

432
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,180
Yoo Jin!

433
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,190
 What are you guys doing today?

434
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,530
"On a dark night road, the sight of the woman"

435
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,930
 "in the distance makes my heart sink."

436
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,570
 "Listening to that woman's pounding heartbeat, I smile as I dance."

437
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,690
"He wipes her tears. The very moment the lips of both touch."

438
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,850
- Pass! 
 - You can't beat me.

439
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,460
Block! Block!

440
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,490
Come over here.

441
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,070
 - That's mine. 
 - No, that's mine.

442
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,620
 That's right!

443
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,990
 - A suicide goal? 
 - Suicide goals are skills too.

444
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,960
That's right.

445
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,890
 Jae Woo...

446
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,720
 Ryeok! I'm saying this as the team leader. Don't do it.

447
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,630
 Don't do anything.

448
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,190
Okay! 2:0! Oh, it's 1:1.

449
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,700
 1:1

450
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,750
 There's not much left.

451
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,160
One more!

452
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,260
 Hyuk...

453
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,590
 Fins! Fins! Kwon Ryeok...

454
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,260
 Yes! I'm happy.

455
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I can never do that. I'd rather die than do that.

456
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,890
What's with the long face?

457
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,240
 Lee Hyun?

458
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,130
 What? What do you want me to do about it? Take care of it yourself.

459
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,220
Nice!

460
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,620
 One point left, hyung.

461
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,690
 Jae Woo,

462
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,520
 you've grown.

463
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,890
Alright.

464
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,590
There's A and B. But A keeps telling B sorry and runs away.

465
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,310
B pretends not to know. A keeps on appearing.

466
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,890
But B gets annoyed with A but also cares.

467
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,900
So B is A and A is B.

468
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,640
Is this a math problem?

469
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,790
Do Jin!

470
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,950
You're my only hope. Concentrate.

471
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,190
- Listen to me carefully. 
 - Okay.

472
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,000
- Okay. 
 - Okay?

473
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,890
I have a close friend.

474
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,050
He's a total best friend, a really close friend.

475
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,050
Best friend? But you don't have any friends, except for us.

476
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,560
No...

477
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,950
I do.

478
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,300
I have friends, too.

479
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,660
But that friend has a friend that he has known for a very long time,

480
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,040
who is totally like a younger sister,

481
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,490
but now he recently met her.

482
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,500
And that girl keeps appearing in front of him.

483
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,410
So he keeps feeling concerned about her?

484
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,470
He likes her!

485
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,800
I mean I wouldn't say he likes her.

486
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,660
But if you keep thinking about her, then you like her.

487
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,980
No... no.. it's just...

488
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,660
being concerned for her, that's all.

489
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,720
- There's also something he needs to return to her. 
 - Call her!

490
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,740
But he doesn't know her number.

491
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,530
Oh my god.. How old are you?

492
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,890
Ask your friend to get her number first.

493
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,080
Or, there's SNS. 
 (T/N: Social Networking Sites)

494
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,520
SNS?

495
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,390
- SNS. 
 - SNS..

496
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,280
Okay, thank you.

497
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,360
Lee Ma Ha.

498
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,480
Why are there so many?

499
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,600
Okay!

500
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,810
It doesn't fit.

501
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,750
I'm sorry, but where are the chargers for older phones?

502
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,990
Right in front of you.

503
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,860
That will be 5,500 won (about $5.50).

504
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,010
Are you... Kwon Ryeok?

505
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,990
Sorry.

506
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,450
Daebak!

507
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,460
Don't rush! Where are we even going?

508
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,860
Get excited!

509
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,390
Tada!

510
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,400
Why are we eating at this kind of nice place for dinner?

511
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,910
Oh... It's too fancy. This is fantasizing.

512
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,170
I'm not paying.

513
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,220
There is someone else who is paying!

514
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,150
Oh, wait one second.

515
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,150
It's a number I don't know... 
  Is this Lee Ma Ha's cell phone?

516
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,950
Looks like spam...

517
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,310
Really?

518
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:36,510
Lately, there's been a lot of anti-fans who get people's phone numbers. Be careful.

519
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,440
I erased it.

520
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,510
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go see it!

521
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,360

T/N: meaning "try hard."

522
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,450
Is it not this number?

523
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,600
I mean, how long has it been since I've sent this... There is still no response?

524
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,690
Oh, it's only been two minutes.

525
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,910
Wow. Look at that chandelier.

526
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,790
It's so pretty.

527
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,620
Hello.

528
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,330
Lee Yoo Jin!

529
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,270
What's going on? Is it your birthday? It's not your birthday yet, though.

530
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,620
Celebrate me as much as you would if it was my birthday. I wanted to be celebrated so I called.

531
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,090
What for?

532
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,130
- Did you..? 
 - I got my first paycheck!

533
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,750
- Really? 
 - Oh, Lee Yoo Jin!

534
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,970
After three years, your first paycheck?

535
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Congratulations!

536
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,250
Thank you.

537
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,740
Today, I'm treating. Order anything you want to eat!

538
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,490
Wow.

539
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,410
Even still, how can you take us to such an expensive place?

540
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,820
You have to save when you can, but for you, I should splurge. Don't you think?

541
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,950
Oh, I'm touched.

542
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:43,920
But it's your first paycheck, and you're not celebrating with your members, but with us first?

543
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,090
Are you the loser of your team?

544
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,140
Lia, what are you talking about?

545
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,680
That's true... Have my priorities changed a bit?

546
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,160
Of course, I should come before the members.

547
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,020
Of course, I'm proud of you.

548
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,090
And since Yoo Jin is so kind, everyone likes him.

549
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,810
Thank you!

550
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,310
If you're giving me expensive food, then compliments will come out.

551
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,000
Can't you see how thin my face is? Let's hurry and order.

552
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,670
Sorry, sorry.

553
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,380
Let's see.

554
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,790
I can order everything from A to Z, right?

555
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,520
Don't regret this!

556
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,470

557
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,620
What is it?

558
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,300
That unknown number from before... keeps calling me.

559
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,650
Do you think someone is prank-calling you?

560
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,420
I don't know, let's just hurry and order.

561
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,960
Yeah, let's just order first.

562
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,040
This is so annoying.

563
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,790
Is this not the right number?

564
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,150

565
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,650
Oh, yes, how was the first shoot?

566
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,080
It was my first time and the first time for Hyunji,

567
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,440
maybe it's because we're close, but it felt really comfortable, and we finished well.

568
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,970
I guess it was comfortable for me too. Even though it was all day, time went by really fast.

569
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,920
That's good to hear.

570
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,810
You guys worked really hard.

571
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,840

572
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,180

573
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,350
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

574
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,400
That's right.

575
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,700
Don't be impatient, Kwon Ryeok. With ease.

576
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,740
One,

577
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,410
two,

578
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,290
three,

579
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,670
four,

580
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,810
four.

581
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,820
Yikes.

582
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,790
Lee Ma Ha.

583
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,080
I'm so sorry, Sunbae, I thought it was a spam call.

584
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,320
Spam?

585
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,660
But... how did you get my number?

586
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,030
It's the same as before.

587
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,010
- Your number 
 - Ah, yes.

588
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,940
 Sunbaenim, my pouch...

589
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,890
I would appreciate it if I could get it back.

590
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,040
Where are you? Send me your location. I'll bring it to you.

591
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,830
Oh, no, no, no. You can just mail it to me.

592
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,290
Ah...

593
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,580
Mail it?

594
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,830
Alright.

595
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:12,510
By any chance, did you look inside the pouch?

596
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:19,640
Hey. Do you think I would look into other people's belongings like that?

597
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,640
No, no. I didn't mean it like that.

598
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,860
Nevermind.

599
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,870
- Give me your address. 
 - What?

600
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,830
You told me to send it to you.

601
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,350
Yes. I will send a text message right now.

602
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,770
Alright.

603
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:45,640

604
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,570
How did she know?

605
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,690

606
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,420
Crow Tit.

607
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,470

608
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:16,250

609
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,530
 When am I going to see you, Oppa?

610
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,100
 You always say that.

611
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,920
Hold on.

612
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,080
 Is she dating someone?

613
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,310
You surprised me.

614
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,220
Back in the days, you would never even imagine doing that.

615
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,170
Date when you can, because soon, you won't be able to even dream about it.

616
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,850
- Are you jealous? 
 - Jealous?

617
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,840
If you wanted to date,

618
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,440
you should have done that when you were a trainee.

619
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,920
But I was in the practice room 24/7.

620
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,320
Right? You were like a zombie.

621
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,470
And so? Do you regret it?

622
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,910
No. If I did, then SHAX would not exist today.

623
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,170
That's right!

624
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:11,310
That is what I, SHAX's manager Dae Kwon, want to say!

625
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,400
You and me. Us. Our single lives.

626
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,190
Let's live only looking forward. You can date after retiring.

627
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,650
Again with that nonsense. Don't get involved.

628
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,440
Alright. I'm going to retire when you retire.

629
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,780
Do it then, alright?

630
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,670
Let go!

631
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,310
You must have a headache from reviewing the scenarios and scripts. Sweat it all out!

632
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,070
Life has no mercy, Dae Kwon! Dae Kwon!

633
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,080
Yeah. I'll treat you.

634
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,390
 Really?

635
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,000
Yes. See you at the same place as last time.

636
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,230
 Okay.

637
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,350
I'm going to go!

638
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,150

639
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,020

640
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,430

641
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,920
 What are you doing?

642
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,510
What's this? Why isn't she responding?

643
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,480
 Do you have something scheduled today?

644
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,690

645
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,640
 What about tomorrow? What are you doing?

646
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,320
 Do you not have any plans?

647
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,620
 Do you have any promotions on these days?

648
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,360
Why is he like this all of a sudden?

649
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,970
He should hurry and send the package.

650
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,090
Should I have replied?

651
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,710
There's no way... right?

652
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,850

653
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,110
Why are you here? You said you were going to rest.

654
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,390
I don't think I'm the type to rest.

655
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,920
That's good.

656
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,640
Let's talk.

657
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,970
Why?

658
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,720
You still haven't solved the math problem?

659
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,320
B was able to contact A.

660
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,260
- And? 
 - But they haven't replied.

661
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,410
What's going on?

662
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,120
What's A and B?

663
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:22,010
A is... some girl.

664
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,190
- Some girl? 
 - Yes.

665
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:26,260
B is... a friend of Ryeok's.

666
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,180
What?

667
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,350
Hyung Ryeok has friends?

668
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,570
No.

669
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,500
Hyung, you like someone, don't you?

670
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,820
Are you crazy? Me?

671
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,700
Calm down. So what's the problem?

672
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,720
With my advice, he was able to find her number.

673
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,660
But that one phone call was all.

674
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,120
I don't know the way—

675
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,720
Yes.

676
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,350
It's hard.

677
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,750
After all, a created image is scary.

678
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,620
When you look like this, you're completely in love.

679
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:06,010
Without knowing his own heart, the AB story... Did you call her?

680
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,430
Yes.

681
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,260
He did.

682
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,350
So what's the problem? Start!

683
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,540
How?

684
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,670
- There's nothing to say. 
 - What?

685
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,390
You have to show your heart!

686
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,100
- My heart? 
 - Hyung!

687
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,640
When Do Jin hyung plays soccer, he only dribbles.

688
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,550
When? I'm a total striker!

689
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,370
When are you going to take a shot if you're only dribbling?

690
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,030
You need to kick to make a goal.

691
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,590
Hey!

692
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,100
 Ryeok is going to get some good sleep tonight.

693
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,910
I need to take him home.

694
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,500
 Where are my car keys?

695
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,470
 Car keys!

696
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,430
Where are my car keys?

697
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,830
 You've arrived at your destination.

698
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,690
 You've arrived at your destination.

699
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,750
 What is this?

700
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,670
Where does she live that a car can't get to it?

701
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,370
 Lee Ma Ha!

702
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:54,010

703
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,310

704
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:06,720
I don't want to be an idol. I'm not interested.

705
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,340
This is your opportunity to do what you want to do for the rest of your life.

706
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,090
Hello.

707
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,800
Hello.

708
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,230
He'll be joining you as the newest member. Introduce yourselves.

709
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,970
Hope you'll get along.

710
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,190
Hello.

711
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,470
Hello.

712
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:56,980

713
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,210
What is this?

714
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,260
He didn't even say goodbye.

715
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,660

716
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,900
 You know this isn't something to overlook. Did you forget how we got here?

717
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,930
  Looks like you didn't take my advice.

718
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,650
 Don't you know you against him will cause trouble?

719
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,530
  - ... without contacting me 
 - Why is it so quiet?

720
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,350
  - You're one step late. 
 - This is not even a sitcom audition.

721
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,170
 Don't get caught up.

722
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,030
  Why do I keep running into you in unexpected places?

723
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,910
Even if it's you, I don't see any reason for you to act like this.

724
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,290
  A cute junior, who calls me a role model... Kwon Ryeok is off limits.

725
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,890
  You see, I like Kwon Ryeok.

726
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:42,990
♫   No one's forcing me.   ♫

727
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,610
♫   You're telling me how...  ♫
