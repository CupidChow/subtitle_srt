I couldn't find your daughter.

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,611
could I find Yu Yeon?

would everyone have forgotten?

11

I will do that for you.

I'll be too ashamed to be this pathetic.

how is this making atonement?

00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:58,901
He always talked about the importance of "marriage",

78
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,471
that the food we eat with our drinks is important.

79
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,971

80

we aren't even drinking wine.

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,271
I never complained.

82
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:08,940
Then he'd bring...

83
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,041
the weirdest food and made us try it.

84
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,651

- Sausage stew.

85

Sausage stew.

00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:22,260
I heard this goes perfectly with makgeolli too.

87
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,490
I got this from the restaurant
that just opened recently.

88
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,130

Come on, they just opened up
a new restaurant here,

92
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,301

everyone makes a good living.

- Kimchi for me.

- I'll go with...
- I trust you.

97
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,080
I knew it. Inspector Oh,
you're the only one for me. Try it.

98
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,881
- No, I trust you too.
- Do you?

99
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,391
- Yes.
- Man, take it.

100
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,021
So?

101
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,031
- Try something else.
- Darn it.

102
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,600
- I knew it.
- Everyone, up!

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,940
He must be trying to catch a fish
to make the noodles.

168
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:40,810
What are you taking?

169
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,411
I saw you taking medication.

170
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,521
Are you sick?

171
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,551
Why do you ask?

172
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,850
Do you think
something bad will happen to me too?

173
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,560
- It's not...
- You're scared...

174
00:13:58,161 --> 00:13:59,761
something bad might happen to someone again,

175
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,060
even if it was me, a guy you barely know.

176
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,171
I was just curious.

177
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,940
I shouldn't have asked. I'm sorry.

178
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,200
You don't have to apologize.

179
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,171
I like how you are finally
starting to seem humane.

180
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,991
It must be frightening for Dong Sik.

181
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:29,761
He'll feel like it's his fault
that people close to him...

182
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:33,031
keep disappearing and dying.

183
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,600
It's my fault...

184
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:40,631
that Mr. Nam passed.

185
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,741
I'm the one who got him in that danger.

186
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,011
I'm to blame.

187
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,911
It's all my fault.

188
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,921
Don't blame yourself.

189
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,060
I've done my share of self-blaming.

190
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,690
Don't even get started.

191
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,901
If you don't get out of it soon,

192
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,230
simply breathing...

193
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,970
and staying alive...

194
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:20,310
feels like a nightmare.

195
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,450
I just live not knowing...

196
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:30,781
if I'm myself or someone else.

197
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,421
What is that?

198
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,491
It's nothing.

199
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,031
Inspector Han, don't get into this dreadful life.

200
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:51,070
How did you end up doing that?

201
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,180
Dong Sik is down there at the lake.

202
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,480
Follow the road sign
and drive down for about 10 minutes.

203
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,421
Mr. Park.

204
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:10,891
But don't leave me here
before you two go back.

205
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,031
I'll wait here.

206
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,460
Are you just staring?

207
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,261
If you keep staring
at the surface of the water,

208
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,970
there comes a moment
when you aren't sure...

209
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,301
if a fish came to touch the float
or if it's just the wind.

210
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,110
You get confused.

211
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,451
If you pull it up too quickly,
it'll run away.

212
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:10,150
If you take too long before you pull it up,
you'll miss it.

213
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,551
Should I pull it up...

214
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,761
or not?

215
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,390
I would...

216
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,931
make a move.

217
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,001
I don't care if it's a fish or the wind.

218
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,870
I'll pull up.

219
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:47,320
Chief Nam suddenly went to
the Police Agency before he died.

220
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,130
I went after him,
but I couldn't find out who he came to see.

221
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,130
However, I ran into two people
I didn't expect to see in the lobby.

222
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,801
Is your suspicion kicking in again?

223
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:05,310
I'm getting suspicious
to not be suspicious again.

224
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,441
That's why...

225
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,751
I want you to join me
in this investigation.

226
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,451
The case hasn't ended.

227
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,021
No, I poked around...

228
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,160
and set it on fire.

229
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,691
I can't let anyone...

230
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,600
pass from this world like Chief Nam did.

231
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,870
Even if it was you,

232
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,870
I couldn't let that happen to you.
So...

233
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,941
Inspector Han Ju Won.

234
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,451
Jumping into something recklessly is my thing.

235
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,150
You can just be yourself.

236
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:54,320
Stay calm and composed.

237
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:57,320
That's your thing.

238
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,360
Do you understand?

239
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:02,900
Yes.

240
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,201
The two unexpected people.

241
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,370
Who were they?

242
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,541
Cho Gil Gu...

243
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,011
and Hwang Gwang Yeong.

244
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,971
Officer Cho and Inspector Hwang
were at the Police Agency?

245
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,080
Yes.

246
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,551
By Police Agency,
do you mean like the headquarters,

247
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,080
the National Police Agency?

248
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,251
Is it odd for them to be there?

249
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,491
I wouldn't say it's odd,
but it's unusual.

250
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,860
The jurisdiction for Manyang Substation
is Gyeonggi Province.

251
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,191
Why did they have to go to the Police Agency?

252
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:35,961
Inspector Hwang said he came to see a friend.

253
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,630
I'm here to see a friend.

254
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,541
One works at the Office of the Spokesperson here.

255
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:46,711
Officer Cho was rather vague about it.

256
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,281
Same here. I came to meet a friend.

257
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,551
But no one at the Office of the Spokesperson...

258
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,681
had joined the police force
in the same year as Inspector Hwang.

259
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,350
Then he lied about going there to meet a friend.

260
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,991
And Officer Cho too.

261
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,191
Have you ever heard him say
that he had a friend at the Police Agency?

262
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:05,330
No, if he had a friend there,
he would've shown off.

263
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,961
Do you remember
what Section Chief Kwak said yesterday?

264
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,870
He talked about the relationship
between Officer Cho and Chief Nam.

265
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,241
Gil Gu must be crushed.

266
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:17,170
He has known him for ages.

267
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:20,170
21 years, I suppose?

268
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,211
They didn't necessarily work
in the same station,

269
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,810
but whenever something happened,
we all worked together.

270
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,481
21 years.

271
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,880
That means since 2000.

272
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:33,920
Whenever something happened,
you all worked together?

273
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,261
2000?

274
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,221
Isn't it when that case happened?

275
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:40,890
Of course, I might be suspecting the wrong person.

276
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,560
And we investigate
in order not to suspect the wrong person.

277
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,630
Right.

278
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,471
To find Officer Cho's friend
at the Police Agency,

279
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:53,170
we will have to do something illegal.

280
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,140
How about we start
with checking the call history from that day?

281
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,580
I'll do it.

282
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:58,850
Really?

283
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,781
I want to do something.

284
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,481
I need to.

285
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,390
Okay. Thanks.

286
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,521
- Then, Inspector Hwang...
- Yes.

287
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,191
I'll follow and keep an eye on him.

288
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,130
- Jae Yi, you're coming with me.
- I am?

289
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,531
Then...

290
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:19,531
I will investigate again
what happened on the day...

291
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,070
Kang Jin Mook died.

292
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,771
He saw him there that day, right?

293
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,771
Yes. But Ji Hwa,

294
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:28,011
there's no way he harmed that person.

295
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,211
I agree.

296
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,580
I don't think he killed Kang Jin Mook.

297
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,150
That's why I want to investigate this again.

298
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,850
I don't want any suspicion.

299
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,570
Okay. Please hang on a second.

300
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,870
Yes. I've been waiting.

301
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,840
Already?

302
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,551
I'm on night duty today.

303
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,681
I'll be right there
as soon as I leave tomorrow morning.

304
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,380
No. It's okay.

305
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,241
Hey.

306
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,771
All right. Let's take off carefully.

307
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,011
Take off? What's up at this early hour?

308
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,580
I'm just got off from night duty.

309
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,551
And I booked a taxi this morning.

310
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,420
Which means this is a very important matter.

311
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:45,181
It's related to the Police Agency.

312
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,951
What if it isn't?

313
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,261
Hey, I'm a cop.

314
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,590
This is what a cop's gut feeling tells me to do.

315
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,691
Make sure not to let me go, okay?

316
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,971
Gosh, this is happening.

317
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,801
I'm actually at the Police Agency.

318
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,660
Darn it. I can't hear anything.

319
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,600
Hey, should we just raid them?

320
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,900
Hold on.

321
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:33,001
- Let's just catch him.
- Quiet.

322
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,340
Oh, he's leaving. Let's follow him.

323
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,140
- We need to figure out who he is.
- Hold on.

324
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,721
Darn it. This was a waste of time.

325
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,920
What?

326
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,890
This was a waste of time
for both us and them.

327
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Jae Yi. Jae Yi.

328
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,640
Aren't you the butcher shop owner?
And Constable Oh.

329
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,271
What are you doing here?

330
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,511
Inspector Hwang, are you crying?

331
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,511
So you were following me?

332
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,551
Why? What have I done wrong?

333
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:24,080
Well, it's...

334
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,890
You had an interview,
and you failed, right?

335
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,650
What are you talking about?

336
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,021
Don't you lie to me.

337
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,761
I had some job interviews recently to get a job,

338
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:36,100
and I didn't get any,
so I know how you feel.

339
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,400
- You did?
- Yes.

340
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:42,701
They said I'm too pretty to work with.

341
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,140
Fine. I failed the interview.

342
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,570
Now the chief has passed,

343
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,211
I feel bad running away...

344
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:52,650
alone.

345
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,880
That's why I didn't tell you about this.

346
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,781
Because I felt sorry for everyone.
That's why.

347
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,521
By the way, why did you spy on me?

348
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:04,090
Is it so bad...

349
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,360
that I wanted to work at the Police Agency?

350
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:09,461
A cop's gut feeling, my foot.

351
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,100
This is definitely not what we're looking for.

352
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,070
And I'm sure that's not either.

353
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:16,541
What do you mean by,

354
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,941
this and that?

355
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,511

No, it's just...

362
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:57,810
because this is confidential.

363
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,380
That's why I can use the office fax only.

I'll take care of everything,
so don't worry.

Okay, thanks. Bye.

Hey.

379
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,013
You picked up your phone.
This rarely happens.

380

Yes.

Did you receive the medicine?

383
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:39,152
Don't forget to take it, okay?

384
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,423
- I've got to go.
- Wait. Just hang on.

It's 3pm. At the city council hall.

- we, the development committee...
- Mother.

Don't.

398
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:44,983
Yes, I did.

Yes.

Aren't you going to

Inspector Han is going.

To meet his father?

404
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,802
Yes. Why?

405
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,703
Well, it's just,
he's Inspector Han's father.

Ji Hwa.

407
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:05,072
You know the way Inspector Han talks and acts.

408
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:08,443
I'm not sure where he learned it from.

409
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,713
But I'm sure of one thing.

410
00:29:11,312 --> 00:29:13,013
He didn't get it from his father.

411
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,382
What are you trying to say?

412
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:15,652
Those two...

413
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:19,193
are totally different.

414
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:23,723
I'm here to see Chief Superintendent Han.

415
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,862
So why are you sitting in front of me?

416
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:31,263
He summoned me too.

417
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:37,542
I'm sorry for making you wait.

418
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,112
The meeting took longer than expected.

419
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,213
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:43,082
It's good to see you.

421
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,052
I called you
because I wanted to ask you something.

422
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:48,453
But I didn't expect to see him here.

423
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,023
What you want to ask me...

424
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,152
is probably related to
what I'm about to tell you.

425
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,993
I thought the prosecutor in charge should know,
so I asked him here.

426
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:59,533
Are you talking about the Munju serial case?

427
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:02,663
That's right. The Munju serial murder case.

428
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:06,003
Well, to be exact,
it's about a case from 21 years ago.

429
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:09,443
The case of the missing college student, Lee Yu Yeon.

430
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,042
Of course.

431
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:12,542
I'm listening.

432
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:16,913
A little after 8pm, on February 5,

433
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,253
Officer Cho Gil Gu from Manyang Police Substation...

434
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,913
called the secretary's office.

435
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,723
He asked to see me.

436
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,652
He said it's about
the missing college student from Munju.

437
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,822
He's someone you work with.

438
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:34,332
And it happened
when I was the Superintendent of Munju Station.

439
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:36,663
So I couldn't ignore him.

440
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,402
Are you saying you met him?

441
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:42,773
Yes, he said something very strange.

442
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:50,312
I didn't do anything wrong.

443
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,283
I just did what I was told to do.

444
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,953
What my boss told me to do.

445
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:57,523
You know that.

446
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:58,983
I don't understand.

447
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:02,392
- I don't know what you mean.
- You can't do this.

448
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:05,122
I guess you're trying to bite off your tail,
but you know what?

449
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:08,632
I just made the delivery
and fetched it back as I was told.

450
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:11,402
As I was told
by the Superintendent of Munju Station 21 years ago.

451
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:13,973
Are you talking about me?

452
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,642
Officer Cho.

453
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,213
Have we ever met before?

454
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:25,042
Except for today,
have you ever met me in person...

455
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,983
and ever talked to me in your entire life?

456
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:30,183
Well, that's...

457
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:33,822
No.

458
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:34,822
So?

459
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,023
How is it possible
that I ordered you to do something?

460
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:41,062
I don't know how to
accept this preposterous situation.

461
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:45,003
Are you sure
you don't know anything about this?

462
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,203
How can I be sure
when I don't know what this is about?

463
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:48,832
Is what I allegedly told you to do...

464
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:52,473
related to the missing college student case
from Munju?

465
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,173
You said that
you wanted to talk to me about the case.

466
00:31:56,642 --> 00:31:58,042
So you really don't know?

467
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,213
Because I was told
the order came directly from you.

468
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,253
Who told you that?

469
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:05,953
Never mind.

470
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,953
I think I came to the wrong place.

471
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:12,122
I apologize. I'm really sorry.

472
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:15,463
Please don't tell anyone...

473
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:18,003
that I came here to see you.

474
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:21,132
Officer Cho. Officer Cho, wait.

475
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,213
Am I supposed to believe that?

476
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:29,213
Even if you can't believe it
that's the truth.

477
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,812
It is strange indeed.

478
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,913
Something even stranger happened after that.

479
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:37,322
Chief Nam who was killed that night...

480
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,292
paid an unannounced visit that day.

481
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,503
Maybe Officer Cho was here.

482
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:53,302
Maybe the prestige of the Police Agency is gone.

483
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:54,372
Nam Sang Bae.

484
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,503
How dare you barge in like this?

485
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,612
Cut me some slack for old times' sake.

486
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:03,542
Do you still deal with things like this?

487
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:07,652
Well, I don't know what you mean.
How do I deal with things?

488
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,953
You act without knowing who your boss is.

489
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:11,623
You act without any fear, get tired,
and eventually give up.

490
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,922
If you keep it up, you may not live long.

491
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:16,522
Are you threatening me?

492
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:19,092
The almighty Chief Superintendent
of the Police Agency?

493
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:21,533
Chief Nam Sang Bae of Manyang Police Substation.

494
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:25,033
I don't know what exactly is going on
at your substation.

495
00:33:25,163 --> 00:33:26,973
But you should control your household from home.

496
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:29,942
Why was Cho Gil Gu here?

497
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:32,103
I want to know why too.

498
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:33,913
Call me when you find out.

499
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:36,112
The forensics report.

500
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,243
Did you get rid of it?

501
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:42,252
What?

502
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:45,993
The autopsy report from 21 years ago.

503
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,353
What forensics report?

504
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:48,893
My goodness.

505
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:51,962
I don't know what's true and what's not.

506
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:55,092
Because it's hard to read your emotions.

507
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:57,732
If you'll keep asking me questions
without telling me what's it about,

508
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:58,833
get lost.

509
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:07,543
So you're saying
you really don't know anything.

510
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:14,453
Don't you ever show your face to me again.

511
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:18,223
This is an order, Chief Nam.

512
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:23,393
What forensics report was he talking about?

513
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,063
How on earth would I know?

514
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,793
Then why did you...

515
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:30,132
pretend you didn't know him?

516
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:32,732
- What do you mean?
- I'm talking about Officer Cho.

517
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:34,132
I heard a lot about you.

518
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,973
I'm Han Gi Hwan, Ju Won's father.

519
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:38,703
I'm Officer Cho Gil Gu.

520
00:34:39,442 --> 00:34:40,513
I see.

521
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,043
Like I said before,

522
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:46,982
he asked me not to tell anyone
that he visited me.

523
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,482
Are you sure...

524
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,152
you're not involved?

525
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:55,652
If I am, why would I summon you two...

526
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:57,092
to tell you all about it?

527
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:59,322
Especially when Chief Nam is dead.

528
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:01,362
No one would know
if I keep my mouth shut.

529
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:03,663
You're right.

530
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,302
I see your point,

531
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:10,473
but why exactly are you telling us all this?

532
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:14,143
A person died that day on February 5.

533
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:15,313
An officer died.

534
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,043
He wasn't just an officer.

535
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:20,013
He was my fellow officer
whom I worked with at Munju Police Station.

536
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:22,652
And Ju Won... No.

537
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:26,223
He was Inspector Han's boss
and he was murdered.

538
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,993
So you need to investigate thoroughly.

539
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:30,563
Certainly.
We'll make a thorough investigation.

540
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,123
He said "forensics report".

541
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,993
It could be a lead.

542
00:35:34,192 --> 00:35:36,833
Yes, we'll look into it.

543
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,533
Are you serious about this?

544
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,342
Han Ju Won, I'm an officer too.

545
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:47,672
Chief did what?

546
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:50,243
A forensics report?

547
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:51,543
Yes.

548
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:53,013
I don't think he was lying.

549
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,612
He really looked like
he didn't know anything.

550
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,453
I'm not defending him
just because he's my...

551
00:35:58,453 --> 00:35:59,723
I know you're not.

552
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,623
Don't speak like you know me.

553
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:03,763
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:09,063
I need to see Officer Cho.
Do you think he'll come?

555
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,433
We have to make sure he does.

556
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,603
I'll call you later.

557
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,842
What is it?

558
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,822
The vehicle that was towed.

559
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,353
The one with the dashcam
Inspector Han got the video from.

560
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:37,563
I checked the security cam footage.

561
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:42,033
The vehicle was parked over there
at 5:30am on November 10.

562
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:47,272
But the strange thing is around that time...

563
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:50,143
there was no vehicle parked near here.

564
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,342
So I checked the footage again...

565
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:54,813
and found out...

566
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:58,813
that someone put no-parking signs around here.

567
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:04,283
So that no one can park here.

568
00:37:06,052 --> 00:37:07,853
Because they didn't want
to be caught on any dashcam.

569
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,152
That's right.

570
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:10,962
One more thing.

571
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:16,092
I didn't know that apartment house
had a security cam.

572
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,902
They only had the anchor.

573
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:20,473
Kang Do Su.

574
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:22,632
They only had the anchor for a security cam.

575
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:25,772
I heard the building owner
didn't want to install a camera...

576
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:27,413
because only one family lives in the building.

577
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:30,942
There's only one family living there
but they still installed a camera?

578
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:32,112
It's strange.

579
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:34,913
Dong Sik, we should look into it, right?

580
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:36,283
Why would you look into it?

581
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,252
You should be working on your own case,
so why are you here?

582
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:41,793
I'm here because Seon Nyeo wanted me to be here.

583
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,623
She saw you when she was dispatched.

584
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,692
She asked me to help you two.

585
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:48,433
Help us?

586
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,203
You're investigating Chief Nam's murder.

587
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:53,473
We're not idiots, you know.

588
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,433
What are you talking about? It's not true.

589
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:56,572
Sang Bae was...

590
00:37:57,543 --> 00:38:00,743
I didn't have a chance
to call him my brother when he was alive.

591
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,572
But he was like a brother to me too.

592
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:04,683
And he was really nice to Seon Nyeo.

593
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:07,712
I can't sit back and do nothing.

594
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,052
I'll do anything to help.
Please just let me.

595
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:14,893
- Tell them I forced you to help.
- All right.

596
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,092
Tell them you help us only because I...

597
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:19,563
Lee Dong Sik, don't cross the line.

598
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:21,933
I'm his boss and we're partners.

599
00:38:22,462 --> 00:38:24,663
Tell them I ordered you to help.

600
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:27,232
If someone asks, this is what you will say.
Got it?

601
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:29,802
I should just interview residents
in the neighbourhood, right?

602
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:31,603
Leave it to me.

603
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,112
What is it?

604
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:40,283
I don't know
if I should tell you this or not.

605
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:41,953
What is it? Tell us.

606
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,882
I heard it from Cheol Sang
who watches over the holding cell.

607
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:50,293
He said someone visited Chief Nam
when he was in the holding cell.

608
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:51,893
Who?

609
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:57,663
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

610
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:14,482
Jae Yi.

611
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,112
You came?

612
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:20,322
- Sit.
- What's the matter?

613
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:24,263
Mr. Cho.

614
00:39:25,422 --> 00:39:27,663
We were like a real family.

615
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:29,632
After my mom went missing,

616
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:33,373
you and your wife took care of me a lot, right?

617
00:39:34,402 --> 00:39:37,473
- Jae Yi.
- You're actually not a bad person.

618
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,543
So tell us everything.

619
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:42,973
Please.

620
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,322
Well...

621
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:54,692
So I...

622
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:58,893
I was worried about the chief.

623
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:00,592
Yes, right.

624
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,600
Thinking of him sleeping in the cold jail,

625
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,130
on the ground as cold as ice,

626
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,770
I was concerned.

627
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,140
You went there because you were concerned?

628
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,740
Yes, that's right.

629
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,510
Just be honest.

630
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,250
Why did you go there?

631
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,350
Because he called me.

632
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,820
The chief called me.
That's why I went there.

633
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,730
- Did you get some sleep?
- Yes.

634
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,470
These punks,
they should've given you a thicker blanket.

635
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,240
No, I'm fine. Gosh.

636
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
I can't sleep well anyway.

637
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,910
Don't worry.

638
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,680
All the people at the substation...

639
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,380
know you're innocent.

640
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,950
I don't know about others,
but I know.

641
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,150
You do?

642
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,990
That's good.

643
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,260
I don't know about others,
but Gil Gu, you should know.

644
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,230
- We've known each other for years.
- You're right.

645
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,400
Wait. When did I see you for the first time?

646
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,370
In 2000?

647
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,670
Yes. Gosh, you're right.

648
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,400
Staying here like this,

649
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,340
I keep thinking of the old days.

650
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,240
As the same thing that happened 21 years ago
is happening now.

651
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,880
What do you think?

652
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,480
Doesn't it remind you of it?

653
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,380
Sorry?

654
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,350
- Move over.
- I'm scared to walk outside.

655
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,120
- Let me see.
- No!

656
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,290
- No!
- You can't go.

657
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,530
Move over, you punk! Move over!

658
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,300
She's my daughter, you jerk!

659
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,970
This can't be true. No...

660
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,640
What are you doing?

661
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,580
Come on. Can't you see we're busy?

662
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,650
What is the officer from the substation
doing here?

663
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,880
Well...

664
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,950
Actually, I'm...

665
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,950
I'm going to KCSI...

666
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,760
and I heard you have something to send as well.

667
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,220
Is that so? Hey, he's going to KCSI.

668
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,360
Oh, right.

669
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,690
Here.

670
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,260
This is urgent.

671
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,630
Make sure to tell them
to check for fingerprints, okay?

672
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,070
Okay.

673
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,110
21 years ago, you handed the evidence...

674
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,310
to KCSI.

675
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,010
And it was also you...

676
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,050
who brought the report.

677
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,450
Gil Gu, is the report on the guitar pick out?

678
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,690
- Yes.
- Thank you.

679
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,220
(Forensics Report)

680
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,730
What? There's nothing?

681
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,300
What's really strange...

682
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,170
is that someone...

683
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,400
happened to clean the guitar pick perfectly,

684
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,210
so the report said...

685
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,570
nothing was found.

686
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,080
Because of one guitar pick that had nothing on,

687
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,050
I arrested Lee Dong Sik...

688
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,820
and almost killed him.

689
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,750
Just because it was his.

690
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,990
Just because of the reason.

691
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,160
Do you remember?

692
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,730
Just because the guitar pick...

693
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,260
with no fingerprint or DNA...

694
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,030
belonged to Lee Dong Sik,

695
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,470
he was arrested and suspected?

696
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,700
Well...

697
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,710
It's true that it was yours, Dong Sik.

698
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,520
I read through the case.

699
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,390
I saw the record on the request for a test,

700
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,320
but I've never seen the report
on the guitar pick itself.

701
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,530
The forensics report.

702
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,930
(We request for a test
on the guitar pick found at Munju Stream.)

703
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,630
(Yu Yeon's twin brother Dong Sik's guitar pick
was found at the scene.)

704
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,630
(We found the prime suspect.)

705
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,830
(He admitted the guitar pick belongs to him.)

706
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,640
(- "Have you see the guitar pick?"
- "Yes, I think it's mine.")

707
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,440
(We request for a test on the item found at the scene.)

708
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,140
Only that one has nothing?

709
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,420
At some point,

710
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,020
I couldn't find the forensic report
on the guitar pick itself.

711
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,890
Oh, you couldn't?

712
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,960
Cho Gil Gu, did you get rid of the report?

713
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,330
Why did you do it?

714
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,200
Why? Because it's fake?

715
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,070
The report you gave to me was fake, wasn't it?

716
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,870
You swapped the real one for the fake, right?

717
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,840
Because you thought it would catch up with you.

718
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,910
So you just got rid of it, didn't you?

719
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,680
Hey, you plotted all of this, right?

720
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,510
Hey, Cho Gil Gu. Cho Gil Gu!

721
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,680
No, no.

722
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,050
I just did what I was told to do.
I only did what I was told.

723
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,060
Who did?

724
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,530
No. Never mind.

725
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,340
Who is it?

726
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,310
After receiving a text from the chief,

727
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,980
three calls from the chief superintendent's office,

728
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,610
and three calls from a cloned phone.

729
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,750
- Lee Yu Yeon.
- Kang Jin Mook.

730
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,620
Nam Sang Bae.

731
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,790
Who in the world...

732
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,360
killed them?

733
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,760
Is it you, Officer Cho Gil Gu?

734
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,000
No! I said I'm not!

735
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,530
I...

736
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,040
I can't tell you.

737
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,740
If only the chief didn't text me...

738
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,050
Gosh, why did he send me such a text?

739
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,320
He said a copy of the report...

740
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,850
was in the safe at his office...

741
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,920
and is now gone.

742
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,160
The one I kept in the safe at my office disappeared.

743
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,590
The same report you got rid of before.

744
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,760
You'll take all the blame.

745
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,630
It can't happen.

746
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,830
Gil Gu, let's talk.

747
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,800
But that's not true.

748
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,270
All I did was hand it to him.

749
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,570
But why?

750
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,910
Why did he send me such text?

751
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,750
It's not my fault.

752
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,920
I'm not the only one who met the chief.

753
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,550
I'm not the only one
who met him at the holding cell.

754
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,190
It's true.

755
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,320
I'm not the only one who met him.

756
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,700
Who else met him?

757
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,480
My goodness.

758
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,350
I came here to meet up with you
because of Chief Superintendent.

759
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,350
Are you interrogating me?

760
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,750
You're right.

761
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,060
I visited Chief Nam that day.

762
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,660
Why did you visit him so early in the morning?

763
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,760
I went to check
if the old man had a good sleep.

764
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,070
What should I do?

765
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,110
I just did what you told me to do.

766
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,010
Be quiet.

767
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,110
I'm nothing.

768
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,680
You said it's the order of the higher-ups.
The higher-ups.

769
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,420
Please. Tell the higher-ups...

770
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,020
If you want to live, shut your mouth.

771
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,020
Understand?

772
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,230
A threat? Me?

773
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,740
A threat? Me?

774
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,120
My gosh.

775
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,680
I don't understand
why Officer Cho Gil Gu said that.

776
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,290
After that,

777
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,930
what did you talk about with Chief Nam?

778
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:05,160
We just talked about the past a little bit.

779
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,140
Just a little bit.

780
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,080
What are you so worried about...

781
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,580
that you're peeking and eavesdropping like a rat?

782
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,520
Gosh. My Cheol Mun hasn't changed.

783
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,460
Stay quiet until you come out.

784
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,600
For old times' sake,
I'll send you more blankets.

785
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,600
Cheol Mun.

786
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,420
Why do I have to stay here like this?

787
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,140
It's because...

788
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,330
Well...

789
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,330
Because you kept something in your safe.

790
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,330
Oh, the fishing line?

791
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,410
But it doesn't make sense
that I'm locked up here because of that.

792
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,540
I'm not sure about others, but you know.

793
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,750
You and I were here together that day.

794
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,580
My superintendent is amazing.

795
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,000
He even stopped the security camera recording
in the jail...

796
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
where a serial killer was locked up.

797
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,170
I turned off the security camera,

798
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,560
but people might suspect us.
So be quick and bold, okay?

799
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,000
Got it.

800
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,310
Don't do anything weird.

801
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:19,640
I'll be sticking to you.

802
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,500
I got it. Just open it already.

803
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,480
It's here.

804
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,960
No. No!

805
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,480
- No!
- No! You can't touch anything!

806
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,790
Nobody can know we were here.

807
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,670
Let's go out. Go out.

808
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,000
Dong Sik. Yu Yeon isn't the one.

809
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
You and I saw it together.

810
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,670
Kang Jin Mook bit his own finger...

811
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,270
and wrote a message with his blood on this wall.

812
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,640
Why are you bringing it up?

813
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,920
A dying message he wrote when he was dying.

814
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,040
He must've thought it was so unfair
that he left such a thing.

815
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,080
So you're saying Kang Jin Mook isn't the culprit?

816
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,120
Did you tell me to let you meet Kang Jin Mook...

817
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,080
to ask such a ridiculous question?

818
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,560
The forensics report on the guitar pick...

819
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,020
Did you order it?

820
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,270
- What?
- The guitar pick...

821
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,560
found at the very scene
where Bang Ju Seon's body...

822
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,560
was found.

823
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,960
I'm talking about that guitar pick.

824
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,730
Did you tell Gil Gu to get rid of the report on it?

825
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,710
Oh, was there a thing like that?

826
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,480
For the last 21 years,
I worked at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency...

827
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,040
and came back here.

828
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,750
I was in charge of so many cases.

829
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,120
How can I remember all those cases?

830
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,980
It's such a long time ago.

831
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,420
Yes, yes.
It's possible that you don't remember.

832
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,600
But weirdly, everything related to you...

833
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,920
disappeared or is gone.

834
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,770
The security camera, the forensics report,

835
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,810
and even Kang Jin Mook.

836
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,410
Chief Nam Sang Bae.

837
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,640
Stop with your nonsense.

838
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,270
Do you have about 10 months before retirement?

839
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,480
Don't lose your pension...

840
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,920
poking here and there with your nonsense.

841
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,850
Just stay there quietly and take it all.

842
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,100
I got it.

843
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:25,270
Then you should release me.

844
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,060
What are you talking about?
Why should I do it?

845
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:34,440
The day when Kang Jin Mook died.
You and I were here together.

846
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,500
If I spill it out,

847
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,670
what will happen to you
who have a few years before retirement?

848
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,750
That's what I'm worried about.

849
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,480
Yes, Cheol Mun.
What you said is right.

850
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,920
It's all in the past.
It's a long time ago.

851
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:52,480
I don't care about what you took out, changed,

852
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,520
or erased.

853
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,830
I don't care at all.

854
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,620
Once I get out of here,

855
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:02,690
all my memories will be gone.

856
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,640
Of course.

857
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,540
For the great superintendent,

858
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,040
it's a piece of cake
to get an old man out of here, right?

859
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,290
Before you came here,
I checked the security camera at the jail.

860
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,190
You talked with him for 5 minutes and 32 seconds.

861
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,230
It's quite a long time.

862
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,660
You know, old people...

863
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,600
often reminisce about the good old days.

864
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,520
It's a buzzword these days.

865
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,730
"Back in my days..."

866
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,830
My gosh.

867
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,750
If I knew that was his last day,

868
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,310
I would've talked about the old days a lot more.

869
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,420
Just about old days?

870
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,480
After you left,

871
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,290
he looked up for a very long time.

872
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,330
He was looking straight
at the security camera.

873
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,330
He was talking,
but the sound wasn't recorded,

874
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,310
so I analysed his lip movements
and wrote it down.

875
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,600
You know it.

876
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,750
Who killed...

877
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,540
Kang Jin Mook.

878
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,890
The one who killed Kang Jin Mook...

879
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,230
will kill me as well.

880
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,230
You're talking nonsense!

881
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,730
Kang Jin Mook killed himself!

882
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,290
Is that...

883
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,730
really true?

884
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,480
(November 10, Munju Police Station holding cell)

885
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,560
The sender is me,
and the recipient is also me.

886
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,730
Who is it?

887
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,400
Cute.

888
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,210
Who is it?

889
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,320
Who?

890
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,210
You do all sorts of things.

891
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,400
Son.

892
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,070
You should eat lots of protein.

893
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,420
If meat is too heavy,

894
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,610
eat a lot of fish. Okay?

895
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,670
My little baby.

896
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,920
You listen so well.

897
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,570
Try this one too.

898
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,460
It looks good. Here. Quickly.

899
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,900
You look happy.

900
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,170
Yes. I'm so happy.

901
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,650
It's been so long
since you asked me to buy you a meal.

902
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,650
You're my only family.

903
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,190
But I've been so busy, right?

904
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,360
Let's have more time
like this together from now on.

905
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,690
Oh, no.
But it's not just the two of us today as well.

906
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,630
Sorry?

907
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,070
Someone will come soon.
But before that, Mother,

908
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,840
you should be honest with me.

909
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,380
What are you talking about?

910
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,000
Who is coming
and what should I be honest about?

911
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,610
Kang Jin Mook's death.

912
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,480
Are you related to it?

913
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,130
Jeong Je. What do you mean?

914
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,630
Kang Jin Mook killed himself.

915
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,590
What about Chief Nam Sang Bae?

916
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,630
Did you kill him?

917
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:01,270
Park Jeong Je.

918
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,040
Hello, Ms. Do.
It's been a while.

919
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,440
Park Jeong Je, you...

920
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,020
(JL Construction Chairman Lee Chang Jin)

921
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,960
Don't ever call me for...

922
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,710
Inspector Han Ju Won.
What are you doing now?

923
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,500
I didn't bring my phone.

924
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,380
Let me have one call.

925
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,210
Who do you think you're messing with?

926
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,710
010-0640-3324.

927
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,110
(JL Construction Chairman Lee Chang Jin)

928
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,650
(Missed calls)

929
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,460
Why aren't you answering?
You can take the call.

930
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,130
It's none of your business.

931
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,900
You should answer the phone call this time.

932
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,900
Dong Sik.

933
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,020
I guess you're using two phones.

934
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,150
Well, I work for the public interest, so...

935
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,980
So answer it.

936
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,650
You work for the public interest.
Councilwoman Do.

937
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,420
Mother.

938
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,040
010-0640-3323.

939
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,940
Why aren't you answering the call,
Councilwoman Do?

940
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,590
Never mind. She doesn't need to answer it.

941
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,060
That's not what I want to know right now.

942
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,250
Park Jeong Je.

943
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,230
Is breathing...

944
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,690
and living a nightmare to you?

945
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,460
Sweetheart. Son.

946
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,130
Lee Dong Sik, you...

947
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,820
You.

948
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,110
You're hiding a nightmare.

949
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,420
What is it?

950
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,500
Tell me.

951
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,690
You punk.

952
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:17,090
Help! Help me!

953
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,840
This is a mess.

954
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,380
=Beyond Evil=

955
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,440
=Beyond Evil=

956
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,040
That day.

957
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,460
The day Yu Yeon didn't come back.

958
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,290
I'm sure he doesn't remember anything.

959
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,060
That wench.

960
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,170
Do you want me to get rid of her perfectly?

961
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,590
If Jeong Je really lost his memories,

962
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,690
he must be the one
who wants to get them back the most.

963
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,860
Senior Inspector Park, keep it together.

964
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,540
What if it wasn't just once in 2020?

965
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:08,900
Yu Yeon.

966
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,040
Did you kill Yu Yeon?

967
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,810
Do you really not know?

968
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,420

969
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,250
Park Jeong Je!
