There he is.

5
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,322
You crazy jerk.
Are you even a human being?

6
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,792
Is the victim's father the killer?

7
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,362
Is the body inside the house?

8
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:36,923
Maybe Mr. Kang really is the killer.

9
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,362
Is it really a serial murder case?

10
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:40,603
How could you kill your own daughter?

11
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:42,733
That hurts, Ji Hwa. Go a little easy on me.

12
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,432
- Is it manslaughter?
- Get in.

13
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:47,032
- Gosh, it's horrifying.
- Get in.

14
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:48,373
Is it premeditated murder?

15
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,103
Why did you bury the body in the house?

16
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:53,943
Sang Bae, he could get in trouble
for contaminating the scene.

17
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:55,743
I'm sorry, Hong Cheol.

18
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:57,553
You just have to let it go.

19
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:00,182
Gosh.

20
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:07,292
Do Su. Hey, stop.

21
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:33,613
What's the matter?

22
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,182
Move aside.

23
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:37,292
Move aside, you jerk!

24
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:38,922
Officer Lee!

25
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:50,133
Uncuff me.

26
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,672
When will you stop storming out
without thinking?

27
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,243
- Uncuff me.
- Tell me what's going on.

28
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,342
That scum...

29
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:00,783
And Jae Yi is...

30
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:06,152
Is someone threatening her? Why?

31
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,193
Why?

32
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,123
Everything. Search the entire area.

33
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:19,133
All of Manyang-eup.

34
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:22,003
Search everywhere down to a grain of sand.

35
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:27,172
Yoo Jae Yi. Jae Yi wasn't there.

36
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:32,742
Officer Lee, is Ms. Yoo Jae Yi in trouble?

37
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,283

Go to the spot 50m down
to the mouth of Munju Stream.

41

You'll find Jae Yi there.

42
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,093
Just go now.
Go find Jae Yi and stay with her.

I'm Inspector Han from Manyang Substation.

This is a Code Zero situation.

46
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,232
The location is 50m down
to the mouth of Munju Stream.

47
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:58,832
Please send the nearest patrol car to the location.

48
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:05,373
Inspector Han, we're not going to the location.

49
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:06,772
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,843
Do you want to see Ms. Yoo die?

51
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,753
I'll explain later.

52
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,753

I know who murdered all of them.

56
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,463
It's Kang Jin Mook.

57
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:27,163
And we're going to arrest him now.

58
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:34,003
No one's going to die from today.

- Oh, it's him.

64
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,682
Inspector Han, you announced
it's a serial murder case, right?

65
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:20,752
How did you know that?

66
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,052
How did you arrest him?

67
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,153
What's the condition of the dead body?

68
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:25,292
Where is the body?

69
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,992
How did you know he hid the body here?

70
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:28,492
I can't give any comments for now.

71
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:29,562
Inspector Han.

72
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,163
You remember me, right?

73
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:33,232
You once found my father.

74
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:36,663
I'm Bang Ju Seon's sister.

75
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:40,603
Did he kill my sister too?

76
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,242
I can't give any comments for now.

77
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:44,872
Please take a look at this.

78
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,382
It's the picture taken the day she died.

79
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:50,442
Did you find her fingers in the house...

80
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,312
by any chance?

81
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:54,422
Because we didn't find her fingers.

82
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:58,453
For now...

83
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,263
I can't give you any comments.

84
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,992
Why can't you give me any comments?

85
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:06,862
Do you know what it's been like
for my father for 20 years?

86
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:08,763
So why can't you say anything?

87
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,573
- Ma'am, step aside.
- Please calm down.

88
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:14,302
Inspector Han, are you all right?

89
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,672
- Inspector Han, a comment, please.
- You should go.

90
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:19,672
A comment, please!

91
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:20,843
When did you start suspecting him?

92
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:23,042
Is it a serial murder case?

93
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,413
Did you find the murder weapon?

94
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:28,252
Around 10:30pm last night,
at a store in Manyang-eup, Munju.

95
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:30,223
A man is dragged out by the police.

96
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,093
In the early morning on the 24th of last month,

97
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,763
the daughter of this supermarket's owner...

98
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,263
went missing.

99
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,992
Only her 10 severed fingers were found...

100
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:40,192
on a wooden bench in front of the supermarket.

101
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,732
The missing college student's father
was arrested last night.

102
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,502
They confirmed her body
has been buried under the yard...

103
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:48,843
of the supermarket since her death.

104
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,742
The victim's father...

105
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,713
was arrested by the police.

106
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:53,713
The VCU...

107
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,612
Both Foreign Affairs and RIU
of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency...

108
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:57,013
want to take the Munju serial murder case...

109
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,112
and asked to transfer the case
to their jurisdictions.

110
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:02,122
Inspector Han recently raised the possibility...

111
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,023
of a serial murder case.

112
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,292
The first case with the same MO occurred in 2000.

113
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:10,023
The killings haven't stopped for the last 20 years.

114
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:12,393
It's highly possible
that they're serial murder cases.

115
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:15,603
Because Inspector Han made the arrest...

116
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:17,002
ahead of the VCU of Munju police...

117
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,903
the case is drawing public attention again.

(Jung Cheol Mun Chief of Munju Police Station)

120

How does it look over there?

121
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,893
When Kang Jin Mook gives a statement,

122
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,552
watch him from the observation room.

123
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:44,232
You could take advantage of it
to transfer back to the Seoul Police.

124
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:47,163
All right. I'll talk to you later.

(Victim 6, Lee Geum Hwa, October 19, 2020)

128
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:10,853
(Hey, police officer. H, Mi...)

129
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:32,513
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

130
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:34,442
I've been calling since last night.

131
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:37,083
- Have you heard of the incident?
- Coffee?

132
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,323
- No, thank you, sir. Before that...
- What about breakfast?

133
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:44,492
Sorry? I haven't eaten yet.

134
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:47,052
- Make dried pollack soup for two.
- Yes.

135
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:55,203
So last night, Ju Won arrested the suspect.

136
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,172
Let's skip what the entire country knows.

137
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,533
Yes, sir.

138
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:03,343
First off, the body was sent
to the NFS for an autopsy.

139
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,713
We haven't found the exact cause of death,

140
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:08,442
but there are marks on her collum, her neck,

141
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:10,953
that show she was suffocated with a wide cloth.

142
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:13,083
Death by suffocation due to pressure on the neck.

143
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,252
- Wait.
- You're right.

144
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:18,353
The skeleton Ju Won found at the reed field...

145
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:22,163
also had a broken hyoid bone, right here.

146
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:23,992
So they were suffocated to death.

147
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:26,492
And their fingers were cut off at the tips.

148
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,403
But it seems like there are other victims.

149
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:33,603
Bang Ju Seon. The victim from 20 years ago.

150
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:38,073
Yes. It seems like Ju Won's claims are true.

151
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,543
The supermarket owner was...

152
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,412
a serial killer
who had been killing people for 20 years?

153
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:47,313
This is a very shocking story,

154
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,223
so reporters and all kinds of nobodies are...

155
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,423
even going through our trash cans.

156
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:55,122
And because you denied this theory
during your press conference,

157
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:58,693
the police station is also filled with all kinds of reporters.

158
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,203
- Those darned reporters.
- Don't worry.

159
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:04,632
I'll make sure I stop Ju Won's name
from getting published again.

160
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:07,673
Why did they say Inspector Han
when he has a perfectly good name?

161
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,872
He just arrested a serial killer
that couldn't be identified...

162
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:13,412
or be caught by the police
for the last 20 years.

163
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:16,112
At the very least,
his real name should be on paper.

164
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:19,553
You're right. He deserves that.

165
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:23,453
But Ju won didn't do this alone,

166
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:26,923
so naturally, they will report both of their names.

167
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:31,063
His partner's name is Lee Dong Sik,
an assistant inspector.

168
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:34,333
He was a suspect 20 years ago
during Bang Ju Seon's case.

169
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,032
His sister has been missing
since that time as well.

170
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:42,103
Like this college student,
only 10 of her fingertips were found.

171
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,543
His story is way more shocking than Ju Won,

172
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,612
so reporters will drool all over him
instead of...

173
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:54,522
The process of their arrest isn't very clear.

174
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,223
Before the suspect took out her body,

175
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:00,453
they were already on a stakeout at his house.

176
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:03,022
And it's also unclear
when or how they found out...

177
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:05,063
about this case.

178
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,902
Aren't there too many
of those online news websites these days?

179
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,002
Sorry?

180
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:15,103
Back in the day,
3 or 4 newspapers used to send us their papers...

181
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,673
by day and night for us to read it over first.

182
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:20,772
Work was much easier back then.

183
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,882
All kinds of people show up
claiming to be reporters,

184
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:26,382
only to publish absurd articles on speculations.

185
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:29,953
Shouldn't we arrest them
for obstruction of justice, Mr. Kwon?

186
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,622
You're right, Mr. Han.

187
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:35,193
The facts on when and how
they found out about the case...

188
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,693
and how they narrowed the suspects
and did the investigation...

189
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:39,833
are considered confidential information.

190
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,632
So reporters can't have access to
such sensitive information.

191
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,433
I'll make sure I stop them.

192
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:48,303
The officer who arrested him
was a suspect 20 years ago,

193
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:50,573
and he was the family of one of the victims.

194
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:53,573
Shouldn't he have stayed off the case?
He should've avoided it.

195
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:54,912
That assistant inspector was a part of the substation,

196
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:58,282
not a part of the team
who's in charge of the case, so...

197
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:01,183
Ordinary people don't know how the system works.

198
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,683
They'll talk once articles are published on him.

199
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:06,223
That's definitely a problem,

200
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:10,823
but the bigger problem is which team should take this case.

201
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,132
The Foreign Affairs Division
and the Regional Investigation Unit...

202
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,862
both made requests to have the case assigned.

203
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:19,173
In that case, the prosecution will...

204
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:22,603
make an adjustment on the team
who'll take over.

205
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,782
When a case gets transferred,

206
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:32,053
the investigation begins from the start
again and again.

207
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:35,122
It'll be like hurting the bereaved family again.

208
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:38,122
Prosecutor Kwon, this is your first major case.

209
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:41,392
You should indict the serial killer
who went on killing for 20 years.

210
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:44,862
Let's have Munju Police Station take this case.

211
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:48,303
But we'll make sure we report
on how Inspector Han arrested him.

212
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,303
I'll make sure...

213
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,973
the information on Officer Lee doesn't get out.

214
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:56,343
I wanted to treat you to a bowl of dried pollack soup,

215
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:58,772
but I shouldn't hold down the prosecutor in charge.

216
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:00,642
You should wrap it up very soon.

217
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,713
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,453
I was going to tell you this over the soup.

219
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,752
It's not that important, but...

220
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,823
- Hyeok.
- Yes, Father.

221
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,823
It's about the skeleton I mentioned just now.

222
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:18,162
The one that Ju Won found at the reed field.

223
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,193
We identified her.

224
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:23,103
Lee Geum Hwa, 38 years old. She's Korean-Chinese.

225
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:24,803
She was deported for illegal residency,

226
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,473
then she re-entered the country
by using her sister's passport.

227
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:28,943
She was arrested once for prostitution
at a massage parlour,

228
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:31,043
then was let off with a warning.

229
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:35,183
People say it had a connection
with the Foreign Affairs Division.

230
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,683
A connection?

231
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,152
I'm sure they were probably
in charge of illegal aliens back then.

232
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:40,752
Should I be concerned?

233
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,683
Not at all, sir.

234
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:48,362
One, make sure I get Ju Won's name out in the media.

235
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:49,793
Two.

236
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,593
Do not disclose the particulars
of the case or the suspect.

237
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:55,103
Three.

238
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:58,902
Do not let the outside world
find out about Lee Dong Sik.

239
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:05,112
It sounds like
Ju Won will get promoted all by himself.

240
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,282
He'll turn his son into a hero...

241
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,043
and become the Commissioner General himself.

242
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,693
The person you have reached is not available.

243
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,022
(Han Ju Won)

244
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:24,423
Why won't he pick up a call
from the prosecutor in charge?

245
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:26,463
What do I do with Lee Geum Hwa, Ju Won?

246
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,473
This punk.

247
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:34,673
(Investigator Kang Sang Bok)

248
00:13:37,002 --> 00:13:38,713
Do you have the autopsy report?

249
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,813
Wait, what's the cause of death?

250
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:47,313
Cardiopulmonary arrest
due to multiple organ failure?

251
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:50,382
Please send over the report in a hurry.

252
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,362
Cardiopulmonary arrest due to multiple organ failure?

253
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:58,563
It means her heart stopped
because her organs stopped working.

254
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,933
I thought we saw pressure marks
during the postmortem exam.

255
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,402
You said there's a high chance
she suffocated to death.

256
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:07,303
The marks were there.

257
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:13,112
Ms. Oh, do you remember seeing hypodermic bleeding...

258
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,313
from Min Jung's fingertips
that were found on that bench?

259
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,112
That's why we said they were severed
while she was alive.

260
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:22,953
We all searched so much for her
thinking she'd be alive...

261
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:26,823
I think she was alive...

262
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:29,223
when she was put inside that crock.

263
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,372
(She died of cardiopulmonary arrest
due to multiple organ failure.)

264
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,782
Thank you for the food.

265
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:08,093
He buried his daughter alive,
yet he's gobbling up to survive?

266
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,933
- Do Su.
- That jerk will never talk.

267
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,132
The first thing he said today was,

268
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,803
"Thank you for the food."

269
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,183
Hey, what's wrong?

270
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:37,083
Hey, what's wrong? What is it?

271
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:39,652
You punk. What's wrong?

272
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,223
Spit it out. Spit it out now!

273
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:45,732
- Do Su!
- Move aside!

274
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:47,132
Hey, come here.

275
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,433
Spit it out. Spit that out!

276
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,103
Spit it out, you jerk!

277
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,083
Gosh, I thought I was going to die.

278
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,023
Ji Hwa.

279
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,233
I think...

280
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,162
I should let Min Jung go now.

281
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:32,843
(Kwon Hyeok, Voice Message)

282
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:38,483
We know Kang Min Jung's cause of death now.

283
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:41,053
Cardiopulmonary arrest caused
by multiple organ failure.

284
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:49,093
Voicemail box.

285
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,563
Ju Won, why won't you answer my call?

286
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:54,563
Do I really have to text you
to get you to talk to me?

287
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:57,132
Voicemails can be dangerous.

288
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:59,003
Make sure to delete it after hearing the message.

289
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:03,043
We have identified the skeleton you found.

290
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:07,712
The person's name is Lee Geum Hwa.
She was a Korean-Chinese.

291
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:09,813
Foreign Affairs Division
has investigated her case once.

292
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:13,353
The burner phone where her DNA was found...

293
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,083
The phone that was used to text your number.

294
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,452
I need to know
if there are more things related to you...

295
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:20,823
other than that to figure out
what I should do.

296
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:23,692
We'll get the stories straight with your father...

297
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:25,432
so we don't have to take this further.

298
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,962
So deny everything until we discuss it.

299
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:31,033
Just say you don't know the woman. Okay?

300
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,003
You're a cop. You know how this works.

301
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:40,642
You must show me something that can prove...

302
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,142
your relationship with Ms. Lee.

303
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:45,983
Hasn't there been any visitors?

304
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:49,353
Who would visit a dead illegal immigrant masseuse?

305
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:52,353
When we have the body of someone
who doesn't have family or friends,

306
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:55,662
we need to wait until their family signs a disclaimer.

307
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:59,392
We will have to keep the body in there
for a few months.

308
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,603
This is a headache for us too.

309
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:05,402
What's your relationship with her though?

310
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,372
She was one of my acquaintances.

311
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,642
An acquaintance cannot claim the body.

312
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:11,372
Can't you reach someone in China?

313
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:13,773
I'm glad we can move...

314
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,483
- Inspector Han.
- Chief.

315
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,853
- What brings you here?
- Pardon?

316
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,583
I thought you came
because you heard about Min Jung.

317
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,853
No. What happened?

318
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:27,023
Jin Mook, that punk...

319
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:30,462
That punk...

320
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,563
gave up Min Jung's body
so we could hold a funeral for her.

321
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,462
So I came to take the body.

322
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:37,962
Will you cremate it right away?

323
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:41,573
Well, this place is ice cold.

324
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:46,773
And Min Jung has been in the cold ground
for a long time.

325
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:48,442
I must take her out of here as soon as possible.

326
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:51,442
Did you bring a signed document
for the body transportation?

327
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:53,513
- Yes. It's right here.
- Thanks, sir.

328
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:01,323
(Lee Geum Hwa, Female, No relatives or friends)

329
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,333
(The late Kang Min Jung)

330
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:29,882
(Cremating)

331
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,222
Hey. Hang on a second.

332
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:51,543
You're only making it harder
for Min Jung to leave in peace.

333
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:53,672
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:56,712
I'm sorry, Min Jung.

335
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,212
I'm so sorry.

336
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,553
I shouldn't have...

337
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:05,553
left you that day...

338
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,593
What about that day?
What did you do?

339
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,023
- Jae Yi.
- That day...

340
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:15,162
What did the people here do wrong that day?

341
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:20,533
Hey, why are you saying sorry?

342
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,672
Why are you making yourself guilty?

343
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,573
Why are you crawling into the agony yourself?

344
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:39,793
Hey!

345
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,392
- Hey, stand up.
- Ji Hun.

346
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,922
- Constable Oh!
- Wake up!

347
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:45,962
Take his tie off.

348
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,293
- Let's take him outside.
- Carry him.

349
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:49,503
- Come on.
- Take him outside.

350
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:51,932
Gosh, why is he so tall?

351
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,972
I'll go and look after him.
Stay here with Dong Sik.

352
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:06,753
Dong Sik, you should go get some fresh air too.

353
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:08,152
This will take a long time.

354
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,523
Inspector Han, Jae Yi, you should go out too.

355
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:15,793
- Is he all right?
- He will be all right.

356
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:19,493
I'm sorry I keep worrying you.

357
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:20,692
Don't say that.

358
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:24,063
Take him home, give him some food,
and put him to sleep.

359
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:25,803
Well, I need to go back to the station.

360
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,803
Dong Sik, Inspector Han,
you should join me after this.

361
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:32,313
Well, the reinvestigation has been finished already.

362
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:34,612
We can interview the testifiers tomorrow, right?

363
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:36,682
He said he would speak to these two.

364
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:39,513
Kang Jin Mook...

365
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,182
wants to talk to you.

366
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:54,192
- Dong Sik.
- Why won't this turn on?

367
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:01,103
You know, I have something to say...

368
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,472
Darn it.

369
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:07,172
According to the laws in Korea,
detectives must record...

370
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:08,912
all the questions they ask.

371
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:12,783
I don't know why though.

372
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:14,753
So wait.

373
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,783
Inspector Han.

374
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:17,882
He's an observer.

375
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:19,523
He can only be watching this.

376
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:21,093
He's not allowed to talk.
That will be illegal.

377
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:25,362
I'm Inspector Han Ju Won,
and I'm the observer today.

378
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,833
Darn it.

379
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,803
Haven't we gotten this changed yet?

380
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,162
Seriously, Chief?

381
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:34,202
Jung Cheol Mun got his room
filled with fancy stuff.

382
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,773
Just butt heads with him, Ji Hwa.

383
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:39,172
Or tip the press off about him.

384
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:40,743
What on earth is he saying now?

385
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,182
Has Officer Lee lost his mind?

386
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:45,253
His job is to make Kang Jin Mook talk.

387
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:46,553
What nonsense is he saying now?

388
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,583
Gosh, that nut case.

389
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,222
It's not nonsense. It's the truth.

390
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:54,192
- What?
- I mean, Korean laws...

391
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:57,692
are just so lame.
Observers must be only observing quietly.

392
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,063
And the detective
who interrogates the testifier...

393
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,493
needs to type too, at the same time.

394
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,263
And is there anybody here
who doesn't know that?

395
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,533
Why is he saying that now...

396
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:10,343
This is a protest, isn't it?

397
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:13,112
He knows Kang Jin Mook wanted to talk to him,

398
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,912
and he got all arrogant now. Right?

399
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:17,412
Gosh, why is it so noisy in here?

400
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:21,853
Aren't you supposed to
be just observing in the observation room?

401
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:26,222
Isn't the observation room
for authorized personnel only?

402
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,222
Cheol Mun.

403
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:30,622
Darn it.

404
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,533
What are you doing?
Stand up already.

405
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:34,833
Yes, sir.

406
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:47,472
Darn it.

407
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:07,192
Thank you.

408
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:12,972
Gosh, what are all these?

409
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,103
Are you ready now?

410
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:18,472
Hang on a second.
I need to open the report form.

411
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:24,083
That noisy wench.

412
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:28,853
She was too talkative.

413
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:33,892
Right?

414
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,140
That noisy wench.

415
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,780
She was too talkative.

416
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:48,981
Right?

417
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
So...

418
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,090
I got angry.

419
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:56,491
That's all.

420
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,651
Were you drinking with guys last night?

421
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,890
Yes, I was. So what?

422
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,330
You shouldn't go out.

423
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,691
Whatever.

424
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:41,471
I'm not in a good mood tonight.

425
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:43,001
Don't touch me.

426
00:26:43,241 --> 00:26:46,911
You shouldn't sleep outside from now on.

427
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,511
You can't do that anymore.

428
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,040
Whatever, I don't care.

429
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:51,941
Listen to me.

430
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,251
- Listen to me.
- Don't touch me! You creep me out!

431
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:03,491
Hey, Jin Mook!

432
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:05,860
Go. Just go.

433
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,501
Did you go around nibbling on bread
looking for that brat again?

434
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:14,671
Hey, wait. One second. Come on!

435
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,951
You're drunk again.

436
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,411
You know what?

437
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,050
It was her plan all along.

438
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,691
She planned on leaving the kid with you
and running off all along.

439
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:39,560
Don't say that.

440
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,661
You're her friend.

441
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,870
Has... Has she called you?

442
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,671
Her friend?
Did you say I'm friends with that brat?

443
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,771
Are you out of your mind?

444
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,941
Do you know how funny it was
whenever she opened her mouth?

445
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,350
She claimed to have quit college
because of family reasons,

446
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,880
then meeting you
while she was working part-time.

447
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,850
She was a prostitute,

448
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,991
just like your mom.

449
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,921
Please come with me.

450
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:12,090
Why would I go with a loser like you?

451
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:13,731
Stop that.

452
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:15,931
"I fell in love at first sight"?

453
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,501
People said she got her hands on this idiot...

454
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,600
who paid off her ransom and took her.

455
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:25,540
The entire neighbourhood knows that story.

456
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,840
That brat just toyed with you. Get it?

457
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,850
- You dimwit!
- Stop that!

458
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,681
(Manyang Farm)

459
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,540
Mr. Kang.

460
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:08,280
- What is that?
- Stop...

461
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,221
that.

462
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:13,421
Mr. Kang, that...

463
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,431
I guess the rumours of your prostitution were true.

464
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,560
What are you doing here this late at night,

465
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
all dressed up prettily?

466
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,370
(Hey, police officer. H, Mi...)

467
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,441
What's wrong, Jin Mook?

468
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,640
Don't get me wrong.
I was just texting a friend...

469
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:36,640
Who's this friend?

470
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:39,011
Why do you care?

471
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,411
Why? Are you worried about something?

472
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:46,290
Why is this stupid nitwit trying to scare me?

473
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,961
You're just a prostitute.
Stop talking so much.

474
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:55,330
Which one was that?

475
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,501
What?

476
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:01,100
I don't think you're talking about one person.

477
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:06,241
You need to tell me which one is which...

478
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,241
for me to write up this report.

479
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,540
Yes, right. That is something...

480
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,350
I wouldn't know.

481
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:23,860
Help me!

482
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,360
How would I...

483
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,001
It hasn't even been long
since your husband died.

484
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,271
Know that?

485
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,651
Everything is...

486
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:56,221
nothing but...

487
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,820
my imagination.

488
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,261
Your imagination?

489
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,971
I just imagined that could be the case.

490
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,471
I had lots of time
when I was in the holding cell,

491
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,971
but I had nothing to do.

492
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,471
That crazy jerk.

493
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,241
He'll never confess.

494
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,780
We can't find the victims unless he confesses.

495
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,080
Man, this is awful.

496
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:25,691
(I pushed her toward the window,
then strangled her.)

497
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:28,590
(Then strangled her.)

498
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,530
Do you think those women repented?

499
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,401
- Repent?
- I don't have...

500
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:40,130
a particular religion,

501
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,441
but you're supposed to repent your sins
before you die.

502
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,971
Were they all guilty of something?

503
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,120
According to what you said,

504
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:01,221
Lee Geum Hwa, Yeo Chun Ok,
Wi Sun Hee, and Jin Hwa Lim...

505
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,820
all had to repent of something.

506
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,761
- What about the 1st person?
- The 1st?

507
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,630
Not her.

508
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,530
- She would never do anything...
- It was your daughter.

509
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:19,241
Who knows?

510
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,411
Everything is my imagination. I don't know anything.

511
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:24,711
If she would never do anything of that sort,

512
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,181
why did you think he killed his daughter?

513
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,550
Should I ask him?

514
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:39,691
- Ms. Kang Min Jung...
- An observer, only to observe.

515
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,931
- You aren't supposed to speak.
- isn't your biological daughter.

516
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,501
- What?
- What?

517
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:53,441
What kind of nonsense is this?

518
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:56,380
Min Jung is my daughter.

519
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,981
She really is my daughter.

520
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,651
Dong Sik, you know, right?

521
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,350
You know that.

522
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:14,861
This man broke the law. Make him leave!

523
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,731
- Get, get out of here!
- Hey!

524
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,930
Lower your finger before I cut it off.

525
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,341
I agree with that.
He cut off other people's fingers.

526
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:32,850
When did I do that?

527
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,281
I never did that.

528
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,430
You said it's illegal for an observer to speak.

529
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,301
Please make Inspector Han Ju Won
leave this room immediately.

530
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:54,870
Hey, wait. One second.

531
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,571
That scumbag.

532
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,680
Illegal, my foot.

533
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:07,481
Since I spoke up in the middle,
we can discard that report...

534
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,580
and start all over again.

535
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,551
- What?
- The law says we can do that.

536
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,220
You said you imagined everything.

537
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,821
We had to start over anyway.

538
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,100
Inspector Han Ju Won,
please do not butt in from now on.

539
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,001
I apologize.

540
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:28,370
Now, let's start again from the top.

541
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:32,341
Mr. Kang Jin Mook, stay calm as you answer.

542
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:34,970
You seem more suspicious
when you overreact.

543
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:37,140
There were many rumours...

544
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,680
about your older sister...

545
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,220
20 years ago, you know.

546
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:52,560
When did you first meet your wife,
Yoon Mi Hye?

547
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,401
An escort bar, correct?

548
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,301
What are you talking about?

549
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:02,470
When did you find out about her pregnancy?

550
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,771
- Why do you ask?
- I always thought...

551
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,341
that she resembled nothing of you.

552
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,720
Gosh, darn it.

553
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,890
It's a huge relief that a man like you
isn't her real father.

554
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:28,430
You knew that too, right?

555
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,531
Don't touch me! You creep me out!

556
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,370
Creep you out?

557
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,510
Yes, I hate you.

558
00:35:39,611 --> 00:35:42,781
You pretend like you're stupid,
humouring and deceiving everyone.

559
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:46,051
But I know what those creepy eyes mean.

560
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:49,950
- I know about it.
- Stop that.

561
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,620
I can see why that woman ran away from you.

562
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,751
I would've hated to live with you if I were her.

563
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,240
Are you really my dad?

564
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,441
I thought about it a lot,
and I don't think you are.

565
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,981
If you're not,
why do I have to live with you?

566
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,180
But Min Jung...

567
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,651
I'll know if I get a paternity test.

568
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:39,671
- No.
- You knew it.

569
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,801
You...

570
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,211
knew it.

571
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:53,350
You know the truth.

572
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,680
No!

573
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,830
Hey, stop him.

574
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:21,470
You little...

575
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,111
Why?

576
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:25,981
Why?

577
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:28,981
You crazy jerk!

578
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,321
Hey, let him go.

579
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,091
Inspector Han, let go of him.

580
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,990
Let him go. Inspector Han!

581
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,461
Should we call an ambulance?

582
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,700
Inspector Han!

583
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,450
My goodness, Inspector Han.

584
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,790
It was as if
you worked with your partner for 10 years.

585
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,631
You're practically a native Manyang resident now.

586
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,760
Chief, I'd like to take a vacation for a while.

587
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,430
I'll request vacation leave.

588
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,571
Vacation leave?

589
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:21,501
You're taking a vacation at a time like this?

590
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,771
All right. Get some rest then.

591
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,981
Thank you.

592
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:07,010
(Districts for further development in Munju)

593
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,820
Let me see.

594
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,420
Good old days with the biggest fan.

595
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,430
We had great fun.

596
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,230
I guess she's afraid of being incriminated.

597
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,860
I called you several times.
What took you so long?

598
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,200
As you know,

599
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,770
I am the chairman of JL Construction.

600
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,640
So I'm kind of busy.

601
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,380
If Munju Redevelopment Project comes to nothing,

602
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,210
your JL Construction will go out of business.

603
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,980
So why do you seem relaxed about it?

604
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,650
Gosh, this woman is unpleasant.

605
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,490
Why would it come to nothing,
and why would I go out of business?

606
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,900
Everyone's talking about the serial murder case.

607
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,030
They're even talking about murder cases
from 20 years ago.

608
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,230
Congratulations.

609
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,870
Hey, are you trying to provoke me?

610
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,940
Me?

611
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,610
How could I dare to provoke you?

612
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,780
No, I wasn't.

613
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,040
I was sincerely congratulating you.

614
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,580
Because your precious son
is getting a special promotion.

615
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,820
A special promotion? Why would he?

616
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,520
I heard your son helped
to catch the supermarket owner.

617
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,620
I heard he took several patrol cars along...

618
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,590
to save that butcher shop lady.

619
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:23,400
Actually, he didn't take patrol cars along.

620
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,770
Small little details aren't important.

621
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,830
I'm just saying it's something
to think about macroscopically.

622
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,840
If Inspector Park Jeong Je of Munju Police Station...

623
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,410
hadn't employed a diversionary tactic,

624
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,650
would they have been able to catch the killer?

625
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,450
Here's what I think.

626
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,050
Your son has done all the work.

627
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,490
And Chief Superintendent Han's son
and Lee Dong Sik...

628
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,660
are taking all the credit.

629
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,990
But darn it.

630
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,860
What?

631
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,930
Chief Superintendent Han is very smart.

632
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,730
What do you mean?

633
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,070
I heard illegal immigrant prostitutes
are involved in it.

634
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,540
So both the Regional Investigation Unit
of the Seoul Police...

635
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,110
and the Foreign Affairs Division
are trying to take the case.

636
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,920
It's good for us if they do.

637
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,660
If the background of the case is not Munju
but the whole country...

638
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,460
Then we'd be able to push ahead
with the redevelopment project.

639
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,890
You're right.

640
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,130
But unfortunately,

641
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,430
he seems to have discovered
paternal love all of a sudden.

642
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,300
So he stopped it.

643
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,140
That crazy jerk.

644
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,210
Why would he show paternal love now?

645
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,270
He thinks if the Seoul Police Agency
takes the case,

646
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,740
they might snatch his son's achievement.

647
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,010
Oh, come on.

648
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,520
He's more interested in
being promoted to the chief...

649
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,280
than his son.

650
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,790
He asked to finish the investigation
at Munju Police Station...

651
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,260
and hand it
to Gyeonggi Seobu district prosecutor's office.

652
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,960
And the prosecutor was Han Ju Won's private tutor.

653
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,630
It's a setup from start to finish.

654
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,600
So you should do something...

655
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,900
for your son too.

656
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,010
It could be a good opportunity
if you look at the big picture.

657
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,880
Take the details...

658
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,350
and exaggerate.

659
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,820
Just cook something up
and get him a special promotion.

660
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,090
I just remembered that I have an appointment.

661
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,720
So you should've come earlier.

662
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,830
We can talk at another time.

663
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,230
Lady.

664
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,200
Go for it.

665
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,740
What did you just say?

666
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,550
I told you to draw a girl, not a deer.

667
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,920
That deer looks just like Min Jung.

668
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,490
So if you draw a girl,
everyone will know it's her.

669
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,360
It will be hung in the living room
so how will they even see it...

670
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,930
and notice it's her?

671
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,530
Because I'm going to post the picture
on social media.

672
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,300
The police officer
who worked hard to catch the killer...

673
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,570
sincerely cherishes the memory of the victim.

674
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,610
People will be touched by it.

675
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,980
Just leave.

676
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,650
My goodness, boy. Just do as I say.

677
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,950
What's wrong with you?

678
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,090
Lee Dong Sik and Han Ju Won...

679
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,650
are hogging all the credit.

680
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,390
So do you really want to sit here
drawing deer?

681
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,060
I'll take it back for you.

682
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,400
I'll get you a special promotion.

683
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,430
Mother.

684
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:49,800
Everyone looks out for their own interests.

685
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,240
So you should become a senior inspector too.

686
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,610
Son, the one who will be promoted this time...

687
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,850
is you, not Lee Dong Sik. Okay?

688
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,550
I will never let him have it.

689
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,950
- I will take care of everything.
- Mom.

690
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,990
Yes, what is it?

691
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,250
Do you want me to die?

692
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,530
- Jeong Je.
- Do you want me to die?

693
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,260
- Hey!
- Leave Dong Sik alone!

694
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,160
Stop harassing him.

695
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,270
Why?

696
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,800
Why is he important to you?

697
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,640
He's the only friend I have.

698
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,740
So don't mess with him.

699
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,240
Son.

700
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,810
(Oh Ji Hwa)

701
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,980
Yes, Ji Hwa.

702
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,780
Hold on.

703
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,720
Aren't you leaving?

704
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,020
I am. I'm leaving.

705
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,130
You foolish boy.

706
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,340
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe I called at a bad time.

707
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,540
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:04,480
Don't be. So what's going on?

709
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,350
I realized I forgot to tell you something.

710
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,280
Good job.

711
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,250
What are you talking about?

712
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,750
Jae Yi.

713
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,350
You saved her.

714
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,090
You did well.

715
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,560
You did a good job, Jeong Je.

716
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,030
Who are you? You're not Ji Hwa, are you?

717
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,230
Where's my friend Ji Hwa?

718
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,740
Is that how you take compliments?

719
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,480
How is Dong Sik doing?

720
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,150
He's driving me crazy.

721
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,480
That punk Dong Sik disappeared.

722
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,850
What?

723
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,420
Did you try reaching his partner, Inspector Han?

724
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,660
He took a few days off.

725
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,260
What an amazing pair of nut cases.

726
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,660
I said I don't know!

727
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,570
You should've at least brought a photo of her.

728
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,600
Aren't you leaving?
Why are you standing there?

729
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,200
Bring some salt and throw it at him.

730
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:18,250
Oh, no. You got dirt on your shoes.

731
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,680
Are you a stalker or something?

732
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,390
I'm your partner.

733
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,620
Did you track my location illegally?

734
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,730
"Forget-me-not", "Rose", "Lily"?

735
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,830
My gosh, all the pretty flowers are gathered here.

736
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,700
You entered and graduated from...

737
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,920
Korean National Police University
at the top of your class.

738
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,770
What is a delicate officer such as yourself...

739
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,910
doing here in broad daylight?

740
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,840
Do you like pufferfish soup?

741
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,390
(Pufferfish Soup Restaurant)

742
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,630
My, this is nice. Busan pufferfish soup.

743
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,770
This place sells the best pufferfish soup in Korea.

744
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,710
Help yourself.
It's the chief's treat.

745
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,610
You mean Chief Nam Sang Bae?

746
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,110
Chief Nam loves the pufferfish soup from here.

747
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,850
When we were in the Regional Investigation Unit,

748
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,480
we caught a culprit in Ulsan...

749
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,320
and the three of us, Chief Nam, me, and the culprit,

750
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,420
came all the way to Busan to have this
before getting back to Seoul.

751
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,060
He said it's a real crime not to have the soup...

752
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,520
when we were already down here.

753
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,990
He told me to have this with you.

754
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,870
How unnecessary.

755
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,040
I find this kind of gesture really uncomfortable.

756
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,140
I clearly told you before
that I don't want...

757
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,270
anyone to cling to me or be mindful of me.

758
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,310
If you don't need those people,

759
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,850
why can't you cut anyone off?

760
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,780
You must be wondering
why you're feeling so uncomfortable.

761
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,590
What are you talking about?
What do you mean I can't cut anyone off?

762
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,620
Why are you here alone?

763
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,930
To catch me?

764
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,930
Why don't you just put handcuffs on me?

765
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,740
I confessed everything to you, remember?

766
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:26,110
No one's going to die from today.

767
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,410
What did you just say?

768
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,620
My sister, Yu Yeon...

769
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,590
I'm going to find out where he buried...

770
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,020
everyone who went missing and take them out.

771
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,530
You'll arrest him yourself, Inspector Han.

772
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,200
"Arrest"? Why don't you arrest him yourself too?

773
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,500
You already knew everything and put up a show.

774
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,710
You're the one who brought back
Kang Min Jung's fingers, aren't you?

775
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,710
I'm sorry for what I've done to you, Inspector Han.

776
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,620
- I'm sorry for everything.
- Don't you apologize.

777
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,190
I know you're a criminal too.
You should be punished.

778
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,360
After I find her.
After I find my sister,

779
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,100
then you can put handcuffs on me yourself.

780
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,800
I promise. I will...

781
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,240
turn myself in...

782
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,610
to you, Inspector Han.

783
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,150
Do you believe my words?

784
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,620
Why would you believe what a criminal said?

785
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,460
Why are you being so clingy?

786
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,930
Why weren't you enraged?

787
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
After arresting Kang Jin Mook...

788
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,870
and at Kang Min Jung's funeral.

789
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,840
Even in the interrogation room.

790
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,310
My goodness.
Were you suspicious of me because I was calm?

791
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,650
I'm just curious because I don't get you.

792
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,920
I was enraged, of course.

793
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,320
He and I have been close friends for 20 years.

794
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,430
But being enraged gets me nowhere.

795
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,770
You also need to be done with rage.

796
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,870
You were enraged that the people
of the Foreign Affairs Division...

797
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,100
didn't trust you.

798
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,170
That's why you came all the way to Manyang.

799
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,510
You think I was enraged at them?

800
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,810
They came across a case by chance...

801
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,550
when they were investigating a voice phishing case.

802
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,050
The victims of the case they found
were illegal immigrants...

803
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,290
who made a living through prostitution.

804
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,790
They must've wanted to believe
it was done by a Chinese gang.

805
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,090
They said I was making up a story...

806
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,290
because I wanted to get promoted.

807
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,130
That I was exaggerating the case
by spicing up the story.

808
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,230
Why would I be enraged at people
who spew such nonsense?

809
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,710
They just didn't like me
and didn't want to listen to me.

810
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,010
Because I'm better and smarter than them.

811
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,580
But I am better than them.

812
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:21,450
Goodness. He's so full of himself.

813
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,590
Well, I know you're full of yourself,

814
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,690
but you're not the type to lie.

815
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,930
They're so weird.

816
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,330
Don't butter me up.
I won't go easy on you.

817
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,630
Once we find all the victims,
I'll make sure to arrest you.

818
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,740
I know that. You must be dying
to arrest me seeing how...

819
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,310
you came all the way to Busan,
following Kang Jin Mook's traces...

820
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,640
all by yourself.

821
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,750
I saw the records
of Kang Jin Mook's location tracking on his phone.

822
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,990
He came down to Busan quite often.

823
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,020
Even on the day before Min Jung died.

824
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,160
Here's a question for you.

825
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,000
What is Inspector Han looking for in Busan?

826
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,600
I'm looking for the birth mother of Kang Min Jung,

827
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,300
Yoon Mi Hye.

828
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,170
You're the one who stalked me.

829
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,980
You took this before coming down to Manyang, right?

830
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,680
Check out the next photo.

831
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,450
(Hey, police officer...)

832
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,220
"Police officer"?

833
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,590
I thought she was saying
she met a police officer,

834
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,390
but I think she meant to say
that it wasn't a police officer.

835
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,100
You thought she said she met a police officer...

836
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,100
and came down to Manyang because of that text?

837
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,330
I told her to text me "1"
if it was him.

838
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,610
And she did text me "1".

839
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,910
She typed many, at that.

840
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,210
Don't be embarrassed.

841
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,220
Police are supposed to act on their hunches.

842
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,820
We don't need reasoning.

843
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,820
"H, Mi"?

844
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,160
Six years ago, Lee Geum Hwa was caught...

845
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,330
in the crackdown on prostitution in Busan.

846
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,330
So she was forced to leave the country.

847
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:17,300
- Name.
- It's Lee Geum Hwa.

848
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,600
The women that were caught with her...

849
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,710
were Jin Hwa Lim, Wi Sun Hee, Yeo Chun Ok,

850
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,210
and...

851
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,180
- Yoon Mi Hye.
- Name.

852
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,580
It's Yoon Mi Hye.

853
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,380
According to the record,

854
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,150
Yoon Mi Hye used a false name
in the massage parlours.

855
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,660
- She flipped her first name.
- As in Hye Mi?

856
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,430
"H, Mi"...

857
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:49,200
"He's not a police officer.
He's looking for Hye Mi".

858
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,970
I'm sure that's what Lee Geum Hwa wanted to type.

859
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,470
I heard from Constable Oh...

860
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,840
that Kang Jin Mook kept a photo
of Yoon Mi Hye in his wallet.

861
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,080
He showed it to the women in massage parlours...

862
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,920
and looked for Yoon Mi Hye?

863
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,180
Their marriage wasn't registered,

864
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,650
so there was no legal way for him to find her.

865
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,590
He must've traced Yoon Mi Hye
from the first massage parlour they met...

866
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,990
and eventually ended up in Busan.

867
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,190
Could you take a close look at the photo?

868
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,960
I said I can't recognize her.

869
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,400
It's a photo from 20 years ago, so...

870
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,170
I don't care how old the photo is.

871
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,030
I said I've never seen someone like her.

872
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,670
Why did he look for her for over 20 years?

873
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,540
Remember how he was driven into a frenzy...

874
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,510
when we said Kang Min Jung might not be his daughter?

875
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,140
A simple DNA test could prove it,

876
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,710
but why did he have to go around the country
to look for her...

877
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,980
and kill Jin Hwa Lim, Wi Sun Hee,
Yeo Chun Ok, and Lee Geum Hwa?

878
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,450
He didn't want Yoon Mi Hye
to find out he was looking for her.

879
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,520
Because he was going to find her and kill her.

880
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:54,130
- But why did he kill Min Jung?
- According to the tracking record,

881
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,170
on the day
before Kang Jin Mook killed his daughter,

882
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,770
(Maria)

883
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,240
he was there.

884
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,050
Just ask us the questions already and leave.

885
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,350
I don't think they know anything though.

886
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:13,920
It's this guy.

887
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,350
I'm not sure.

888
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,220
Who did he look for?

889
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,990
He must've looked for a woman named Hye Mi.

890
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,920
He also could've mentioned a name
called Yoon Mi Hye.

891
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,760
I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

892
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,330
But there are so many people
who look like him.

893
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,600
I think I've seen a truckload.

894
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,940
Maybe he's one of your customers.

895
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,770
How dare you.

896
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,510
- He must be!
- No way.

897
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:45,310
Could you take a look at this photo too?

898
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,780
Sure.

899
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,350
I asked Jeong Je for it.

900
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,890
It was in Kang Jin Moon's wallet.

901
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,030
Thank you for coming to Busan.

902
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,130
You're only thanking me now?

903
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,760
Please take a look again.

904
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,830
On October 22,

905
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,470
this man here must've looked for this woman.

906
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,040
Do any of you remember?

907
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,270
I'm not sure. I don't think I've seen him.

908
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,610
I don't know him either. What about you?

909
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,580
- I seriously don't know him.
- Is that so?

910
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,350
Wait a minute. Isn't she Cherry?

911
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,850
"Cherry"?

912
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,790
This must be the guy
who came to look for Cherry.

913
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,990
The girl who works here told me...

914
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,190
some guy came looking for Cherry
while I was away.

915
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,660
Cherry used to work here for a short while.

916
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,430
Do you know where she is?

917
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,730
I do.

918
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,470
She was killed in a car accident last year.

919
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,540
- Poor thing.
- My gosh.

920
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,940
How futile.

921
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,510
Where have you been, Dong Sik?

922
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,220
Am I not allowed to talk now?

923
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,450
You should turn on the computer.

924
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,790
We're not doing that today.

925
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,160
We're not here to interrogate you.

926
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,460
- Liar.
- I came to ask you something.

927
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,300
He's here to watch me.

928
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,430
He's worried that I might kill you.

929
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,500
Inspector Han.

930
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,930
Why would Dong Sik kill me?

931
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:19,070
What did you want to ask?

932
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,480
Why did you kill Min Jung on that day?

933
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,850
I thought this isn't an interrogation.

934
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,680
Dong Sik. I told you, I didn't kill her.

935
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,790
I'm not asking if you killed her or not.

936
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,890
I'm asking why it had to be that day.

937
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,390
I didn't kill her,

938
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,090
so how would I know the day she was killed?

939
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,560
October 22.

940
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,660
The back alley of Myeonseo Port in Busan.

941
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,130
Maria.

942
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,100
I hear...

943
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,470
you showed this photo to them.

944
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,950
- I did?
- A worker from there remembers you.

945
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,650
She said you were looking for someone
named Hye Mi.

946
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,820
But she used the name Cherry at Maria.

947
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,320
And she was called Yoon Mi Hye in Manyang.

948
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,360
Is it illegal...

949
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,730
to look for my wife?

950
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,500
Well, it's not.

951
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,170
They told me that you heard...

952
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,640
how Yoon Mi Hye died.

953
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,600
Poor Mi Hye, right?

954
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,840
I went all over the country to look for her.

955
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,110
Is that why you killed Min Jung...

956
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,510
instead of Yoon Mi Hye?

957
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,150
Dong Sik, what on earth are you saying?

958
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,890
How could you say that?

959
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,120
Then let me say it.

960
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,030
For 20 years, you looked for a woman
who abandoned you.

961
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,300
But all that effort was in vain
because she was killed...

962
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,860
in a car accident.

963
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,570
You spent an entire 20 years.

964
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,070
You were despondent...

965
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,040
and bereft that you were about to go crazy.

966
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,440
And the girl who doesn't take after you at all,

967
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:04,210
who only looks like Yoon Mi Hye,

968
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,850
said this to you.

969
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,350
"Are you..."

970
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,220
"really my dad?"

971
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,590
I thought about it a lot,
and I don't think you are.

972
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,730
If you're not,
why do I have to live with you?

973
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,030
"You're going to abandon me as well?"

974
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,430
"How dare you abandon me?"

975
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,670
"Not this time. I can't lose you."

976
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,070
You strangled her.

977
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,870
With the pent-up rage you've had for 20 years,

978
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,580
you strangled her.

979
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:39,780
Inspector Han.

980
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,120
You must've watched too many movies.

981
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,590
Min Jung is my daughter.

982
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,430
She really is my daughter.

983
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:55,330
What? I don't think so.

984
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:00,070
99.9998 percent.

985
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,270
It's proven
that you're not her biological father.

986
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,580
(By 99.9998 percent,
it's proven that Kang Jin Mook is not...)

987
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,550
That crazy wench.

988
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,850
That witch. That crazy wench!

989
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:16,990
How dare she fool me?

990
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,920
If he caught Yoon Mi Hye,
he'd have killed her for sure.

991
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,290
I'm glad she wasn't caught.

992
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,800
You're glad she wasn't caught?

993
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,500
Yoon Mi Hye is alive.

994
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:39,070
She knew you were after her,
so she asked them to tell you she died.

995
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,140
Liar.

996
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,510
It's true.

997
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:51,950
There's no record of her death.

998
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:57,890
She knew you couldn't check
since your marriage wasn't registered.

999
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,730
You killed the wrong person,

1000
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,700
Mr. Kang Jin Mook.

1001
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,100
The woman you wanted to kill is still alive.

1002
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,050
Inspector Han, do you think this will work?

1003
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,920
We're giving it our best shot.

1004
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,720
But this is illegal!

1005
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,550
How can you forge a registration certificate?

1006
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,960
A bunch of public officials broke the law.

1007
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,890
Cheol Mun, be quiet.

1008
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,530
We have no evidence.

1009
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,530
Without his confession,
we'll never find the bodies of the victims.

1010
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,070
This isn't the day of resurrection.

1011
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,700
You think he'll confess
just because we resurrected her on paper?

1012
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,800
He's saying something.

1013
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,370
Dong Sik.

1014
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,610
About Yu Yeon...

1015
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,150
I didn't kill Yu Yeon.

1016
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,420
I'm serious.

1017
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,220
I told you I didn't kill her.

1018
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,300
Don't ever call me anymore.

1019
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,800
I won't come even if you do.

1020
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,110
I'm telling the truth.
I'm not lying.

1021
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,210
I sent Yu Yeon back to you.

1022
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,050
Hold on, Dong Sik.

1023
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,280
Come here.

1024
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,990
I have something to tell you.

1025
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,420
Shut your mouth, you jerk!

1026
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,430
I'll tell you where I buried her.

1027
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:42,430
Don't you want to know
where she's buried?

1028
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,070
I'll tell you
where everyone else is buried too.

1029
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,080
Come here, Dong Sik.

1030
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:11,860
Instead,

1031
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,630
find Mi Hye for me.

1032
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,930
Bring her in front of me.

1033
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,670
Hey. You jerk.

1034
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,570
Cut the nonsense, you scumbag.

1035
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,380
I'm a cop.

1036
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,710
Since when were you ever a cop?

1037
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,720
You're the one who...

1038
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,150
put Min Jung's fingers in front of my house.

1039
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,860
I found out when you sent me the text.

1040
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,230
"Dad, please let me out."

1041
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,070
You can do it, Dong Sik.

1042
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,840
What will you do...

1043
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,910
if I don't find Yoon Mi Hye for you?

1044
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,280
I know you will.

1045
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,420
You need to find Yu Yeon, don't you?

1046
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,590
I'll only tell you where Yu Yeon is...

1047
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,330
when you bring Mi Hye here.

1048
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,570
I am the owner of this house!

1049
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:33,040
Why are you digging up the ground?

1050
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,910
- They found a body here?
- What on earth are they doing?

1051
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,310
Let go of me! I need to see it myself!

1052
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,210
This is driving me crazy.

1053
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,550
Where is that jerk right now?

1054
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,090
Are we his servants or something?
They always shove us around.

1055
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,090
He's ordering people to do stuff
without spending any money.

1056
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,960
House prices here will plummet now.

1057
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,060
You shouldn't say that.

1058
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,500
They'll throw stones at you.

1059
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,170
Falling house prices gives me a headache too.

1060
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:01,900
They're digging up Jae Yi's backyard right now.

1061
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,040
Please be careful not to damage the remains
when you move them.

1062
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,050
You can't get in here, ma'am.

1063
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,150
It's my mom. I'm her daughter!

1064
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,020
Let her go. Get in.

1065
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,700
Jae Yi, we don't know if it's her yet.

1066
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,740
We'll have NFS run a DNA test.

1067
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,150
I can't recognize her.

1068
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,580
- I don't think it's her.
- Jae Yi.

1069
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:50,790
Ji Hwa, there's no way
she's been lying there.

1070
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,090
It's been 10 years.
I've been here for 10 years.

1071
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,960
I would've known, right?

1072
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,370
No, that's not her.
My mom must be alive, right?

1073
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,270
- Collect the evidence items too.
- Yes, sir.

1074
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,670
Seriously.

1075
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,640
It can't be my...

1076
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,650
Mom...

1077
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,090
Mom.

1078
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh, no.

1079
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,070
I'm so sorry.

1080
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,110
No...

1081
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,680
Jae Yi.

1082
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,650
Jae Yi.

1083
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,170
Mom.

1084
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,970
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry.

1085
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,380
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,970
Hey, I'm really busy right now.

1087
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,900
- So why don't you answer my calls?
- Well, you don't either.

1088
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,270
Prosecutor Kwon.

1089
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,840
They dug up so many bodies.

1090
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,240
You know me. I never do all-night work.

1091
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,980
- Even when I took the bar exam...
- Hyeok.

1092
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,650
We haven't found a female body in her 20s.

1093
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,620
NFS examined their teeth to determine their age...

1094
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,420
but they were all in their 30s or 40s.

1095
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,160
You're looking for Lee Dong Sik's sister, right?

1096
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,360
I heard they dug up his house
but didn't find anything.

1097
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,860
Just call me if you hear something.

1098
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,660
Okay. Just answer my calls.

1099
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:16,400
Keep up the good work.

1100
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:20,370
What's wrong with him?
Since when were they so close?

1101
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,340
Let's go see Kang Jin Mook.

1102
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,110
Let's beat him up until he tells us.

1103
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:02,310
We should find your sister.
So let's do what we can do.

1104
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:06,110
I'll help you.

1105
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,650
Are you that desperate to catch me?

1106
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:23,700
Of course.
I came here to catch you in the first place.

1107
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,500
So let's go see Kang Jin Mook.

1108
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,940
(Oh Ji Hwa)

1109
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,880
Yes, Ji Hwa.

1110
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,880
(Kwon Hyeok)

1111
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,960
I said we should move him to the detention center.

1112
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,130
You couldn't stop this
while he was in your custody?

1113
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,760
(Fishing line)

1114
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,100
(Dong Sik, I didn't...)

1115
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,600
Dong Sik.

1116
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,300
(kill Yu Yeon.)

1117
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,200
I didn't kill Yu Yeon.

1118
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,480
(Dong Sik, I didn't kill Yu Yeon.)

1119
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,530
=Beyond Evil=

1120
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,570
I carried out a sting operation alone...

1121
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:33,130
and a woman was killed in the process.

1122
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,470
So I ask to be prosecuted.

1123
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,870
Check the date of the video.

1124
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:42,340
It was filmed on the day
that Supermarket Murderer died.

1125
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:46,580
Did you two kill Kang Jin Mook?

1126
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:50,550
About Yu Yeon... I didn't kill Yu Yeon.

1127
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,820
That's why you hooked me then.

1128
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,890
Because you thought I'd be very useful.
