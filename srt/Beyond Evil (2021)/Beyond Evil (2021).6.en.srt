I know you're busy but I asked for you.

Don't be.

10

Why would you be sorry?

You don't have to be sorry.

13

Thank you. I really appreciate it.

I ran into 27 officers today.

How will they find Min Jung at this rate?

42
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,775
What do we do, Min Jung?

43
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:46,476
I guess you're stuck with me forever.

Goodness, I feel bad for the victim who got killed.

49
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:36,625
We don't know for certain
if the victim is dead or alive.

50
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,065
What's wrong with you, Inspector Han?

51
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,195
They found blood in the bathroom
of the victim's house.

52
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,505
We can't conclude...

53
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,736
Min Jung, I heard he dragged you back again.

54
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:47,036
Are you at home?
How are you feeling?

55
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,945
Jeong Je, I'm so tired.

56
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:51,476
I'm on my way home now.

57

(Jeong Je, I'm so tired.
I'm on my way home now.)

58
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,276
So his motive is clear.

59
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,885
So letting him go
without getting a warrant is a little...

60
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,885
What difference does it make?

61
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,156
Why are you being like this?

62
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:03,685
Do you think it's possible
to indict a suspect for murder...

63
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:04,995
where the body is missing?

64
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,156
It's impossible.

65
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:09,265
That's right.

66
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:13,336
Even if they request a warrant,
it'll get rejected.

67
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,305
You know the reasons that judges like.

68
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,166
That darned reasonable doubt...

69
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,736
- That they can't exclude.
- That they can't exclude.

70
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,505
Even so, it's wrong...

71
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:23,205
to not be able to punish the murderer.

72
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:25,315
That's what the law says.
What can we do about it?

73
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,776
Don't you agree, Inspector Han?

74
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,786
You're right.

75
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,156
It might end up as a cold case
if they can't find the body.

Dong Sik.

77
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:41,226
You should wake Min Jung up
and take her home.

78
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:52,736
I think she dropped those.

79
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:07,616
I can't believe her.
She ran away again.

80
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,526
- What do we do?
- Just leave it at that.

81
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,325
At least she made the bed.

82
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:15,926
I guess she sobered up.

83
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,395
She must've gone home, right?

84
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:21,565
- Should I call her?
- You don't have to.

85
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:24,236
I have to call her anyway.

86
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,836
Why would I take you home?

87
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,906
Just go straight home.

88
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,875
And don't even think of fooling me.

89
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,536
Because I'll know if you're lying.

90
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,606
How on earth would you know?

91
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:16,986
Well, we'll meet at Jae Yi's at 8pm,
exactly 1 hour from now.

92
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,825
Why don't we just go right now?

93
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,825
I asked Ji Hwa and Jeong Je to come too.

94
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,726
There are only a few of us
so let's start when everyone's there.

95
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,195
What do you mean, there's only a few of us?

96
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:29,536
1, 2, 3.

97
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,236
Where did Ji Hun go?

98
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:35,075
He left.
He said he needs to take care of something.

99
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:38,676
Hey, there's the fourth person.

100
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,616
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

101
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:43,815
What? Wait.

102
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,286
Wait, Inspector Han.

103
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:47,156
Just let him go.

104
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,625
You can't force people
to join business dinners these days.

105
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,986
Then I should leave too.

106
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,226
I'll see you in an hour.

107
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,565
Oh, there's Dong Sik.
You could be the fourth person.

108
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,005
Let me off the hook tonight.

109
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:04,505
I need to take care of something.

110
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,135
Besides, I'm really tired.

111
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,776
Come on, Dong Sik.

112
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,546
Just let him go.
Dong Sik stayed up all night...

113
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:13,476
to go find Min Jung.

114
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,046
Just go home.

115
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:19,856
That's right. Min Jung went home.

116
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,856
So we should call Jin Mook out.

122
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:11,806
I told you to go straight home.

123
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,375
I did.

124
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:18,346
I went through so much to come in

00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,915
Did you climb over the wall?

128
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,116
You dropped them at the substation.

129
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,966
Gosh, Dad can't find out about this.

130

Hey.

131
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:50,076
Hold on. I'll call you back.

Jeong Je! What are you doing here?

133
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,436
I came to take you home.

134
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:16,206
All of a sudden?
What's going on?

135
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,175

I told you that I can find out.

I don't even remember how much I had to drink.

137

I'm sure.

138
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,966
Min Jung, I told you not to take this road.

139
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:49,905
The lights are flickering,
and it's faster to go the other way.

00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,145
No, it's okay.

167
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:26,316
Who?

168
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,015
Han Ju Won.

169
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:31,056
There's a high chance
that this is a serial murder case.

170
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:33,226
The new inspector.

171
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,125
I wanted to get his number.

172
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:39,696
One second.

173
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,505
- What do you think you're...
- Hello?

174
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,576
I... Hello?

175
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,045
Hello?

176
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:58,385
Are you Inspector Han Ju Won?

177
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,456
I am.

178
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:03,385
So I guess you were together.

179
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:09,395
I just asked him for your number.

180
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:14,535
Hello, I'm Kang Min Jung's father,

181
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,806
Kang Jin Mook.

182
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,616
Why did you want my number?

183
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:32,186
I wanted to see you.

184
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:34,216
What?

185
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:37,686
I really want to meet you,

186
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,866
Inspector Han.

187
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:05,755
Dong Sik, you don't have to stand there.

188
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,255
Grab a seat.

189
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:08,556
I need to use the bathroom.

190
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:18,125
I called you so suddenly,

191
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,696
yet you came over very soon.

192
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:24,535
But I don't have anything better to offer.

193
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,546
Are you asking me...

194
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,715
to conduct a separate investigation on my own?

195
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:15,385
Dong Sik, so...

196
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:20,496
it's not that I don't trust Ji Hwa.

197
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:24,326
Ji Hwa wouldn't usually do this,

198
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:29,665
but she won't tell me anything.

199
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,135
Did Min Jung go through something terrible?

200
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:38,875
Or was she unable to find anything?

201
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:44,185
I heard you worked in Seoul until recently.

202
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:49,256
I heard you were a very talented detective.

203
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,086
Please, just this once.

204
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,526
I'm a man who has nothing.

205
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:59,836
I should be doing everything I can as her father,

206
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:04,205
but I couldn't find anything,

207
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,606
and I don't know anything either.

208
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,776
Please, I beg you.

209
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:12,616
Please, I ask of you.

210
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:17,445
Please help me. Please find her.

211
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:24,485
That's enough, Jin Mook.

212
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:32,895
Let go of my hand.

213
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,566
I'm sorry.

214
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:39,106
I'm so sorry.

215
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,616
I'll record your statement as a reference.

216
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,715
Let us begin from the day she went missing.

217
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,086
Inspector Han.

218
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,116
May we have a word outside?

219
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:07,965
What do you think you're doing?

220
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:10,836
I was going to start investigating the testifier.

221
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,435
Are you saying
you're going to do an investigation?

222
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:14,405
Yes.

223
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,175
Don't you know your place?

224
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:20,276
Inspector Han,
you're now an officer of Manyang Substation.

225
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:22,546
Don't you know the detectives
of the Violent Crimes Unit...

226
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:24,145
are in charge of violent crimes?

227
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:25,955
"How far will you go?"

228
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:29,826
"Can you throw away
all the rules and the principles?"

229
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,625
Don't you remember
you're the one who asked me that?

230
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:35,056
And this is my answer to that question.

231
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,066
It's really strange.

232
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:43,135
Of all people,
Kang Min Jung is the one who's missing here.

233
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:46,536
And Mr. Kang Jin Mook is her family.

234
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,145
You're supposed to do anything you can...

235
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:52,415
because you're practically family.
So why are you so upset now?

236
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:59,385
Is it because the leader of the team in charge
is Inspector Oh?

237
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:04,586
Are you now saying
the person I'm protecting is Oh Ji Hwa?

238
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:07,925
You're so terrible at guessing.

239
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:10,725
"Who would that be?"

240
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,235
"Guess who it is."

241
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:16,266
You know you did all that,
saying things like this.

242
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,905
And now you're saying it's not Oh Ji Hwa.

243
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,705
You know what? I still can't believe you.

244
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,645
The security camera at the station.

245
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:30,145
The day after the incident,

246
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:33,016
something seems to have happened in the archives.

247
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:34,155
What did I do?

248
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,125
- Did you do that to Min Jung...
- Did I do what to her?

249
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,826
Did I kill her?

250
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,935
And the security footage...

251
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:53,506
from the staircases, hallway,

252
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:55,905
and the archives...

253
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,645
taken around that time have all been deleted.

254
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:03,145
So it's only natural to think...

255
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:06,356
that someone had something to hide,
and someone in the police station...

256
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,915
deleted the footage.

257
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:11,856
So now I'm going to
do the investigation properly myself.

258
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,395
It's also what the missing person's family wants.

259
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:19,395
What do you think, Officer Lee?

260
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,665
The rules and principles.

261
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,506
Can you throw it all away?

262
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,076
That was the last time I saw her.

263
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:30,905
It was the last time.

264
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:36,346
My dear Min Jung...

265
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:41,586
I shouldn't have gone outside.

266
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,625
When you said you went outside,

267
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,195
do you mean you went to Manyang Butcher Shop,

268
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,066
where you referred to as Jae Yi's place?

269
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,465
I heard...

270
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,336
everyone was coming.

271
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,606
At first, I thought of not going,

272
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:59,836
but Ji Hun came, so...

273
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:03,475
You mean Constable Oh?
What time was it?

274
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:08,945
(Recent, Ji Hun)

275
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:12,415
It was 8:33pm.

276
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:15,116
How can you tell from the call history?

277
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:19,395
Chief Nam called me,

278
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:22,496
so I went to Jae Yi's place.

279
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:27,465
Everyone was eating meat there.

280
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:29,405
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

281
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:35,705
And I grilled some galbi for Min Jung.

282
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:41,145
I should have left the shop then.

283
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:46,816
What time did you arrive home
after you left the butcher shop?

284
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:52,286
I think it was around 11:20pm.

285
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,496
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

286
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:56,796
- Bye.
- I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

287
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:03,366
It was about that time. Right, Dong Sik?

288
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:11,875
Dong Sik lives in the neighbourhood,

289
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:13,816
so I came home with him.

290
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:15,846
Is that so?

291
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:19,286
I should have opened the door to her room
at least once.

292
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,125
But I thought she must be tired
and didn't want to wake her up.

293
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,725
Until we knocked on your door at night,

294
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:33,296
did you not hear anything?

295
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:35,836
Not at all.

296
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:39,635
Did you not hear Min Jung
leaving the house either?

297
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:43,776
If I had heard anything,

298
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:49,046
I would have opened her bedroom door.

299
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:57,026
I can't open the door now.

300
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:02,096
I can't... Min Jung is not there.

301
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:15,154
(Manyang Supermarket)

302
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,194
(Manyang-eup)

303
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,664
Well, it was...

304
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:27,735
a bit over 7pm...

305
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,444
when Min Jung came home.

306
00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:32,305
(Kang Min Jung arrives home.)

307
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:35,715
My goodness!

308
00:24:36,414 --> 00:24:38,414
You're home.

309
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,315
I'm sure you're tired.

310
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:45,055
Did you have dinner yet?
You should eat.

311
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:49,364
I heard people are having a barbecue dinner...

312
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,225
at Jae Yi's.

313
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:54,565
I'm tired. I'll take a shower and go to bed.

314
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:07,374
(Ji Hun)

315
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,245
I got the phone call...

316
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:12,444
at 7:17pm.

317
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:15,985
At first, I thought of not going,

318
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,624
but Ji Hun came, so...

319
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:24,765
Jin Mook, it's me, Ji Hun.

320
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,765
You mean Constable Oh?

321
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:28,334
What time was it?

322
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:31,035
(Oh Ji Hun arrives at Manyang Supermarket.)

323
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:34,434
It was 8:33pm.

324
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:37,174
How can you tell from the call history?

325
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:40,844
Chief Nam called me...

326
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:42,884
Hey, Mr. Kang.

327
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,844
It's already past 8pm.
Where are you?

328
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:46,955
In your store?

329
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,624
Ji Hun said he was going there.
Is he there now?

330
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:55,955
Yes. Bring them and hurry over.

331
00:25:56,725 --> 00:26:01,334
He's packing some makgeolli now.

332
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:05,364
We will make sure we have enough.

333
00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:06,934
Okay. Bye.

334
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,934
12 bottles should be enough, right?

335
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:11,305
Maybe not.

336
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,515
(Came back to Manyang Supermarket)

337
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:16,745
What time did you arrive home
after you left the butcher shop?

338
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:20,154
I think it was around...

339
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:22,555
11:20pm.

340
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:24,684
(11:20pm)

341
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:27,825
It was about that time.
Right, Dong Sik?

342
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:35,864
Dong Sik lives in the neighbourhood,

343
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:38,604
so I came home with him.

344
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:40,735
Is that so?

345
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:43,674
(With Officer Lee Dong Sik)

346
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:46,215
Do you know anyone
or have any evidence to prove it?

347
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,715
No, I don't have any.

348
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,884
Right. At the butcher shop.

349
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,684
What time was it?

350
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,184
11pm.

351
00:26:57,184 --> 00:27:00,194
It means I have nothing to prove my alibi
after 11pm.

352
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,025
Because I just went home and went to bed.

353
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:05,025
This could have been his alibi,

354
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:07,965
but he didn't mention it.

355
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:10,904
Why?

356
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:15,775
If I had heard anything,

357
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:19,344
I would have opened her bedroom door.

358
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:24,584
I can't open the door now.

359
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:27,614
I can't... Min Jung is not there.

360
00:27:35,124 --> 00:27:36,225
Was anything stolen?

361
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,364
Her phone.

362
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:46,374
Except for that, everything was in the room...

363
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:47,834
exactly as it was.

364
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:01,184
Are you saying
even things like her wallet were still there?

365
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:06,894
Her wallet and her bags were all in the room.

366
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,664
Did anything else go missing?

367
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:15,965
Well, it's nothing big.

368
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:18,805
A washcloth.

369
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:21,535
An exfoliating washcloth.

370
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:24,444
It's a long strip that Jae Yi got her.

371
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,174
That went missing.

372
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:42,825
You're right. It's gone.

373
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:44,525
She always had it tied up...

374
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:47,394
in a ribbon on the handle of this basket.

375
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,134
What did it look like?

376
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:51,904
You know, the usual. The long, green one.

377
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:54,475
I bought a box of two, and we split it.

378
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:58,874
I think I got it at the cosmetics store next door.

379
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:04,344
On the 23rd, when Ms. Kang was last seen,

380
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,815
she left Manyang Butcher Shop after dinner...

381
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:10,884
around 11pm. Is that correct?

382
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:13,624
Yes, that sounds about right.

383
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:18,965
Why?

384
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,164
So who are you suspecting now?

385
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:24,035
- Is it wrong to suspect someone?
- Of course not.

386
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:28,705
I was just wondering
if you knew who you were suspecting?

387
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,374
I should suspect everyone.

388
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,315
That's my job.

389
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:39,785
Detectives have a very sad job.

390
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,854
You have to be suspicious of everyone.

391
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,785
Dong Sik isn't like that.

392
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:52,025
You should start getting suspicious too, Ms. Yoo,

393
00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:54,295
if you want to find your mother.

394
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:59,205
I know you searched
every corner of this country to find her.

395
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:01,575
- So try to be cool-headed...
- Ju Won.

396
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,475
I'll find my mom on my own.

397
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:06,975
I don't need you
to blurt out your half-hearted advice...

398
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,545
just because this doesn't concern you.

399
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:12,884
I would've ignored it if I were you.
I never looked.

400
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,755
Thank you for your cooperation.

401
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:25,694
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

402
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:53,094
I think it was around 11:20pm.

403
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:56,255
It was about that time. Right, Dong Sik?

404
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:03,104
Dong Sik lives in the neighbourhood,
so I came home with him.

405
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:04,904
Is that so?

406
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:08,674
He never answered any of his questions.

407
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:12,045
I can't... Min Jung is not there.

408
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:17,844
Was anything stolen?

409
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,684
Then he asked if anything was stolen.

410
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:30,394
(Kwon Hyeok)

411
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:37,735
Hey, Hyeok. I had a favour to ask.

412
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:41,634
The audit office will conduct
the questioning tomorrow afternoon.

413
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,505
Ju Won will be there.

414
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,944
I'm sure you aren't here to tell me just that.

415
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:50,644
Ju Won wanted the case file
for the Kang Min Jung case...

416
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:52,884
and the access history of the situation room...

417
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:55,215
that's in charge of the security cameras
for Munju Police Station.

418
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:58,485
The security cameras inside the station?

419
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:01,495
Yes, sir. Starting from 3pm of October 24...

420
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:05,295
to the next day at 10pm of October 25.

421
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,535
He sounded very desperate,
unlike how he usually is.

422
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,735
I felt bad, so I was going to do it for him.

423
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,844
But then I realized...

424
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,205
I shouldn't help him snoop around...

425
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:20,944
without you knowing.

426
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,184
Don't worry. I'll stop him.

427
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:25,844
Give it to him when he comes.

428
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:28,255
- Sorry?
- You can't stop someone...

429
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:30,084
who's out of his mind.

430
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:33,325
I need to know what's driving him crazy
to stop him from doing this.

431
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:36,465
You should look into it
and find out what he's after.

432
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:39,094
- But I believe...
- Prosecutor Kwon.

433
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:41,965
I don't need your opinion.
Just do as I say.

434
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,434
If you're thoughtless,
the least you can do is act quickly.

435
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,535
Sorry?

436
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:54,645
Why do you think he asked a prosecutor
for the police record?

437
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:58,015
It means you'll have to ask someone in the police agency.

438
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:01,254
Who among the police force
wouldn't expect you to return the favour?

439
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:04,455
If he contacted you
knowing you'll run over to me,

440
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:05,924
it means he'll poke around...

441
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:08,524
the entire police agency unless I help him.

442
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,064
It's better to give it to him...

443
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:12,665
after we leave out whatever we need to.

444
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,035
Ju Won is...

445
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,004
making good use of you as a stepping-stone.

446
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:25,145
Hyeok. A hunting dog...

447
00:33:25,444 --> 00:33:27,544
should never run behind its master.

448
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:29,745
It needs to know where he's headed...

449
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:31,544
and run ahead of him.

450
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:34,185
Who would want a dog that always follows him?

451
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:35,855
It would be better to just shoot it.

452
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:38,855
Get going.

453
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:52,535
Father.

454
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:59,645
There's something I haven't told you.

455
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:02,674
I may have made a mistake.

456
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:06,754
Ju Won asked me to look into someone before.

457
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:09,185
I was a bit shocked after my investigation...

458
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:11,325
because he was affiliated with you.

459
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:13,895
Who?

460
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:16,455
Inspector Park Jeong Je of Munju Police Station.

461
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:19,424
The only son of Councilwoman Do Hae Won of Munju.

462
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,805
I believe she was very close to you 20 years ago.

463
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,634
You two promoted the redevelopment project together.

464
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:30,705
I didn't inform him of his connection to you.

465
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:33,075
I didn't think you'd want me to.

466
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:35,814
I thought it'd be better...

467
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,285
to leave out what I can to keep him under control.

468
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,614
Do you think I was a bit too far ahead?

469
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:46,955
Good work, Hyeok. You may go.

470
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:14,214
Are you out of your mind?
You're taking a leave now?

471
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,154
I'm sick of everything.

472
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:19,924
I'm sick of Munju.

473
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:22,955
I'm sick of people.

474
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,094
I hate all this ruckus.

475
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,504
I thought you'd be thrilled.

476
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:36,774
That case isn't buried deep yet.

477
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:39,274
If you stand out in a time like this,

478
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:41,015
you'll get attacked.

479
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,174
Attacked?

480
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:44,714
What did I ever do to get attacked?

481
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:47,585
- Park Jeong Je!
- I hear a voice.

482
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,654
The voice of a woman.

483
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:01,335
There might be a reason
why I should get attacked.

484
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:04,665
No.

485
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,375
No, right?

486
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:10,544
Right?

487
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,844
But why do I keep hearing something?
This is odd.

488
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:23,325
You should see a psychiatrist.

489
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:26,325
- Once you're on some medication...
- I don't want to do that.

490
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,125
It's not that great to live as an idiot.

491
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,024
Jeong Je.

492
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,395
Am I...

493
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:37,564
remembering the old days
after what happened to Min Jung?

494
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:44,344
I don't remember anything in particular anyway.

495
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:47,814
So why did you give an alibi for Dong Sik?

496
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:50,114
Why did you let him out after he got arrested?

497
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:52,114
It would've been better
if the case got closed!

498
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:55,185
Mom, let's not be like that.

499
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,785
What's wrong is wrong.

500
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:01,024
Dong Sik didn't do it.

501
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,895
How...

502
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,265
do you know that?

503
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:13,205
Well...

504
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,504
All right, my son.

505
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:20,075
Dong Sik didn't do that. Okay.

506
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:23,714
You should take a few days off.
Don't be too concerned.

507
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:29,185
Now that I got your permission,
let the break begin.

508
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:36,964
Don't call me.
I'm going to turn my phone off.

509
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:47,274
How did he know?

510
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:49,335
Know what?

511
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:54,274
You know, that Lee Dong Sik isn't the culprit.

512
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,044
How did he find out?

513
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:57,844
And he said he's hearing a woman's voice.

514
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,544
By any chance,

515
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:01,955
is he the culprit?

516
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,725
Lee Chang Jin! You crazy jerk!

517
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:07,455
You startled me. Has she lost it?

518
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,725
You'll lose your voice
if you yell like that.

519
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:11,064
Do you...

520
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,165
want to die?

521
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:16,495
If you say that one more time...

522
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,835
What strong maternal affection you have.

523
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:21,674
It's so overwhelming that it's suffocating me.

524
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,105
All right. All right.

525
00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:28,075
But...

526
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,884
if your precious son could be a liability,

527
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,245
I should think things through.

528
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,984
You have the footage from the dashcam, don't you?

529
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:37,024
What dashcam?

530
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,024
You asked me to delete it. It's all gone.

531
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:46,325
Well, I made a copy as insurance.

532
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,395
- Give it to me.
- It's insurance. Just insurance.

533
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:50,435
Don't you know what it means?

534
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:53,705
I don't care if you keep it as insurance.

535
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:56,105
Just give me a copy so I can use it.

536
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,944
Gosh, this lady is so annoying.

537
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:01,975
- What do you need it for?
- My son...

538
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:04,285
isn't the only one in the video.

539
00:39:06,214 --> 00:39:08,654
Are you planning to edit your son's part out...

540
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:12,055
and use it to close the case?

541
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:15,355
That's reckless. Things could go wrong.

542
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:21,294
Why don't you give Chief Superintendent Han a heads up?

543
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:26,305
Since when was he on our side?

544
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,035
I'll take care of everything.

545
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:35,814
So...

546
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:40,015
give me the copy, Chairman Lee.

547
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:52,694
Delivery complete.

(Nam Sang Bae)

551
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:44,245
Why are you here so early?
It's not even 6am yet.

552
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:46,185
Because I need to talk.

553
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:48,484
What? Talk about what?

554
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:49,855
To who?

555
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:52,685
To me?

556
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:56,754
My goodness. It's chilly in the morning.

557
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,694
Why don't we have some hot tea while we talk?

558
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:02,634
Why did you delete the security footage?

559
00:41:03,605 --> 00:41:06,464
I checked the entry log of the situation room.

560
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,245
Give me your cell phone.

561
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:14,544
- Excuse me?
- Just give it to me.

562
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,754
(Unlock)

563
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,895
I see you're not recording our conversation.

564
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:32,424
What I'm about to tell you is off the record.

565
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:35,694
So it can never be recorded.

566
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:42,174
Lee Dong Sik, that punk,

567
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:45,875
took something from the archives and kept it.

568
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,475
It's a case file from 20 years ago.

569
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:50,685
I knew he took it.

570
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:53,585
But I couldn't tell him to put it back.

571
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:55,884
Because it's his sister's case.

572
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:58,825
But when Min Jung went missing,

573
00:41:58,825 --> 00:42:01,995
I knew someone would look for that case file.

574
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:03,424
So I said to Dong Sik.

575
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:06,094
"You little brat, put it back right now."

576
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:09,665
Well, I told him to give it to Jeong Je...

577
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:13,064
and ask him to put the file back.

578
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:16,774
But he went furious
saying Jeong Je can't be involved.

579
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:20,274
He insisted on putting it back himself so he did.

580
00:42:22,214 --> 00:42:24,814
So you deleted the footage of the hallway and the archives?

581
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:26,114
That's right.

582
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:29,614
The officers who were on duty in the morning that day.

583
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,484
They were my junior colleagues in the old days.

584
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:36,024
I didn't want them to be in trouble for this.

585
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:39,864
So when one guy was dozing off
and the other went to the toilet,

586
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:42,895
I sneaked in and deleted it.

587
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:46,404
Am I supposed to believe that?

588
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:47,835
Inspector Han.

589
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:50,805
Officially speaking,

590
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:54,475
I went there for my hard-working junior officers.

591
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:56,645
I wanted to cheer them up.

592
00:42:56,645 --> 00:42:58,745
That's why I paid a short visit.

593
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,955
I was drunk so I wanted to see them.

594
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:02,555
I even brought snacks.

595
00:43:02,555 --> 00:43:05,654
I didn't touch anything.
We're not supposed to.

596
00:43:05,654 --> 00:43:08,694
Under any circumstances,
no matter who asks me,

597
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,364
this is what I will say.

598
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,495
Officially.

599
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,234
So if I report to my superiors
about the deleted security footage...

600
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:17,765
and the entry log,

601
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:19,765
this would be your official statement, right?

602
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,305
That's right.

603
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:24,645
And that is why...

604
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:27,674
I'm telling you
all the little details of how it happened.

605
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:29,415
Off the record,

606
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:32,085
I'm asking you to let it go this time.

607
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:36,455
I only have about a year left until my retirement.

608
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:40,254
What do you think they'll do?
Take disciplinary action against me?

609
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:42,524
They'll just let it go anyway.

610
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:47,495
So let's not make a big deal out of it.

611
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,605
Now, let's have some hot tea.

612
00:43:53,404 --> 00:43:54,535
Yes.

613
00:43:56,935 --> 00:44:00,205
Dong Sik, why are you here so early?

614
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:02,814
It just happened.

615
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,714
Inspector Han, you're early too.

616
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,855
Well, this is nice.

617
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,754
Both partners are passionate about their job.

618
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:11,585
You're perfect for each other.
It's great.

619
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:13,555
Dong Sik, have some hot tea.
Have a seat.

620
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:14,855
I'll go get ready for work.

621
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,864
Will you? Okay then.
You may leave now.

622
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,935
I heard you kept the case file but put it back.

623
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,504
You pretended you didn't know anything about it.

624
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:30,134
But I found out the truth at last.

625
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,375
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

626
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:36,044
It's just that I love to collect things.

627
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:39,185
Is that so?

628
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:41,285
Shall we have some tea?

629
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:44,924
If I change into the uniform,
I'll have to start working.

630
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:49,895
Gosh, he startled me.

631
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:53,524
Why is he getting more and more violent?

632
00:44:53,935 --> 00:44:57,364
Hey, I think it's because
he's been hanging out with you.

633
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:59,165
- Chief.
- Yes?

634
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:01,734
What's with the tone?

635
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,634
What now?

636
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:08,245
Why did you delete the footage
of the hallway and the archives?

637
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:11,915
That's not what I asked you to do.

638
00:45:12,314 --> 00:45:15,185
Why would you do that and leave a trace?

639
00:45:16,015 --> 00:45:17,085
Leave a trace.

640
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:23,794
Leave a trace...

641
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:28,864
I think you should quit your job.

642
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,364
- Excuse me?
- You are an officer...

643
00:45:31,364 --> 00:45:33,335
but you wish to commit a perfect crime.

644
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:34,935
Is it easy to commit a perfect crime?

645
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:37,504
Then why do criminals get caught?

646
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:40,344
You may think you got rid of all the traces,

647
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,674
but that's only in your head.

648
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:44,384
If you want to erase something completely,

649
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:47,785
you should replace it with something else.

650
00:45:48,654 --> 00:45:52,725
You knew you couldn't cover your traces
in the situation room.

651
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:54,924
So you came up with another reason for being there.

652
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:58,825
This could lead to another problem for you.

653
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,734
It was reckless.

654

- We can talk at the station.

You know that, right?

700
00:49:29,075 --> 00:49:30,234
- Ji Hun.
- You said he's just a witness,

701
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,274
so why are you dragging him away
like he's being arrested?

702
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:35,274
A witness? Let go of him.

703

I guess you haven't seen the articles.

704

He's the last person who saw Kang Min Jung.

On top of that, he even stalked her!

706

- No, that's not true.
- It's okay, Ji Hun.

707
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,384
I wasn't the last person Min Jung saw!

708
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:51,765
Dong Sik, you know it.
I've told you.

709

What? He knew?

710

So I guess you were covering up for everyone.

711

Let go of him!

He's right! You can't take a witness like this!

713

We're only putting it that way,
but he's practically under arrest.

714
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,774
We're not putting handcuffs on him
because he's Ms. Oh's brother.

715
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:08,575
Do you want us to put handcuffs on him?
Let's go, Ji Hun.

and is following them.

- Yes.
- Why not?

736

Because there was someone
who came to pick Min Jung up.

00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,330
You're not evil.

812
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,900
You're not.

813
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,530
Ji Hwa. I didn't know you were here.

814
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,300
I just came by to see.

815
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,040
Jin Mook. Jin Mook...

816
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:45,210
Ji Hun didn't do it! I know he didn't!

817
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,080
There's no way Ji Hun's done that.

818
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,420
He couldn't have done that to Min Jung.

819
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,790
- I know he didn't do it.
- Right?

820
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,690
- You know it right? Right?
- Of course.

821
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,730
- How do you know for sure?
- Dong Sik.

822
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,030
How do you know?

823
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,970
Well...

824
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,740
You know Ji Hun would never do anything like that.

825
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,690
Dong... Dong Sik.

826
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,230
Dong Sik...

827
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,100
probably just said it without...

828
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,400
Ji... Ji Hwa...

829
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,100
I'm so sorry.

830
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,950
What? It's back on?

831
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
What happened?

832
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,850
Min Jung's phone...

833
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,920
Chief Nam told me
that Min Jung's phone might turn on again,

834
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,960
so he told me to make sure to keep an eye on it.

835
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,690
So I asked my classmate
working at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

836
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,500
And the signal just...

837
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,970
Are you saying
Kang Min Jung's phone was turned on?

838
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,130
That's right.

839
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,130
Ask where it is.

840
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:50,000
Well, I have to tell Chief Nam...

841
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,470
Ask where it is!

842
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,640
Okay.

843
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,650
- Ji Hwa, where are you going?
- To get some air.

844
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,140
What's wrong?

845
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,380
What? What is it?

846
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,480
What is it? What happened?

847
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,120
What is it? What happened?

848
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,760
Do Su, Min Jung's phone is on again.

849
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,160
Track its location and send a support team there.

850
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,230
What? It's off?

851
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,000
Why would it be off?

852
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,700
So you got the signal around here, right?

853
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,470
Did she move or not?

854
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,740
- Inspector Hwang.
- Yes?

855
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,040
Hold tight.

856
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,480
(Munju Tourist Hostel)

857
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,920
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

858
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,750
Hold on a second.

859
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,230
What happened?

860
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,540
Dad, please let me out.

861
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:45,850
(Dad, please let me out.)

862
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,020
=Beyond Evil=

863
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,920
Why did you become a police officer?

864
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:25,130
To not be wrongfully blamed,
and to not blame anyone wrongfully.

865
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,030
He remembered something he's forgotten...

866
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,630
on the day Kang Min Jung went missing.

867
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,100
So my crime here is that
I'm the last one to have met Min Jung?

868
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:34,530
That's right.

869
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,200
So what?
Are you going to catch the real culprit now?

870
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,910
Aren't you scared of me?

871
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,580
You're just crazy.

872
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,050
The one who went into that house and got out...

873
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:47,450
was caught on the camera.

874
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,720
Why did you bring back the fingers of Kang Min Jung?

875
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,850
Dong Sik, I'm on my way to find Mom.

876
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,960
They said it's 50m underneath the steppingstone.

877
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,990
Move. Move, you jerk!
