2
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:15,565
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:21,505
Why did you come here?
Are you out of your mind?

4
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,045
No one knows I'm here.
So don't worry.

5
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:28,415
I watched your hearing earlier today.

6
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:30,915
I heard you sent your son
to the General Investigation Unit...

7
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,284
at the Seoul Police Agency.

8
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,985
You don't have to stare at it.

9
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,595
You know I've been faking it.

10
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:41,265
I wanted to go independent
after being stabbed for my boss.

11
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:44,695
So I started pretending to have a limp.

12
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:47,534
But there's something stranger than my leg.

13
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:51,135
You're about to be the next Commissioner General.

14
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,504
But don't have a car in your garage.

15
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,974
It's not your concern.

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,004
Seriously?

17
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:01,445
Was your car wired?

18
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,184
And your son placed it, right?

19
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:05,955
Did your naive son threaten you with it?

20
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:08,855
Is that why you let him join Lee Dong Sik...

21
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,155
at the General Investigation Unit?

22
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:15,965
We walked right into the trap
at the reed field.

23
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:18,965
He recorded our conversation.

24
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:21,634
- What?
- That arrogant brat.

25
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:24,004
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

26
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,545
Pull yourself together, you arrogant dad.

27
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,045
It's not the time for you
to be ashamed of yourself.

28
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,884
You should try to fix the problem.

29
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,745
Do you want me to deal with your son?

30
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:39,985
If you do,
would we get rid of the recording as well?

31
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:41,655
This is better for us.

32
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:44,155
Now we know how much he knows.

33
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,995
We talked about Do Hae Won, didn't we?

34
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:48,664
Did you see her?

35
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:52,164
She was so spiteful and tried to threaten me.

36
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:55,435
Then we should try downsizing.

37
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:56,765
Let's use some bait.

38
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,034
Who?

39
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:59,375
JCM.

Lee Chang Jin.

43
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,495
How dare you challenge me?

44
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:21,995
That punk has no idea.

45
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:30,034
The one with less power should act like one.

46
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,004
He doesn't know his place.

47
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:46,085
How dare you ignore my message?

48
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:49,254
(Messages)

49
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,824
(Good luck with the questioning
and let's meet up and talk at night.)

50
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,724
Little jerk.

51
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,595
You should know your place.

52
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,784
This is perfect.

53
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,204
Inspector Han Ju Won.

54
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:17,714
Did you take him inside the house?

55
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,384
Yes. I helped him with his belongings
and left the house.

56
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:25,985
When was the light turned off?

57
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:28,254
Not long ago. Why?

58
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,625
I'll have a look for a moment.
Is that all right?

59
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,154
- I'll go with you.
- No.

60
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,295
I'll just have a look and come right back.

61
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,545
Superintendent Jung.

62
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,235
Superintendent Jung!

63
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:20,904
Sir!

64
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,584
No, you can't die. Please.

65
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:44,654
Inspector Lee Dong Sik,
this is Jung Cheol Mun.

66
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,694
I have something to say.
Come to my place alone quietly...

67
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:50,125
right now.

68
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,274
Hey. Han Ju Won.

69
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,644
Superintendent Jung Cheol Mun...

70
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,555
has passed away.

71
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:31,675
It...

72
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:34,805
looks like I killed him.

73
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,285
Inspector Lee Dong Sik,
this is Jung Cheol Mun.

74
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:53,394
I have something to say.
Come to my place alone quietly right now.

75
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,194
Are you Lee Dong Sik?

76
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:59,264
- Why would you go instead of me?
- I should apologize.

77
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:01,305
But I don't want to.

78
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,535
- What?
- If you went in,

79
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,144
you would've been framed.

80
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:12,444
Oh, right. So you're saying...

81
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,944
you sacrificed yourself for me.

82
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:20,254
Gosh. You're truly a good friend.

83
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:23,084
I'm sorry if I offended you.

84
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:30,764
Yes, that's right.
That was very offensive.

85
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:37,065
To be frank,
I don't even want to see a glimpse of you.

86
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:42,505
I could see your father overlapping over your face.

87
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:46,675
I'm trying to hold out as much as I can.

88
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,915
I know you did nothing wrong,

89
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:55,224
and I know best when it comes to
getting framed for doing nothing.

90
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,665
So please,

91
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:05,234
stop making a big fuss
and feeling guilty for everything.

92
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:07,535
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,474
Don't you ever do anything else to be sorry for.

94
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,224
What are you doing?

95
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,694
Nothing.

96
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:36,694
Tell me what's going on.
What is it?

97
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:38,295
Ji Hwa.

98
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:43,364
Don't cross over to this side.

99
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,734
"Don't cross over"?

100
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,374
You brought Min Jung's finger...

101
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,145
and put it there, didn't you?

102
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:01,224
Why would Kang Jin Mook leave it
on the bench at his house?

103
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,295
Why do you think I never pointed that out?

104
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,964
- I'm sorry, Ji Hwa.
- You're sorry?

105
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,704
Hey, you.

106
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:21,944
Don't you dare try to avoid this
by saying sorry!

107
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,415
I never tried to stop you.

108
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,584
When I found out Jeong Je hit Yu Yeon,

109
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:31,185
I did everything as you said...

110
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:33,285
because you were her family,

111
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,785
because you were the victim.

112
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,324
But you don't want me to cross over
at this point?

113
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,224
Will you keep doing this?

114
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,094
What did you mean when you said...

115
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:45,834
you would've been framed for everything
if you got caught...

116
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,435
instead of Inspector Han?

117
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,805
What are you hiding from me?

118
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:53,974
Twenty-one years ago,

119
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,444
Han Gi Hwan, that jerk,

120
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,844
hit Yu Yeon with his car.

121
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:05,984
Han Ju Won got a recording
of his father admitting it...

122
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,025
in his own words.

123
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:11,925
Give me the recording.

124
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:13,425
So what if I do?

125
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,765
We can only conduct an internal investigation...

126
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,694
with a recording made without someone's knowledge.

127
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:20,594
Even so, we're police officers.

128
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,665
Police officers?

129
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:26,574
You're right.

130
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,005
I'm an officer...

131
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:32,145
who found a finger at the crime scene,

132
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,775
didn't report it,

133
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:37,315
then tampered with the scene
only to throw it out somewhere else.

134
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,685
Ju Won knew that too.

135
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:44,594
But until I found Yu Yeon,
he kept quiet...

136
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:48,065
No, he's still quiet about it.

137
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:49,964
And so are you.

138
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:52,795
Why did you do that?

139
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:56,104
- Well, that's...
- Because you understand.

140
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:00,074
You know some things just
can't be dealt with by the law.

141
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,305
But still.

142
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:04,944
- We'll have to try.
- We will.

143
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,744
Ju Won and I will do it.

144
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:12,185
Why? He's Han Gi Hwan's son.

145
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:13,885
I could've done this without the recording,

146
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:16,224
but he gave me the file,

147
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:18,824
then told me to expose it to the world
if I wanted to.

148
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:22,594
But he's going to grab his dad
and jump down into a pit of fire...

149
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:24,265
before I do anything of that sort.

150
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,805
He told me not to ruin my life any further,
that he'll do this.

151
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:33,604
He wants to pay for his crimes or something.

152
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,275
After he saw that text I got,

153
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,374
he ran over all by himself
to Superintendent Jung's place.

154
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,555
Ji Hwa,

155
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,555
I can't let that fool...

156
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,425
go alone.

157
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,055
(Father)

158
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:33,765
(Father)

159
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,635
(Father)

160
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:47,614
(Father)

161
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:57,925
You should leave.

162
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:01,364
I don't like having another person at home.

163
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:08,364
If you're like that,
why were you at my place so often?

164
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:11,834
I won't do anything on my own,
so just go.

165
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,104
Now,

166
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,675
are you ready to do some hare coursing,

167
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,444
Inspector Han?

168
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:26,714
The person you have reached is not available.

169
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,385
Please leave a message...

170
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:36,364
So? What was found on the scene?

171
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,864
Right. Chief Nam Sang Bae's phone,

172
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,994
a man who was killed on February 5.

173
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:44,464
And a burner phone
that sent a message to Chief Nam's phone.

174
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:45,704
That's all?

175
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,244
There was also a knife, the murder weapon,

176
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:51,815
but we only found fingerprints
from Superintendent Jung Cheol Mun.

177
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:58,285
However, on the burner phone
used to send the text to Chief Nam,

178
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:01,185
we also found a text message
he sent to Inspector Lee Dong Sik...

179
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:02,984
right before his death.

180
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:07,854
Superintendent Jung asked him
to come to his place alone.

181
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:13,464
I have no idea why Ju Won was there
instead of Inspector Lee...

182
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:14,935
Why did he say he was there?

183
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,464
He refused to answer.

184
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,275
He won't talk?

185
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,545
Why did Superintendent Jung die?

186
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,005
Someone must've killed him,

187
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:25,844
or it could be suicide.

188
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:29,214
Killed him? Who did? Ju Won?

189
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:30,915
Goodness, Ju Won wouldn't.

190
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,515
That means he committed suicide.

191
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,015
He killed Nam Sang Bae,

192
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,255
then the guilt drove him crazy,
so he killed himself.

193
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:39,425
- Sorry?
- His fingerprint was on the knife,

194
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:40,594
so you can close the case.

195
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:43,494
But we should continue the investigation further...

196
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:46,895
Hyeok, when I come up with a story
and throw it at you,

197
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,204
all you have to do is bite, chew, and swallow.

198
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:50,805
Is it that hard to do?

199
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,944
(Unidentified Caller)

200
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:06,315
Who's calling this early?

201
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,854
Why the fingerprints?

202
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,525
Things kept taking a wrong turn,

203
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,425
so I calculated the possibilities.

204
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,354
And the fingerprints?

205
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:17,124
Those were to frame Lee Dong Sik
for staging his murder as a suicide,

206
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,334
but your son took the bait and swallowed it.

207
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:21,364
I'll close the case quietly.

208
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:23,704
You should go off the grid for a while.

209
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:26,574
(Wishing for a quick advancement
in Munju Dream Town project!)

210
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:29,275
I really have to start the redevelopment this time.

211
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:31,415
I went all-in in this round.

212
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:34,214
You can go all-in when a new round begins.

213
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:37,885
You can take some time off.
I'll deal with this case.

214
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,594
Boss.

215
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:50,565
Gosh, darn it.

216
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,864
Are they angry that we messed with their boss,
Jung Cheol Mun?

217
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,135
The officers of Munju Station are ganging up on me.

218
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:59,935
They have no clear evidence,
so keep your mouth shut to get out.

219
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:12,455
Mr. Lee Chang Jin.

220
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:15,785
Let's go.

221
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,225
Call me when you figure out everything.

222
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:31,035
Good morning, Ji Hwa.

223
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:41,584
The farewell at the dock
always comes back to find us

224
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:45,914
Did I hold my tears back to fight the sadness?

225
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:51,124
Are was using the sea before us
as an excuse to part ways?

226
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:55,324
Man is a ship, woman is a harbour

227
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,864
Who were you talking to
when you were arrested?

228
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,094
Ji Hwa.

229
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,805
You used to love it
when I sang you this song.

230
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,374
Do you remember?

231
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:06,874
Please answer the question.

232
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:11,674
The one who says goodbye can't say a word

233
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:16,485
So what can the man say as he leaves?

234
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,055
He couldn't. He can't say anything.

235
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,255
Let me ask you one more time.

236
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,354
What were you doing...

237
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:26,195
between 8:30pm to 11pm on March 7...

238
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:27,354
the day that Jung Cheol Mun died?

239
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:29,265
Why do you keep asking me that?

240
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:33,535
I heard a cop was there.
Han Ju Won, to be more specific.

241
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:34,594
Just answer...

242
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,775
Just answer me, Mr. Lee.

243
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:42,844
Ji Hwa, this is really upsetting.

244
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:45,644
Why do you keep thinking of me
as the bad guy?

245
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:47,745
Do you know why I married you?

246
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:51,285
I'm sure it wasn't love.

247
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,015
Probably because you wanted to run away.

248
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,525
You wanted to run away from this neighbourhood.

249
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,824
So why do you think
I chose you of all people?

250
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:01,995
- Because I was cute?
- Because you were innocent.

251
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:06,934
You had such a raw ambition to build buildings...

252
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,404
and apartments.

253
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,005
And that seemed innocent to me.

254
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:15,174
Do you know why I divorced you?

255
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,705
Because you didn't tell me
about your previous marriage...

256
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,914
or the fact that you had a son? No.

257
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:21,884
I was scared.

258
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,515
I was scared
your raw ambition might eat me alive.

259
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,725
I'm sorry,
but all I wanted was to run away,

260
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:32,894
not get eaten alive
by you and your ambition.

261
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:37,525
- I see.
- So tell me, Chang Jin.

262
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:41,864
Did you kill Jung Cheol Mun?

263
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,805
No, I was home that day.

264
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,404
Do Su, notify him.

265
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:51,975
Lee Chang Jin.

266
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,045
You are under arrest without a warrant...

267
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,384
for being a suspect in Jung Cheol Mun's murder.

268
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:57,684
These guys always arrest people without warrants.

269
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,515
Do your superiors know about this?

270
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:01,755
What superiors?

271
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:03,485
Can't you see that everyone at the station...

272
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,755
are eager to catch the guy
who killed the superintendent?

273
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,455
I understand that you're eager,

274
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:11,565
but you can't just arrest
an innocent person like this.

275
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:12,664
You don't even have any evidence.

276
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:15,535
You can't prove you were home
around the time of the murder,

277
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:17,265
which means you have no alibi.

278
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:18,904
Meanwhile, we noticed you received a text...

279
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,505
from the superintendent
the day before he died.

280
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:25,074
"Hello. It's JCM."

281
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,614
"Let's meet tomorrow."

282
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:28,344
He only sent me this
because we had agreed...

283
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:30,644
to meet at the fishing ground in the afternoon.

284
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:32,255
Exactly.

285
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,955
Well, take a look at
what got caught on camera.

286
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:43,394
We saw you trying to kill him.

287
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:48,094
So what?

288
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,065
You think Mr. Lee killed Superintendent Jung...

289
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:54,074
and think I might be his next target?

290
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:56,005
Or it could be your son.

291
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,144
Son? What son?

292
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,055
Are you saying you don't have a son?

293
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:07,555
Well, if that's the case, okay.

294
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,055
But still,

295
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:14,965
the public knows that Jeong Je is your son.

296
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:20,094
"The future mayoral candidate's son found dead."

297
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,805
I don't know if that will be okay.

298
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,065
Dong Sik.

299
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,035
Stop meddling in other people's lives...

300
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,475
and start living your own life.

301
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:31,305
My life?

302
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:41,684
Ms. Do.

303
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,684
You see,

304
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:48,824
I was sometimes jealous of Jeong Je.

305
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,965
Even though Jeong Je hit my sister with a car,

306
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,305
you took care of all the mess.

307
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:59,404
Then you came to our house and threw a fit.

308
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:06,445
That day, my dad wanted to say this to you.

309
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:09,245
"I will do anything for my son."

310
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,815
But because he couldn't bring himself to say that,

311
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,914
he couldn't even look at me
in the eyes after that.

312
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:17,485
Jeong Je was very scared of you...

313
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:22,195
while I was best friends with my dad.

314
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:26,735
But after that day,
it felt like our lives got switched.

315
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:31,775
Jeong Je killed Yu Yeon,

316
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,245
and that changed everything.

317
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,945
- I feel sorry for you.
- I feel the same way about you...

318
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:42,144
and your son.

319
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:45,215
It might not have been your fault,

320
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:47,785
but you lived the past 21 years in anxiety...

321
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:49,924
and getting robbed.

322
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:55,965
Oh, right.
Someone else had hit Yu Yeon with a car...

323
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:57,795
right before Jeong Je did.

324
00:22:58,124 --> 00:22:59,364
Didn't you know that?

325
00:23:00,594 --> 00:23:04,334
Jeong Je said he hit her
when she was already on the ground.

326
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:09,604
But Yu Yeon got hit standing up.

327
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:13,545
I wonder whom it was...

328
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:17,384
that first hit Yu Yeon with a car.

329
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:22,624
No.

330
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:25,154
Jin Mook...

331
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,495
Yes? What about him?

332
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:29,424
Do you think...

333
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,065
I'll get fooled by you?

334
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:35,404
Go to the Violent Crimes Unit
in Munju Police Station...

335
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:38,164
and ask them for Yu Yeon's autopsy report.

336
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:43,445
I wonder where Jeong Je is right now.

337
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:46,674
If the guy frames everything on him
and kills Jeong Je,

338
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,914
he'll end up becoming the culprit.

339
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:02,894
(Secretary Jang)

340
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:09,265
Secretary Jang, I need you to take Jeong Je...

341
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,805
to a different hospital immediately.

342
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,035
(Sowon Care Hospital)

343
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:22,084
I'm Mr. Park Jeong Je's secretary,
the person who called earlier.

344
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,715
I'm here to pick him up.

345
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:40,765
Mr. Park.

346
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,305
Senior Inspector Park.

347
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,344
"Senior Inspector Park"?

348
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,245
Senior Inspector Park.

349
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:53,644
Do you recognize me?

350
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:55,914
Han Ju Won?

351
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,084
Are you here to save me?

352
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,124
Yes.

353
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:07,225
Let's go.

354
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:19,705
That was close.

355
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:22,445
We came out as fast as we could.

356
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,074
Jae Yi?

357
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:27,144
Mr. Park, are you okay?

358
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:30,114
Yes, I'm totally fine.

359
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:32,055
Good.

360
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,985
Hold on tight.
I'm going to speed.

361
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:18,965
Ms. Yoo, are you sure you have a driver's license?

362
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:21,134
I got it as soon as I turned 20.

363
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:22,834
How many times did you practice
during the past nine years?

364
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,765
Who practices how to drive an ambulance?

365
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,005
I forbid you to drive again.

366
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:27,834
If I'm not allowed to drive,

367
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:31,505
who's going to drive that? You?

368
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:36,144
I do have a Class One driver's license.

369
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,785
But I've never driven an ambulance before.

370
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:41,914
Where are we going now?

371
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:48,995
Ms. Yoo, please drive for me.

372
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,094
Then please take good care...

373
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:52,934
of Mr. Park for me.

374
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:55,535
Why are you asking him
to take good care of him?

375
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:19,995
Mr. Park.

376
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:27,864
You're under arrest
for inciting the concealment...

377
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:29,104
of Lee Yu Yeon's body.

378
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:31,434
But before I do,

379
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,604
just turn yourself in.

380
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:43,914
I'm already 21 years late.

381
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:46,955
Instead of turning myself in,

382
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:53,594
I'd like to get arrested instead.

383
00:27:58,164 --> 00:27:59,535
Inspector Han.

384
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:05,874
Do Hae Won. Park Jeong Je.

385
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:07,975
An arrest warrant?

386
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:10,205
Your father doesn't know about this, does he?

387
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:11,275
Listen.

388
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:13,515
Do Hae Won and your father
worked together 21 years ago...

389
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:15,445
regarding the development carried out
by Oh Il Construction.

390
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,384
So they're really close...

391
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:19,684
You knew about that?

392
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:23,785
Well, let me talk to father first.

393
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,555
Hyeok.

394
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:30,624
You're a prosecutor.
You don't work for the police.

395
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:33,134
Why do you try to be the police's dog?

396
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:36,104
Dog? What nonsense are you talking about?

397
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:37,864
This is a family issue.

398
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:40,475
This is about you, me, and father.
This is about us.

399
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:43,275
Do you think father...
I mean the Commissioner General...

400
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:49,384
really think of you as his family?

401
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,015
Hey, Ju Won.

402
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,555
What do you think?

403
00:28:57,184 --> 00:29:00,225
(Prosecutor Kwon Hyeok)

404
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:03,195
I'm saying this for your sake.

405
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:05,735
Let it go now.

406
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:09,634
The rope you're holding onto is rotten.

407
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:12,805
- What?
- It's so rotten...

408
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,505
it's about to snap.

409
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:18,844
And I'm going to cut the last string.

410
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,275
Ju Won, what are you trying to do?

411
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,414
Hyeok.

412
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:26,285
I know you're a smart man.

413
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:31,084
Will you keep holding onto it
until you fall on the ground...

414
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:33,755
or let it go when you have a chance?

415
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:38,225
Think about what would be the best for you.

416
00:30:03,354 --> 00:30:04,455
What's wrong?

417
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:07,755
Does your recovered leg hurt?

418
00:30:09,195 --> 00:30:10,824
There's our peeper.

419
00:30:10,924 --> 00:30:12,565
And it's not what a cop is expected to do, is it?

420
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:15,805
What is a cop expected to do?

421
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:17,265
To uphold the law.

422
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:20,334
I'm not so smart.
I don't know the laws very well.

423
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:23,674
You're a cop.
You're supposed to know all the laws by heart.

424
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,745
You're one half-hearted cop, aren't you?

425
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:28,614
Which is why I would like you,

426
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:30,884
a hard-working man, to teach me a lesson.

427
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:37,555
You asked them to turn that off,

428
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,995
sneaked in like a rat,

429
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:42,725
and showed Yoon Mi Hye's autopsy report
to Kang Jin Mook...

430
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:46,134
in secret to urge him to commit suicide. Am I right?

431
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:50,465
- You're amazing.
- I did?

432
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:53,174
- Do you have evidence?
- No.

433
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:56,374
Just like when you hit Chief Nam Sang Bae...

434
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,305
to death.

435
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:03,884
Come on. I didn't do that.
It's all a misunderstanding.

436
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:10,124
What is it?
Are you going to hit me with that?

437
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,725
But I'm in here.

438
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,555
Oh, my. How scary that was.

439
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:19,695
You look like you would walk in
and beat me to death any second.

440
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:24,834
You're right.

441
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:27,934
That's my plan.

442
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,445
You killed my sister,

443
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,975
kept her body in a wall for 20 years,

444
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:36,985
and killed Chief Nam.

445
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:38,715
So why not kill you myself?

446
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:41,555
Only then I can call it an act of true revenge.
Am I wrong?

447
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:43,985
Gosh.

448
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:55,265
Kill me.

449
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:03,174
Inspector Lee.

450
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:07,275
What are you doing?

451
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,485
Where's the officer in charge?

452
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:14,755
Sir, this man is trying to kill me.

453
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:17,985
You're saying nonsense.

454
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:21,824
I searched his place,
and I found this weapon.

455
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,195
I just wanted to check if it's his.

456
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,495
Stay out of trouble.

457
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:32,374
The arrest warrant for Do Hae Won has been issued.

458
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,104
(Arrest Warrant, Do Hae Won)

459
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:37,505
I'll go have it executed.

460
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,124
That doesn't scare me.

461
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,924
I'll ask the guard to set you free.

462
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,555
Of course.

463
00:32:56,924 --> 00:32:58,995
Like father, like son.

464
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,065
In the end, the criminal is Do Hae Won...

465
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:02,664
Do Hae Won is arrested...

466
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:05,934
for receiving bribes, destroying evidence, instigation,

467
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,634
obstruction of justice,

468
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:11,045
and violating Improper Solicitation and Graft Act...

469
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:12,745
and Public Service Ethics Act.

470
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:14,015
That's it?

471
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,844
I told you the car accident
that nut's sister had...

472
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:20,555
was related with Kang Jin Mook.

473
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:23,755
We will hear more about that now.

474
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:29,894
I don't get it. I haven't done anything.

475
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:33,565
And It's 21 years ago.

476
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:36,134
We have never prosecuted the case,

477
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:37,834
so even though it's from 21 years ago,

478
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:40,205
if we find anything illegal from the investigation,

479
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,834
we can bring you to justice.

480
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,705
Hasn't your lawyer told you that?

481
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:46,344
I guess he's incapable.

482
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,985
You'd better remain silent.

483
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,384
Are you pleading the fifth now?

484
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:57,154
I'm not sure
if you be patient enough to do that.

485
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,924
Let me check everything one by one,

486
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:02,624
starting with your son's statements.

487
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:07,195
You know we saved your son, right?

488
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,934
You let that crazy punk out in the world.

489
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:11,664
How could you say you saved him?

490
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:13,775
Park Jeong Je is crazy?

491
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:15,744
I guess then that crazy punk killed a person too.

492
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:17,604
- That's...
- Ma'am.

493
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:20,575
Stop pretending to be a cold-hearted mother.

494
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,485
I know you have been hiding your son
in the hospital...

495
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:25,315
in order to protect him.

496
00:34:26,385 --> 00:34:29,425
By the way, have you checked...

497
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,084
Yu Yeon's autopsy report?

498
00:34:34,354 --> 00:34:37,894
Cho Gil Gu, Jung Cheol Mun,
and Lee Chang Jin have been...

499
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:40,795
ripping you off for 21 years.

500
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:43,365
What does it feel like?

501
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:55,845
Thanks for your cooperation.

502
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:59,414
As long as this helps with our investigation,
I'm happy to help.

503
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:03,925
Ji Hwa does like good-looking men.

504
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:06,224
I'm better looking though.

505
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:09,624
This investigation is about Jung Cheol Mun's corruption,

506
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,965
so Inspector Han is going to interrogate you.

507
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,664
You arrested me for killing a person,

508
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:16,304
and now you're saying this is about the corruption...

509
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:17,905
because you don't have evidence.

510
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:21,804
You refused to appoint a lawyer.
Is that correct?

511
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:26,514
I'm completely innocent,
so ask me anything.

512
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:28,744
I don't know if I would give you my answers though.

513
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:32,284
You arrested me without a warrant
and it's been almost 48 hours now.

514
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,584
It's okay.

515
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:39,525
We will start once the arrest warrant is issued.

516
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:41,425
The arrest warrant?

517
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:44,295
There's no reason for the arrest warrant to be issued.

518
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:48,334
We will see about that.

519
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:50,505
"October 15, 2000, late night,"

520
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:53,534
"I used my burner phone
where its number ends with 1234..."

521
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,434
"to call my mother, Do Hae Won's burner phone..."

522
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:58,244
"where its number ends with 3324 to ask for help."

523
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:01,315
Here. There's a record of 3324 being connected...

524
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:03,744
with 1234 for a while.

525
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:08,215
And the phone number written next to your name
ends with 3324.

526
00:36:08,454 --> 00:36:09,825
It's the same number.

527
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:14,025
You activated the 3324 phone recently
and used it again.

528
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:17,365
Last night, Cho Gil Gu came to the office...

529
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:19,095
and admitted to it all.

530
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:21,735
Yes, it's true.

531
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:25,834
I gave her the report...

532
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,704
in exchange for money.

533
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:30,604
As Superintendent Jung Cheol Mun has ordered,

534
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:32,845
the report about the guitar pick...

535
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:34,775
found at the crime scene
where Bang Ju Seon's body was abandoned...

536
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,684
was handed to you.

537
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:39,914
You made a fake report
that said nothing was found from the pick...

538
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:44,184
and gave it to the prosecutor in charge
at the moment, Nam Sang Bae.

539
00:36:44,425 --> 00:36:47,155
After Kang Jin Mook was arrested,

540
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:50,365
Chief Nam wondered why his guitar pick was there...

541
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:53,764
and visited Kang Jin Mook in jail.

542
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,365
Then he started to wonder
why Kang Jin Mook had to die...

543
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:01,104
and what caused all this 21 years ago.

544
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:06,244
He started to look through the case reports.

545
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:08,945
Then he found the truth.

546
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:14,954
Is this why you killed Chief Nam?

547
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:19,624
Just because you switched one report,

548
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:20,854
you have been pestered...

549
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:24,195
by Cho Gil Gu and Jung Cheol Mun.

550
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:28,034
Why? What did they find on the guitar pick?

551
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,834
Why was that guitar pick...

552
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,704
found at the scene
where Bang Ju Seon's body was abandoned,

553
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:36,974
not at the scene of the car accident...

554
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:40,615
where Park Jeong Je hit Yu Yeon?

555
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:43,485
I asked this question...

556
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:46,715
to Park Jeong Je last night.

557
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:51,354
Dong Sik asked me that too.

558
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:54,025
I have no idea what was found there...

559
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:57,465
and why it was there.

560
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:01,595
I really don't.

561
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:04,804
I asked my mother too,

562
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:08,604
but she would deny everything.

563
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,845
She said that never happened.

564
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:15,715
She said nothing ever happened.

565
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:18,985
He said that you said that never happened.

566
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:21,514
Nothing ever happened.

567
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:24,925
Was it...

568
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:30,664
a secret which was so valuable...

569
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,795
that someone had to take to the grave?

570
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,865
Ma'am, why was the guitar pick...

571
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:39,135
at the scene?

572
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:44,374
Kang Jin Mook told you why, didn't he?

573
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:50,177
Why was the guitar pick at the scene?

574
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:55,447
Kang Jin Mook told you why, didn't he?

575
00:38:57,317 --> 00:39:00,456
Wait. What did you say you want?

576
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:05,226
The key to the deer farm.

577
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:10,097
I know you sold it to Jin Li Construction.

578
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:14,637
But you're still managing the place.

579
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:20,536
Why would I give you the key?

580
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:24,447
The guitar pick.

581
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:26,916
What?

582
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:32,516
Jeong Je hit Yu Yeon with his car.

583
00:39:37,257 --> 00:39:39,157
That's how she died.

584
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:49,536
And at the scene,

585
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,706
he dropped a guitar pick.

586
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:59,347
So I took it...

587
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:02,077
and put it next to Bang Ju Seon at the reed field.

588
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,847
I wanted them to think Jeong Je killed Ju Seon too.

589
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,217
But they arrested that poor kid, Dong Sik.

590
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,927
You took care of it, didn't you?

591
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:18,567
Jin... Jin Mook.

592
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,036
- You're not...
- Why are you stuttering?

593
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:30,806
Put your cellphone down.

594
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,277
Or I'll just go to the police station...

595
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:37,686
and tell them
I saw Jeong Je hitting Yu Yeon with his car.

596
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,356
What? No.

597
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:46,396
Do you think people would believe you?

598
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:49,396
Yes.

599
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:50,867
Because...

600
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:54,967
if you stutter a little,

601
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:57,606
people believe you.

602
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:02,237
They think I’m naive, innocent,

603
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:05,476
and dumb.

604
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:08,916
Should I report Jeong Je to see
if it's true?

605
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,586
Give me the key.

606
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:15,956
What will you...

607
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:19,427
do with it?

608
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:21,697
For your son's sake,

609
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,226
it's better not to know, right?

610
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,237
Since then,

611
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:34,306
have you been...

612
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:38,646
killing people?

613
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:42,987
What you did 20 years ago.

614
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:45,387
(Gyeonggi Councilwoman Do Hae Won)

615
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:49,626
That wasn't the only time, was it?

616
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:55,056
What have you been doing
with the key to the deer farm?

617
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:57,967
Did you...

618
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,706
really kill your own daughter?

619
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,706
She deceived me.

620
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,407
She didn't listen to me.

621
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:11,907
And she kept saying odd things.

622
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:13,217
What?

623
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:22,456
She spoke ill of her own mother.

624
00:42:22,657 --> 00:42:24,286
How dare she try to leave me?

625
00:42:24,286 --> 00:42:28,197
Stop it. I don't want to hear it.

626
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,867
Tomorrow's the event
for the redevelopment project, right?

627
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:34,496
I want to be there.

628
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,067
I'm about to lose everything because of you.

629
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,436
How dare you come?

630
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:40,137
Yes, I'm doing it because I'm sorry.

631
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:43,907
I want to support the project.

632
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:46,246
Hey.

633
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:49,077
I'll play my part as the victim's father.

634
00:42:50,447 --> 00:42:51,586
So...

635
00:42:54,987 --> 00:42:56,257
you play your part.

636
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:01,027
Just like you did...

637
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,027
until now.

638
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:13,536
Your imagination is too much.

639
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:15,936
It's too dramatic.

640
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:17,007
Really?

641
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:24,086
But your son didn't think so.

642
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:26,487
Did...

643
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:30,657
my mother...

644
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,626
Did my mother...

645
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:45,666
ignore it for 20 years...

646
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:52,876
when all those people were dying?

647
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:57,746
Because of me.

648
00:44:01,317 --> 00:44:04,686
All because of me.

649
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:07,996
What's the secret?

650
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:10,396
There's no secret, Son.

651
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:12,597
Because of me.

652
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:15,697
Why do you think I did that?

653
00:44:16,507 --> 00:44:18,106
Who do you think...

654
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:20,706
made me struggle for the last 20 years...

655
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:22,577
trying to hide what happened?

656
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:27,347
Park Jeong Je! Jeong Je!
Get it together!

657
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,887
Aren't you going to go in?

658
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:37,527
Jeong Je has to handle it on his own now.

659
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,396
But do you think he can handle it?

660
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:47,436
Do you think he can?

661
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:54,777
Jeong Je...

662
00:44:55,836 --> 00:44:58,146
wanted me to ask you something.

663
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:04,186
Dong Sik.

664
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,657
Dong Sik, I'm sorry.

665
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:10,427
I'm really sorry.

666
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:14,927
I'm sorry but would you do me a favour?

667
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,137
Ask her to tell me the truth this time.

668
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,777
Chief Nam and Kang Jin Mook.

669
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:32,847
Ask her if she killed them because of me.

670
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:38,387
Could you ask her that for me?

671
00:45:43,956 --> 00:45:45,527
If that's true...

672
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:52,027
He said if that's true,

673
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:54,967
he would slice his own throat.

674
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:04,976
I didn't.

675
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,387
No.

676
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:13,856
I didn't do it.

677
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:18,686
Well, I just...

678
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:22,496
showed him Chief Nam's text message.

679
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:24,527
I showed it to Lee Chang Jin.

680
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:28,166
But I had nothing to do with Kang Jin Mook's death.

681
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:31,467
- It wasn't me.
- Then who did it?

682
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:34,206
You heard it too.

683
00:46:34,976 --> 00:46:36,876
That day at the reed field.

684
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,916
Those two did it.

685
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:45,746
So tell me.

686
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:50,586
Who are those two?

687
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:53,856
Tell me their names.

688
00:46:55,797 --> 00:46:57,067
Lee Chang Jin.

689
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:02,266
Han Gi Hwan.

690
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:07,936
Yes, Inspector Lee.

691
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:13,746
How did Do Hae Won's interrogation go?

692
00:47:16,547 --> 00:47:17,617
Their names?

693
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:21,586
You got a name?

694
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:25,786
Great work.

695
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,496
- Request a warrant right away.
- Yes, ma'am.

696
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,306
I'll make a request for an arrest warrant.

697
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:41,376
Darn it. Now I'm stuck with you
for 10 more days, Mr. Lee.

698
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:47,047
Do you actually believe
the warrant will be approved?

699
00:47:47,317 --> 00:47:48,976
Do you really think you'll get it?

700
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:55,617
We have a good reason
to believe the suspect committed a crime,

701
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:57,257
and there's a good chance...

702
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,086
he'll destroy the evidence and run away.

703
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:01,827
Of course, you should be detained,
don't you think?

704
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:05,666
It seems like the warrant VCU Two requested...

705
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,166
will be approved.

- Hey, Hyeok.
- Hello.

709
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,186
I had many cases to look into,

710
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:35,697
so I had to call you back a little late,
Commissioner General.

711
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:39,327
"Commissioner General"?
Then come over for a moment now.

712
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:42,637
I don't think I can do that.

713
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,467
I just approved the arrest warrant
for Ms. Do Hae Won.

714
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,036
And Ms. Do Hae Won...

715
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:51,746
happens to be involved very intimately with you.

716
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:55,547
It could be a problem in the future
if I made a visit right now.

717
00:48:55,717 --> 00:48:56,887
All right.

718
00:48:58,646 --> 00:49:01,117
I also attached another warrant.

719
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:03,317
The suspect's name is...

720
00:49:04,186 --> 00:49:07,356
Lee Chang Jin.

721
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:10,827
We couldn't investigate him without detention.

722
00:49:11,896 --> 00:49:15,467
Actually, you'll be furious
when you hear this.

723
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:20,507
He dared to barge into the jail
at the police station,

724
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:22,436
then abetted the suicide...

725
00:49:22,436 --> 00:49:24,976
of Kang Jin Mook, a suspect of serial murder,

726
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:26,677
that idiot.

727
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:31,516
It looks like
this man also murdered Chief Nam Sang Bae.

728
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:33,817
Is there evidence?

729
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:37,126
Of course, there is.
That's why they requested a warrant.

730
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:40,097
Someone heard him make the confession or something.

731
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:43,197
I wasn't supposed to tell you that now.

732
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:47,097
This is...

733
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:51,666
This is as far as I'll go.

734

This is as far as you'll go?

735
00:49:58,177 --> 00:49:59,476
Do you think you'll be fine?

736
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:01,617
Why shouldn't I be fine?

Are you two an item?

You aren't questioning me,
so you aren't recording this, right?

whose side he should take isn't me.

773

You should be careful.

Mr. Lee.

781

Do you know why my father...

782
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:52,786
appointed Mr. Lee Dong Sik
to the General Investigation Unit...

783
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,317
at the Seoul Agency?

784
00:52:54,956 --> 00:52:58,257
To be frank, I still have no idea.

785
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:02,757
Well, I'm guessing
he wanted to keep his enemy close.

786
00:53:03,257 --> 00:53:04,467
No?

787
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:10,336
So my father thinks of Lee Dong Sik
as his enemy?

788
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:12,336
That's why he appointed him there...

789
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,677
and kept him around to this day?

790
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:25,387
That's funny.

791
00:53:26,347 --> 00:53:28,856
I thought you knew him for over 20 years.

792
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:31,527
You still have no idea what he's like, do you?

793
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:34,027
He's a guy who can easily betray his son.

794
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:35,396
Don't you remember?

795
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:39,126
"If your son is the mistake,"

796
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:41,137
"then your son could also..."

797
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:45,336
And this is what my father said.

798
00:53:46,137 --> 00:53:50,106
"If you want to find out,
you can just keep an eye on him."

799
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:52,106
And I did.

800
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:55,177
But his son is still sitting here in front of me.

801
00:53:55,617 --> 00:53:56,876
Right.

802
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:01,556
But I'm his blood. Or it might be...

803
00:54:02,757 --> 00:54:04,856
the voice recording that kept me alive.

804
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:07,556
I don't know what the reason is,

805
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:10,697
but he continues to keep Lee Dong Sik around him.

806
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:12,396
However,

807
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:15,896
someone will have to
take the blame for everything and die.

808
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:19,067

809
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:20,737
I drove?

810
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:22,777
In the twilight of October 15, 2000,

811
00:54:22,777 --> 00:54:24,777
you drove in my father's place.

812
00:54:26,447 --> 00:54:28,577
Ever since that day 20 years ago,

813
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:32,786
my father refused to see you for quite a while.

814
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:36,757
He let you take the wheel,
but you hit a person, a woman.

815
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:41,427
Did my dad get furious after you hit that woman?

816
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:43,657
Right, on top of that,

817
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:47,097
I remember him saying Lee Chang Jin is...

818
00:54:47,097 --> 00:54:50,367
a vulgar man whom he should never associate with.

819
00:54:52,137 --> 00:54:54,277
So you're going to come between us?

820
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:56,007
Come between you two?

821
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,806
You can hear him say it, then.

822
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:03,447
Right, this is illegal,
so forget it after you listen to it.

823
00:55:05,617 --> 00:55:06,746
What is it?

824
00:55:07,456 --> 00:55:08,617
It's...

825
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,186
Man, I have no idea either.

826
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:16,027
That's for you, Chief Superintendent...

827
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,797
I mean, Commissioner General, to find out.

828
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:21,896
Goodness.

829
00:55:25,637 --> 00:55:28,206
They all deserve to die.

830
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:31,047
Do you want to listen to it again?

831
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:36,777
They all deserve to die.

832
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:46,056
We got the warrant.

833
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,197
Do Su is bringing it from the court right now.

834
00:55:48,197 --> 00:55:49,297
What?

835
00:55:49,297 --> 00:55:51,697
For the next 10 days,
you'll have to stay in the holding cell...

836
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:53,496
where Kang Jin Mook died.

837
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:57,266
Sounds great.
I'll get to stay near you.

838
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,637
Shut your mouth.

839
00:55:58,637 --> 00:56:00,407
Do you want to go there
until the warrant gets here?

840
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:01,606
Senior Inspector Han Sang Wook...

841
00:56:01,606 --> 00:56:03,677
of the General Investigation Unit
at the Seoul Agency just called,

842
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,347
but I didn't pick up.
He has connections to my father.

843
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:09,117
He called me too.

844
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:14,016
He told me not to let him off easy
and to deal with him by the law.

845
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:18,356
Your father did a great job in losing his tail.

846
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:23,496
He has done that with me before.

847
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,766
The one who needs to figure out
whose side he should take isn't me.

848
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:33,407
It's more important for you, Mr. Lee.

849
00:56:34,206 --> 00:56:36,706
They all deserve to die.

850
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,646
Your father did a great job in losing his tail.

851
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:46,894
The one who needs to figure out
whose side he should take isn't me.

852
00:56:46,894 --> 00:56:49,523
It's more important for you, Mr. Lee.

853
00:56:50,124 --> 00:56:52,633
They all deserve to die.

854
00:56:53,364 --> 00:56:55,534
Your father did a great job in losing his tail.

855
00:56:57,633 --> 00:57:00,034
Here we go again.

856
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:09,543
The employee isn't picking up,
so I'm going to go check in person.

857
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:10,753
Please wait here quietly.

858
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:26,934
Mr. Lee,

859
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:30,934
I don't think you'll live long either.

860
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:33,704
What?

861
00:57:44,313 --> 00:57:45,753
Once everything gets revealed,

862
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:52,793
Dong Sik will kill you.

863
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:01,833
Dong Sik will kill you.

864
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:03,804
He will kill you.

865
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:07,943
You killed my sister,

866
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:09,874
kept her body in a wall for 20 years,

867
00:58:09,943 --> 00:58:11,614
and killed Chief Nam.

868
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:13,543
So why not kill you myself?

869
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:16,883
Only then I can call it an act of true revenge.
Am I wrong?

870
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:21,284
Han Gi Hwan.

871
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:25,094
It wasn't me, it was Han Gi Hwan.

872
00:58:26,624 --> 00:58:27,864
I swear.

873
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,954
I did delay the warrant process,

874
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:55,023
but I hear he's confessing to the Violent Crimes Unit.

875
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:56,653
What is he confessing?

876
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:57,853
I'm not sure yet.

877
00:58:58,853 --> 00:59:00,293
Just a minute.

878
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:02,793
What did you say?

879
00:59:03,394 --> 00:59:04,494
Right now?

880
00:59:04,963 --> 00:59:06,793
Commissioner General, I'll be hanging up now.

881
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:17,374
(Commissioner General Han Gi Hwan
in a hit-and-run)

882
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:21,244
(Caused a hit-and-run,
killing a Munju female college student)

883
00:59:21,244 --> 00:59:22,583
(Abused power at Munju Station
to cover up the incident)

884
00:59:26,014 --> 00:59:28,324
We have exclusive coverage of this breaking news.

885
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,353
This is the voice of Commissioner General Han.

886
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:32,054
Did he see me?

887
00:59:32,054 --> 00:59:33,324
On that day?

888
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,864
Getting into that accident,

889
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,664
hitting Lee Yu Yeon...

890
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:39,563
on that day?

891
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,463
You haven't responded yet.

892
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:46,304
What do you mean, kill?

893
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:50,003
It was a mistake. A minor mistake.

894
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:52,914
This voice recording was evidence
provided by Mr. Han's son,

895
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:55,244
Inspector Han Ju Won.

896
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:58,883
Inspector Han asked us
to reveal the informer's identity.

897
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:27,114
Father.

898
01:00:27,614 --> 01:00:28,713
Han Ju Won.

899
01:00:28,784 --> 01:00:30,684
Why are you holding an illegal weapon?

900
01:00:31,184 --> 01:00:32,483
What are you planning to do with it?

901
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:34,624
Commit suicide?

902
01:00:36,023 --> 01:00:38,693
When we got news of my mother's suicide,

903
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:40,224
this is what you said.

904
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:44,364
"It's the worst form of escape
that a weak person can resort to."

905
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:45,394
But now,

906
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,003
you're planning the same thing?

907
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:52,333
My son.

908
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:54,304
Why did you cause all this?

909
01:00:54,304 --> 01:00:56,603
This will ruin your life as well as mine.
So why?

910
01:00:56,603 --> 01:00:58,644
Because that was my aim.

911
01:01:00,773 --> 01:01:03,344
I wanted to fall from grace,
together with you.

912
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:07,353
Now...

913
01:01:09,923 --> 01:01:11,094
you can be happy.

914
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:15,193
You're the Commissioner General at last.

915
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:17,463
It's what you've always wanted.

916
01:01:18,193 --> 01:01:19,833
Don't come close. Stand there.

917
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:23,603
What if I don't? Will you shoot me?

918
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:26,874
- Shoot me.
- You think I won't?

919
01:01:39,483 --> 01:01:41,724
It must be a while since you shot a gun.

920
01:01:41,983 --> 01:01:43,054
You should be careful.

921
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:52,494
Get out of the way, Ju Won.

922
01:01:53,034 --> 01:01:54,264
You can get out of the way, Ju Won.

923
01:01:55,063 --> 01:01:56,204
Give it to me.

924
01:01:57,574 --> 01:01:58,673
I'm asking you...

925
01:02:00,403 --> 01:02:01,773
to give me the gun.

926
01:02:17,624 --> 01:02:19,293
That's right, you're my son after all.

927
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:30,264
The blank has been fired.
It's now for real.

928
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,503
Father.

929
01:02:35,673 --> 01:02:37,304
If you wish to kill someone,

930
01:02:39,574 --> 01:02:40,914
you should aim for the heart,

931
01:02:41,744 --> 01:02:44,043
or the head.

932
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:48,023
But I have no intention of killing you.

933
01:02:50,054 --> 01:02:52,224
I'm going to make sure
you stay alive and are punished.

934
01:02:56,224 --> 01:02:58,364
I'll aim for your leg,

935
01:02:58,894 --> 01:03:00,764
no maybe the arm with the gun.

936
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,463
- Ju Won.
- No.

937
01:03:03,204 --> 01:03:04,374
I'll be the one to do it.

938
01:03:05,974 --> 01:03:07,204
Inspector Lee,

939
01:03:08,173 --> 01:03:10,344
you can arrest the man
who killed your sister.

940
01:03:10,943 --> 01:03:13,114
Ju Won, put down the gun.

941
01:03:13,114 --> 01:03:14,173
I...

942
01:03:14,914 --> 01:03:16,583
will really shoot you, Father.

943
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:31,793
Don't come near me.

944
01:03:31,793 --> 01:03:32,833
Shoot.

945
01:03:35,364 --> 01:03:36,503
Shoot me.

946
01:03:55,954 --> 01:03:57,353
Han Gi Hwan,

947
01:03:59,224 --> 01:04:00,753
You are under arrest for the murder of Lee Yu Yeon,

948
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:02,693
for being derelict in your duties,

949
01:04:03,963 --> 01:04:05,434
moving a body unlawfully,

950
01:04:06,193 --> 01:04:08,003
and failure to cooperate...

951
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:10,133
with police investigations.

952
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:14,773
Also on suspicion of Kang Jin Mook
and Nam Sang Bae's deaths.

953
01:04:15,003 --> 01:04:16,273
That wasn't me.

954
01:04:16,704 --> 01:04:18,813
Kang Jin Mook committed suicide,

955
01:04:19,244 --> 01:04:22,914
and I wasn't involved in Nam Sang Bae's death.

956
01:04:23,344 --> 01:04:25,153
That was likely Councilwoman Do.

957
01:04:31,353 --> 01:04:32,353
Is that so?

958
01:04:39,094 --> 01:04:40,264
I will shoot.

959
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:43,133
Han Ju Won!

960
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:17,934
Please cover my face for me.

961
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,434
Cover him.

962
01:06:07,784 --> 01:06:09,483
I'll quit the force,

963
01:06:10,684 --> 01:06:12,193
and accept my punishment.

964
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,933
I sincerely apologize...

965
01:06:24,473 --> 01:06:26,634
for the death of your sister.

966
01:06:35,983 --> 01:06:37,284
No.

967
01:06:40,053 --> 01:06:41,983
Why would you do that
when you did nothing wrong?

968
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:45,193
Do you want to get punished?

969
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:48,164
You can get disciplined
for having abused your authority...

970
01:06:48,164 --> 01:06:49,624
regarding the case on Lee Geum Hwa's death.

971
01:06:50,393 --> 01:06:52,063
Then spend the rest of your life...

972
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:55,964
working as a detective.

973
01:07:01,544 --> 01:07:04,044
No, I can't do that.

974
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:06,843
That should be your way to apologize.

975
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,384
The guilty should be the ones
who get punished.

976
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:18,853
So...

977
01:07:21,723 --> 01:07:25,593
I'd like you to arrest me
for abandoning Kang Min Jung's body,

978
01:07:26,464 --> 01:07:28,634
contaminating the crime scene,

979
01:07:28,903 --> 01:07:32,034
and obstructing the case investigation.

980
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:35,143
What...

981
01:07:37,843 --> 01:07:40,143
I... I can't...

982
01:07:42,544 --> 01:07:45,983
I can't do that.
I have no right to do that.

983
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:51,353
If you don't arrest me,

984
01:07:52,624 --> 01:07:54,153
I won't ever turn myself in.

985
01:08:04,263 --> 01:08:07,334
Please arrest me now.

986
01:08:22,084 --> 01:08:23,784
Lee Dong Sik.

987
01:08:24,424 --> 01:08:26,593
You're under arrest
for abandoning Kang Min Jung's body...

988
01:08:27,223 --> 01:08:28,494
and...

989
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,294
for the obstruction...

990
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,674
of justice.

991
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:04,093
Ju Won.

992
01:09:46,803 --> 01:09:48,473
You have the right...

993
01:09:51,513 --> 01:09:53,744
to remain silent.

994
01:09:57,614 --> 01:10:00,284
You have the right to talk to a lawyer...

995
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:03,183
and the right to explain your situation.

996
01:10:08,794 --> 01:10:10,994
And you may request the court...

997
01:10:14,864 --> 01:10:17,403
to review the legality of your arrest.

998
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,643
Commissioner General Han was arrested
last night at around 10pm.

999
01:10:59,643 --> 01:11:02,513
The female university student
that went missing 21 years ago...

1000
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:04,513
was apparently killed by Commissioner General Han...

1001
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:06,414
He'll be sentenced to at least 20 years
or life imprisonment...

1002
01:11:06,414 --> 01:11:09,454
Lee's first trial will be held today
at Munju District Court.

1003
01:11:09,454 --> 01:11:11,693
He received life imprisonment
for murder and many other crimes.

1004
01:11:11,693 --> 01:11:15,063
Do Hae Won, the councilwoman
of Munju and mayoral candidate...

1005
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:17,263
was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment...

1006
01:11:17,263 --> 01:11:19,834
at today's first trial.
However, she appealed...

1007
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:22,534
Senior Inspector Park, Councilwoman Do's son,

1008
01:11:22,534 --> 01:11:25,074
got sentenced to three years of imprisonment
at his first trial...

1009
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:26,233
and did not choose to appeal to a higher court.

1010
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:28,704
The officer
who moved the dead university student's finger...

1011
01:11:28,704 --> 01:11:31,973
got sentenced to 1 year in prison
and 2 years of probation.

1012
01:11:31,973 --> 01:11:35,013
It was only to find out the truth
behind the incident...

1013
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:38,884
Inspector Han,
the former commissioner general's son,

1014
01:11:38,884 --> 01:11:41,183
got acquitted even though he had abused his authority,

1015
01:11:41,183 --> 01:11:43,384
considering that he couldn't predict the victim's death...

1016
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:45,023
and because it ended up helping the investigation...

1017
01:11:45,023 --> 01:11:47,393
and eventually led to the serial killer's arrest.

1018
01:11:49,994 --> 01:11:53,964
(February 5, 2022)

1019
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:56,034
(RIP Lee Su Yeon)

1020
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,773
You know today's the anniversary
of Chief Nam's death, right?

1021
01:12:04,773 --> 01:12:06,544
I'll see you at Manyang Butcher Shop.

1022
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:11,714
I'll visit you again,

1023
01:12:14,214 --> 01:12:15,454
Mom.

1024
01:12:17,424 --> 01:12:21,964
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

1025
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,634
Manyang Substation?

1026
01:12:32,204 --> 01:12:34,303
It really is you, Han Ju Won.

1027
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,303
But you don't work at Manyang Substation anymore.

1028
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:41,074
I heard you work
in the Women and Juvenile Affairs Division...

1029
01:12:41,074 --> 01:12:42,643
at a police station somewhere in Gangwon Province.

1030
01:12:42,643 --> 01:12:45,214
Long time no see, Ms. Yoo.

1031
01:12:48,723 --> 01:12:51,153
Do you still go around throwing eggs?

1032
01:12:52,523 --> 01:12:54,853
I bought them because we were out of eggs,
but this is a lot.

1033
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:57,523
What do you say?
Do you want me to throw some at you?

1034
01:12:58,494 --> 01:12:59,864
I'm good.

1035
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:02,534
Come on inside.

1036
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:07,834
What are you doing?

1037
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:11,044
Mr. Lee.

1038
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:14,744
What took you so long?
Everyone's here.

1039
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:24,384
Hey, Inspector Han.

1040
01:13:25,794 --> 01:13:29,193
We haven't met ever since that day.

1041
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:38,903
Why aren't you coming inside?

1042
01:13:41,603 --> 01:13:43,544
Inspector Han.

1043
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:46,174
Why didn't you reply to my text?

1044
01:13:47,273 --> 01:13:50,584
My father's still going through with this appeal.

1045
01:13:50,584 --> 01:13:52,813
What does that have anything to do with you?

1046
01:13:57,723 --> 01:13:58,824
Shall we go inside?

1047
01:13:58,824 --> 01:14:01,193
My goodness gracious.

1048
01:14:01,193 --> 01:14:04,794
It's been so long.
It's been ages.

1049
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:08,763
- My gosh.
- Long time no see.

1050
01:14:08,763 --> 01:14:10,134
Hello.

1051
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:12,574
I called you three times,
but you never picked up.

1052
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,733
- Why did you call him three times?
- You're still handsome.

1053
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:15,744
It's so annoying.

1054
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:17,273
Let's see.

1055
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:20,143
I came all the way from Seoul.
I'm starving.

1056
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,544
- It looks delicious.
- Here.

1057
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:26,954
Gosh, let me try some. It looks amazing.

1058
01:14:28,723 --> 01:14:30,584
Gosh, it's really delicious.

1059
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:32,393
- Really?
- Inspector Hwang.

1060
01:14:32,393 --> 01:14:34,893
You haven't changed at all
even though you work in Seoul now.

1061
01:14:34,893 --> 01:14:38,063
I'm not an inspector anymore.
I'm a senior inspector.

1062
01:14:39,193 --> 01:14:42,303
All your friends from KNPU got promoted,

1063
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,634
but you're still an inspector.
I feel so bad for you.

1064
01:14:45,634 --> 01:14:46,773
I'm okay.

1065
01:14:48,273 --> 01:14:50,174
Let me ask you something
while we're on that subject.

1066
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,714
Are you going to
ask Senior Inspector Park to come back...

1067
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:54,074
once he gets released?

1068
01:14:55,683 --> 01:14:57,884
- What's your problem?
- What?

1069
01:14:58,084 --> 01:15:01,114
Ji Hun, give Inspector Han some stew.

1070
01:15:01,114 --> 01:15:03,023
Sure. Give me your bowl.

1071
01:15:03,023 --> 01:15:04,784
Inspector Han doesn't like
sharing bowls and utensils.

1072
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:06,994
Jae Yi, where are the new bowls?

1073
01:15:06,994 --> 01:15:09,523
- I bought some new ones earlier.
- It's okay.

1074
01:15:10,624 --> 01:15:12,933
- Here you go.
- Okay.

1075
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:20,074
- Enjoy your food, everyone.
- Enjoy your food.

1076
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:21,903
- Thank you for the food.
- It's delicious.

1077
01:15:24,504 --> 01:15:26,843
I guess you don't hate sausage stew.

1078
01:15:27,674 --> 01:15:28,884
I like it.

1079
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:31,714
Eat up.

1080
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:43,763
I heard you're busy going to mountains, hills,

1081
01:15:43,763 --> 01:15:45,334
rice paddies, and farms these days.

1082
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:49,504
It must be exhausting to go around
looking for elders with dementia...

1083
01:15:49,563 --> 01:15:52,433
and the disabled after they run away from home.

1084
01:15:54,334 --> 01:15:56,074
No, it's not exhausting at all.

1085
01:15:57,943 --> 01:15:59,643
Someone needs to find them.

1086
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:04,483
I'm just glad that there's something I can do.

1087
01:16:06,954 --> 01:16:08,214
Good.

1088
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:11,254
I'm relieved to hear that.

1089
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:19,534
Hello?

1090
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:21,464
Mount Taeak?

1091
01:16:22,263 --> 01:16:23,634
I'll leave right away.

1092
01:16:25,504 --> 01:16:26,504
I need to...

1093
01:16:27,034 --> 01:16:28,204
You should go.

1094
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:30,103
Please send my farewells.

1095
01:16:37,483 --> 01:16:38,553
Ju Won.

1096
01:16:44,483 --> 01:16:45,893
Make sure you eat well...

1097
01:16:48,023 --> 01:16:49,364
and sleep well.

1098
01:16:51,364 --> 01:16:52,364
And pooping.

1099
01:16:53,593 --> 01:16:54,763
Make sure that goes well too.

1100
01:17:02,343 --> 01:17:03,443
I told you...

1101
01:17:04,403 --> 01:17:06,914
not to speak casually with me,
Mr. Lee Dong Sik.

1102
01:17:09,114 --> 01:17:11,683
Keep up the good work, Inspector Han Ju Won.

1103
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:40,773

1105
01:18:09,174 --> 01:18:12,943
In Korea, adults who go missing
without any contacts are...

1106
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,044
treated as simple runaway cases.

1107
01:18:15,643 --> 01:18:16,744
Please help them...

1108
01:18:16,744 --> 01:18:19,614
return to their family
who desperately waits for them.

1109
01:18:19,983 --> 01:18:23,284
When you come across even a smallest lead...

1110
01:18:23,284 --> 01:18:26,853
Please report it
to a nearby police station or substation.
