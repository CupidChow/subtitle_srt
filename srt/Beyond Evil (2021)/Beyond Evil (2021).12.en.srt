(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,680
Mr. Lee, shouldn't we go there?

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,750
Russian junkies are causing a scene
at the nightclub.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,450
My goodness.
How many households are there?

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,150
Can you see that?

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,630
Boss ordered us to take care of the junkies.
All right?

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,830
Hey, idiot.

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,260
Listen to me.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,560
My goodness.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,470
All right.

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,130
When I was a little boy,

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,570
when I couldn't even speak Korean very well,

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,840
I helped my mom and dad's business...

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,940
pretending that I speak Russian.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,810
Is it funny?

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,750
No. sir. It's admirable.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,590
That little boy...

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,220
worked at Texas and Russian Street.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,320
While he worked in a tiny street stall,

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,760
he promised himself...

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,260
that he would never spend his life...

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,930
in a dump like that.

24
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,300
That he'd own land that's so big
that there's no end in sight.

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,300
And that he would rule his own land.

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,680
Look at that apartment building.
That's not enough for me.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,280
I would build a whole town.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
And I would name the town after me.
Changjin-Ri!

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
No.

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,850
- Jin Li. How does Jin Li sound?
- It's great.

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,860
It's great, isn't it?

32
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,770
So you're here again.

33
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,700
Didn't you answer Boss's call?

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,840
Russian customers are on drugs
and making a mess...

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,480
at the hotel nightclub.

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,840
So?

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,750
You're the one who speaks Russian.

38
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,950
I guess you learned rubbish Russian
on a backstreet somehow.

39
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,450
But you're lucky that you did.

40
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,260
Director, so why don't you go take care of them?

41
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,100
I've washed my hands from the nightclub business.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,270
Got it?

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,740
You jerk.

44
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,180
I tried to be nice to you
since you're from Seoul.

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,880
But how dare you tell me what to do?

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,150
Where exactly are you from? Cheongnyang-Ri?
Maljuk Street?

47
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,820
You're in Yeonpo now!

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,660
City Corporation wants us
to take responsibility...

49
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,200
for delaying the opening
of Han City Shopping Center.

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,630
They're filing a four-million-dollar lawsuit against us.

51
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,900
Double the lawyer's fee.

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,600
And tell them
we'll give them a handsome success fee.

53
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,610
They said we're unlikely to win the case.

54
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,340
Lawyers will want
a few hundred thousand dollars to start with.

55
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,680
But we used every penny we have
to purchase the land.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,190
Sir.

57
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,120
If we don't start the construction of Munju project,

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,760
we will not only go out of business...

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,660
but also lose everything to foreclosure.

60
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,700
If we fail to start the construction in a month,

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,000
we should clear the property
and move to another country.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Which country?

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,270
Russia is one option.

64
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,640
I hear Russia is cold.
I hate being cold.

65
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,250
- Sir.
- How dare you...

66
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,050
Let me just say one thing.

67
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,920
I've assisted you for the last 30 years.

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,660
Something doesn't feel right about Munju.

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,860
I keep getting this anxiety...

70
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,990
Director Kim Dol Seok.

71
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,300
You're a businessman
so use a standard dialect.

72
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,130
I can barely understand you.

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,440
- Sir.
- Stand up and get out...

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,040
before I smash your head.

75
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,010
I will get a lawyer.

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,330

88
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,290
You.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
You're hiding a nightmare.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,030
What is it?

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,870
Tell me.

92
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,180
You punk.

93
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,820
- Mom.
- Yes, what is it, my son?

94
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,730
I don't know.

95
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,230
It's okay. You don't have to know.

96
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,500
It's all right.
You don't have to remember.

97
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,770
- He has to know.
- You!

98
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,180
Inspector Han, don't do this.

99
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,450
It looks like...

100
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,020
that jerk, Dong Sik, talked you into this,

101
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,050
and you can't seem to make a sound judgement.

102
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,390
It looks like you're the one
who can't make a sound judgement.

103
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,190
And the same goes for January 15, 2001.

104
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,830
The year 2001?

106

You must've been very out of it...

107
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,570
for you to write this yourself
on this official document.

Jeong Je.

111
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,090
You recognized this number.

112
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,500
You did, didn't you?

113
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,530
You saw it on Officer Cho Gil Gu's call history.

114
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,310
No, Jeong Je doesn't know anything.

115
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,610
- I know it very well.
- Jeong Je.

116
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,210
The number of the burner phone
my mother has been using...

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,520
for over 20 years.

118
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,260
If you recognized it,
why didn't you say anything?

119
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,930
I wanted to know.

120
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,330
Know what?

121
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,370
About that day I know nothing about
and don't remember a thing from.

122

That day?

123
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
Mom.

124
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,510
- About that day.
- Yes?

125
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,950
That day when Yu Yeon never came back.

126
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,350
What happened that day?

127
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,650
I don't remember a thing.

128
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,160

No, Jeong Je. Jeong Je?

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,920
- Jeong Je, stay with me.
- Yes, a 41-year-old male.

- Stay with me!
- He's having difficulty breathing.

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,560
Are you all right?

144
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,200
I've recently been thinking...

145
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,600
that having trust is infinitely useless.

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,840
Trusting is a matter of your feelings.

147
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,010
It can always be shattered...

148
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,640
when the truth kicks in.

149
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
- Is that so?
- That's why trusting him...

150
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,050
isn't that important right now.

151
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,130
If you wish to trust Senior Inspector Park,
go ahead.

152
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,900
Because when the truth kicks in,

153
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,760
that trust will be shattered anyway?

154
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,740
It's because
I don't think you're ready for this yet.

Do you think I'm crazy?

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,570
(JL Lee Chang Jin)

167
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,570
(JL Lee Chang Jin)

168
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,750
So you looked up the investigation report?

169
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,750
Yes, sir.
In order to find the lead to the DNA test report,

170
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,850
I looked through the reports on the cases from 2000,

171
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,660
the disappearance of Lee Yu Yeon
and the murder of Bang Ju Seon.

172
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,560
You said Chief Nam Sang Bae...

173
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,460
asked if you destroyed...

174
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,530
- the DNA test report, correct?
- Yes.

175
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,970
The report he meant was...

176
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,870
probably the test report for a guitar pick.

177
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,300
- The test report on a guitar pick?
- Yes, sir.

178
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,240
On October 15, 2000,

179
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,640
at the reed field by Munju Stream
where Bang Ju Seon was found,

180
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,610
a guitar pick was also found.

181
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,420
Chief Nam Sang Bae had spotted it himself.

182
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,550
Right here. On the investigation reports...

183
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,520
for Lee Yu Yeon and Bang Ju Seon's cases,

184
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,530
you'll see a part regarding the guitar pick.

185
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,060
According to Oh Yeong Ah, a coworker...

186
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,460
who worked at the café with Bang Ju Seon,

187
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,300
the guitar pick belonged to Lee Dong Sik.

188
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,540
Yes, I think I remember that.

189
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,510
That's why he was arrested without a warrant.

190
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,340
Yes, I also found a record...

191
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,010
of Lee Dong Sik admitting
that it belonged to him.

192
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,350
Park Jeong Je gave the same testimony.

193
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,850
However, I found something out of the ordinary.

194
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,590
- Out of the ordinary?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,290
According to the case report
for Bang Ju Seon's case,

196
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,260
there was nothing detected from the guitar pick,

197
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,660
no fingerprints or DNA.

198
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
Although Lee Dong Sik used it
the day before in the afternoon...

199
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,970
at Manyang Café,

200
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,540
and he also stated
that was his only guitar pick.

201
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,970
I heard he had a habit of wiping it
after he used it.

202
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,510
Even so, if he put it in the guitar case,

203
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,010
something had to be on the guitar pick.

204
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,920
But no, I heard nothing was found on it.

205
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,780
You heard nothing was found on it?

206
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,890
No. I was able to find
all the other DNA test reports,

207
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,520
but the report for the guitar pick...

208
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,790
wasn't a part of the case file.

209
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,500
(No DNA or other evidence was found
on the guitar pick.)

210
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,210
Did you get rid of the test report?

211
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
What?

212
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,780
The test report from 21 years ago.

213
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,720
So he was looking for this?

214
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,150
Do you think someone destroyed that report?

215
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,520
That report didn't have
any admissibility of evidence.

216
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,590
Lee's fingerprints or DNA...

217
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,760
weren't found on it.

218
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,570
If he was arrested
just because it belonged to him,

219
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,200
I'd say it's a bit of a stretch
in the investigation.

220
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,340
Right.

221
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,410
Do you think that's why?

222
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,810
Maybe someone wanted to cover up
their mistake in the investigation.

223
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,750
Are you holding the officer in charge responsible?

224
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,750
In other words, it sounds like
I gave an order to destroy that...

225
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,260
as the superintendent of Munju Police Station.

226
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,490
You asked me to conduct a thorough investigation,

227
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,860
so I am thoroughly raising a question
as you requested.

228
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,730
If I gave the order to have the report destroyed,

229
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,370
I wouldn't have made you begin investigating this.

230
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,700
Before I did that,

231
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,510
I would've crossed out this part first.

232
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,880
"E. Requested to have the guitar pick tested."

233
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,950
"The guitar pick found next to Bang Ju Seon was..."

234
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,320
"sent for testing."

235
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,550
"No DNA or other evidence was..."

236
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,190
"found on the guitar pick."

237
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm aware of that.
I wanted to ask just to make sure.

238
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,630
I doubt the police or the prosecution...

239
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,660
gave the order to have the report destroyed.

240
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,930
If it was an insider in those two institutions,

241
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,700
they would've crossed out
what's on the investigation report.

242
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,300
That's why I'd like to ask you one more question.

243
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,840
Are you looking into this case
only because Chief Nam Sang Bae,

244
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,150
a police officer was murdered?

245
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,880
- Or do you have another reason?
- What?

246
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,620
You seemed to be very concerned about this case.

247
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,690
In that case,

248
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,390
I think I should be prepared.

249
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,420
So it'd be better if I know the reason.

250
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,560
I think Ju Won is...

251
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Excuse me? Yes.

252
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,170
I think he's investigating
with Officer Lee Dong Sik.

253
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,470
Actually, Office Lee is not the only one.

254
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,440
A few officers of Manyang Police Substation...

255
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,840
and some officers of Munju Police Station
are in it too.

256
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,140
So maybe I should assign them to the case.

257
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,280
A police officer was murdered.

258
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,850
I'm sure they'll conduct a thorough investigation.

259
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,850
But they say the skin is nearer than the shirt.

260
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,680
So I was worried
if they investigate with a biased point of view,

261
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,050
it would cause trouble for the entire police force.

262
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,590
Do you think it was a mistake
to assign you to the case...

263
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,620
when you are so busy?

264
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,390
No. A mistake? It wasn't a mistake.

265
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,700
I'm always ready to do anything for you, sir.

266
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,530
So I am doing my best
to make a thorough investigation.

267
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,170
Let me know if you find anything.

268
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,970
Put these away.

269
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,810
Certainly, sir. I'll put them away.

270
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,250
(JL Lee Chang Jin)

271
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,050
I thought you'd be at the hospital
where Park Jeong Je is.

272
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,990
Why are you here?

273
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,260
"The one who killed Kang Jin Mook
will kill me as well."

274
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,700
It's what Chief Nam said.

275
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,030
What do you think he was trying to say?

276
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,340
That someone induced Kang Jin Mook
to commit suicide.

277
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,340
And that if he pursues the missing test report
for the guitar pick,

278
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,080
he would die as well.

279
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,650
Do you think Kang Jin Mook knew about the test report?

280
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,120
Kang Jin Mook wasn't an officer.

281
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,480
So he couldn't have known about the test report.

282
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,750
But maybe he did know something
about the guitar pick.

283
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,720
I think Chief went to see Kang Jin Mook
to ask him about it.

284
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,520
But he couldn't because he was already dead.

285
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,030
So it's not about the report,
but about the guitar pick.

286
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,730
Maybe Kang Jin Mook saw something...

287
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,670
related to the guitar pick.

288
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,710
I looked into the case file from 2000.

289
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,380
I read the record of your statement
as a testifier.

290
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,440
You said on October 14,

291
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,410
you used the guitar pick at Manyang Café...

292
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,250
around 4:30pm the day Lee Yu Yeon went missing.

293
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,650
The officer asked if you had used it after that,

294
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,450
and you said you didn't remember.

295
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,030
I really don't remember.

296
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,460
You also said you put the guitar pick
in the guitar case...

297
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,900
after you used it at the café.

298
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,870
You said you went to the cabin at the deer farm...

299
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,330
in Mount Simju.

300
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,440
You said you stayed in the cabin...

301
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,170
at the estimated time of the accident.

302
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,740
Did you say you looked into the case file?

303
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,140
It seems like you memorized the whole statement.

304
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,750
It's just that I have a good memory.

305
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,720
What I want to know is...

306
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,590
how your guitar pick ended up...

307
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,890
next to Bang Ju Seon's dead body.

308
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,060
If someone dropped it there...

309
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,530
Was I at the scene?

310
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,430
Stop joking.

311
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,910
Gosh, did it sound like a joke
and not a confession, Inspector Han?

312
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,010
Are you making a confession?

313
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,610
If that's what you want to believe,
go ahead.

314
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,250
Something bothers me about Park Jeong Je.

315
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,220
The one who was with you at the cabin that day.

316
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,960
The one who had access to your guitar case.

317
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,220
Didn't the statement say that person...

318
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,990
was with me at the estimated time of the accident?

319
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,900
That's why I said it bothers me.

320
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,830
Like I said before, the hospital record also...

321
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,570
You know what? Something else bothers me.

322
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,140
It wasn't there the day Kang Jin Mook died.

323
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,780
But a security camera was suddenly installed
at that building.

324
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes. It's been bothering me too.

325
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Hello.

326
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,160
How is Jeong Je?
I heard he was in bad shape yesterday.

327
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,390
He's in the hospital now. I'm sure he'll be okay.

328
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Did you look into it?

329
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,430
I guess I can't get rid of the leech.

330
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,560
A leech? What do you mean?

331
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,200
JL Construction owns that building.

332
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,900
JL? Are you talking about Lee Chang Jin?

333
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,170
So where is the leech right now?

334
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,880
He answers my calls in three seconds.

335
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,450
But suddenly he's out of reach.

336
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,810
3786.

337
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,520
When I got into your car, 2820, last night,

338
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,990
(54M 3786)

339
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,390
I think I saw that car.

340
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,260
(54M 3786)

341
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,870
Why should I pull my car out of my parking lot?

342
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,940
Who are you people?

343
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,580
What is this about?

344
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,980
Did you drive this vehicle last night?

345
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,050
Last night?

346
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,880
No, I brought it from the repair shop
early in the morning.

347
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,320
Why did you bring it from the repair shop?

348
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,150
- Well...
- Were you in an accident?

349
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,520
- Hit and run?
- There was no hit and run.

350
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,920
It's my boss' car.

351
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,760
He said he hit something with the back of his car.

352
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,330
But it's not like he hit someone.

353
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,030
Do you work at JL Construction?

354
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,600
What? Yes.

355
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,800
And your boss is Lee Chang Jin, right?

356
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,770
Yes.

357
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,670
So he was with us last night.

358
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,450
(My Ji Hwa, HKH)

359
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,880
This little...

360
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,620
Answer your phone.
I need to talk to you.

361
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,460
My goodness.

362
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,710
What are you doing in my office
when I'm absent?

363
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,510
Then you should be here in your office!

364
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,310
You're crossing the line, Chairman Lee.

365
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,940
What?

366
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,050
How dare you talk to me that way,
you little punk?

367
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,190
I'm not a punk. I'm Jang Oh Bok.

368
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,020
The chivalrous fighter, Jang Oh Bok.

369
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,060
He's a hidden master...

370
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,690
from the period of King Yeongjo
of the Joseon Dynasty.

371
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,330
I know all about it.

372
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,800
My chivalrous fighter, Jang Oh Bok.

373
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,530
Stay outside.
Don't come in before I ask for you.

374
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,700
Ma'am, if you feel threatened,

375
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,270
just yell for me.

376
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,720
Is it because you always collect crazy guys?

377
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,990
Or is it because he stayed with you
long enough to go crazy?

378
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,860
I'm not feeling very well today.

379
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,730
So I won't be able to tolerate your nonsense.

380
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,960
Why aren't you feeling well?

381
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,100
Because of your son?

382
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,430
What about my son?

383
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,270
I saw your son being carried away
in an ambulance last night.

384
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,570
Lee Dong Sik and Han Ju Won were watching.

385
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,710
So why did you avoid my calls last night?

386
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,350
Do you think it's okay to keep secrets from me?

387
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,030
I'm sure Jeong Je doesn't remember anything.

388
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,860
I can assure you.

389
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,160
What doesn't he remember?

390
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,830
About that day.

391
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,130
That day?

392
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,540
That day from 21 years ago.

393
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,310
So why are you talking about the old days?

394
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,650
Do you remember the burner phone I use?

395
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,280
The phone I answered when I was with you.

396
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,990
(The day Nam Sang Bae died)

397
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,890
Could you just answer your phone?

398
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,430
I think it's your informant
you bragged about the other day.

399
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,060
Just answer the phone.

400
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Yes.

401
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,310
Why did you answer so late?

402
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,050
Cho Gil Gu.

403
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,450
I know I'm not supposed to call you.

404
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,050
But this is an emergency.

405
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,290
What is it now?
Is your daughter studying abroad...

406
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,190
suddenly getting married or something?

407
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,860
If it's not an important matter,
let's talk later.

408
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,760
Later, later, later.

409
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,500
Superintendent Jung isn't answering my calls.

410
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,870
You two can't get away like this.

411
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,440
Do you think
I'll let you put all the blame on me?

412
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,210
Put the blame on you?
What are you talking about?

413
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,810
Chief Nam figured it all out.

414
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,050
He knows the test report
for the guitar pick has gone missing.

415
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,690
He said it was in his safe.

416
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,290
The safe they searched two days ago.

417
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,520
What does that mean?

418
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,160
What do you mean it was in his safe?

419
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,030
A text message?

420
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,030
Nam Sang Bae did?

421
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,200
All right. Take a screenshot of it...

422
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,330
and send the image to me.

423
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,600
I said all right.

424
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,870
I'm going to take care of it.

425
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,550
(The one I kept in the safe at my office disappeared.)

426
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,050
(The same one you got rid of before.
They'll blame you. Let's talk.)

427
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,030
Chairman Lee, it's...

428
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,790
I mean it's...

429
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
Well, this is just...

430
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,480
The same one you got rid of?

431
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,420
Back then...

432
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,950
I had no choice.

433
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,860
Jeong Je couldn't become the culprit, could he?

434
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,230
The development plan
would have been cancelled too, you know.

435
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,530
This is all a lie.

436
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
The safe in the Chief's office?

437
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,530
I mean, it doesn't exist anywhere in this world.

438
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,570
- I got rid of everything.
- So what is it?

439
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,910
The guitar pick found at the place...

440
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,480
where Bang Ju Seon died.

441
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,520
It belongs to Lee Dong Sik.
Why did you do it?

442
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,120
My son's...

443
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
fingerprints were found on it.

444
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,800
At first,

445
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,960
I fabricated the report
that identified his fingerprints...

446
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,900
and wrote that nothing was found.

447
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,840
But it kept bothering me,

448
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,410
so I got rid of both the pick and the report.

449
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,660
And I got rid of them completely.

450
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,490
Trust me.

451
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,490
Gosh.

452
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,330
I didn't know there was a 21-year-old secret between us.

453
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,770
Seriously, Councilwoman Do!

454
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,010
I don't think you have the right
to talk like that though.

455
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,980
- Pardon?
- You definitely said...

456
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,480
you would take care of Lee Yu Yeon's body,

457
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,880
so we should just leave.

458
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,220
And I thought you did for the last 21 years.

459
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,720
And why was that...

460
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,590
found inside the wall in that wench's house?

461
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,830
I can't believe this woman.

462
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,100
You're indeed one charming woman,
Councilwoman Do.

463
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,540
I wish nothing bad happens
to cause wrinkles on that face.

464
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,610
Are you sure Nam Sang Bae is lying...

465
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,210
about the report in the safe?

466
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,640
Are you sure it's not there?

467
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,980
I just said it was perfectly taken care of.

468
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,210
I spent plenty of money on that.

469
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,620
Perfectly?

470
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,890
If you had killed a person,
it would have been barely perfect.

471
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,020
Kill?

472
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,720
A person?

473
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,200
Once Chief Nam starts digging into this,

474
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,060
Lee Dong Sik will start moving.

475
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,770
- What should we do?
- No one is moving.

476
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,840
If I take care of him early on,
nothing's going to happen.

477
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,110
I'll show you what "perfect" is.

478
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,810
That number is...

479
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,810
the number I used 21 years ago.

480
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,920
Should I just kill this woman?

481
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,990
Jeong Je found it out,

482
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,830
and Han Ju Won and Lee Dong Sik...

483
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,760
also found it out.

484
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,100
Awesome. This is just great.

485
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,200
You said if you take care of him early on,

486
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,070
nothing's going to happen.

487
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,570
Is this nothing?

488
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,940
Lee Dong Sik, that punk, is...

489
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,540
frantically watching for a chance
to eat my son alive.

490
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,210
- So why did Nam Sang Bae...
- What about Nam Sang Bae?

491
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,180
What did I do to him?

492
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,380
Where's your son now?

493
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,820
I'll take care of my son.

494
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,620
Since when did you take care of anything?

495
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,020
You didn't take care of anything 21 years ago.

496
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,230
By any chance, did you put him...

497
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,800
in the same hospital from 21 years ago?

498
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,170
That's nonsense.

499
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,940
- So tell me where he is.
- Come on.

500
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,370
He's not a kid, and he has a job.

501
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,380
Nothing good will happen
if the opposing candidate's camp...

502
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,850
finds out that Jeong Je
is in a mental hospital.

503
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,320
You didn't put him...

504
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
in a regular hospital, did you?

505
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,990
With some medication,
he will get better soon.

506
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,320
He doesn't need to be put in a closed ward.
That's too much.

507
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,000
- Hey, lady.
- Chairman Lee, please.

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,870
Your child is a time bomb.

509
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,230
Do you want me to take care of him perfectly?

510
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,610
Hey! Secretary Jang!

511
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,620
(Emergency Medical Center)

512
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,830
What...

513
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,640
Mr. Park, are you all right?

514
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,710
Deer... I...

515
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,310
Deer... I definitely...

516
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,920
Sir, please get ahold of yourself.

517
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,190
Let's go back to the hospital.

518
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,060
No.

519
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,590
Let's go. Now.

520
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,240
Lee Dong Sik said you can stay in the basement.

521
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,120
In the basement?

522
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,650
Why? Do you want to go somewhere else?

523
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,190
Not really.

524
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,500
How's Hansong Mental Hospital?

525
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,770
The reason why you were hospitalized...

526
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,770
is because you killed a human
that looked like a deer.

527
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,740
You said earlier,
"Deer... I definitely..."

528
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,350
Right?

529
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,680
All I remember is that I saw a deer.

530
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,980
That's all.

531
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,190
Even when Lee Dong Sik was told...

532
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,060
that you lied about your past,

533
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,160
he didn't suspect you.

534
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,130
He rather told me to snap out of it...

535
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,900
and that I must bring him conclusive evidence.

536
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,340
And I'm sure he will say the same now.

537
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,570
Until we have conclusive evidence,

538
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,240
whatever it is that you did,

539
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,110
he won't question you first.

540
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,750
I...

541
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,620
I really don't remember...

542
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,220
anything else.

543
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,190
I don't believe that.

544
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,160
Somehow,

545
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,470
you keep bothering me.

546
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,070
But I'm not going to do anything for now.

547
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,010
I don't want to act foolishly again.

548
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,250
Chief Nam once told me this.

549
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,720
They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

550
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,890
If people like us with police authority
act foolishly,

551
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,120
we could not only hurt ourselves
but also hurt others.

552
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,760
And that's...

553
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,630
what I have done to him.

554
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,770
I will not do something like that ever again.

555
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,240
So try to get your memories back
as soon as possible.

556
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,680
Escape from the nightmare
where your life feels like death,

557
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,810
and confess everything to Lee Dong Sik.

558
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,250
He is still...

559
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,990
waiting.

560
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,740
Is this a Munju resident meeting?

561
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,810
Are you a member of this group too,
Inspector Han?

562
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,340
He was the last person to join...

563
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,810
the substation.

564
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,050
How could you leave me out of this?

565
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,020
Officer Lee, this is very upsetting.

566
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,250
How could you be suspicious of me?

567
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,490
Inspector Hwang.

568
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,820
You're only here
because you kept saying you were innocent.

569
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
So will you be quiet already?

570
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,490
Officer Yoon, did you hear?

571
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,200
These guys, Constable Oh and Ms. Yoo,

572
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,030
tailed me.

573
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,130
Let's say Constable Oh had his reasons.

574
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,140
But seriously, Ms. Yoo,
I'm so disappointed in you.

575
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,710
What do you mean I had my reasons?

576
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,410
How could I ever harm the chief?

577
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,410
How could you even suspect me for that?

578
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm Hwang Gwang Yeong.

579
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,180
I come from a family of public officials.

580
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,250
My dad worked as a level-eight public official
in his hometown.

581
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,020
And my fiancée is a teacher.

582
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,120
She teaches elementary school kids.

583
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,390
This is already exhausting.

584
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,030
- You got that right.
- Don't listen to him, my baby.

585
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,030
Who wants more water?

586
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,270
I'll get going.

587
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,530
Where do you think you're going?

588
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,140
I told you.
This is what Manyang people are like.

589
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,140
What happens in Manyang stays in Manyang.

590
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,180
We can't stand seeing anyone attack our locals.

591
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,850
We gather together
and get rid of our enemy first.

592
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,190
But when there's no outsider,
you're always fighting each other.

593
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,930
I'm from Manyang too.

594
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,500
Seon Nyeo, I'm sorry for asking you
to come all the way here.

595
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,500
No, it's okay.
I wanted to do what I could to help.

596
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,340
I received a parcel from Chief Nam.

597
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
A parcel?

598
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,980
He must've sent it before he passed away.

599
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,220
He wrote that he hopes our child...

600
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,990
will be born into a world...

601
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,660
that isn't so cold and harsh.

602
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
I'd be shameless not to do anything.

603
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,360
I'm sorry.

604
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,770
My hormones are all over the place
now that I'm almost due.

605
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,370
Thank you so much.

606
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,170
I'll begin then.

607
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,340
Are you sure you'll be okay?

608
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,820
I think Lee Yu Yeon was hit by a car.

609
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,260
Judging by the cadaver,
I could tell...

610
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,360
that she had multiple fractures on both her shins,

611
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,300
cervical vertebrae, and her neck.

612
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,630
You can also get these types of fractures...

613
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,470
if someone falls to their death
from somewhere very high up.

614
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,700
But in those cases,

615
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,470
it's also very common
to see a fracture in the skull.

616
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,140
But there were no signs of that
in Lee Yu Yeon's skull.

617
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,850
Do you know what kind of vehicle
she could've been hit by?

618
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,710
Yes. Here.

619
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,050
Do you see how her shin bones are broken in half?

620
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,250
Judging by the butterfly-shaped fracture,

621
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,220
it seems like she was hit by the bumper.

622
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,490
And both her shin bones were equally fractured...

623
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,360
right below her knees.

624
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,000
The bumper on a sedan is around 50cm above the ground.

625
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,600
But if it makes a sudden stop,
the car leans forward a bit,

626
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,240
and the bumper dips down.

627
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,670
That's exactly where her shin bones were fractured.

628
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,810
That means she was hit by a sedan.

629
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,050
In order for anyone to get these severe fractures,

630
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,150
they'd have to get hit by a car
that's driving over 45km per hour.

631
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,750
The incident happened in 2000.

632
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,590
Back then, there weren't a lot of street lights here.

633
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,860
That means she ran in the dark.

634
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,660
I think Lee Yu Yeon...

635
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,170
was standing still.

636
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,270
If she was walking or running,

637
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,640
only one of her legs would've gotten fractured.

638
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,380
Either that or the location of both fractures
would've been different.

639
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,940
I'm pretty sure...

640
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,250
Lee Yu Yeon was facing the car directly.

641
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,590
- Bye.
- We'll be off now.

642
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,060
You should go. Go on.

643
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,170
- I... I can also be of help.
- Come on.

644
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,070
- Bye.
- Goodness.

645
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,240
Are you okay?

646
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,940
Why wouldn't I be okay?

647
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,050
I ran into Mr. Park Jeong Je.

648
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,580
I dropped him off in front of your house.

649
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,320
And I told him you allowed him
to sleep in the basement.

650
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,720
The basement?

651
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,860
When did I ever say that?

652
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,990
I don't ever recall saying that.

653
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,860
If he had anything to do
with the death of your sister,

654
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,430
don't you think that'd be the most ideal place...

655
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,630
to help him get his memory back?

656
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,000
"The most ideal place"?

657
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,270
Are you reluctant
because that was where your sister was found?

658
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,680
Or are you just worried about Mr. Park as a friend?

659
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,080
I heard he's in a very unstable state right now.

660
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,010
If we keep cornering him,
he might lose it and end up...

661
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,180
That's something for Jeong Je to bear.

662
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,290
He knew that the number of the burner phone...

663
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,890
was his mother's, but he didn't tell anyone.

664
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,660
He was also in a mental hospital
for four years after the incident.

665
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,000
That means he was mentally shocked
due to the incident.

666
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,100
Well, yes. But...

667
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,000
Then it's time for him to remember.

668
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,840
What have you been doing for the past 20 years?

669
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,570
If someone told you they saw someone similar,

670
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,510
you'd run over there only
to end up getting disappointed.

671
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,180
Then you'd do the same thing
after another absurd phone call.

672
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,080
You and Jeong Je watched him do that for years.

673
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,020
If he really doesn't remember anything,

674
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,720
I bet he'd want to find out more than anyone.

675
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,120
Let's stop pitying him
when it doesn't do him any good.

676
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,890
Mr. Han.

677
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,890
You did the right thing.

678
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,800
My gosh.

679
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
I heard you found something new.

680
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,610
Yes. Just a second.

681
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,440
You know the building located
behind Munju Police Station?

682
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,210
Here's a certified copy
of the real estate register.

683
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,520
Someone owned the building
before JL Construction did.

684
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,090
Guess who it was that sold the building
to Lee Chang Jin.

685
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,920
- Do Hae Won?
- That's right.

686
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,320
She bought it in 1999.

687
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,430
And it turns out she sold it to Lee Chang Jin...

688
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,530
in November 2000,
which was right after the incident.

689
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,800
She pretty much gave it away
since it was half the market price.

690
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,000
That's located in the center of the city.

691
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,440
Isn't that the most expensive land in Munju?

692
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,910
I bet that area is included
in the development project.

693
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,380
Was this the only building she sold to him?

694
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,650
I'm sure there are other buildings
that are included in the project.

695
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,380
Councilwoman Do started
buying buildings near that area...

696
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,790
ever since 1999.

697
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,520
But during the past 20 years,
she sold about two-thirds of it.

698
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,130
- To whom?
- Lee Chang Jin.

699
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,100
Jung Cheol Mun.

700
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,730
And Lee Gang Ja.

701
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,740
Who's Lee Gang Ja?

702
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,540
Ms. Lee, I'm only going to ask you this once.

703
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,780
Who did you borrow all the yuans you used...

704
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,680
to make the bet?

705
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,380
That darn Fifth Amendment!

706
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,520
(The suspect mentioned above
will be arrested for...)

707
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,650
(Name: Lee Gang Ja, Job: Unemployed)

708
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,650
Officer Cho's wife,

709
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,590
Ms. Lee Gang Ja.

710
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,520
That means she gave it to Cho Gil Gu.

711
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,090
Yes, she gave him a patch of land instead of money.

712
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,430
She gave him land?

713
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,730
That means it's either 1 of the 2.

714
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,600
She was either blackmailed,

715
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,700
or she paid him in return
for doing something for her.

716
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,840
Superintendent Jung received his land
for a dirt-cheap price.

717
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,440
Then why don't you investigate him first?

718
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,150
Jung Cheol Mun received bribes...

719
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,710
even when he worked in Seoul.

720
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,080
Oh, right.
Rumours say that's why he got transferred here.

721
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,320
He pretty much got demoted.

722
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,720
It won't be easy to get anything out of him.

723
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,660
You're right.

724
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,860
Let's say Mr. Cho and Superintendent Jung...

725
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,290
helped Councilwoman Do
get rid of the case report.

726
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,230
But why do you think
she gave her land to Lee Chang Jin?

727
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,470
I was going to pressure him to tell me.

728
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,700
But my darn ex-husband won't answer my calls.

729
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,910
When did Councilwoman Do
give her land to Mr. Cho?

730
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,610
In 2020.

731
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,280
Mr. Cho said he only did what he was told...

732
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,580
and that he passed on the report.

733
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,920
I don't know if Councilwoman Do
got blackmailed by him...

734
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,590
or gave him that land in return for a favour,

735
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,490
but if it really had anything to do
with the missing case report,

736
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,790
it's strange that she gave it to him in 2020.

737
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,790
You're right. The incident occurred in 2000.

738
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,060
What if...

739
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,940
it wasn't just in 2020?

740
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,770
You think he received stuff from her
by blackmailing her ever since 2000?

741
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,170
For 20 years?

742
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,340
How are we going to prove that?

743
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,510
Didn't Ms. Lee Gang Ja get arrested...

744
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,650
the day I got reinstated?

745
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,090
(Economic Crime Investigation Team)

746
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,120
I don't get why we're here right now.

747
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,560
- Exactly.
- Me neither.

748
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,030
- What is this for?
- I'm really innocent.

749
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,970
Gosh, those ladies are so feisty.

750
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,570
It's driving me crazy.

751
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,510
Do you have anything?

752
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,510
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

753
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,550
Ji Hwa.

754
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,950
Thanks to you,
I'm going to get a promotion.

755
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,580
What?

756
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,020
Follow me.

757
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,530
The Chinese people...

758
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,500
who gave those ladies the money for their gambling?

759
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,830
They're known as the Da Ge Gang,

760
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,440
the gang even the Seoul Agency was after.

761
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,770
Thank you. Right.

762
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,010
- And here you go.
- Okay.

763
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,140
Make sure you get them to the end.
Don't let Seoul snatch them.

764
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,450
And you? What will you do
with Lee Gang Ja's account statement?

765
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,680
Are you going to look through
all 20 years of her history?

766
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,550
I'll manage.

767
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,720
Yes, sure. Go ahead.

768
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,660
Anyway, I owe you big time. Thank you.

769
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,690
I'll make sure I pay you back for this.

770
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,460
Stop. Stop right there.

771
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,500
What?

772
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,070
I'll hold you to your words right now.

773
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,300
What?

774
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,340
I heard you'll be promoted soon.

775
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,310
Shoot.

776
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,210
You know that...

777
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,550
Ms. Lee Gang Ja has nothing to do with the Da Ge Gang.

778
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,950
She got fooled, gave them her bank account number,

779
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,880
then took some commission for currency exchange.

780
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,720
I think you can end her case
with a suspension of indictment.

781
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,090
That could be a possibility.

782
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,060
Make sure she is punished by the law,

783
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,890
but don't be so scary when you question her.

784
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,100
Yes, all right. I'll question her myself.

785
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,400
- Thanks a lot.
- Goodness.

786
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,610
Oh, how may I help you?

787
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,550
Dong Sik, you were here too.

788
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,180
Here's 20 years of account history
from Ms. Lee Gang Ja's bank account.

789
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,620
Thanks.

790
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,090
As you already know, we got your wife into this.

791
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,560
- You can blame us if you wish.
- No.

792
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,300
I heard you asking him to go easy on her.

793
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,170
It's all my fault. I can't blame anyone else.

794
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,670
I'm the one to blame.

795
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,640
We'll look at every single transaction she made...

796
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,540
in her bank account starting from 2000.

797
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,570
You'll see that she got paid.

798
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,080
By Do Hae Won?

799
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,210
Dong Sik, you know my daughter.

800
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,280
You adored her too.

801
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,820
She wanted to do a million things,
but she didn't have a great dad.

802
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,220
I was making a living all alone,
and constables don't get paid much.

803
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,690
What kind of utter nonsense is he saying, Ji Hwa?

804
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,890
This story sounds awfully familiar.

805
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,730
I've heard it from an officer who robbed...

806
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,100
a jeweller’s in his jurisdiction...

807
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,530
and a crazy officer
who instigated an abduction of a rich friend,

808
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,900
who also told the kidnapper...

809
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,370
how he can lose police officers.

810
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,940
Forget the fact that...

811
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,850
police officers get paid with taxpayers' money.

812
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,280
We all start with the same salary,

813
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,380
and we do not make a choice
like the one you did, Mr. Cho.

814
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,390
I'm sorry.

815
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,820
I apologize.

816
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,890
Dong Sik, I'm so sorry.

817
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,860
You don't have to bow your head to me.

818
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,530
Do Hae Won isn't an idiot.

819
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,970
She wouldn't have sent you money under her name.

820
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,010
But you know, Mr. Cho.

821
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,880
You know that I'll cling onto this tenaciously.

822
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,110
You know that I'll rip this apart.

823
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,680
You know that...

824
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,160
I'll never forget what you did.

825
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,830
So don't you forget either.

826
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,270
That man, Nam Sang Bae.

827
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,300
Don't ever forget him.

828
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,370
Dong Sik, I'm sorry.

829
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,940
I deserve to die.

830
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,580
But I...

831
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,680
only called her and sent her a message.

832
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,350
I have no idea why he was at the junkyard.

833
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,990
I really don't know.

834
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,160
He wanted to see me over that test report,

835
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,590
so all I did
was sending that message to Do Hae Won.

836
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,700
I can tell you everything,

837
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,300
but I can't turn myself in, Dong Sik.

838
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,600
I need to let my daughter get married.

839
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,100
I'll quit my job,

840
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
give up on getting my pension,

841
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,710
and move far away with my wife.

842
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,110
I can't believe him.

843
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,080
Did you hand over the report...

844
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,750
to Do Hae Won back in 2000?

845
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,230
It's from Superintendent Jung.

846
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,260
I gave her the original.

847
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,800
(NFS, For authorized personnel only)

848
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,900
Then I got something else in return.

849
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,770
My child is my mortal enemy.

850
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,610
(Gyeonggi 30S 6549)

851
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,640
- Is that from the guitar pick?
- Yes.

852
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,310
Okay. Great work.

853
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,380
I gave that to Chief Nam.

854
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,720
(DNA Test Report)

855
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,590
What is this? Nothing?

856
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,220
You fabricated the report?

857
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,790
What was in the original?

858
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,960
I don't know that. I mean it.

859
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,500
I was told not to open it, and I didn't.

860
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
You just switched out the report,

861
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,840
and Do Hae Won paid you for the last 20 years?

862
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,540
Well...

863
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,710
I just...

864
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,240
- took a very nice guess.
- About what?

865
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,150
She once said something like this to me.

866
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,650
"Our children are our mortal enemies."

867
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,690
That's why I figured there was evidence...

868
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,430
that Jeong Je was the culprit on that guitar pick.

869
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,840
Get up.

870
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,680
Get up, you jerk.

871
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,760
Get up.

872
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,630
Get up, you jerk.

873
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,470
Dong Sik.

874
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,840
You.

875
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,220
- Did you kill Yu Yeon?
- No.

876
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,090
No, I'm not sure.

877
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,790
- You aren't sure?
- Dong Sik.

878
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,230
I really don't remember.

879
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,000
I thought I really hit a deer...

880
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,370
And not a person that looked like a deer?

881
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,240
It was...

882
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,510
It was...

883
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,480
It was a deer. I'm sure of it.
It was a deer.

884
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,550
Then why has your mom been paying people for 20 years?

885
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,120
- What?
- Why has she been paying...

886
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,920
jerks like Cho Gil Gu,
Jung Cheol Mun, and Lee Chang Jin?

887
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,860
Why did she keep saying...

888
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,460
her child is her mortal enemy,
while continuously paying them?

889
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,060
What was found on that guitar pick?

890
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,270
My guitar pick found
at Bang Ju Seon's murder scene.

891
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,870
What do you think did they find?

892
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,000
I don't know.

893
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,700
I really don't...

894
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,310
I really don't know.

895
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,440
You don't know, you never know,
you can't remember,

896
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,110
you don't know anything!

897
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,220
Do you...

898
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,290
Do you think I never asked you anything...

899
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,590
only to get that absurd answer from you?

900
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,260
Dong Sik.

901
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,730
I really...

902
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,130
I never asked you why you did that...

903
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,230
or why you haven't told me.

904
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,200
Even when you lied and said...

905
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,570
you were with me on the night Min Jung died.

906
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,950
Even when I found out...

907
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,520
that you were with Min Jung on that night.

908
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,020
Even when I found out
about how you lied and said...

909
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,030
you were in the US
when you were locked up in a mental hospital.

910
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,870
I tore that house down.

911
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,800
You saw...

912
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,140
You saw how I...

913
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,810
finally found Yu Yeon there.

914
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,850
Even then,

915
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,550
I didn't ask you.

916
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,020
I gave you many chances.

917
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,590
But you...

918
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,660
will never say a word to me
even as you gulp down those drugs.

919
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,260
You just don't know.
You don't remember.

920
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,830
- You don't know a darned thing!
- Dong Sik.

921
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,540
I really...

922
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,050
don't remember.

923
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,590
"You said Lee Dong Sik..."

924
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
"was a very good friend."

925
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,790
"Is that true?"

926
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,100
(Question: You said Lee Dong Sik
was a very good friend.)

927
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,730
"Yes, that's true."

928
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,670
"Do you know anything
about the guitar pick Lee Dong Sik used?"

929
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,640
"Yes,"

930
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,310
"I remember he boasted about it
the day he bought it."

931
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:16,010
"Did Lee Dong Sik play the guitar
at the cabin the day before?"

932
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,320
I'm not sure.

933
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,050
"Was there a time
that Lee Dong Sik took that guitar pick out?"

934
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,360
I'm not sure.

935
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,320
"Do you know Lee Yu Yeon,
Dong Sik's sister?"

936
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,930
"Did you know her well?"

937
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,470
I don't want to go in. Can you come out?

938
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,300
"Was Lee Yu Yeon dating someone?"

939
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,950
"Were you in regular contact with Lee Yu Yeon?"

940
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,520
"Did you ever send or receive texts
to and from Lee Yu Yeon?"

941
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,120
"Was there ever a time
you met Lee Yu Yeon alone, outside?"

942
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,360
"011-0780-1234."

943
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,130
"Do you know anything about this phone number?"

944
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,900
To all the yes or no questions you were asked,

945
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,530
you always responded
that you didn't know anything.

946
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,200
Do you really not know?

947
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,270
You really don't know anything?
Nothing at all?

948
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,440
You don't know anything?

949
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,740
You really don't know?

950
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,910
Jeong Je. Park Jeong Je!

951
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,980
Park Jeong Je!

952
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,450
How can you call me out when Dong Sik is home?

953
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,460
- Were you drinking?
- Yes.

954
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,860
- My brother too?
- Yes.

955
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,060
Did you call me all the way here
just to show me this side of you?

956
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,600
When you go to college...

957
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,600
and I go to the States,
I won't be able to see you.

958
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,610
I'll miss my girlfriend so much.

959
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,370
The States?

960
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:53,310
Yu Yeon, today is the day.

961
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,050
Your brother is sleeping over there.

962
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,730
Let's go in and tell him that we're dating.

963
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,030
011-0780-1234.

964
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,530
(I don't want to go in.
Can you come out?)

965
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:18,740
First, stop hiding this from your mother,
then ask to go public.

966
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,140
- What?
- I'm going.

967
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,140
Don't follow me.

968
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,150
Darn it. Hey.

969
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,320
I really won't follow you.

970
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,290
Yu Yeon, I told you.

971
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,920
I really won't follow you.

972
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,460
Gosh.

973
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,610
What's so scary about this jerk?

974
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,300
Yu Yeon.

975
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,200
I...

976
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,770
killed her.

977
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,410
I...

978
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,980
killed Yu Yeon with my car...

979
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:43,910
when she was collapsed on the ground.

980
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,520
Yu Yeon...

981
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,020
Dong Sik.

982
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,830
Dong Sik, just kill me.

983
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,010
All right. I got it, you jerk.

984
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,610
Kill me.

985
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,150
Just...

986
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,050
kill me, please.

987
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,840
I came right away after your text.

988
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,540
I heard Park Jeong Je confessed.

989
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,780
Where is he?

990
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,890
I'm sure he's at home, with his mother.

991
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,590
What do you mean?

992
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,220
You sent him home?

993
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,360
I told him to go.

994
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,330
Are you insane?

995
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,630
You said he confessed to killing Yu Yeon.

996
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,370
We need to get him to the station,
get his confession, and punish him.

997
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,710
What are you doing?

998
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,810
What? What about me?

999
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,750
What are you planning?

1000
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,250
Are you using Park Jeong Je as bait?

1001
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,950
Are you plotting something again?

1002
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:32,890
Can't I do that?

1003
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,290
Haven't you learned anything?

1004
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,830
Chief Nam was murdered.

1005
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,600
We don't know
who else will end up being killed,

1006
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,130
and you're starting this all over again?

1007
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,100
All I've learned is thieving.

1008
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,140
What will you do
if Park Jeong Je and Do Hae Won join forces?

1009
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,880
Those two are family.

1010
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,780
What will you do...

1011
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,710
if Park Jeong Je doesn't do
what you think he will?

1012
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,820
Do you...

1013
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,750
still trust Park Jeong Je?

1014
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,820
Even after learning the truth,

1015
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,060
how can you still trust him?

1016
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,030
Inspector Han,

1017
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,470
what about you?

1018
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,410
If your family...

1019
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,780
did something unthinkable,

1020
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:30,580
would you...

1021
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,120
help them out?

1022
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,350
What...

1023
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,550
are you trying to say?

1024
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,090
You're not someone
who places great value on family.

1025
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,990
Does that mean...

1026
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,430
I can trust you, Ju Won?

1027
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,730
Enough for that trust to stay intact...

1028
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,900
despite knowing the truth?

1029
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,620
Emergency notification.

1030
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,320
Han Gi Hwan nominated for public office.
Turn on the TV.

1031
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,860
(Chief Superintendent Han nominated
for Commissioner General of Police)

1032
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,470
(Nominee for Commissioner General)

1033
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,470
(Han Gi Hwan)

1034
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,540
Your father...

1035
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,410
has become the most important person
in the police force.

1036
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,920
Congratulations,

1037
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,220
Inspector Han.

1038
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,170
(Han Gi Hwan, 59)

1039
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,500
(Current Chief Superintendent)

1040
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:07,670
Help! Help!

1041
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,370
Help!

1042
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,080
Help! Help!

1043
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,810
Help...

1044
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,210
=Beyond Evil=

1045
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,480
Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan...

1046
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,810
has relations with Do Hae Won and Lee Chang Jin?

1047
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:25,380
Everything is pointing toward your father.

1048
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:27,580
You're not remembering it right!

1049
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,750
What do you mean
I'm not remembering it correctly?

1050
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,620
Why do you think Chief Superintendent Han...

1051
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,860
was involved in Lee Yu Yeon's case?

1052
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,530
- Get on your knees.
- That's absurd.

1053
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:40,200
Because your father would never commit a crime?

1054
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,470
Do you remember the higher-ups
that Cho Gil Gu mentioned?

1055
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:46,570
The press and council members
will go crazy over this.

1056
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,210
Are you sure the hearing will go well?

1057
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,650
Why don't you come work for me,
Inspector Lee Dong Sik?
