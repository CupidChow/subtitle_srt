(All characters, organizations, locations, )

2
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:15,904
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:20,505
(3 years ago November 21, 2017)

4
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:32,754
Mr. Lee Sang Yeob, my burden.

5
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:35,354
Yes.

6
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:38,595
What's the most important skill
while on a stakeout?

7
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:43,835
What is it?

8
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:46,635
Observation.

9
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:53,534
Even if there are obstacles
between you and your enemy,

10
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,644
not even a flinch is allowed.
You should be persistent.

11
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:59,815
You should be patient enough
to endure the pain in your bladder.

12
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:03,955
You need the effort not to lose interest
after sleepless nights.

13
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,325
No flinch, bladder control, and sleepless nights.

14
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,364
When you can control all these aspects,

15
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:20,065
you'll finally become a decent VCU detective.

16
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,664
Do you know what a real cop is?

17
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:24,474
- Inspector Lee.
- Yes.

18
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:26,435
Why did you become a police officer?

19
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,174
My burden has many questions today.

20
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,644
Are we on a blind date?

21
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,155
Because I felt victimized.

22
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:51,194
I didn't want that and didn't want anyone else
to be victimized either.

23
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,205
I'm cool, aren't I?

24
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:58,634
Is that why you're sitting here
not catching that jerk?

25
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,845
He killed three female college students...

26
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,144
who were barely 20 years old.

27
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,315
And you want me to watch his window?

28
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,384
Why aren't you catching Song Ji Ho
and just sitting here?

29
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:11,514
- We don't have any evidence.
- We do.

30
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:14,155
The second victim's blood was found in his car.

31
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,525
He said she had a nosebleed in his car.

32
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,354
Do you honestly believe that nonsense?

33
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:19,895
The judge believed it.

34
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:23,895
That's why we're here,
and he is in his house.

35
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,764
In his comfortable house, not a jail cell.

36
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,875
Lee Song Ah.

37
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:35,805
The third victim.

38
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:39,845
She was a friend of my sister's.

39
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,784
What?

40
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:46,884
She was very dear to me.

41
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,954
She was so kind and innocent.

42
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,655
She didn't deserve to die like that.

43
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:51,995
Why didn't you tell me this before?

44
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,925
You should've told me when we identified her.

45
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,324
Then you would've removed me from the team.

46
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:01,835
You're not a burden, you're a liability.

47
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:03,435
Do you want our team... No.

48
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,634
Do you want to get the whole unit in trouble?

49
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,204
I'm never leaving the team.

50
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:10,875
I'll do whatever it takes...

51
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:12,875
to catch him.

52
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:14,615
Whatever it takes?

53
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:21,525
Look. Song Ji Ho is a smart scumbag.

54
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:22,884
He killed two people and got away with it.

55
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,224
Do you think he won't get away the third time?

56
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,655
That's why we have to bust in.

57
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:28,164
You don't know what he's hiding in there.

58
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:30,995
Let's bust in before he gets rid of the evidence.

59
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,194
I'll pretend to be a deliveryman and...

60
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,204
So you want to commit a forcible entry into the house.

61
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,405
Can evidence obtained illegally be used in court?

62
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,204
It can be if it's an emergency situation.

63
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,805
- So let's just bust in...
- Then what?

64
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,044
Then what?

65
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,854
You're just dying to victimize Song Ji Ho.

66
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,155
Who's victimizing who?

67
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,555
Article 13, Clause 1 of the Constitution.

68
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,284
No citizen shall be placed in double jeopardy.

69
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,354
Once one is judged innocent,

70
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,694
one cannot be prosecuted again
even if hard evidence is found.

71
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:01,865
Once he's acquitted...

72
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:04,065
because of the illegally obtained evidence,
that's it.

73
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:07,065
And it'll turn him into a victim.

74
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,175
What if...

75
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,974
we compose a piece of solid evidence?

76
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,355
You're out of your mind.

77
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,685
We can't just sit here...

78
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,954
and watch his window forever!

79
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:29,425
Keep your voice down.

80
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,495
I want to stab him to death.

81
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,264
I know he will become the victim
if I do that.

82
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:36,795
That's what's holding me back.

83
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,094
Dong Sik.

84
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,605
I have to catch him no matter what.

85
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:46,074
I don't care if it's illegal.
I'll do whatever it takes.

86
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,375
But if I fail...

87
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,175
I'll just kill him myself.

88
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,415
What about the victims' families?

89
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:54,344
The ones who lost...

90
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:57,454
their daughters or sisters.

91
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:00,985
Why should they have to see that murderer...

92
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,285
being turned into a victim
only to receive sympathy?

93
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:07,964
You're a police officer.
Think of how unfair and burdensome...

94
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,094
this will be for the families of those victims.

95
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:12,495
It's much better than seeing that jerk alive.

96
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:16,535
- Inspector Lee Sang Yeob.
- Dong Sik.

97
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,435
Don't call me by my name, you punk.

98
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:23,144
You don't deserve to be in the VCU.
Take your hands off this case.

99
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:24,714
You need to leave the Regional Investigation Unit.

100
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,315
Dong Sik.

101
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:33,214
Hey, man. What did I say about partners?

102
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:35,855
Didn't I say you have to
at least pretend to die if I tell you to?

103
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:38,824
Fine, I'll do everything as you say.

104
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,964
So please, Dong Sik.

105
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,824
Then make sure you keep your eyes on him...

106
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:45,394
but don't make a single move.

107

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency,
Regional Investigation Unit 1)

108
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,944
Just pull out.

109
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,985
I'll tell Unit Two to relieve you.

110
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:03,584
Just come back in.

111
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:05,884
I'm sorry, Mr. Nam.

112
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,925
Goodness, you don't have to be sorry.

113
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:12,425
Sang Yeob is our huge burden.

114
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,264
He can never be a detective.

115
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,865
I keep telling him again and again.
My goodness.

116
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:19,995
I'm sorry, Dong Sik.

117
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:24,204
But still, look after that kid
and bring him back in one piece.

118
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,535
Okay.

119

120
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:38,384
Has he gone crazy?

121
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,115
Sang Yeob, what are you doing?

122
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:42,324
His car just left the parking lot.

123
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:44,894
- I'll make sure I stay on his tail.
- Hey, stop. Stop right there!

124
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,754
What if we lose him?

125
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,964
His car just turned into a street.

126
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:50,865
I'm going to catch him no matter what.

127
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:53,165
Okay, I get it.
Just follow him, okay?

128
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,865
Just keep your eyes on him.

129
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:58,305
Don't confront him alone, okay?

130
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,605
Hey, Sang Yeob, I'm on my way.
So until I get there...

131
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,545

Don't talk.

00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:28,094
- I'm sorry.
- Stop talking!

136
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,474

This is Inspector Lee Dong Sik...

We need an ambulance here right now.

He's of Regional Investigation Unit,

This is...

148
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,815
A gun. That jerk is carrying a gun.

149
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:27,354
I'm sorry. I snuck a gun out.

150
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,454
Get him.

151
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:32,324

167
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,484
Please let me live.

168
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:39,854
Please let me live. Please.

Self-defence.

170
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:02,744
I did that out of self-defence.

Don't tell Dad.

179
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:16,474
- Where are you going?
- I need to get some air.

180
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:30,425
(Daughter: Dad, please let me out.)

181

(Dad, please let me out.)

183
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,734
What's wrong, Mr. Kang?

184
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,175
Why? What is it?

185
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,474
What's wrong? What's going on?

186
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,055
Why? What is it?

187
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:08,124
Do Su, Min Jung's phone is on again.

188
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:10,494
Track its location and send a support team there.

(The day of Kang Min Jung's disappearance)

(October 23, 2020)

191
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,035
- Did you drink a lot?
- Yes.

192
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,734
You reek of alcohol.

193
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:21,505
I do?

194
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,244
Thank you for walking me home.

195
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:26,045
- Get home safe.
- All right.

196
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,185
You scared me!

197
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:38,655
Are you just coming home?

198
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:40,655
You're tired, aren't you?

199
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:44,864
How about dinner?
You should eat, right?

200
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:48,035
The guys asked...

201
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:51,065
if we want to have meat at Jae Yi's place.

202
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:53,175
I'm tired.
I'm just going to wash up and sleep.

(Ji Hun)

204
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,895
Yes, Ji Hun.

205
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:22,165
Min Jung?

206
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,234
She just came home.

207
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:29,905
I'll go after organizing the store.

208
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:32,214
Beef galbi?

209
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:36,584
I'll ask Min Jung.

210
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:38,484
Okay.

211
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:27,765
(Dong Sik's Eternal Love, Min Jung)

212
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:39,834
- Yes.
- I miss you, Dong Sik.

213
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:41,334
Have you gone crazy?

214
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:44,045
Yes, I've gone crazy because I miss you, punk.

215
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,245
- Where are you?
- Home.

216
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,344
It sounds like you're outside.

217
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:49,884
I'm home.

218
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,755
Okay, come here right now.

219
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,884
I'm a little tired today.

220
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:56,854
(Are you not coming?)

221
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,364
Yes, yes.

222
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,934
All the more reason to grill galbi
if you're that tired.

223
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,134
- Hang up.
- Okay.

224
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,134
- Here, here. Don't do it.
- Don't burn it.

225
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,735
- Hi.
- Jeong Je.

226
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,174
You came, Jeong Je?

227
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,245
Just leave it to him.

228
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,374
I'll do it.

229
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:22,215
I guess he's confident.

230
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:23,884
You're an expert at grilling marinated meat.

231
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,154
Hurry over and take the tongs.

232
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:28,285
You said I must come,

233
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:30,055
so I thought we're having beef.

234
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:32,894
It's a get-together of Manyang Police Substation.
In your dreams!

235
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:37,424
Then how about Munju Police Station paying today?

236
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:40,134
Look at the meat. It's the kind of meat...

237
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,904
you can only find once in a century.

238
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,904
There are two people from each station.

239
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:48,245
- The one who should pay is...
- Look at how well it's marinated.

240
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,505
Jae Yi, you get better every day.

241
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,545
Dong Sik, the sauce is burning.

242
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:55,985
Just leave him alone.

243
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,354
A dead body was found in the reed field.

244
00:19:58,354 --> 00:19:59,914
If we leave him alone, he will starve tonight.

245
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,025
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,624
You came? Hi.

247
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:07,725
What's that? It's not fresh makgeolli, is it?

248
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,195
I definitely told him
to go to Manyang Supermarket,

249
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:11,565
but he didn't even want to walk that distance.

250
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,465
Makgeolli is all the same.

251
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:16,934
I'll call Jin Mook to bring it.

252
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:18,505
I'll go.

253
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,604
It'd be too heavy for him
to carry all the makgeolli by himself.

254
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,874
All right. Go.

255
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,545
Hey, Ji Hun!

256
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:30,215
Why is Jin Mook so late?

257
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:31,485
- My goodness.
- Here.

258
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,354
- Ji Hwa.
- You heard everything, right?

259
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:36,785
Come quickly and have some meat.

260
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:40,854
Enjoy the meal and have fun.

261
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:42,495
Hey, Dong Sik.

262
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,894
(Manyang Supermarket)

263
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:14,195
That darned girl.

264
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,394
Look at the state of your fingers.

265
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:00,535
The basement.

266
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:02,374
I should go.

267
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:18,725
Jin Mook! It's me, Ji Hun!

268
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:20,124
Let me in.

269
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:25,864
Jin Mook, are you in there?

270
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,005
Jin Mook!

271
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,344
Is it you, Ji Hun?

272
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,705
What brought you here?

273
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,255
Hey, Mr. Kang.

274
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:52,225
It's already past 8pm.
Where are you?

275
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,324
In your store?

276
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:56,295
Ji Hun said he was going there.
Is he there now?

277
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:59,035
Yes, he's...

278
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:02,364
packing some makgeolli now.

279
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:07,404
Yes. We will make sure we have enough.

280
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,005
Okay. Bye.

281
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,785
12 bottles should be enough, right?

282
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,055
Maybe not.

283
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:21,414
I'm not sure.

284
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:25,295
I should just pack six more.
Can you give me a plastic bag?

285
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:32,965
Min Jung is home, right?

286
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,035
Doesn't she need to have dinner?

287
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,604
Should I ask her?

288
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,705
She's sleeping.

289
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:42,844
- She won't wake up.
- Already?

290
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,305
Yes.

291
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,664
Min Jung!

292
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:57,614
Min Jung.

293

(Minion Oh Ji Hun)

294
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,874
Hey, alcoholic.

295
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:44,914
Aren't you hungry?

296
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:47,815
Shouldn't you have some hangover food?

297
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:50,824
Are you asleep?

298
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:54,455
Are you dead?

299
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,124
Sleeping like a dead person?

300
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,805
He said I must leave you alone.

301
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:05,334
Jin Mook said that.

302
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:09,144
Sleeping like a dead person?

303
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,545
Sleeping like a dead person?

304
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,985
Jin Mook said that.

305
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:19,414
Jin Mook said that.

306
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:21,515
Jin Mook said that.

307
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:23,525
(Kang Jin Mook)

308
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,134
Hey.

309
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:34,495
Hey, where are you?

310
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:37,005
Are you home?

311
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,705
Yes. Where's Min Jung?

312
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:44,705
Is she home now?

313
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,844
She came home.

314
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,745
She's home now.

315
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:50,715
That's good.

316
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,584
I was going to go to your place now.

317
00:28:56,824 --> 00:29:00,055
I have something to give Min Jung.

318
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,924
Don't.

319
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:07,565
She told me not to wake her up.

320
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:09,705
She said she was going to bed.

321
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:15,404
Come here. You can give it to me.

322
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:19,414
Come and have some meat too.

323
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:23,144
Min Jung needs to have dinner too, after all.

324
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:25,955
I saw her sleeping before I left.

325
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:29,025
She was really deeply asleep.

326
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:34,525
Like a dead person?

327
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:38,225
Right. Yes.

328
00:29:38,894 --> 00:29:40,565
Like a dead person.

329
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:47,305
Like a dead person.

330
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,884
Come on and hurry over here.

331
00:30:00,354 --> 00:30:01,614
Okay?

332
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:04,884
We will grill the beef when you arrive.

333
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:08,195
What? Is that on you?

334
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,795
You're coming, right? Dong Sik.

335
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:31,015
Do you think it's possible
to indict a suspect for murder...

336
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:32,215
where the body is missing?

337
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,654
It's impossible.

338
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,525
Once he's acquitted...

339
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:21,134
because of the illegally obtained evidence,
that's it.

340
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,235
Article 13, Clause 1 of the Constitution.

341
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:24,965
No citizen shall be placed in double jeopardy.

342
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:26,834
Once one is judged innocent,

343
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:28,634
one cannot be prosecuted again
even if hard evidence is found.

344
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:30,975
What about the victims' families?

345
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:32,315
The ones who lost...

346
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,844
their daughters or sisters.

347
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:37,084
Why should they have to see that murderer...

348
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,114
being turned into a victim only to receive sympathy?

349
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:43,255
Ju Seon! Give my daughter back!

350
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:45,795
Mr. Bang.

351
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:49,065
My youngest daughter, Ju Seon.

352
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:51,725
My sweetheart hasn't come home yet.
I have to wait for her.

353
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:57,465
Oh, my gosh! Honey!

354
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,515
The first time is the toughest.

355
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,884
You get used to it after then.

356
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:19,455
I got used to running over
to check and see if it's my mom...

357
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:22,364
whenever I hear
that an unidentifiable body was found.

358
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:26,065
Even when people say,
"That woman..."

359
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:29,404
"practically killed her husband
and ran off with another man",

360
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,465
you get used to getting that too.

361
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:35,805
Do you think I'm not used to
how people keep whispering...

362
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:37,805
that she's a victim of a serial killer?

363
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:40,815
I have to live like this
until the day she comes back.

364
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,084
What if...

365
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:50,485
we compose a piece of solid evidence?

366
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:54,854
I don't care if it's illegal.
I'll do whatever it takes.

367
00:32:54,854 --> 00:32:56,695
But if I fail...

368
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:00,795
I'll just kill him myself.

369
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:52,815
(Manyang Supermarket)

370
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:03,195
That was a great meal. Bye, guys.

371
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:32,925
Min Jung...

372
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:45,534
(November 4, 2020, Present day)

373
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,514
What are you doing here?

374
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,184
I should ask you the same thing.

375
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:33,115
What are you doing here, Officer Lee?

376
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:36,255
You just disappeared from the butcher shop.

377
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,724
- Let's split up and search.
- All right.

378
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,155
You weren't at home either.

379
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:47,764
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

380
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:50,334
You turned off your phone.

381
00:35:51,135 --> 00:35:53,304
Then he told me where you were.

382
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,005
Who?

383
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:57,275
(Kang Jin Mook)

384
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:01,144
He said this is the only place you would go.

385
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,345
(Kim Young Hee, 63)

386
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,184
He also told me you're a good son.

387
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:09,624
That's a load of nonsense.

388
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:10,954
I know.

389
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:13,054
I know because I just saw something.

390
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:14,695
Your face.

391
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:17,764
When you realized she was still breathing,

392
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:21,434
I couldn't tell
if you were relieved or disappointed.

393
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,175
I'm just saying because I understand you.

394
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,405
Some people are a burden just because they're alive.

395
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:34,374
If you're done talking, please leave.

396
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:38,115
I'll come back in three hours.

397
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:46,124
He says he remembered something
from the day Kang Min Jung disappeared.

398
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:51,664
Kang Jin Mook says he wants to meet us.

399
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:04,354
So you went over what happened
on the day she went missing?

400
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:05,955
Well,

401
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,665
we have to find Min Jung fast.

402
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:14,305
She sent me a message.
That means she's alive.

403
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:15,665
Right?

404
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,104
(Ji Hun asked about Min Jung,
so I told him she was asleep.)

405
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:23,814
So what do you remember?

406
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:26,144
Dong Sik, you should know...

407
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:30,015
I don't want to suspect anyone.

408
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:34,385
I just have to find Min Jung.

409
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:39,725
So I should give every little detail, right?

410
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,194
So she wasn't at the butcher shop?

411
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:47,464
For how long?

412
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:49,334
About an hour.

413
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:54,444
Yoo Jae Yi.

414
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:59,615
Jae Yi wasn't there.

415
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:05,555
If I go to Busan

416
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:11,495
Will I be able to see you again?

417
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:19,265
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

418
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:20,334
Manyang.

419
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,174
What an interesting place?

420
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:28,644
When you mentioned every single name,

421
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:30,274
I couldn't understand you.

422
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:33,144
But you were right.

423
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,754
Every single name is popping up one after another.

424
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:40,854
I guess it's Yoo Jae Yi's turn now.

425
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,254
The person you have to protect.

426
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,495
Who's protecting who?

427
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:50,635
Hey.

428
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:55,334
That sounds ridiculous. Got it?

429
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:01,644
I'm the one protecting...

430
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:04,644
this fool.

431
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:19,394
- Is it barley tea?
- Corn tea.

432
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,564
It's still very hot.

433
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:23,095
Cool it down before you drink.

434
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,674
I heard you have mysophobia.

435
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:33,305
The coffee here is old and unsanitary.

436
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:34,504
So I can't offer you any.

437
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:38,615
Thank you for sparing me.

438
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:44,584
I'm sure you didn't come here
to buy meat early in the morning.

439
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:47,685
What is it?

440
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,794
On October 23,

441
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:58,935
from 9:50pm to 10:50pm,

442
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:00,504
where were you, and what were you doing?

443
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,104
October 23.

444
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,575
It's the day Min Jung went missing.

445
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,915
I guess I was cutting meat,
grilling it, or eating it...

446
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:12,915
with the officers from Manyang Substation
and Munju Police Station.

447
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:15,584
- Are you sure of that?
- Of course I'm...

448
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:20,024
Wait a minute.

449
00:40:22,424 --> 00:40:24,254
I left for a while.

450
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:26,194
I did, didn't I?

451
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:28,495
I can't say that you left.

452
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:30,135
You can't say that I stayed either.

453
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:34,035
Because I was sleeping upstairs.

454
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:37,834
Oh, come on.

455
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:41,845
- My goodness.
- Go home now.

456
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:46,685
- Upstairs?
- I live in the attic.

457
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:49,245
When they have team dinners,
I sometimes go upstairs to sleep.

458
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:51,854
It's not like they can't serve themselves
when I'm not here.

459
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:54,285
I was tired that night
because I went to the morning market.

460
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,155
But why do you ask?

461
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,825
Is someone saying it was strange
that I disappeared?

462
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,325
Who?

463
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:04,564
- I can't tell you...
- Kang Jin Mook.

464
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:08,165
Is it Mr. Kang?

465
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,504
Why do you think he's the one?

466
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:13,444
Because...

467
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:18,274
he's a father who lost his daughter.

468
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:34,024
- Ji Hun, how did you...
- Jae Yi.

469
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:37,165
Dong Sik.

470
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:38,694
Welcome back.

471
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:42,734
How did you get out?

472
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,174
Jeong Je.

473
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,075
He turned himself in.

474
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:49,075
You crazy brat.

475
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:51,044
Are you out of your mind?

476
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:54,584
Come out of there.
Come out!

477
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,584
What are you doing?
Let him out!

478
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,754
He went in voluntarily.
So how can I let him out?

479
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,354
- You little...
- Calm down.

480
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:02,854
You can't do this at the police station.

481
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,124
You can't lock him up for this.

482
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:06,564
Please don’t cross the line.

483
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:07,825
We are trying to be fair.

484
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:09,995
Constable Oh was locked up too.

485
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,694
Listen to me.
That boy and my son aren't the same.

486
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:16,805
I don't care about your fairness.
They are two different people.

487
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:18,635
How are they the same?

488
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:19,674
Excuse me?

489
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,115
My son...

490
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,345
would never do something like that.

491
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,785
He'd never kill someone.

492
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:33,254
He's so gentle that he can't even kill a bug.

493
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:34,825
I can.

494
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,964
I can kill a deer.

495
00:42:40,595 --> 00:42:42,495
What's wrong with you, Jeong Je?

496
00:42:42,495 --> 00:42:43,495
That's enough.

497
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:47,435
You've done enough so just go home.

498
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,104
So I can sleep.

499
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:50,205
Sleep?

500
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,544
You're completely out of your mind.

501
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,544
Jeong Je, what are you trying to do?

502
00:42:57,544 --> 00:43:00,415
I am guilty,
so I'm paying for what I've done.

503
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,584
Guilty? Of what?

504
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,955
What? He's not guilty of anything.

505
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:09,555
He's just joking. It's a joke.

506
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:10,825
I am guilty.

507
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:14,064
I'm guilty of being the last person
to meet her that night.

508
00:43:15,064 --> 00:43:16,694
How is that your fault?

509
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,705
That means it's highly possible
that I did something to her.

510
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,805
It's just bad luck.

511
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:27,305
Being the last person to meet her
doesn't make you the killer.

512
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,504
What about Ji Hun?

513
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:31,415
If I'm not the killer,

514
00:43:32,374 --> 00:43:35,044
why did he have to be locked up?

515
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:36,854
He can't be the killer.

516
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:39,515
Someone tipped us off...

517
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:44,024
with the video of only Ji Hun in it.

518
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,334
Right. It's you again.

519
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,265
You convinced him to do this.

520
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:56,805
- Mother!
- I'm sorry,

521
00:43:56,905 --> 00:43:59,805
but it looks like he made the choice.

522
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:03,774
Jeong Je isn't a boy
who would do something like that.

523
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,615
Ms. Do Hae Won!

524
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:11,185
Cut it out and just go home.

525
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:15,655
Please leave.

526
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:19,155
We'll deal with this
with a quick and accurate investigation.

527
00:44:22,225 --> 00:44:23,694
Please do that.

528
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:38,444
Oh, Dong Sik.

529
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:40,745
My friend.

530
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:43,455
I can't believe you came to visit.

531
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,285
Nice to meet you.

532
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,484
Fine, thank you, you punk.

533
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:52,095
You've never even been to the US.
English? My foot.

534
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:56,964
Why didn't you say so
if you had known already?

535
00:44:57,135 --> 00:45:00,935
It was very tiring
to mix awkward English into my language.

536
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,504
- Come out after a bit.
- Come out where?

537
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,334
Why do you sound so confident?

538
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:08,144
What if I'm the killer?

539
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:09,374
You aren't.

540
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:13,174
- Really?
- No. You aren't.

541
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:15,544
How would you know that?

542
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:19,584
I heard Jin Mook got a text message from Min Jung.

543
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:24,095
The incident finally turned into an actual case,

544
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,765
and I was the last one she met.
Hey, man.

545
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,095
You can't trust me.

546
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,165
It wasn't you.

547
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:39,174
So how would you know that?

548
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:46,214
"Dad... Please let me out."

549
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:50,754
I sent him that text.

550
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:54,584
What are you talking...

551
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:00,124
He got another message from Min Jung.

552
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,765
Where are you right now?

553
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,635
Hey, Dong Sik. You're here.

554
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:11,174
Where were you?
He's been looking for you.

555
00:46:11,174 --> 00:46:14,905
Dong Sik, Min Jung sent me another message.

556
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:16,774
What did she say this time?

557
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,245
"Dad, it hurts. Please let me out."

558
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,685
You wouldn't pick up your phone either.

559
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,555
Where have you been all along?

560
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:28,155
At the holding cell in Munju Police Station.

561
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:32,024
The holding cell?
Were you there to see Jeong Je?

562
00:46:32,024 --> 00:46:33,124
Yes.

563
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,635
Yes, did you find the location of the sender?

564
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,234
The mouth of Munju Stream?

565
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:44,234
The mouth of Munju Stream?
It's nothing but a field of reeds.

566
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:51,415
The reed field? Why?

567
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:53,484
Unit Two is on its way.

568
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:57,055
- Request for the security footage.
- There aren't any cameras there.

569
00:46:57,055 --> 00:47:00,225
All you can see are reeds and the stream,
isn't that so?

570
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:02,424
You're right. There's none in the vicinity.

571
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:05,455
How far inside should we search
starting from the road?

572
00:47:05,854 --> 00:47:08,024
Everything. Search the entire area.

573
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,935
- The entire area?
- All of Manyang-eup.

574
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:13,805
Search everywhere down to a grain of sand.

575
00:47:14,905 --> 00:47:16,705
Don't worry about her and stay here.

576
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:18,674
I'll search through everything.

577
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:22,104
Chief, could you gather everyone
at the substation?

578
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:25,345
People may not feel comfortable
having their houses searched,

579
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,984
so please ask them for cooperation.

580
00:47:26,984 --> 00:47:29,944
Officer Lee, Inspector Han,
you heard her, right?

581
00:47:30,185 --> 00:47:32,955
Jin Mook, don't worry about her.

582
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,484
I'll make sure I strip down every single house...

583
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:37,495
in all of Manyang-eup from the rooftop to the basement...

584
00:47:37,495 --> 00:47:41,095
to find anything related to Min Jung's case. Okay?

585
00:48:06,515 --> 00:48:07,754
(Mount Simju Trail Map)

586
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,495
(Simju Temple)

587
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:19,865
That's too bright, Jae Yi.

588
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:28,874
Why did you hide that there?
You could've just given it to me.

589
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:31,575
You put it deep in your desk drawer.

590
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:35,444
You hid it very well between planks and garbage,

591
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:37,885
so I had a tough time.

592
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,725
No matter how much I thought about this,

593
00:48:43,995 --> 00:48:45,924
the only person who wouldn't be afraid...

594
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:49,165
of sending a message like that in the same room is...

595
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:51,595
you, Dong Sik.

596
00:48:52,294 --> 00:48:53,935
Thanks to me,

597
00:48:53,935 --> 00:48:56,665
you're excluded from the list of suspects
who sent the text, right?

598
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:59,374
- May I have it back?
- No.

599
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:04,214
Jae Yi, aren't you scared of me?

600
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:06,944
I had Min Jung's phone.

601
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,885
I could've killed her.

602
00:49:09,885 --> 00:49:12,285
You're just insane, that's all.

603
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:16,825
The sorrow you held all to yourself
brimmed over at some point,

604
00:49:16,825 --> 00:49:20,225
so you just began to go around doing crazy stuff.

605
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:21,595
Right?

606
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:25,995
Since you're running amok like a crazy man,

607
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:28,205
will you tell me...

608
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:31,234
who made you go crazy...

609
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,705
and killed Min Jung?

610
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:35,805
Was it Kang Jin Mook?

611
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:43,885
Yes.

612
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:48,524
And he's the one...

613
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:51,424
who did that to your sister?

614
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:56,095
- Yes.
- Then what about my mom?

615
00:49:58,234 --> 00:49:59,865
I think it was him.

616
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:11,575
Jae Yi, give me the phone.

617
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,444
- No.
- I'll manage. Give it to me.

618
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,015
- No, I want to do this too.
- Jae Yi!

619
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:17,814
You're trying to find your sister
with your own hands.

620
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,424
I want to find my mom with my own hands.

621
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:22,455
Don't. Don't do that!

622
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,495
Jae Yi.

623
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,995
- You'll get hurt.
- I'll have to get hurt.

624
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:33,495
Why should you make all the sacrifices?

625
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:36,165
You're already a mess.

626
00:50:36,564 --> 00:50:38,334
It has been 10 years.

627
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:42,674
I'm sick and tired of
sitting in that butcher shop. I'm done.

628
00:50:42,674 --> 00:50:45,644
I'm... I want to get hurt.

629
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:48,245
I need to pay the price
if I want something.

630
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:51,155
- I'm fine.
- I'm not.

631
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,655
I'm not fine with this.

632
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,794
Just accept it. You have to.

633
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:00,024
Jae Yi.

634
00:51:01,294 --> 00:51:03,124
I'm fine, really.

635
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:06,294
You'll be by my side.

636
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:13,135
There's no turning back now.

637
00:51:13,774 --> 00:51:16,874
I sent another text message to Kang Jin Mook...

638
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:19,274
before I got here.

639
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,055
Goodbye, Dad.

640
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,885
I'm coming out now.

641
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:31,624
You're not going anywhere.

642
00:51:32,754 --> 00:51:33,894
(Oh Ji Hwa)

643
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:43,834
Hey, Ji Hwa.

644
00:51:44,774 --> 00:51:48,144
I'm all right.

645
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:51,115
Where?

646
00:51:53,685 --> 00:51:58,214
Simju Temple in Mount Simju?

647
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:04,055
Right.

648
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:06,995
That place?

649
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:11,294
Yoo Jae Yi, 28 years old,
highest level of education, high school.

650
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:13,234
She's pretty.

651
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,805
She runs her own business.
The butcher shop.

652
00:52:16,805 --> 00:52:18,274
She's quite capable.

653
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:21,845
All medical examiners know
who this woman is.

654
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:25,174
She shows up
whenever an unidentified body is found.

655
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:27,415
She visits the prosecutor
and the detective in charge...

656
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:30,415
every year during the holidays
and makes a scene to say hello.

657
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:35,185
Not many people continue
to look for their missing mom for 10 years.

658
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:38,254
She's a very loving daughter.

659
00:52:38,294 --> 00:52:40,595
If she's that kind of woman, I'm all for this.

660
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:42,064
What's so good...

661
00:52:42,064 --> 00:52:45,435
about your family,
who ends up becoming nothing but a burden?

662
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:48,535
So why are you trying to force that idea?

663
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:51,774
Because I couldn't find anything odd
through my investigation.

664
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:56,305
Therefore, was this investigation conducted
for personal reasons?

665
00:52:58,515 --> 00:53:01,015
I like simple relationships that only involve...

666
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:03,185
giving what I need to give
and taking what I need to take.

667
00:53:05,455 --> 00:53:08,624
It looks like the victim's father
got another text message.

668
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,894
"Goodbye, Dad. I'm coming out now."
My gosh.

669
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:14,725
Where was it sent from?

670
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,095
It wasn't love. She was a suspect.

671
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:21,765
Right here.

672
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,564
(Presumed to have gone missing
near the sign for Simju Temple)

673
00:53:27,144 --> 00:53:29,274
- Hello.
- Hello, you're here.

674
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:31,374
- Great work, sir.
- Hello.

675
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:33,615
You're here.

676
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,984
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

677
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,555
Where's Officer Lee?

678
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:44,955
I think he volunteered to do a search
in the reed field.

679
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,394
He's there when we got a warrant
to search through Ms. Yoo's place?

680
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:52,834
Don't worry.
This time, I won't throw any eggs at you.

681
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,464
Why not?

682
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:56,964
Does it not feel unfair this time?

683
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,535
No, not really.

684
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:04,075
The first message was sent from the shop.

685
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,415
And I heard another one was sent from the place
my mom went missing.

686
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:08,944
So I figured you might want to search my place.

687
00:54:10,555 --> 00:54:13,185
You're thirsty, aren't you?
I'll go get some water.

688
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:16,955
Well, thank you, Jae Yi.

689
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:23,194
Hey, we could get in trouble for taking it.

690
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:25,095
- What?
- Think about it.

691
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:28,765
If they find something,
we'll be in trouble for drinking the water.

692
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,135
They won't find anything.

693
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:32,504
Officers have been in and out of this place
so many times...

694
00:54:32,504 --> 00:54:35,205
to drink makgeolli. So this is ridiculous.

695
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,805
- They could find something.
- Right.

696
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:39,415
- Inspector Han.
- The day she went missing,

697
00:54:39,415 --> 00:54:40,584
when you had a team dinner...

698
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:43,314
I heard Ms. Yoo disappeared that night.

699
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:45,814
- What?
- He's right. She did.

700
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,424
She was tired,
so she went upstairs to sleep.

701
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:50,325
She always does that,
so what's the big deal?

702
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:53,354
Are you suspecting her?

703
00:54:54,564 --> 00:54:55,725
Is it wrong to suspect her?

704
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,165
She's family to us.

705
00:54:57,734 --> 00:54:59,265
You're not supposed to suspect your family.

706
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:02,535
Constable Oh, you should quit your job...

707
00:55:02,535 --> 00:55:03,805
and just be her family.

708
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:05,905
- What did you just say?
- Hey, stop it.

709
00:55:06,004 --> 00:55:08,044
How dare you talk like that to Inspector Han?

710
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,075
Calm down.

711
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:14,084
Inspector Han, this may seem suspicious to you.

712
00:55:14,084 --> 00:55:16,185
But she can't be the killer.

713
00:55:16,185 --> 00:55:19,555
I think it's ridiculous that you suspect her.

714
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:21,785
Why aren't you suspecting Dong Sik?

715
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,294
He came here after 9pm that night, didn't he?

716
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:25,394
Officer Lee did?

717
00:55:26,794 --> 00:55:30,495
He said he wouldn't be here.

718
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:33,064
Then he came
when we told him we were having beef.

719
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,765
- Inspector Han.
- What?

720
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:36,834
Where are you going?

721
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:41,205
I'm taking a vacation today.
I'll tell the chief.

722
00:55:42,374 --> 00:55:43,504
Inspector Han.

723
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:51,754
Yes.

724
00:55:52,984 --> 00:55:54,024
Section Chief Kwak.

725
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:56,325
Inspector Han.

726
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:57,854
What brings you here?

727
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:06,865
You're working for my father, right?

728
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:11,004
Well, all police officers work for your father,
don't they?

729
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:16,975
What do you want, Inspector Han?

730
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:22,944
Okay, but make it clean
so you won't have to clean it up for him.

731
00:56:23,745 --> 00:56:24,754
All right.

732
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,185
(Munju Police Station Kwak Oh Seob)

733
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:34,524
Is your son still pursuing something?

734
00:56:36,124 --> 00:56:38,064
Is he tracking down the criminal?

735
00:56:39,535 --> 00:56:43,205
Is my son the reason
why you've barged in here?

736
00:56:43,865 --> 00:56:46,435
Well, I can't say it isn't.

737
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:50,075
It seems that your son...

738
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:51,915
hasn't given up.

739
00:56:51,915 --> 00:56:54,144
Councilwoman Do's son...

740
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,185
voluntarily walked into a holding cell.

741
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:00,484
Should I just kill them both?

742
00:57:01,424 --> 00:57:03,584
You two are making things complicated.

743
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,725
This is why you shouldn't have children.

744
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:09,995
As your partner,

745
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,635
wouldn't I be uncomfortable with it?

746
00:57:12,635 --> 00:57:14,435
My partner? Who is?

747
00:57:14,435 --> 00:57:17,374
Who do you think it is?
It's us.

748
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:18,975
We've been partners since 20 years ago.

749
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,544
I told you I only want one thing.

750
00:57:22,544 --> 00:57:25,115
I'll tell you again
because it seems you keep forgetting.

751
00:57:25,845 --> 00:57:28,984
Munju shouldn't be the background of serial murders.

752
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:31,885
Munju should remind people of redevelopment, apartments,

753
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:33,214
permits, and construction.

754
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,555
These are the things
that Munju should remind people of.

755
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,155
So why...

756
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:42,225
are people so interested...

757
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,595
in text messages from a possibly dead girl?

758
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:48,535
Why are the cops crawling out...

759
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:51,334
and searching every corner
of Manyang-eup right now?

760
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:54,845
They're going from door to door...

761
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:56,745
and making a big fuss of it!

762
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:03,345
Is that enough reason for me
to barge in or not?

763
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:06,314
Chairman Lee.

764
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:10,124
Serial murders.

765
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:11,854
Munju will always remind people of the word.

766
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,294
Darn it.

767
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,624
You sit your butt down and listen to me.

768
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:20,865
Sit.

769
00:58:30,814 --> 00:58:32,814
It's impossible to get rid of the tag.

770
00:58:32,814 --> 00:58:34,115
So let's just put things in order.

771
00:58:35,984 --> 00:58:38,285
What is he up to this time?

772
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:41,185
People are talking about serial murders...

773
00:58:42,024 --> 00:58:45,124
because the killer is still on the loose.

774
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:46,995
After all those years,

775
00:58:47,865 --> 00:58:49,365
are you trying to catch him now?

776
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:52,964
The one who killed Bang Ju Seon,
Lee Yu Yeon, and all the others.

777
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:54,104
Are you planning to catch him?

778
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:57,734
This guy is crazy.

779
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,104
So who is the killer?

780
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:03,745
Is that important to you?

781
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:06,814
All we need is to solve the case.

782
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:16,955
Each department manages videos of its own offices.

783
00:59:16,955 --> 00:59:19,794
But hallways aren't included
so we manage those videos.

784
00:59:19,995 --> 00:59:21,424
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

785
00:59:22,064 --> 00:59:23,765
Like Section Chief Kwak told you,

786
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:25,894
just tell me and forget about this.

787
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:28,405
Chief Nam won't be in trouble for this, right?

788
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:31,234
He only has a year left until his retirement.

789
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,305
He won't be in trouble.

790
00:59:32,705 --> 00:59:33,705
Never.

791
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:36,705
Give me a second.

792
00:59:38,544 --> 00:59:40,915
Look. The videos from that security camera...

793
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:42,115
were the only ones deleted...

794
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,214
on the night Chief Nam stopped by.

795
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:45,655
See?

796
00:59:46,484 --> 00:59:47,484
Here.

797
00:59:49,555 --> 00:59:50,555
Wait.

798
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:52,655
Why did he check this video?

799

800
00:59:54,464 --> 00:59:56,624
No one knows there's a security camera there.

801
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:59,535
The utility pole installed with the camera
is on private land.

802
00:59:59,535 --> 01:00:00,665
So it became a problem for a while.

803
01:00:01,334 --> 01:00:03,604
Technically, we shouldn't be managing this camera.

804
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,834
Is the camera still working? Wait.

805
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:10,205
What is this? Why is it empty?

806
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,144
Where is this utility pole located?

How did they find this?

810
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,672
I couldn't find this for years.

811

caused you so much trouble.

No, it's okay.

01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:26,913
Dong Sik said he's coming.

821
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:33,882
- He did?
- Yes.

822
01:03:34,223 --> 01:03:35,853
We can do it by ourselves.

823
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,022
All right.

824
01:03:38,362 --> 01:03:41,493
Fine.

825
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:45,433
- Bye.
- Bye.

826
01:04:27,373 --> 01:04:30,042
The reed field 50m down to the mouth of Munju Stream,

827
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:33,083
next to the stepping stone.

828
01:04:34,243 --> 01:04:38,183
Jae Yi, please let your mom out.

829
01:04:40,152 --> 01:04:41,553
("Superintendent of Munju Police Declares...")

830
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:43,022
("Missing College Student Case Closed")

831
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,632
("Missing College Student Case Closed")

832
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,700
I didn't know you had a habit
of playing with fire at night.

833
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,020
You saw it before.
Why are you staring at it like that?

834
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,160
- Why did you not remove it?
- Why do I have to remove it?

835
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,930
It will remind you every time you see it.

836
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:27,300
Are you talking about a trophy
for the murder or something?

837
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:31,440
I've been looking at what I killed,
cut, and put up...

838
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,840
for 20 years to get vicarious satisfaction.

839
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,640
Is that what you're trying to say?

840
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:43,050
That's what I thought
when I first entered the yard of this house.

841
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,090
Then I thought it might not be the case
for a moment.

842
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,290
But I'm not sure now.

843
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:00,330
There's one thing I know for sure though.

844
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:04,330
Why did you put Min Jung's fingers here?

845
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:11,810
This version is quite creative.

846
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,480
Chief Nam Sang Bae.

847
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,750
Why would a man who only has a year to go
before he retires...

848
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,120
remove the security footage
of the entrance of Manyang Supermarket,

849
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,750
the house of the missing person
on the day of her disappearance?

850
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,960
I heard no one knew that security camera was working.

851
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,890
Well, someone who searched the whole neighbourhood...

852
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,830
to find an elderly man with dementia...

853
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,130
might've known.

854
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,200
He must've thought
there were no cameras around the scene.

855
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,240
When he realized there was one,

856
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,210
how surprised would he have been? No.

857
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,380
Why would it be surprising?

858
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:52,220
The person who entered the house.

859
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,190
The person who came out of the house.

860
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,360
Because someone was filmed.

861
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,400
The reason Chief Nam Sang Bae had to take a risk...

862
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,340
of walking into the police station
to remove the security footage.

863
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:17,010
Who would have been filmed?

864
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:20,280
Nam Sang Bae himself?
Someone who is more precious than him?

865
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,210
What did that person do...

866
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,020
in that place that day?

867
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,060
I'm going to arrest Chief Nam Sang Bae.

868
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,430
Why would you arrest him?
It's not something you can arrest him for.

869
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,330
It depends on how I spin it.

870
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:48,170
The higher-ups need a culprit,
whoever that is.

871
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,910
Officer Lee Dong Sik,
what are you going to do?

872
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,900
Hold on.

873
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:17,970
(Yoo Jae Yi)

874
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,800
I'll just take this call.

875
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:27,880
Yes, Jae Yi.

876
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,380
Dong Sik, I'm on my way to find my mom.

877
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,880
- What did you say?
- He said she's under...

878
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,320
the stepping stone 50m down
to the mouth of Munju Stream.

879
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,160
The mouth of Munju Stream?

880
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,590
What are you talking about?

881
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:45,230
I think Jin Mook left her hairpin.

882
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,730
It's what my dad gave her
when they got married.

883
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:50,030
So she would wear it only on important days.

884
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,600
It's what she was wearing
on the day she went missing,

885
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,640
49 days after Dad passed away.

886
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,440
That hairpin...

887
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,340
Kang Jin Mook brought it.

888
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,750
Listen to me.

889
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,250
If this is Kang Jin Mook's trap to kill me,

890
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,650
you must catch him with this.

891
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,790
You must catch him. Please do that for me.

892
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,870
What's the matter?

893
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:24,530
Move aside.

894
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,840
Move aside, you jerk!

895
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,090
(Munju Stream)

896
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,740
Min Jung.

897
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,880
It's what you wanted.

898
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,350
I'll let you leave this house.

899
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,140
Kang Jin Mook,

900
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,580
I'm arresting you without a warrant for...

901
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,780
kidnapping, confining,
and causing bodily harm to Kang Min Jung.

902
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,750
You have the right to remain silent.

903
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,720
You have the right to an attorney
and the chance to defend yourself.

904
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,020
You have the right to seek a writ of habeas corpus.

905
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,430
Now...

906
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,960
Give me your hands.

907
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,140
Did you come alone?

908
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,610
No way.

909
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,550
Jeong Je?

910
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,810
Jae Yi.

911
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,650
Are you okay? What's up with your hands?

912
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,850
How did you come here?

913
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:06,990
Dong Sik sent me.

914
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,180
Darn it.

915
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,350
That's right.

916
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,720
Your life from now on...

917
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,390
is...

918
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,020
completely...

919
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,070
finished.

920
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,130
(Dad, please let me out.
Dad, it hurts. Please let me out.)

921
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,600
(Goodbye, Dad. I'm coming out now.)
