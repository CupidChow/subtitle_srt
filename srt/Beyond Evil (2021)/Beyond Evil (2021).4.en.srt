1
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,484
Darn it.

2
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:33,165
What on earth is going on?

3
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:41,175
(Head of Munju Police Station, Jung Cheol Mun)

4
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:50,075
Section Chief Park,
is this how you take care of business?

5
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:51,915
Is it so hard for you to supervise your people?

6
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:54,454
There's no evidence that my people leaked it.

7
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,755
Am I supposed to believe that nonsense?

8
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,954
We arrested him without a warrant
because we didn't want a leak.

9
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:00,355
And the other teams couldn't have known.

10
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,624
Someone from VCU must've leaked it.

11
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:06,064
The reporters aren't camped out
at the back entrance.

12
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:08,394
We'll cover him up
and bring him in through the back door.

13
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:10,394
What about the reporters camped out in the hallway?

14
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,264
What if the reporters take pictures of him...

15
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:15,005
and the news says we arrested an officer
as an abduction suspect?

16
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,575
Yes, and without a warrant at that.

17
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,404
How will they even know
Lee Dong Sik is an officer?

18
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:21,475
You told us to arrest him right away.

19
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:22,844
We had no time to let him get changed.

20
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,745
So Lee Dong Sik is in a police uniform.

21
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:26,984
- What?
- What?

22
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,514
Which jerk leaked it?

23
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:31,684
Do Su.

24
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,924
Go get a blanket.
I should cover myself up.

25
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,825
You are under arrest right now.

26
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:38,165
So quiet down.

27
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,225
There's no one at the back door.

28
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:41,594
Let's just go in quickly.

29
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:42,865
I can't take you in by myself.

30
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,564
I should wait for Ji Hwa.

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,575
The reporters will be at the back door
in no time.

32
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:49,775
Will you be okay with it?

33
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:53,644
What's that?

34
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:00,954
What on earth are they doing
in the police chief's office?

35
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:27,815
- Come quick.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,315
Get in!

37
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,345
Hey, stop them.

38
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,244
- You can't come in here.
- Wait.

39
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,685
Slowly. Slowly.

40
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:47,065
Bring him right now. Come on. Quickly.

41
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:48,135
You take him now.

42
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:15,155
- He's a police officer.
- Take his pictures!

43
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,625
Who is he? He's an officer, right?

44
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,794
Is he a suspect in the missing case
of the female college student?

45
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:21,535
Is the suspect an officer?
Did the officer abduct her?

46
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,734
Stop taking pictures!

47
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:27,364
Chief?

48
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,334
What is this?

49
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,845
Is this the only piece of evidence?

50
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:46,454
=Beyond Evil=

51
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:49,825
=Episode 4: Cry=

52
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,404
(Police officer arrest as a suspect
in the Munju missing persons case)

53
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:15,954
Chief.

54
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:17,685
You're here.

55
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,125
What are you doing?

56
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,325
Are the officers from Manyang Substation
having a party in here?

57
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,854
I didn't ask him to come.

58
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:27,964
Inspector Han, you can't barge in
when it's not your jurisdiction.

59
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:29,295
Get out.

60
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,264
You should leave too.

61
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,735
Why aren't you leaving?

62
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,305
We could have a case
because Inspector Han tipped us off.

63
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,604
So let him in the observation room.

64
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:42,575
It doesn't matter whose jurisdiction it is anymore,
is that it?

65
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,784
Nobody cares about the rules anymore.

66
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,815
Way to go.

67
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:51,284
You must've run over as fast as you could.

68
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:54,454
But we're about to watch him mess things up for us.

69
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,055
- Is he remaining silent?
- Remaining silent?

70
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:59,164
I'd be glad if that were the case.

71
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,495
What is that nut trying to do?

72
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:08,604
Ttaengttaengmyeon.

73
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:10,904
What?

74
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,644
The ramyeon brand.
The regular kind, not the cup noodles.

75
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,745
You've been watching it for the last 10 minutes.

76
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,685
And all you came up with
is ramyeon in the plastic bag?

77
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,545
There's no harm in being thorough.

78
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,014
Don't you think so?

79
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,224
Officer Lee, does everything seem like a joke to you?

80
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:27,954
Why would I think it's a joke?

81
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:32,425
I don't know anything about this.
Why would you ask me that?

82
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,235
You should ask Inspector Han.

83
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:40,305
It's the cloned phone
you found Inspector Han's number on, isn't it?

84
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,375
So you're saying...

85
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,575
I put the phone in this plastic bag
and went up the mountain.

86
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:50,445
But the security camera caught me.
Is that it?

87
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:54,144
Maybe you guys have X-ray vision.

88
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:57,825
Does the VCU teach you how to develop superpowers?

89
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:00,755
All right.
Let's say what's inside the bag is ramyeon.

90
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,555
Why did you bring it with you?

91
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,594
Were you going to cook ramyeon up on the mountain?

92
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:07,094
Is that why you wrapped it up nicely
in a plastic bag?

93
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,065
Are you training your men properly?

94
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:14,334
I've never seen an officer
with such little law-abiding spirit.

95
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,474
What did you just say?

96
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,334
I was going up the mountain.

97
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,474
So how can I cook ramyeon up there?

98
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,875
I would need a portable gas stove and butane gas.

99
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,144
Isn't it illegal to use flammable materials
in the mountains?

100
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:26,284
Why would I break the law to eat ramyeon there?

101
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,154
Do Su, you really need some law-abiding spirit.

102
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:33,284
You're under arrest
for abduction and malicious wounding.

103
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:34,695
But you're talking about a law-abiding spirit?

104
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,495
Of course. A police officer must follow the law.
Isn't this the law?

105
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,425
Are you saying we don't have to obey this kind of law?

106
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:42,435
Pull yourself together.
Many a mickle makes a muckle.

107
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:45,034
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

108
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,904
Gosh. That darn "many a mickle".

109
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,334
I've heard about him,
but he really is a total nut case.

110
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:53,375
Listen, Dong Sik. I used to look up to you.

111
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,175
You started from a police substation
in such a remote area...

112
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,615
and made it to the Regional Investigation Unit in Seoul...

113
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,784
Kang Do Su.

114
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,315
Gosh.

115
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:03,485
Thank you for your compliment.

116
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:09,125
If you weren't going to cook it,
why did you take it there?

117
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:12,625
A raw ramyeon snack.

118
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,865
Don't you know what that is?

119
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:18,604
A snack made with uncooked ramyeon noodles
mixed with the soup powder.

120
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:21,474
Ttaengttaengmyeon is perfect for a raw ramyeon snack.

121
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:27,305
Oh, no. I guess he doesn't know that either.

122
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:30,815
Do Su.

123
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:35,055
Why do you think I told you the exact product name...

124
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,885
of the ramyeon I was carrying?

125
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,954
To make it easier for you guys to check
if I actually bought it?

126
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,425
That's one of the reasons.

127
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:46,825
Since I'm a police officer just like you,

128
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:49,995
I don't want you to waste your time
investigating the wrong man.

129
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,135
But of course, that's not the only reason.

130
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:56,505
I must not let you doubt what I say even just a little.

131
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,604
Oh, right.

132
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:04,274
Am I speaking too fast?

133
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:06,685
Do Su, your typing speed is...

134
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,615
still under 200 keystrokes per minute, right?

135
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,625
All right.
I'll repeat what I said but slowly this time.

136
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:15,154
So the reason why...
I mean, Officer, the reason why...

137
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:19,224
I revealed the exact product name of the ramyeon is...

138
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:23,195
You're saying you said it
because you didn't want us to suspect you?

139
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:25,464
Do Su, what distinguishes Ttaengttaengmyeon from others?

140
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,104
It has the thinnest noodles among all ramyeon products.

141
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:31,604
A raw ramyeon snack is better with thin, crispy noodles.

142
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,104
Imagine that I went up to the mountain with thick noodles.

143
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,045
That would be pure comedy.

144
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,945
That's why I clearly told you it was Ttaengttaengmyeon...

145
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:42,315
Gosh, that stupid Ttaengttaengmyeon.
Stop spewing nonsense.

146
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,254
Do you think we arrested you without a warrant...

147
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:45,925
just to hear you chattering about ramyeon noodles?

148
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,454
Do Su, what's wrong?

149
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:52,464
Do you not like ramyeon?

150
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,295
Lee Dong Sik, that's enough.

151
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,535
Enough?

152
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,805
Well, if you say so. Okay.

153
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:04,305
If that was too much... Then...

154
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:07,045
What else should I talk about
other than noodle quality?

155
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,575
How about screen quality?

156
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:18,854
Noodle quality, screen quality.

157
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:22,594
That was a good one.

158
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,994
Did I look okay on the screen?

159
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:35,874
Police officers exposed...

160
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,645
the man they arrested without a warrant...

161
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,645
in front of reporters,
who took photos of the suspect.

162
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:46,515
They revealed the identity...

163
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:49,155
of a suspect they hadn't proved to be guilty...

164
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,454
to the whole world.

165
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,565
Do you like stories like this?

166
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,624
Don't let him sway you and move on.

167
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:05,004
Why did you go to Mount Simju
with Ttaengttaengmyeon that morning?

168
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,364
To eat a raw ramyeon snack.

169
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,435
That's not what I asked.

170
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:10,634
Why did you go up to the mountain?

171
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:11,974
You know...

172
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,045
that I always go hiking to Mount Simju
on my day off.

173
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:16,374
You know that.

174
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,315
Inspector Oh Ji Hwa, you know that.

175
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,025
You went hiking because it was your day off?

176
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,754
When Kang Min Jung who's like your own niece
went missing?

177
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:30,454
It would've been weird
if I hadn't done what I usually do.

178
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,425
Is it weird for me to do what I always do?

179
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:37,535
So what's your answer?
Do you know it or not?

180
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,035
Are you going to...

181
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:45,175
confirm that fact for me or not?

182
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,515
I'm well aware...

183
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,384
that Officer Lee goes hiking to Mount Simju
on his days off.

184
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,055
But Dong Sik, I don't know about this.

185
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:06,525
Why was there Min Jung's blood
in the basement of your house?

186
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:16,234
Blood? Min Jung's blood?

187
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:24,344
How would I know that?

188
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:28,114
I mean, Min Jung came to my house
whenever she wanted.

189
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:30,454
Maybe she went to the basement
and got pricked by something.

190
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:31,785
Why did you clean the basement?

191
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:34,785
You cleaned thoroughly using bleach
and some other detergents...

192
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:37,055
as if you had to get rid of your traces completely.

193
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:48,874
Are you saying that I dragged...

194
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,614
Min Jung to my basement...

195
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:06,325
to cut off her fingers...

196
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,695
and murder her?

197
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:12,864
And in order to remove all the evidence...

198
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:16,035
of cutting off her fingers and killing her,

199
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:19,604
I cleaned the basement using bleach
after the murder?

200
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,785
Come on. Stop acting like an amateur.

201
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:37,915
I cut off Min Jung's fingers in my basement,

202
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:41,325
and cleaned the place
to get rid of her splattered blood...

203
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,954
using bleach and some other detergents?

204
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:45,825
If that's true,
why is this the only bloodstain you found?

205
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:53,065
Don't tell me you think
that all the bloodstains were gone...

206
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:57,104
because I cleaned the basement using bleach.

207
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,204
Are you guys detectives in a drama?

208
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:03,214
Luminol can detect blood
even if you clean it with bleach.

209
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,244
You know that.

210
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,185
And you found this single drop of blood.

211
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:10,815
Are you sure this is all you found?

212
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,744
What? A single drop?
Just a single drop of her blood?

213
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:41,854
Sang Bae, it doesn't make sense, you know.

214
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,254
Min Jung is like his own family,
and she went missing.

215
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:46,984
Besides, he was the one who found her 10 fingers.

216
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:48,754
Then why would he thoroughly clean his basement...

217
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,925
even using bleach and detergents?

218
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,594
Gosh. "Thoroughly", my foot.

219
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:55,094
If he thoroughly cleaned it,
there should've been no blood at all.

220
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,134
If he had cut all the 10 fingers in there,

221
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,334
there must've been blood all over the place.

222
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,334
You're not making any sense.

223
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,374
Did you really arrest him
because of that single drop of blood?

224
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:07,275
But we did find blood that belongs to the missing person.

225
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,645
He was caught on the security camera...

226
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,175
that he installed by himself cleaning the basement.

227
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:13,084
I'm glad you brought that up.

228
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,984
Did you see him cutting off her fingers
in that footage?

229
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,884
Is there any sign
that Dong Sik deleted the footage?

230
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,785
We couldn't find anything like that, but...

231
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:22,854
What kind of crazy psycho
would install a security camera,

232
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,724
murder a person in front of that camera,

233
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:26,765
and clean the place to get rid of the evidence?

234
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,195
- Are you serious?
- Gosh.

235
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,964
That means he didn't cut off her fingers in his basement.

236
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,035
- What did you say?
- He did it at another place.

237
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:38,134
Is there any place you think he might've done it?

238
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,374
A place where it wouldn't be strange...

239
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:42,114
to see blood everywhere and to use a knife or a saw...

246
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,704
Hey, didn't something happen
at that store in the past?

247
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,244
The same thing happened back then.

248
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:16,015
Oh, gosh. What's going on?

249
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,515
Oh, I see that the owner is still running that store.

250
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,145
Let's just keep going.

251
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,594
- Has it been long?
- Didn't she tell you anything?

252
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,795
What's going on there? It's been closed for a while.

253
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:35,165
I heard that the woman who ran that store
packed up and left.

254
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:38,805
That girl's father died not long ago.

255
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,864
Could her mom have met another man?

256
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:42,974
- She left with another man?
- Quiet down. She might hear us.

257
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,874
What do you think you're doing now?

258
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,684
Did it make you this mad
that we're rummaging through the butcher shop?

259
00:16:58,844 --> 00:16:59,844
Butcher shop?

260
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:02,215
Ms. Yoo, you're angry
because your butcher shop...

261
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,414
is being searched and seized.

262
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,555
I guess you're doing this
because it made you angry...

263
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,555
that your store got involved in a murder case.

264
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,995
But you can't take that anger out on me.

265
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:14,965
You should rather blame yourself for being friends...

266
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,765
with someone like Lee Dong Sik.

267
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,604
Hey, stop it. Okay?

268
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:26,775
Ms. Yoo!

269
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,215
Jae Yi! What are you doing?

270
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,414
- Jae Yi, did you lose your mind?
- My goodness!

271
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:37,114
Gosh.

272
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:40,584
Here. Oh, my. Look at this.

273
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,325
What are you doing?
Are you taking photos?

274
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:45,825
- Delete that right now.
- I didn't take any.

275
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:46,894
Delete the photo.

276
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:49,134
- I deleted it.
- We deleted it.

277
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,664
What on earth did he do
to make her do something like that?

278
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:54,434
- Tell me about it.
- Seriously.

279
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:55,505
Let's go.

280
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:01,005
What? Are you annoyed?

281
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,674
Come on, it's just some eggs.

282
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:06,414
- You can just wash it off.
- Jae Yi.

283
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,414
Are you annoyed that people are talking about you?

284
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:09,985
It's nothing compared to what you did.

285
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:13,184
You stigmatized an innocent person.

286
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:16,924
This person will be stigmatized
as a criminal for life.

287
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:18,995
And you're annoyed...

288
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,894
by just some eggs?

289
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:21,934
Are you saying...

290
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:25,535
I stigmatized Lee Dong Sik,
who is an innocent man?

291
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:30,904
You're putting on a show, obviously.

292
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:42,055
Are you saying this is just a show?

293
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:45,255
Ms. Yoo, is life so easy for you?

294
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,924
I envy the world you live in.

295
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,725
The world where some show...

296
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,594
can easily make turn an innocent man
into a criminal...

297
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,624
and make everyone believe you.

298
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,065
If that lame world of yours...

299
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:59,465
and your prejudice...

300
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:03,035
are the only reason why I have to be egged now,

301
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,005
it means you disregard
the entire Korean police force.

302
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,315
You know you're being overly dramatic now.

303
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:13,914
You'd better cut it out here...

304
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,955
unless you want to be completely done for.

305
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:28,965
Hey.

306
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,465
Do it then!

307
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,444
Let me see...

308
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,715
what you find too. Please.

309
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,055
Hey.

310
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,325
Can't you knock?

311
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,755
Why would I?

312
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,065
This place is full of men.

313
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:37,594
You shouldn't be so shy with your colleagues.

314
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:38,705
That's just not appropriate.

315
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:43,235
It's a new one.

316
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,005
You said you don't like using used towels.

317
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:46,245
Take this to the shower.

318
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,775
- I don't take showers anywhere.
- Oh, right.

319
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:50,815
I forgot that.

320
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:52,344
But what else can you do?

321
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,444
I can't let you go home.

322
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,854
As you know, Dong Sik is now arrested,

323
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,255
so without you,
this team will be too short-handed.

324
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,255
We can't let that happen.

325
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:03,854
- I'm taking some time off...
- Who? You?

326
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,864
When? I have never signed that paper.

327
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:10,664
- Sir.
- Come on. Don't be like that.

328
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:12,664
There's some bleach in the bathroom.

329
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:14,334
Why don't you clean the bathroom...

330
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:16,874
and wash yourself up as well?

331
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,775
Life isn't easy, is it?

332
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,815
You can't just wash up anywhere.

333
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:28,114
Goodness. Life isn't easy for any of us.

334
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:30,785
Wash up and come on out.

335
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:44,594
What are you doing?

336
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,834
You hate when things are dirty.

337
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:53,104
It's my car. And I'm still working now.

338
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,674
Just leave it. I'll take care of it.

339
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:59,245
You know, Jae Yi isn't a bad person.

340
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:03,055
She's actually a really nice person.

341
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,884
Instead of her,
I'll wash your car and do anything...

342
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:09,354
- to make you feel better, so...
- Officer Oh.

343
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,495
Why would you do that?

344
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,664
Are you stupid? Are you a pushover?

345
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:15,394
Why are you doing this?

346
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:17,094
Well, it's just...

347
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,535
You don't seem to understand what's going on.

348
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:22,334
Don't make me laugh.

349
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:23,575
I don't understand what's going on?

350
00:22:23,604 --> 00:22:25,075
You're the one who doesn't understand.

351
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:29,045
You also said Lee Dong Sik was a good person.

352
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,144
If he's such a nice person,
why would he do this?

353
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:35,344
If he really is a nice person,
why would he do something like this?

354
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:37,354
You provoked them.

355
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,325
Like some cold rice in a bowl,

356
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:45,894
the people here have been stuck
in this stupid village.

357
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:49,065
And you provoked those people.

358
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,634
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have washed your car.

359
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:58,674
Let's go out on patrol.

360
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,305
You're going to drive, right?

361
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:08,854
This is not the place.

362
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,555
There are a lot of bloodstains,

363
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:13,785
but most of them are animals' blood.

364
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:15,384
Most of them?

365
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:18,295
But this knife.

366
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:21,465
A woman's blood was found
on the wooden handle of the knife.

367
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:23,265
Not only was the bloodstain old
but it also was highly likely...

368
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:25,904
to have been contaminated,
so I didn't expect much from it,

369
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,364
but we managed to extract its DNA.

370
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:31,075
And we even found a match from our database.

371
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,505
- Here. Take a look at this.
- Han Jeong Im.

372
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:35,914
How did you know?

373
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,475
(The DNA from the above item matches
that of the missing Han Jeong Im.)

374
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:39,785
Han Jeong Im?

375
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:41,785
Is this all we've got?

376
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:44,354
This means we're totally doomed
thanks to someone.

377
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,725
Keep looking. But it won't change the fact
that that's all we've got.

378
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:53,025
Anyway, we found a woman's DNA.

379
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,325
It's not Kang Min Jung's.

380
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:57,965
And it's just a tiny bloodstain on the handle.

381
00:23:57,965 --> 00:23:59,205
What can we do about it?

382
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,334
This means Manyang Butcher Shop is irrelevant.

383
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:06,374
You arrested him without a warrant,
and your 48 hours are almost over.

384
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:08,045
If you don't have any evidence to get the warrant,

385
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:10,114
you need to at least get Lee Dong Sik's confession.

386
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:13,545
I heard that punk has the cops
in the palm of his hands.

387
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:18,515
Once it gets out that Dong Sik is freed,
the arrest has been cancelled,

388
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:20,725
and there's been a mistake
in the search and seizure warrant...

389
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,884
That's not the problem.

390
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,325
The problem is we might miss a criminal.

391
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:24,694
You're upset. This is not like you.

392
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,325
Why are you even angry?

393
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:27,664
The ones who should be angry are your father,

394
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:29,834
who believed you and decided to arrest him
without a warrant,

395
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,194
and me, who issued the warrant.

396
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:33,235
We were totally fooled by you.

397
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:36,775
Han Ju Won.

398
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:39,344
Stay off this case.

399
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:43,674
- Hyeok.
- And I'm saying this for your sake.

400
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:45,884
I know you graduated at the top of your class,

401
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,015
and I understand you want to
continue your winning streak...

402
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:50,755
as a police officer as you have been,

403
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,384
but we're not in school.

404
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,725
The world doesn't always go your way, young man.

405
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:00,565
I mean, look at your face.

406
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:04,434
Let your father and I take care of this case.

407
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:05,634
Get some rest.

408
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,944
Han Jeong Im.

409
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,025
Han Jeong Im.

410
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:28,485
(Missing person, Han Jeong Im, female, age 42)

411
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:42,904
(Missing person, Han Jeong Im, female, age 42)

412
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:45,745
Why was a missing person's blood...

413
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,275
(Contact)

414
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:50,815
034-942...

415
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:57,715
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

416
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:07,725
My mom said earlier...

417
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,894
that the cops were here this afternoon.

418
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:11,934
Here? Again?

419
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,735
This area must be cursed.

420
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,475
- There's something about this area.
- It's so spooky.

421
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:19,604
- Why did you take a photo?
- I'm scared.

422
00:26:39,594 --> 00:26:41,424
(Missing Person)

423
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,864
(Han Jeong Im, female, age 42, 165cm,
55kg, dark brown curly hair)

424
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:47,604
I'll get everything back.

425
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:54,174
Just as they were when you disappeared, Mom,

426
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,114
I'll get them all back.

427
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:02,884
I'll give it all to you when you come back,

428
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:05,884
and I'll never set foot in this place again.

429
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:12,255
I'll give it all to you, Mom.

430
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:14,864
And I won't even look back as I leave.

431
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:21,604
Don't worry.

432
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:24,035
I'll make sure to get everything back.

433
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:04,677
You look so comfortable.

434
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:07,116
You must be at ease.

435
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:13,856
What took you so long? You're my partner.

436
00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:15,687
You should've come sooner.

437
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:21,056
I missed you so much.

438
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:25,027
I was pondering whether I should call you or not.

439
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:30,707
Getting attached to others can be dangerous.

440
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,237
Don't you think?

441
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,477
I didn't know bonds between people meant so much to you.

442
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:39,316
I suppose that's why you bonded with the victims...

443
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:40,916
before you killed them.

444
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:43,187
- Me?
- Han Jeong Im.

445
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,947
Yoo Jae Yi's mother.

446
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:46,717
I saw the missing persons flyer for her...

447
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:49,457
that you put up on the wall in your basement.

448
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:53,556
You made them let their guards down and killed them.

449
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:55,757
That stupid bond was a trap.

450
00:28:57,896 --> 00:29:01,096
The word "trap" reminds me of something.

451
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:05,106
You see, I had so much time
while being locked up in here,

452
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:07,707
so I've been thinking about it.

453
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:12,977
About the woman, the owner of the cloned phone.

454
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:17,586
That woman is a trap you set, right?

455
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:21,386
Did she know that you pushed her...

456
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,386
to her death?

457
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,836
Reporter Im, we're dealing with such a big crisis.

458
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:38,106
It was the information on an arrest
without a warrant that was leaked.

459
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,707
You happened to see it while passing by?
Come on.

460
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:42,947
I heard everything from the restaurant owner.

461
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,707
I know you ran out of the restaurant while eating.

462
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,876
Which team leaked it?
Just give me a hint.

463
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:51,616
I'll make sure to keep the rest confidential...

464
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:54,056
- What are you doing?
- Pardon me?

465
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:58,457
Mr. Jung and Mr. Park told me to find out
who leaked the information.

466
00:29:58,457 --> 00:29:59,626
Hang up.

467
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,056
- Ma'am.
- I said, hang up.

468
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:04,666
It doesn't make sense to waste time
on a phone call for that reason.

469
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,136
Who is your immediate supervisor?

470
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:09,636
Whose order do you put first?
Do you want to leave this team?

471
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:11,237
I hung up.

472
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:14,376
I'm sorry, ma'am.

473
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,806
It makes no sense. I simply can't understand it.

474
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:21,677
Why? Did they tell you
to find out who the mole is too?

475
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:22,816
A mole?

476
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:26,287
No, it's not like that.

477
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,957
Someone came to see Dong Sik.

478
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,126
And that person is Mr. Kang Jin Mook.

479
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:33,027
The missing Kang Min Jung's father.

480
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:34,656
What?

481
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:37,126
You lost so much weight.

482
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:40,737
It's been only a few days,
but you got much thinner.

483
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:42,806
Did you get some sleep?

484
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:46,136
You must not have slept well...

485
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,376
because your back hurt
while sleeping on the floor.

486
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:58,416
This is... This is jangjorim.

487
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,816
I made it for you.

488
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:04,487
When they... When they let you eat later,

489
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:08,427
ask them for this and... And eat it.

490
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,967
You made...

491
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:14,136
jangjorim for me?

492
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:15,896
How did you even think to do that?

493
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:18,537
I know that Min Jung will come back.

494
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,007
I don't...

495
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:24,146
I don't want to see you lose your health.

496
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,846
- Don't you know why I'm here?
- I know.

497
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:34,586
- Then why would you do this?
- I know you.

498
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:37,787
It wasn't you. I'm sure of it.

499
00:31:38,257 --> 00:31:39,896
How can you be so sure?

500
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:41,826
Dong Sik.

501
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:47,967
It wasn't you. I just know.

502
00:31:56,677 --> 00:32:00,177
I'll leave it with someone here.
Don't forget to eat it.

503
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:02,017
Take it back. You eat it.

504
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:04,886
We're done. You can let him out.

505
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:25,606
Jin Mook.

506
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,376
Don't skip your meals.

507
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,777
Make sure to eat well.

508
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:38,416
Sleep well and don't forget to take your medication.

509
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:56,536
What do you mean by that?

510
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:59,606
Why must we release Lee Dong Sik?
It hasn't been 48 hours yet.

511
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:01,606
Mr. Kang Jin Mook,
the father of the victim Kang Min Jung...

512
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:04,447
wrote this petition.

513
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:07,577
If the victim's family turned in a petition,

514
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:09,717
you should try to figure out
how to keep him here longer.

515
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,447
(Hello, dear respected police officers.)

516
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,887
"Please let Dong Sik go right now."

517
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,257
Has this person lost his mind?

518
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:20,427
He doesn't even know if his daughter is alive.

519
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:21,757
How can he ask us to release the suspect?

520
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:24,996
The thing is,
Lee Dong Sik and Kang Jin Mook are like a family.

521
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:27,496
Even so, they're not related by blood.

522
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,166
He wants the man who did that to his child to be free?
How ridiculous.

523
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,737
We can't be sure
that Lee Dong Sik is the one who did it.

524
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:36,137
And arresting him was a hasty decision.

525
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,507
Ms. Oh.

526
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,516
How could you say that as the team leader?

527
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:43,516
We can't even apply for an arrest warrant
in this situation.

528
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,316
We'll have to let him go in a few hours anyway.

529
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:47,686
I can't believe you two are saying
we should let him go just like that!

530
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:50,686
We'll let him go for now
and start the investigation all over again.

531
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:53,057
Since his photos were taken, if we release him now,

532
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:54,456
people will think that we made a mistake...

533
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:57,297
and arrested an innocent man, an officer at that.

534
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,226
If Lee Dong Sik really is guilty,

535
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:01,036
and we found that out later,

536
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:04,436
people would bash us for letting him go
before 48 hours passed!

537
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:06,066
Who will take responsibility for that?

538
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:09,277
Not even 1 minute before 48 hours.

539
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:12,577
Find anything. Do everything you can
before saying such a thing!

540
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,217
I'm practically family. It won't take long.

541
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:26,396
Please forgive my rudeness, sir.
I have something urgent to tell you.

542
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,356
- Park Jeong Je.
- You're Councilwoman Do's son.

543
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:33,237
I mean, you're Inspector Park Jeong Je...

544
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,797
from the investigation assistance team.

545
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:38,606
I should have told you this sooner,

546
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:41,376
but I had so much to think about
that I missed the right timing.

547
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:44,947
Mr. Park and Ms. Oh, you two also should hear this.

548
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:48,847
I made a big mistake.

549
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:50,816
What kind of mistake is it
to make you come all the way here?

550
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:54,316
You must release Officer Lee Dong Sik immediately.

551
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:55,956
Even you're saying that too?

552
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:58,657
Officer Lee didn't do it.

553
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:01,396
That night when Kang Min Jung went missing,

554
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:03,896
Officer Lee was with me.

555
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:05,396
What... What?

556
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:17,507
Hey, your mother...
I mean, does Councilwoman Do know...

557
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:19,916
that you did such a crazy thing?

558
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,476
I'm going to tell her.

559
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:23,586
I know you've been working only
at the central records unit.

560
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,746
Still, this is absurd!

561
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:28,887
If Kang Min Jung is found dead,
and this case remains unsolved,

562
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:30,126
you'll be held responsible...

563
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:32,027
for interfering with the initial investigation.

564
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,197
I can write up the statement in your office, right?

565
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:44,836
What do you think you're doing?

566
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:53,617
Confessing a little too late out of guilt.

567
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:58,516
I'm sorry.

568
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:00,387
I should've told you, at least.

569
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,717
But they said they found Min Jung's bloodstain,

570
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:06,186
so I thought I couldn't hear him
because I fell into a deep sleep.

571
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,996
You fell asleep in the living room of Dong Sik's house,

572
00:36:08,157 --> 00:36:10,527
but you were afraid that you didn't hear him go out.

573
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:12,226
That's why you hesitated to say anything.

574
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,197
You already said all that inside.

575
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:17,867
Do you think I asked
because I wanted to hear you say that again?

576
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,777
I get why you're upset.

577
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:21,637
That's right. I doubted Dong Sik.

578
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:24,246
But no matter how hard I think...
You know it too.

579
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:27,077
You know how the door of his house creaks really loudly.

580
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:29,416
It would have woken me up instantly.

581
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:30,816
But I,

582
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:35,316
his best friend, doubted him.

583
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:37,456
That's not my point!

584
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:38,626
What you're doing right now...

585
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:43,266
is exactly the same as what you did...

586
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,766
when Yu Yeon went missing.

587
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:50,036
How will you prove you were with Dong Sik that night?

588
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,836
Do you have a witness?

589
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:54,206
Dong Sik is my witness.

590
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:55,737
Just like back then,

591
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,547
the only witness of your statement is Lee Dong Sik.

592
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:02,146
But why didn't he say that he was with you?

593
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:05,086
He didn't say that back then too.

594
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,516
Because it's the exact same situation as back then.

595
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:11,557
He probably kept his mouth shut
so that I wouldn't get involved.

596
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,266
Come on, let's go.

597
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:20,766
I should write up the statement
so that Dong Sik can be released.

598
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,376
I apologize.

599
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:37,847
My son suddenly meddled in.

600
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,347
What's wrong, Councilwoman Do?

601
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:42,157
I'm sure your son didn't make a false statement.

602
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,887
Of course not. He would never do that.

603
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:48,356
Well, it'd have been better
if I was informed first.

604
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:52,867
I couldn't call you
because it might cause a misunderstanding.

605
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:56,367
You're right. It's been really long.

606
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,566
Chairman Lee, you haven't changed at all.

607
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:01,206
This place is pretty nice.

608
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:03,507
The halibut sashimi is chewy.
It must be wild halibut.

609
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,407
I hope you'll have as much as you want...

610
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:08,117
since you came all the way here to have a meal.

611
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:11,086
What a load of nonsense.

612
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:13,456
I'm not here for a meal.

613
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:16,117
Is anyone among us here for a meal?

614
00:38:16,257 --> 00:38:18,856
What are you saying, Chairman Lee?

615
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:19,896
Exactly.

616
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:23,467
I'm here to meet my dear friends
whom I haven't seen for a while.

617
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,396
Dear friends? As if.

618
00:38:26,996 --> 00:38:29,137
Everyone is up to something.
That's why we needed each other.

619
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,637
Gosh, Chairman Lee!

620
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,307
Goodness, let's stop being so pretentious.

621
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:38,246
You two were picking at the food
because you had no appetite either.

622
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:43,717
Let's show our cards and just get this over with.

623
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:46,987
I really need the redevelopment plan
to go through this time.

624
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:48,887
Don't you know how much I invested in it?

625
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:50,286
If it falls through again...

626
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,086
because of a murder case or whatnot,
just like 20 years ago,

627
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,527
I might go bust.

628
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:57,197
The thing is, the local residents of Munju...

629
00:38:57,197 --> 00:39:00,197
have been waiting for 20 years...

630
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:02,336
for this redevelopment plan to be carried out.

631
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:03,967
If it falls through again,

632
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,737
it could cause an uproar in the local communities.

633
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,677
The entire city could fall into the abyss.

634
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:11,106
Enough of your nonsense.

635
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:13,347
You mean the possibility of you becoming the mayor...

636
00:39:13,347 --> 00:39:14,447
will fall into the abyss.

637
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,887
- What about you, Chief Han?
- I'm not sure.

638
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:20,686
It's been quite a while since I left Munju.

639
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:22,516
So I'm not sure
how the redevelopment will do me any good.

640
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:24,327
I heard your son's number...

641
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:26,797
was found on some cloned phone.

642
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:32,327
I'm not interested in knowing,
so don't bother telling me.

643
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:34,436
If the missing persons case...

644
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:36,237
gets out of the limelight,

645
00:39:36,237 --> 00:39:39,137
then your son's involvement will be forgotten too.

646
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:42,807
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

647
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,047
I'm saying that you shouldn't worry about your promotion.

648
00:39:46,507 --> 00:39:49,476
Your only son won't leave a stain on his life either.

649
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:52,286
I'll help you sleep without worry,

650
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:54,356
so I'm asking the police...

651
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:56,856
to cooperate with the redevelopment plan.

652
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:59,996
Stop them from investigating any serial murder cases!

653
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:01,527
I'm begging you.

654
00:40:03,996 --> 00:40:05,827
The local residents are...

655
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:08,297
very much looking forward to the redevelopment.

656
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:10,436
Fervent protectors of citizens.

657
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:12,706
The highest one among them,

658
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:15,476
the future Commissioner General,

659
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:18,547
will justly answer to their wish.

660
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:20,376
Am I right?

661
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:27,516
Okay.

662
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:30,257
I'll get to work then.

663
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:33,496
Get started on Ms. K.

664
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:34,996
Chairman Lee.

665
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:37,027
What are you planning to do?

666
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,797
We should be aware of it too.

667
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:42,297
Go home and watch the news.

668
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,066
It's big enough to be on the news?

669
00:40:44,237 --> 00:40:45,666
Will it take long then?

670
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:47,277
But Lee Dong Sik will be released soon.

671
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:49,836
So what if he gets released? What can he do?

672
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:51,376
So you don't want us to be concerned?

673
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:54,016
Don't worry about those worthless ones.

674
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,246
Focus on the wild halibut.

675
00:40:56,617 --> 00:40:58,887
Chew it well, okay?

676
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,157
Go on.

677
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:21,307
- What's this?
- Drink it.

678
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:23,807
Darn it. Why didn't you get me tofu?

679
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:25,476
Who eats tofu these days?

680
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:28,117
You only spent one night in the holding cell.

681
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:30,016
My back was all sore.

682
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,847
If you were going to lie,
what took you so long?

683
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:33,717
Lie? What, me?

684
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,987
I was with you that night.

685
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:38,757
What will you do if I'm the real culprit?

686
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:42,626
Do you trust me?

687
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:47,766
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

688
00:42:01,816 --> 00:42:03,516
- Come in.
- Welcome.

689
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:04,586
Hello.

690
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:06,816
Why don't we go to Jae Yi's?
She already set the table for us.

691
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,356
Let's just eat here. Sit, sit.

692
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:11,887
Granny! Get us two bowls of seolleongtang.

693
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:13,626
Make it a double!

694
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:20,766
You crazy jerk.

695
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:23,097
Why would I serve seollongtang to you?

696
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:26,807
You jerk! Get out of here now!

697
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:31,047
Why do you keep tormenting the people of our town?

698
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,347
What ill-fated relationship must we have?

699
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:37,117
You killed a girl 20 years ago...

700
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:39,686
and ruined the redevelopment of the city.

701
00:42:39,686 --> 00:42:42,257
They want to build new apartments...

702
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,626
in the city you ruined.

703
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:45,887
Then you killed another girl?

704
00:42:46,126 --> 00:42:49,197
And why did you appear again?

705
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:53,027
Will you take responsibility
if the land value drops?

706
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:55,467
- My, he's so shameless.
- I know!

707
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:57,536
- How dare he come here?
- Exactly.

708
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:59,367
Get out. I have nothing...

709
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,777
to give to a murderer like you.

710
00:43:02,907 --> 00:43:06,816
- Get out! Get out of here!
- Granny! Stop!

711
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:09,617
- Get out! I said, get out!
- Granny, come on!

712
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:10,987
Why would you throw...

713
00:43:11,816 --> 00:43:13,816
that precious salt on a guy like me?

714
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:17,887
I'll leave, so don't throw it.
It's a waste.

715
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,396
- Get out right now!
- Stop it, will you?

716
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:21,757
Stay healthy, Granny.

717
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:27,036
We're leaving!

718
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,536
Are you okay?

719
00:43:36,777 --> 00:43:38,476
It's salty and nice.

720
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:41,246
You crazy idiot.

721
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:58,066
He's having fun?

722
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:01,336
How can he laugh?

723
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:12,027
- You're here.
- It smells so good!

724
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,008
I'll take these.

725
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:32,817
What are you doing?
We're going to have dinner. Stop it.

726
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:34,317
I'll clean up and head over.

727
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:36,087
Never mind. Give it to me.

728
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:40,928
Sit down.

729
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:43,997
Eat the tofu while watching TV.

730
00:44:57,908 --> 00:44:59,277
What's this?

731
00:45:00,178 --> 00:45:02,817
(Ms. Kang, the victim,
not a college student but a hostess)

732
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:13,598
She was famous for it since she was in high school.

733
00:45:13,598 --> 00:45:16,558
You know the girls that rich kids or celebrities call...

734
00:45:16,558 --> 00:45:18,667
when they hang out at a club.

735
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:19,868
They go to second rounds as well.

736
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:23,098
I remember seeing her
at the matriculation ceremony,

737
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:26,868
but I've never seen her on campus since then.

738
00:45:26,868 --> 00:45:28,538
Many kids said they saw her at clubs.

739
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:30,707
She has many partners too.

740
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:32,477
I heard she also worked at hostess bars.

741
00:45:32,477 --> 00:45:34,948
Why are they airing such interviews?

742
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:37,788
It wasn't pleasant
to have our school mentioned on the news.

743
00:45:37,788 --> 00:45:40,618
I didn't want to be judged
as belonging to the same group.

744
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,417
Didn't she just run away from home?

745
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:45,587
I hear she never came home.

746
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:47,828
Because this town is being redeveloped,

747
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,928
there aren't many security cameras installed.

748
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:52,027
- I'm sure she just ran away.
- That's not who Min Jung is.

749
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:54,538
What's wrong with them?
Why are they saying that?

750
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:56,538
What nonsense are they spewing?

751
00:45:56,538 --> 00:45:58,207
Do we have to just sit by...

752
00:45:58,207 --> 00:46:00,277
watching them look for a girl like her?

753
00:46:00,277 --> 00:46:02,877
On the 24th of last month,
a college student went missing.

754
00:46:02,877 --> 00:46:04,678
The police stated that...

755
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:12,888
That's just...

756
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:52,187
I'm sorry.

757
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:56,797
I'm...

758
00:46:59,627 --> 00:47:01,167
I'm so...

759
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:04,868
I'm so sorry.

760
00:47:07,238 --> 00:47:08,678
Min Jung.

761
00:47:10,977 --> 00:47:12,877
I'm so sorry.

762
00:47:15,317 --> 00:47:16,718
I'm sorry.

763
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,357
Come in, Inspector Han.

764
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:52,718
(Missing Person)

765
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:57,127
You put them up again.

766
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,468
That's not like you, Inspector Han.

767
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:12,468
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

768
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:17,377
The death of Inspector Lee Sang Yeob
that occurred three years ago.

769
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:20,377
I also heard that you're the one
who killed him...

770
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:22,218
when you were his partner.

771
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:24,288
Lee Sang Yeob?

772
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:28,488
The gun...

773
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:36,658
What are you sorry for?

774
00:48:36,658 --> 00:48:38,368
You kidnapped and killed her.

775
00:48:38,368 --> 00:48:40,397
You even cut off her 10 fingers.

776
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:43,497
Are you sorry now
that she is being ripped apart by the press?

777
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,308
Yes.

778
00:48:46,768 --> 00:48:48,138
That's the reason.

779
00:48:50,078 --> 00:48:51,777
If I said that,

780
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:55,448
it would have sounded like
I was making a confession.

781
00:48:56,147 --> 00:48:57,417
Right?

782
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:01,457
Are you recording this on your phone?

783
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:14,468
What's wrong with you, Inspector Han?

784
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:17,567
A coerced confession...

785
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,738
is null and void in court.
You must know that.

786
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:23,308
A coerced confession? What did I do?

787
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:27,718
Didn't you hear there's a security camera...

788
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:30,948
installed there when they searched this place?

789
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,988
I can just get rid of it.

790
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:38,087
You're going to manipulate it?

791
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:41,897
But the footage is being sent to my phone in real-time.

792
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:44,297
Where is my phone?

793
00:49:46,227 --> 00:49:49,437
Were you that desperate to get my confession?

794
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:51,768
Right, I get you.

795
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:54,377
There's no other way than for me to confess.

796
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:57,678
Because I have a perfect alibi now.

797
00:49:58,977 --> 00:50:00,747
Park Jeong Je.

798
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:04,118
You think that's perfect?

799
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:06,817
Of course. It was also perfect 20 years ago.

800
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:08,457
Why do you think
Lee Yu Yeon and Bang Ju Seon's cases...

801
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:09,758
remained unsolved?

802
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:11,687
There was no crucial evidence,

803
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:13,788
and when I came up with a perfect alibi,
it was over.

804
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:16,797
They couldn't prove the alibi wrong then,

805
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:18,768
and they won't be able to prove this one wrong.

806
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:23,797
That means you can never arrest me...

807
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:26,008
for the Kang Min Jung case.

808
00:50:28,078 --> 00:50:30,908
Han Jeong Im. The missing case from 10 years ago.

809
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,277
Do you think there's evidence?

810
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:34,718
She's just one of the many missing people
in this country.

811
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:36,377
Is she even a missing person?

812
00:50:36,377 --> 00:50:39,547
There are so many people
who run away from home and never return.

813
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:42,388
Oh, right.

814
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:45,428
The cloned phone!

815
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,567
Her identity can't be revealed.

816
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:59,408
Not for me, but for you, Inspector Han.

817
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:04,247
Okay! What should Inspector Han do now?

818
00:51:05,247 --> 00:51:06,747
Should he shoot me?

819
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:18,727
You've never shot anyone, have you?

820
00:51:22,198 --> 00:51:25,768
You should aim for the heart or the head.

821
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,368
It's harder than you think.

822
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:33,977
If I make it out alive,

823
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:37,008
you're going to ruin your life and your father's,

824
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:40,877
who was going to become the next Commissioner General.

825
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:48,388
Go on. Think of it as practice.

826
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:12,877
Thank you for everything, Inspector Han.

827
00:52:26,928 --> 00:52:28,527
Why do you think
Lee Yu Yeon and Bang Ju Seon's cases...

828
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:29,928
remained unsolved?

829
00:52:29,957 --> 00:52:31,727
There was no crucial evidence,

830
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:33,868
and when I came up with a perfect alibi,
it was over.

831
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:36,098
(Missing Person)

832
00:52:36,098 --> 00:52:39,038
Han Jeong Im. The missing case from 10 years ago.

833
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:41,207
Do you think there's evidence?

834
00:52:41,207 --> 00:52:43,738
She's just one of the many missing people
in this country.

835
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:45,207
Oh, right.

836
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:48,747
The cloned phone!

837
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:51,518
About the woman, the owner of the cloned phone.

838
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:55,957
That woman is a trap you set, right?

839
00:52:57,158 --> 00:53:00,158
Did she know that you pushed her...

840
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:03,098
to her death?

841
00:53:58,587 --> 00:54:00,917
Inspector Han, you're a lucky man.

842
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:04,357
Because I think you'll go back...

843
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,687
to where you belong.

844
00:54:08,527 --> 00:54:10,828
Min Jung...

845
00:54:15,238 --> 00:54:17,067
I'm so sorry.

846
00:54:29,147 --> 00:54:31,247
That means you can never arrest me...

847
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:33,388
for the Kang Min Jung case.

848
00:54:33,388 --> 00:54:34,587
You can never arrest me...

849
00:54:34,587 --> 00:54:36,218
for the Kang Min Jung case.

850
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:38,227
You can never arrest me...

851
00:54:38,227 --> 00:54:40,658
for the Kang Min Jung case.

852
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,147
(Ms. Kang, the victim,
not a college student but a hostess)

853
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:03,477
Oh Ji Hun, are you out of your mind?

854
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:08,788
Did you tip off the reporters about the arrest?

855
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:16,857
Yes, I did.

856
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:18,598
Why did you do that?

857
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:20,268
Did you want them to know Dong Sik was the suspect?

858
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:26,368
Yes.

859
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:41,658
That's what I wanted.

860
00:55:42,058 --> 00:55:44,087
Why? Why would you want that?

861
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:04,178
Are you watching the news right now?

862
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:09,018
My goodness, what on earth is Inspector Han doing?

863
00:56:09,277 --> 00:56:11,687
Are you saying there are more victims?

864
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:13,348
More victims other than the college student?

865
00:56:14,658 --> 00:56:17,587
Yes, the college student isn't the only victim.

866
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,758
Nine months ago, Foreign Affairs confirmed
that three more victims...

867
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:23,027
were killed with the same MO.

868
00:56:23,027 --> 00:56:24,727
Recently, in Munju...

869
00:56:24,727 --> 00:56:27,127
one more victim was found
and the case showed the same MO.

870
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:30,167
And there are two more victims
who are either missing or killed.

871
00:56:30,397 --> 00:56:33,038
The victims we could confirm
with their body parts...

872
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:35,238
are seven in total including the college student.

873
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:37,607
- And they're all female.
- The victims you could confirm?

874
00:56:37,707 --> 00:56:39,808
Are you saying there could be more victims?

875
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:46,187
In our country, about 60,000 adults go missing...

876
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:47,687
every year.

877
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:51,658
And every year, about 1,000 missing person cases...

878
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,857
remain unsolved until today.

879
00:56:53,187 --> 00:56:55,258
The accumulated number of unsolved cases
for the last five years...

880
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:56,828
is more than 5,000.

881
00:56:58,397 --> 00:56:59,497
And...

882
00:57:00,527 --> 00:57:02,297
we cannot rule out the possibility...

883
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,437
that there are more victims
whose body parts weren't found.

884
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:05,908
What exactly do you mean?

885
00:57:05,908 --> 00:57:07,508
More victims whose body parts weren't found?

886
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,178
Why are you talking about missing person cases?

887
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:15,977
The first case with the same MO occurred in 2000.

888
00:57:16,377 --> 00:57:19,087
The killings haven't stopped for the last 20 years.

889
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,388
It's highly possible that they're serial murder cases.

890
00:57:21,388 --> 00:57:22,457
- Serial murder cases?
- Serial murders?

891
00:57:22,457 --> 00:57:23,857
Are you sure it's been going on for 20 years?

892
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,558
Are you certain of what you've just said?

893
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:39,138
(Han Ju Won raises the possibility
of serial murders in Munju.)

894
00:57:40,977 --> 00:57:42,207
(20 years of serial murders,
7 victims confirmed, all female)

895
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:43,538
(Possibility of more victims,
Among 1,000 missing adults)

896
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:56,718
Inspector Han.

897
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:00,158
Was that a self-destruct?

898
00:58:00,488 --> 00:58:01,558
Well...

899
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:04,397
I want things to go back to normal.

900
00:58:05,127 --> 00:58:06,428
You said so yourself.

901
00:58:06,768 --> 00:58:09,768
That I'll go back to where I belong.

902
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:14,268
So here it goes.

903
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:19,948
I'm kind of in a hurry.

904
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:22,247
Do you remember what you said?

905
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:24,587
"Does it really matter..."

906
00:58:25,747 --> 00:58:27,247
Does it really matter...

907
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:30,087
who put them back?

908
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:31,928
"who put them back?"

909
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:40,868
Of course it matters. So why...

910
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:43,937
doesn't it matter to you?

911
00:58:46,138 --> 00:58:47,238
Kang Min Jung.

912
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:49,908
Lee Geum Hwa.

913
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:52,247
Yeo Chun Ok.

914
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:56,147
Wi Sun Hee, Jin Hwa Lim, and possibly Han Jeong Im.

915
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:58,247
And there are more missing persons too.

916
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:01,388
Bang Ju Seon and Lee Yu Yeon.

917
00:59:08,997 --> 00:59:10,428
Who killed them?

918
00:59:12,368 --> 00:59:17,067
Who is the person you're covering up for?

919
00:59:53,808 --> 00:59:55,138
=Beyond Evil=

920
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:59,147
Your father is cutting off his tail
to avoid getting in a mess.

921
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:01,718
He just cut his son off in a pinch.

922
01:00:01,718 --> 01:00:02,718
Father.

923
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:04,417
Unlike you.

924
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:07,817
Dong Sik, are you sure you didn't kill...

925
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:09,258
Min Jung?

926
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:15,558
The one who killed Min Jung.

927
01:00:17,098 --> 01:00:18,368
I know it's not you.

928
01:00:21,897 --> 01:00:23,067
Officer Lee.

929
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:25,868
You love to abide by the law and principle.

930
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,377
Can you throw it all away?

931
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:30,738
Your precious son, Park Jeong Je.

932
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:34,977
If I let him go, it'll be the end of him.

933
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:37,948
So tell me.

934
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:40,288
Tell me, Lee Dong Sik.
