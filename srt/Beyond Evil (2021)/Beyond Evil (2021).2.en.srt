1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,930
Come in, Delta Team.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,230
- Gosh, you scared me.
- Keep up the good work.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,060
- You can't come in here.
- All right.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,670
How did he even get in?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,270
Gosh, he scared me.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,870
Taking a shot now.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,810
Yes.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,410
- What?
- You're here.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,980
There are no security cameras
pointed in this direction.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,050
There's one in front and another one back there.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,190
But they're both old
so we don't know if they work.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,230
- What are you talking about?
- The security cameras.

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,630
There aren't enough cameras
even in residential areas in Manyang.

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,160
So of course there's none for the field of reeds.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,400
Didn't they provide 200 security cameras
for Munju last year?

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,670
Yes, most of them were installed
in the entertainment district.

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,500
There's no way they had enough for small towns.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,040
This place is up for redevelopment
so they must've thought...

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,870
it's a waste of money to install new cameras.

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,810
Why aren't they coming out?

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,240
Gosh, they're still here.
Why are they taking pictures?

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,480
- Delete those photos.
- You can't take pictures here.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,420
- I'll get going.
- All right.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,650
- See you later.
- See you.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,850
Keep up the good work.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,120
See you later.

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,890
We should find out which cars got in here.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,960
- Right.
- So contact the situation room...

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,990
and secure all the footage of the roads near here.

30
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,330
All right.

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,200
Please watch over Officer Lim.
The mud here is so slippery.

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,610
All right. Don't worry about her and go do your job.

33
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,640
Thank you.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,480
Darn it. There's so much mud.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,550
How are we going to set up the tent?

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,620
The condensation in this area is no joke.

37
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,520
Where do we begin to dig up and until where?

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,490
The road is too narrow,
so there won't be enough space.

39
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,720
But let's scoop it up.

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,890
Let's hurry up and get it done
before the morning dew.

41
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,760
Should we set it up over here?

42
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,970
- Senior Officer Lim.
- Yes, sir?

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
How long have you been with us here at KCSI?

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,170
You need to come up with a plan.

45
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,670
If we leave out a piece of thread working in a hurry,

46
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,510
then miss the culprit, will you take responsibility?

47
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,410
Inspector Ha, don't be so harsh on her.

48
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,180
Hee Mang is listening to you from inside the womb.

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,620
- Congratulations.
- Don't worry.

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,050
His nagging is like a lullaby to Hee Mang.

51
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,820
I thought the dead body was found as bones.

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,220
You'll have to come up with a plan
to scoop up everything.

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,560
Well, we did find skeletons, but...

54
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,530
Yes, sir.
The lower half of the body stuck in the mud was...

55
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,000
like this.

56
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,100
Her feet were wrapped up?

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,840
Her feet were wrapped up like this.

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,470
Is this a pervert who's obsessed with feet?

59
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,850
Dong Sik!

60
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,450
Dong Sik, tell them. It wasn't him!

61
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,320
It wasn't him! I think something has gone wrong.

62
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,520
We found conclusive evidence at the crime scene!

63
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,990
No, Dad.

64
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,830
I didn't do it. I mean it.

65
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,670
It really wasn't me!

66
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,400
It wasn't me!

67
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,990
=Beyond Evil=

68
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,530
=Episode 2: The Disappearance=

69
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,930
The statement recording room?
Not the interrogation room?

70
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,100
How can they take him
to the statement recording room?

71
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,900
How can you throw...

72
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,240
the initial witness and testifier
into the recording room?

73
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,840
No one threw him in there.

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,340
That nut case walked in there himself.

75
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,840
What?

76
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,380
Sang Bae, did you start collecting lunatics?

77
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,480
Why is that new inspector in there with them?

78
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,490
Why are you going this far?

79
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,330
Because it feels like
an officer is suspicious of me.

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,500
So I figured I would get thoroughly investigated.

81
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,970
Do you like me that much?

82
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,410
You ran a background check on me.

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,940
What background check?

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,210
Everyone knows you were a suspect in this case.

85
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,320
Everyone?

86
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,520
Like who?

87
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,090
I'm not sure if I remember.

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,930
You don't remember this.
You don't remember that.

89
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,560
Why don't you ever remember anything?

90
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,900
So about the dead body.

91
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,340
I still haven't heard an answer.

92
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,780
Wasn't that your sister, Ms. Lee Yu Yeon?

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,760
Goodness, you nut cases.

94
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,200
Do you think the recording room is your bedroom?

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,500
The team leader of the VCU
came here to question a testifier?

96
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,800
What an honour.

97
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,600
You already gave us your witness testimony.

98
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,070
Yet you decided to crawl all the way in here...

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,410
and plant yourselves in those seats.

100
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,410
You two are my initial witnesses.

101
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,510
So I should play along, shouldn't I?

102
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,050
Do you want to be here?

103
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,920
We both found the body together.

104
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,420
So I should be here with him to make things fair.

105
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
Please begin the questioning.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,600
Is it still acting up?
They won't give you a new computer?

107
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
There's no use in getting a new computer.

108
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,740
The detective doing the questioning
has to fill up the report too.

109
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,570
We need to change this frustrating process.

110
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,110
And to do that, we need to
change the minds of those stubborn judges.

111
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,820
Okay. Let me begin by checking your written statements.

112
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,790
Lee, you went into that reed field
after receiving a call...

113
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,250
from the guardian to help them find a dementia patient.

114
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,320
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,020
You got there as a backup,

116
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,260
then heard Officer Oh Ji Hun scream?

117
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,130
That's right.

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,870
Ji Hun, that little coward.

119
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,040
You preserved the scene
and reported to the situation room.

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,510
You did well.

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,140
So why are you two in here
to leave a recording of this account?

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,910
Was the body sent to the NFS?

123
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,650
When will we know the identity of the body?

124
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,120
Why do I feel like I'm here to testify?

125
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,690
Assistant Inspector Lee Dong Sik, Inspector Han Ju Won.

126
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,020
You know that substations
are only supposed to preserve the scene.

127
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,630
You two have done your job, so go home.

128
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,660
Is that all?

129
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,730
You should write up a report.

130
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,670
Yes, that's all.

131
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,400
I already have the report.

132
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,210
Right here.

133
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,580
Well, since the high and mighty
team leader of VCU says it's over...

134
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,080
What are you saying?

135
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,950
I'm done being questioned.

136
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,130
I'm not a kid. You didn't have to come for me.

137
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,730
Where's Mr. Bang?

138
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,470
We found him. He's back at home.

139
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,030
What about Ji Hun? He seemed pretty shocked.

140
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,170
I gave him a calming pill,
then laid him down at home.

141
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,340
Happy?

142
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,340
Why are you worrying about them...

143
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,610
And Inspector Han,

144
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,650
why did you let him lure you into doing this?

145
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,690
I got lured?

146
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,220
Can't you see how he's trying to play it smart?

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,520
He didn't want them to make him come and go,

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,990
so he walked into the recording room
and volunteered to get questioned.

149
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,400
If they bother him again, he's going to be like,

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,600
"I've said everything.
I won't go unless you show me a warrant."

151
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Why would they bother me?

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
Because a body was found...

153
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,140
Well, I guess bodies are found when people die.

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,610
I'm starving.

155
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,880
I wonder if the seolleongtang place
is still open for business.

156
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,280
Come along.

157
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,770
What's wrong? Is it not to your taste?

158
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't like meat broth.

159
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,070
- The broth is even thicker now.
- It is.

160
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,010
Will you clean up quickly when customers leave?

161
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,750
Hey, where have you been?

162
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,950
Look who this is.
It's you, Chief Nam.

163
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,420
Goodness, you've become even more beautiful.

164
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,660
I thought you were in Manyang.
What brings you here?

165
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,230
Are you here because of that dead body?

166
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,760
Yes.

167
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,470
I heard it's the same place from 20 years ago.

168
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Is it true it's the girl
who went missing back then?

169
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,570
You know, the girl
who was supposedly killed by her brother,

170
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,740
the son of Manyang Restaurant.

171
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,410
What was his name?

172
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,280
Yes, right. It was Dong Sik.

173
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,380
No, it wasn't him.

174
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,950
And he didn't do that back then.

175
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,120
What do you mean? The one who caught him...

176
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,090
Goodness, stop. He didn't do it.

177
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,230
May I have a refill?

178
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,930
What refill?

179
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,040
Come on, don't be so cheap.

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,840
You said Manyang Restaurant's son
was framed for what he didn't do,

181
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,310
so you gave him extra meat and broth on the house.

182
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,080
Don't you remember?

183
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,780
You're still so youthful.
You look even younger.

184
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,990
Right, I'll give you a refill.
Give me a second.

185
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,490
Darn it. I'm full. Let's go.

186
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,690
I asked for a refill.
We can't leave now.

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,700
Did you say you don't like this?

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,300
You never listen, do you?

189
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,040
Darn it, whatever.

190
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,580
Having fun?

191
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,920
You said you don't like meat broth,

192
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,580
but you decided to stick around.

193
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320
I was wondering if you were having fun watching.

194
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,890
I heard partners are...

195
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,320
supposed to be with each other around the clock,
365 days a year.

196
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,400
Goodness, that's reassuring.

197
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,160
Dong Sik, one more time.
This is what you did.

198
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,460
Then you cut off the fingers
just as you did on Bang Ju Seon.

199
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,460
This isn't Yu Yeon.

200
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,360
What?

201
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,230
Yu Yeon's nails are...

202
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,300
coloured with balsam flowers.

203
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,210
Dong Sik, pull yourself together.

204
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,280
Dong Sik!

205
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,080
Dong Sik! Where are you going? Move!

206
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,280
Mom!

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,780
- You can't take photos.
- Dong Sik!

208
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,050
You didn't do it, did you? Tell me you didn't!

209
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,630
The tangerine is small.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It must be sweet.

211
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,970
Would you like to try it?

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,480
Not like that.

213
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,790
Don't hold her hand so tightly. She's ill.

214
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,690
Dong Sik.

215
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,330
I'll do it.

216
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,540
Are you okay?

217
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,410
Last evening, at the reed field...

218
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,880
Take it easy. Have some.

219
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,980
You bought tangerines.

220
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,220
She used to love tangerines.

221
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,960
I bought them for you.

222
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,430
I'll make sure to give some to her
after she has lunch.

223
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,330
What are you doing here?

224
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,970
I don't even do this and I'm her son.

225
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,370
I'm just dropping by
on my way to do volunteer work.

226
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,800
Volunteer work, my foot.

227
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,070
Sister thinks you come here because of my mom.

228
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,510
You have a store to run.
Why do you close the store...

229
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,710
once a week for this?

230
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,750
You know I wouldn't have been able to
even start that business...

231
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,180
if it weren't for your parents.

232
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,150
I must repay their kindness.

233
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,660
It's not their kindness that started the business.

234
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,490
You worked hard for it.

235
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,530
Don't do this on your day off.

236
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,960
Take Min Jung out and eat something good.

237
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
What's wrong? Did Min Jung not come home again?

238

240
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,020

The person you have reached is not available.

243
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,630
Please leave a message after the tone.

244
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,660
Kang Min Jung.

245
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,100
When will you stop telling lies
about having to do assignments?

246
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,670
Stop it before your dad finds out and get back home.

247
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,710
If you don't want me to scour through...

248
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,070
all the clubs and bars in Hongdae and Gangnam.

249
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,550
And I told you not to touch my phone.

250
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,380
If you ever touch it again,
your fingers will be...

251
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,860
Get back home before I go nuts.

252
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,190
Lee Dong Sik?

253
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,730
Why are you bringing up that nut's name here?

254
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,470
Because the police officer
who went to the scene was Lee Dong Sik,

255
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,930
and that's where the dead body was found.

256
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,570
You don't think I know that?

257
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,340
I've worked my butt off to earn the title,
"a city free of crime".

258
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,210
Why does this have to happen now, after 20 years?

259
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,080
Why now, of all times?

260
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,210
Why does that punk have to show up
next to a dead body?

261
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,520
Maybe Officer Lee is a person who brings bad luck.

262
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,920
- I apologize.
- Get out.

263
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:10,060
(A City Free of Crime, Munju)

264
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,730
Do we know the identity of the dead body?

265
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,900
I'm just in charge of general affairs.

266
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,810
How would I know anything about a violent crimes case?

267
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,810
I'm sure the NFS processed this
as an emergency case,

268
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,850
but there are no fingerprints,

269
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,650
so it will take a while.

270
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,080
You said all the fingertips were cut off.

271
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,360
Even if all the fingers were intact,
it's just a skeleton now.

272
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,090
Does that mean the person died a long time ago?

273
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,230
I suppose...

274
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,330
the person could have died about 20 years ago?

275
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,240
A 20-year-old corpse...

276
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,150
The body of Lee Yu Yeon,
who went missing 20 years ago?

277
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,080
That's perfect.

278
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,850
Park Jeong Je.

279
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,180
Am I wrong?

280
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,420
Then it's still true
that there had not been any crimes for 20 years,

281
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,560
which means you can keep that title.

282
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,690
Right? Hooray!

283
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,570
Park Jeong Je.

284
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,470
Do you think this is the time to smirk like that?

285
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,140
You told me to just smirk and take it easy.

286
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,480
Mother.

287
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,150
I think it's less than 8 months old.

288
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,820
Did we get the results from the NFS?

289
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,650
No, we didn't.

290
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,460
Ms. Oh. You know I love shoes.

291
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,930
The victim was wearing a pair of designer shoes,

292
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,730
and they are one of
this year's fall-winter collection.

293
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,530
And they were sold out
as soon as they were released.

294
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,870
But there's a chance
that the victim is not the owner of the shoes.

295
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,530
That might be true,

296
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,240
but the size of the footprint on the shoe...

297
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,010
matches that of the estimated figure of the person.

298
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,740
If the body had been buried
for long enough to be skeletonized,

299
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,910
the shoes wouldn't be this clean.

300
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,680
You heard both her feet were wrapped
in a black plastic bag, right?

301
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,580
- Yes.
- At first, I thought that was why.

302
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,950
But check this out.

303
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,350
The inside of the bag was very clean too.

304
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,390
There isn't a single speck of dust.

305
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,390
It means before her feet were put into the bag,

306
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,320
the shoes were brushed off and cleaned.

307
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,360
That's right. The shoes were cleaned thoroughly...

308
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,230
before they were put in the bag.

309
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,530
Then they were wrapped carefully
so no dirt would get in...

310
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,470
and tied nicely with a half bow.

311
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,840
As if wrapping a precious present.

312
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,410
Whoever did this must be a complete psycho.

313
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,080
50 minutes of patrol
and 10 minutes of break time is the rule,

314
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,550
but I don't expect you to do that.

315
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,150
Let us at least go home.

316
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,990
Are you listening, Officer Lee?

317
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,660
We're almost there.

318
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,360
You shouldn't say things you can't guarantee.

319
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,260
Will we be patrolling forever then?

320
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,430
If we must, yes.

321
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,500
If there's a person we must catch,
then we must catch him.

322
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,370
If there's a person we must find,

323
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,040
we'll search the whole world
to find him if necessary.

324
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,210
You're right.

325
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,380
We must do anything we can do...

326
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,680
to catch that person.

327
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,950
It's cold.
You shouldn't be sitting here in the rain.

328
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,950
Please stand up.

329
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,820
- Please stand up.
- No!

330
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,290
Don't touch me!

331
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,960
Where did you start walking?

332
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,430
It must have been a tough journey.

333
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,140
Goodness. Look at these shoes.

334
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,820
Arm. Arm. Arm.

335
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,620
- What?
- My arm. It hurts.

336
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,260
I walked here from home.

337
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,620
I see. Where's your home?

338
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,860
Hello. I live in the basement of number 3, Munhak-dong.

339
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm 21 years old and my name is Shin Seok Gu.

340
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,830
Hello.

341
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,470
I'm 40 and my name is Lee Dong Sik.

342
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,440
Lee Dong Sik? Lee Dong Sik.

343
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,310
Is he intellectually disabled?

344
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,940
He's sitting in the rain without an umbrella.

345
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,610
He doesn't smell like alcohol,
and his shoes are messy.

346
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,250
And on his neck, he has...

347
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,450
A phone.

348
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,050
Let's get him in the car.

349
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,890
Sir, the road is wet.

350
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,360
Come on.

351
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,400
Let's ride the police car.

352
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,800
No! Police car. Police car...

353
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,770
Seok Gu.

354
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,770
You're not riding in the police car. Come on.

355
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,210
- Police car...
- We're not riding it.

356
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,580
Instead, could you let me use this for a while?

357
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,980
I'll call your mom.

358
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,880
Mom.

359
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,220
- Mom.
- Thanks.

360
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,650
Number 1 should be his guardian on speed dial.

361
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,420
Mom. Mom...

362
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,490
(Mom)

363
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,420
I won't lend you my shoes.

364
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,520
She's not answering. I'll keep calling.

365
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,620
- Right. By any chance...
- There was a store over there.

366
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,730
I'll go buy a raincoat and some hot packs.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,430
It's cold.

368
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,300
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

369
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,170
We haven't identified the body yet,

370
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,570
but I don't think it's Yu Yeon.

371
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,350
Dong Sik, did you...

372
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,020
know that?

373
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,220
I wasn't 100 percent sure.

374
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,260
So about the dead body.

375
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,790
I still haven't heard an answer.

376
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,830
Wasn't that your sister, Ms. Lee Yu Yeon?

377
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,470
It just didn't seem like her.

378
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Is he back?

379
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,070
The killer from 20 years ago?

380
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,580
Well, what do you call it?
It might be a copycat.

381
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,850
Someone may have looked up old articles.

382
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,580
You haven't seen the lower half of the body, right?

383
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,720
The MO was exactly the same,

384
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,750
including the parts
that weren't disclosed to the media.

385
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,890
It was exactly the same
as what he did to Ju Seon.

386
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,390
That makes no sense.

387
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,130
So he stayed silent for 20 years,
then began killing again?

388
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,130
What if it didn't happen after 20 years?

389
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,300
Are you saying
he could've killed more people in between?

390
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,730
Then why didn't anyone...

391
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,340
The bodies may not have been found.
Then no one would've known.

392
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,510
Then there could be more victims
among the people who are missing...

393
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,380
We don't know that yet.
It might not be the case.

394
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,720
We're investigating.
We'll find something soon.

395
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,390
The identity of the dead body.

396
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,960
First off, we need to find out who she is.

397
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,670
Did you know the body was there?

398
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,370
Is that why you volunteered to go?

399
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,080
No.

400
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,250
It's a coincidence.

401
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,550
A coincidence? You?

402
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,290
Why are you looking at me like that?

403
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,620
Some might think I killed and buried her there.

404
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,690
Are you saying I did it?

405
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,300
Well, I did something.

406
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,080
I used her as bait.

407
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,310
- Ju Won.
- I defied my superiors...

408
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,450
and wanted to carry out a sting operation all alone,

409
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,450
then used her as my bait.

410
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,650
But my bait suddenly disappeared.

411
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,620
Then I thought the sting operation might cause trouble,

412
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,500
so I killed her, cut off her fingers,

413
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,900
then wrapped her feet up nicely,

414
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,030
and buried her six feet under?

415
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,440
An exact copy of the crime...

416
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,510
which the chief of Munju Station covered up 20 years ago.

417
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,420
Why did you close the case back then?

418
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,820
20 years ago. Did you say 20 years ago?

419
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,860
- Sounds great.
- Sorry?

420
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,990
An exact copy of the crime from 20 years ago.

421
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,990
A copycat crime. I like that.

422
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,600
No matter what the NFS does,

423
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
they'll never identify this woman.

424
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,240
We can call it a copycat crime,
then push it aside as unresolved.

425
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,900
- Case closed.
- Dad.

426
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,310
Once the case is closed quickly,
they won't identify the woman.

427
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,810
Then no one would find out who the dead victim met.

428
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,550
- I just need you to keep quiet.
- Dad.

429
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,620
My son, you learn faster than anyone.

430
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,450
I'm sure you learned your lesson.

431
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,690
If you stick around without doing anything,

432
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,460
you won't face any trouble. Therefore,

433
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,190
do not do anything and just stay still.

434
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,360
The day anyone finds out who that woman is,

435
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,230
that'll be the last breath for us both.

436
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,530
This is not a request. It's an order,

437
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,800
Inspector Han Ju Won.

438
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,950
What did you say?

439
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,780
Where is the case file for Lee Yu Yeon,
Officer Lee's sister?

440
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,490
- Why do you want that?
- Do I have to explain it to you...

441
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,220
and make you understand
in order to get to the case file?

442
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,490
What do you think?

443
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,600
- Doesn't it look like you?
- What are you doing?

444
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,060
No?

445
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,100
It's not finished yet.

446
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,570
Inspector Park Jeong Je.

447
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,980
Case Number 2000-031486, column 34, row 3.

448
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,210
That's where you'll find it.

449
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,530
(Gyeonggi Munju Police Station, Victim: Lee Yu Yeon)

450
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,660
(At 6:43, October 15th, 2000, a report was made...)

451
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,330
The first victim before Lee Yu Yeon.

452
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,970
Bang Ju Seon.

453
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,450
(Gyeonggi Munju Police Station, Victim: Bang Ju Seon)

454
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,030
You couldn't find the case file?

455
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,000
It's just the front page.

456
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,530
Everything else is gone.

457
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,870
It must have gone missing back then.

458
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,810
This is kind of awkward,

459
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,350
but the station moved buildings a few times.

460
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,310
So a few of these went missing as we moved around.

461
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,120
Also, a fire broke out once,
so some files were burnt.

462
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,220
We do our best to preserve everything,

463
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,290
but some things are out of our control.

464
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,290
That's not something you should say
as an officer in charge of archives.

465
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,130
You keep saying that I'm in charge of archives.

466
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,770
It feels great to have you speak
as if I'm a somebody.

467
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,270
It's not like the entire file went missing.

468
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,870
Everything else is gone other than the title page.

469
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,670
Isn't this weird to you? Aren't you going to check?

470
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:47,010
Inspector Han, let's have a change of thought.

471
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,580
Why do you think those boxes are piled up in there?

472
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,190
I don't like solving riddles.

473
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,890
We're supposed to type those into our database,

474
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,290
then have them incinerated.

475
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,860
But those boxes are still in there.

476
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,970
They have the right to be burnt,
but they're not afforded that right.

477
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,370
Why? Because we're too busy typing in the cases...

478
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,400
that are happening now.

479
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,610
Dozens of cases in a day
adds up to thousands in a month.

480
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,340
We get waves of tens of thousands of new cases annually.

481
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,480
Then these old cases become neglected in the back room.

482
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
And this is that back room.

483
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,120
You didn't have enough time?

484
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,960
You were too busy to check on these files?

485
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,300
It's been a cold case for 20 years.
Don't you know what that means?

486
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,170
That means we don't have any evidence
to identify the killer.

487
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,940
Unless the killer comes forward now...

488
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,470
confessing what he did,

489
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,540
there's no way to resolve those cases.

490
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,240
Do you think there is a single cop out there...

491
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,150
who would put their priority on cases like those?

492
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,750
No one cares about that case. Why do you want it?

493
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,080
This is different from those cases.

494
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,120
- How so?
- Because Lee Dong Sik...

495
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,690
Inspector Lee's sister went missing in this case.

496
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,000
You're right.

497
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,100
How am I going to tell him about this?

498
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,910
(Gyeonggi Munju Police Station, Victim: Lee Yu Yeon)

499
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,850
(Officer in charge: Assistant Inspector Nam Sang Bae)

500
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,950
(Gyeonggi Munju Police Station, Victim: Bang Ju Seon)

501
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,560
(Officer in charge: Assistant Inspector Nam Sang Bae)

502
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,990
Yes, right. It was Dong Sik.

503
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,360
No, it wasn't him.

504
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,930
And he didn't do that back then.

505
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,970
What do you mean? The one who caught him...

506
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,470
Goodness, stop. He didn't do it.

507
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,580
(Nam Sang Bae)

508
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,580
- Hey, Inspector Han.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,020
What are you doing at the police station?

510
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm surprised you came straight here.

511
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,890
Were you surprised?

512
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,090
What exactly should I be surprised by?

513
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,620
You should've been surprised...

514
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,360
by the fact that I knew you were at the station.

515
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,400
I assumed Inspector Park told you.

516
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,100
You're a really bad judge of character.

517
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,200
Jeong Je isn't like that.
He knows how to hold his tongue.

518
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,770
He's not a spy or anything.

519
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,080
Didn't Dong Sik tell you
that we don't have secrets in this town?

520
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,310
"Someone is always watching from somewhere."

521
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,850
That's right.

522
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,650
In a town like this,

523
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,550
you should solve problems directly
with a frontal attack.

524
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,460
Bang Ju Seon.

525
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,960
Near the crime scene where Officer Oh, Officer Lee,

526
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,660
and I found that body a few days ago,

527
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,500
they found a woman's body 20 years ago as well, right?

528
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,440
Her name was Bang Ju Seon.

529
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,070
Lee Dong Sik was the suspect.

530
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,170
The detective in charge was Nam Sang Bae.

531
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,480
You arrested him yourself 20 years ago.

532
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,020
And now he's working under you.

533
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,490
Well, you're right.

534
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,160
We humans do not know...

535
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,420
what may happen tomorrow.

536
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,590
Right?

537
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,130
When the owner of the seolleongtang restaurant
tried to say something,

538
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,600
why did you stop her?

539
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,230
Were you that curious about it?

540
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,670
Enough to go all the way to the archives in Munju
on your day off?

541
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,570
Or have you already known about the case...

542
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,570
and asked to be transferred here?

543
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,680
I don't know why and how...

544
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,210
you became so interested in the case
to come all the way here.

545
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,410
But just stay quiet.

546
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,280
Stay quiet?

547
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,020
Do you really think I'm doing Dong Sik a favour?

548
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,450
Do you think I have a soft spot for him?

549
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,560
You think I'm stopping you from digging it up...

550
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,320
and hiding something for him, don't you?

551
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,530
But it's not true. I don't even like Dong Sik.

552
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,060
I'm sick of him.

553
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,870
I just want to throw him out if I can.

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,570
What are you doing?

555
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,770
Dong Sik...

556
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,310
is out of his mind.

557
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,350
He receives missing reports of an old man with dementia...

558
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,880
on his cell phone and runs around looking for him.

559
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,050
Even yesterday, I heard he waited for
that disabled kid's mom...

560
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,220
on the street for six hours.

561
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,220
I heard he only wore those plastic overshoes...

562
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,060
and waited in that pouring rain.

563
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,960
Even when he found a body
that could be his lost sister.

564
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,230
That's how he is.

565
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,070
What? Do you think he's like that
because he's committed to his job?

566
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,370
That's not it.

567
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,770
He's not like that at all.

568
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,210
All he wants is to resolve his deep sorrow.

569
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,280
His father said his lost daughter
could come back at any time.

570
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,750
So he waited for her every morning at the intersection.

571
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,820
He froze to death in midwinter waiting for her.

572
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,520
His sister vanished and all they had from her...

573
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,960
were her severed fingertips.

574
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,560
Honey!

575
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,260
My goodness. Honey.

576
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,750
After his mother found her dead husband,

577
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,720
she just lost her mind.

578
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,450
Dong Sik...

579
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,050
wasn't even around...

580
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,820
when all of that happened to his parents and sister.

581
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,030
Because people here never forgot he was the suspect.

582
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,660
That's why he couldn't bear to live here.

583
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,340
I've explained enough for you.

584
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,440
Inspector Han, don't pursue this.

585
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,480
They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

586
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,650
If people like us with police authority
act foolishly,

587
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,410
we could not only hurt ourselves...

588
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,620
but also hurt others.

589
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,390
And that's what I have done to him.

590
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,200
(Regional Investigation Unit)

591
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,630
So what did you find out?

592
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,260
The guys at Foreign Affairs...

593
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,330
kept their mouths shut just like this clam.

594
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,200
You called me all the way here
when you got nothing?

595
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,470
You're paying for the food.

596
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,470
You're going to pay for the food.

597
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,240
And I think you'll pay for the coffee as well.

598
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,240
Violent Crimes, Women's and Juvenile Affairs,

599
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
and even us at Regional weren't aware of anything.

600
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,750
But Foreign Affairs
must have been working on something in secret.

601
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,310
But all of a sudden, one of their elites...

602
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,150
with the biggest connection...

603
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,450
wanted to be transferred and that's your partner,
Inspector Han Ju Won.

604
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,290
He wanted to go to Gyeonggi Province, not Seoul.

605
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,620
And to a substation at that.

606
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,890
What was Foreign Affairs working on?

607
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,330
Illegal immigrants.

608
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,730
That's what they do.

609
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,670
Yes, they are. But what if it's a murder case?

610
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,300
Then Violent Crimes should be in charge.

611
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,940
But they didn't want Women's and Juvenile Affairs
to know about it.

612
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,940
So the victim is a female?

613
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,680
- Yes.
- And Regional?

614
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,680
If RIU wanted the case...

615
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,150
It means there was more than one victim.

616
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,820
An illegal immigrant who couldn't be identified.

617
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,750
And all victims were female.

618
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,050
It's a serial murder case.

619
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,370
(Victim number 6, Lee Geum Hwa, Lee Dong Sik)

620
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,040
(Lee Dong Sik)

621
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,180
Yes.

622
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,280
You punk, I told you to behave and not do anything.

623
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,450
I did behave and didn't do anything.

624
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,520
Then why is someone sniffing around?
What have you been doing?

625
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,660
- Who is it?
- Regional Investigation Unit.

626
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,430
Don't worry about it. I'm sure it's nothing.

627
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,370
Don't worry? It's nothing?

628
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,400
You little punk, when will you ever...

629
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,040
Officer Lee, former Inspector
of the Regional Investigation Unit.

630
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,650
(Lee Dong Sik, Suspect at the time)

631
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,850
He caused trouble and was kicked out of the unit,

632
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,550
but I guess he still has connections.

633
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,930
Dong Sik.

634
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
What are you doing here again?

635
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,430
Gosh, you visit here a lot these days.

636
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,900
So why are you here again?

637
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,570
I noticed the other day...

638
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,280
she's getting bedsores on her back.

639
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,580
So I had to come and check.

640
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,880
Is Min Jung at the store?

641
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,990
Did this brat not come home yet?

642
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,760
You'll wake her up.

643
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,530
(Dong Sik)

644
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,590
Dong Sik.

645
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,730
Hey, Dong Sik.

646
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,500
I called NFS.

647
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,100
But they said the victim can't be identified.

648
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,670
Yes, I know.

649
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,570
You know?

650
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,480
How would you know that?

651
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,010
You still have that informant
at the Telecom company, right?

652
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,380
The phone is off now,
but trace the location of it when it's on.

653
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,950
Is it related to the victim's identification?

654
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,920
Not really. Just trace it for me.

655
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,650
You know the regulations well enough.

656
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,720
Why are you making me break the law?
Are you crazy?

657
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,520
010-0578-4343.

658
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,990
The number belongs to Kang Min Jung.

659
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,260
What? Are you done eating?

660
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,730
I have no appetite.

661
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,170
Hey, do you think I eat
because I have an appetite?

662
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,630
Have a seat.

663
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,170
Eat some more.

664
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,440
I keep picturing it.

665
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,440
The skeleton.

666
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,550
I'm not qualified to be a police officer.

667
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,010
Everyone's the same.

668
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,350
A police officer is human too.

669
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,190
Finish your meal and go do something else.

670
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,090
Like what?

671
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,090
Well, you could go to an Internet café...

672
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,190
and play computer games with little kids.

673
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,400
Or go to a club and dance.

674
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,100
Would I be able to forget then?

675
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,640
No.

676
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,770
But it's better than doing nothing.

677
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,280
Eat up.

678
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
(Dong Sik)

679
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,760
Why did Dong Sik send me these?

680
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,030
Kang Min Jung?

681
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,870
(Dong Sik)

682
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,900
Dong Sik, what's all this?

683
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,870
What do you think? It's your job.

684
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,770
Call your trainee friends,

685
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,810
and search for the place in the photos.

686
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,920
Oh, this place?

687
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,670
Ladies and gentlemen of all ages.

688
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,010
All night long...
I mean, we appreciate your effort...

689
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,680
to dance night and day.

690
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,280
I'm Assistant Inspector Lee Dong Sik
of Manyang Substation.

691
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,750
I ask for your cooperation.

692
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,990
Kang Min Jung, come out when I'm still being nice!

693
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,090
- Who is that? Come out already.
- Who is that?

694
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,430
- Who is Kang Min Jung?
- Maybe he's looking for his girl.

695
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,870
You in the pink shirt and ripped jeans,
stop right there.

696
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,140
- It's him. What on earth?
- That's Kang Min Jung?

697
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,240
Me?

698
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,450
You see? Nothing happened.

699
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,850
What's wrong?

700
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,620
I didn't do anything bad to her.

701
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,600
What are you doing?

702
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,770
So you are saying...

703
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,510
there's nothing wrong with making a girl
whom you don't know well...

704
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,040
get really drunk?

705
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,710
So there's nothing wrong...

706
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,350
with leaving a drunk girl
where anyone can come in and take her?

707
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,550
What are you doing?

708
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,960
You didn't mess with her,

709
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,990
so it's not a crime. Is that it?

710
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,700
Mister.

711
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,600
If I get the bank statements on what you used here...

712
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,540
and the security footage of the club's entrance,

713
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,540
I can easily figure out who you are
and the vehicle you own.

714
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,510
Make sure to be really careful.

715
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,830
Hey, Oh Ji Hun.

716
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm thirsty. Get me some water.

717
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,370
Why did I even help her?

718
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,110
Hey, Big Mouth.

719
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,810
You told him that I went to a club, right?

720
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,210
I'm going to kill him.

721
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,750
Gil Gu.

722
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,860
Your belly is as big as Mount Halla.

723
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,160
Gosh, Min Jung. You should quit drinking.

724
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,030
Alcohol does more harm than good.

725
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,170
Gosh! Gosh, it stinks.

726
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,200
It's not me, you brat.

727
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,070
I only wear the same clothes three times.

728
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,110
You totally smell like a widower.

729
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Why isn't anyone shutting her mouth?

730
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,450
That's right! Come at me!

731
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,880
Hey, let go of me.

732
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,850
Let go of me while I'm being nice. Hey, you!

733
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,320
Good morning.

734
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,230
Who is this handsome man?

735
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,500
Hi, how can I help you?

736
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,600
He's an officer?

737
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,370
I see. Is he a newbie?

738
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,640
Is she drunk? Where is her guardian?

739
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,210
Did he just ignore me? I'm Kang Min Jung.

740
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,880
- I don't care if you're handsome!
- So this is what happened.

741
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,650
Office Lee went to Seoul and brought her back.

742
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,280
Get rid of her.

743
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:38,620
Hey, handsome guy.
I was going to join your table.

744
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,060
Kang Min Jung. Get to your senses!

745
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,260
Dong Sik. I didn't mean to cheat on you.

746
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,700
Shut your mouth and just sleep.

747
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,830
You won't be able to get out of here
if you don't sober up.

748
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,140
That's too harsh. Why don't you uncuff her?

749
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,510
If she runs away, will you bring her back?

750
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,150
She tried to run three times at dawn.

751
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,850
Just think of her as a wild drunkard...

752
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,220
and get ready for duty.

753
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,770
It's going to take a while
until Min Jung sobers up.

754
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
She only listens to Dong Sik.

755
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,110
Is it okay to patrol with me today?

756
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,140
It doesn't matter.

757
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,480
Who is she? Is she Officer Lee's girlfriend?

758
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,220
Dong Sik is going to blow up if he hears this.

759
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,150
You saw Jin Mook during our team dinner, right?

760
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,620
It's his daughter.

761
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,090
He went all the way to Seoul...

762
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,520
to bring back the daughter of a supermarket owner?

763
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,660
She's not just the daughter of a supermarket to Dong Sik.

764
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,300
Jin Mook was an orphan,

765
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,000
and Dong Sik's parents raised Jin Mook like a son.

766
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,500
Hold on a second.

767
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,190
That's Manyang Supermarket.

768
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,720
Dong Sik's parents helped look for a spot...

769
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,520
and signed the contract.

770
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,790
I see.

771
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,500
He shouldn't come.

772
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,810
Just a moment.

773
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,280
Jin Mook.

774
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:40,310
Hey, it's you, Ji Hun.

775
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,480
Dong Sik has to handle something,
so he's working in the office.

776
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,590
Oh, really? Okay, have a good day.

777
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,460
Why didn't you tell him about his daughter?

778
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,530
We wouldn't have gone to catch her in Seoul...

779
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,630
and put handcuffs on her
if we were going to tell him.

780
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,640
If he finds out that Min Jung went to clubs...

781
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,870
and got drunk...

782
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,340
instead of doing assignments,

783
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,910
he's going to pass out.

784
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,810
That's his job as a parent.

785
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,280
Did you see how he couldn't meet my eyes?

786
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,350
He's meek and mild.

787
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,750
And he cried every night while raising Min Jung alone.

788
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,420
Min Jung doesn't have a mother.

789
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,990
She ran away soon after giving birth to Min Jung.

790
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,860
Jin Mook can't forget her
when it's been 20 years since she ran away.

791
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,630
Jin Mook keeps the photo of her
in his wallet like a fool.

792
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,200
So Dong Sik is like Min Jung's mother...

793
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,300
and half of a father as well.

794
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,940
So you're saying even when the whole town...

795
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,110
has turned upside down because of a skeleton,

796
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,880
Dong Sik is playing the role of mother and father?

797
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,880
Because it's him.

798
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,050
Because it's Dong Sik.

799
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,280
I'm thirsty.

800
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,140
Don't tell Dad.

801
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,120
Clean up your nails and go home right away.

802
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,350
What are you doing, Officer Oh?
Aren't you going home?

803
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,730
Why is the patrol car coming in so late today?

804
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,290
We have bad news.

805
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,130
The Busan Case...

806
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,560
Hey, did you see the breaking news?

807
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,300
- Turn on the TV.
- Okay.

808
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,770
The man who was arrested
without a warrant two days ago...

809
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,340
as the suspect of a missing persons case
has been released today.

810
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,070
The police interrogated him over the possibility...

811
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,040
that he murdered the missing woman,

812
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,280
but it seems like the police have failed to find out...

813
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,810
whether the missing woman is dead or alive.

814
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,080
The police official said that the current evidence...

815
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,350
is not strong enough to request an arrest warrant.

816
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,820
They'll specify a suspect
once they gather more evidence.

817
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,190
Gosh, there's no need to watch it.
Turn it off.

818
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,760
Goodness, I feel bad for the victim who got killed.

819
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,200
We don't know for certain
if the victim is dead or alive.

820
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,700
What's wrong with you, Inspector Han?

821
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,210
They found blood in the bathroom of the victim's house.

822
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,040
We can't conclude that she's dead
just because they found blood.

823
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,310
It seems like there's only a small amount of blood too.

824
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,350
But I still think it's him.

825
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,350
They have his blood,
and he wanted to hide their affair,

826
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,680
so his motive is clear.

827
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,420
So letting him go without getting a warrant is a little...

828
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,060
What difference does it make?

829
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,490
Why are you being like this?

830
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,530
Do you think it's possible
to indict a suspect for murder...

831
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,560
where the body is missing?

832
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,760
It's impossible.

833
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,870
That's right.

834
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,700
Even if they request a warrant,
it'll get rejected.

835
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,710
You know the reasons that judges like.

836
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,710
That darned reasonable doubt...

837
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,140
- That they can't exclude.
- That they can't exclude.

838
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,680
Even so, it's wrong to not be able to punish...

839
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,780
the murderer.

840
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,820
That's what the law says.
What can we do about it?

841
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,780
Don't you agree, Inspector Han?

842
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,290
You're right.

843
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,460
It might end up as a cold case
if they can't find the body.

844
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,560
Dong Sik.

845
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,070
You should wake Min Jung up and take her home.

846
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,970
Let's wrap things up and go home.

847
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

848
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,980
I think she dropped those.

849
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,930
(Dong Sik)

850
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,430
We spent last night and all of today together.
Isn't that enough?

851
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Shut it. Where are you?

852
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,570
I told you to go straight home.

853
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,010
I did.

854
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,410
I went through so much to come in without Dad knowing...

855
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,410
You lie all the time now.

856
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,780
How would you go home without your keys?

857
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,380
Did you climb over the wall?

858
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,120
You dropped them at the substation.

859
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,890
Gosh, Dad can't find out about this.

860
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,840
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

861
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,980
Hey, you're here.

862
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,910
- Hey.
- What took you so long?

863
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,320
My gosh, you and your fatherly love.

864
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,850
Come sit here.

865
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,460
Do you have to put in so much effort
to grill the meat for your daughter?

866
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,730
If you grill it on charcoal first,

867
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,460
it tastes much better.

868
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,230
He's grilling it on charcoal too?

869
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,130
Why do you love that brat so much?

870
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,730
Come on.
Thanks to her, we're having Korean beef.

871
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,000
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

872
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,800
Jin Mook, come sit here. I'll grill it.

873
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,870
No, it's okay. Go have your meal.

874
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,180
Enjoy.

875
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,890
I'll do it. Go sit down.

876
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,130
- Give it to me.
- No, it's okay.

877
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,730
Min Jung likes the meat I grill for her.

878
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,370
You guys, just come join us.

879
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,200
We can call Min Jung here.

880
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,470
Yes, let's do that.

881
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,470
Don't.

882
00:53:55,610 --> 00:54:00,240
She stayed up for several days
to finish her assignments.

883
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,710
I'll bring it to her.

884
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,580
Will she be able to eat it?

885
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,820
She must be still hungover.

886
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,690
It seems like she drank a lot last night.

887
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,990
Watch it.

888
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,830
The meat is burning.

889
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,400
Inspector Hwang, take over.

890
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,560
Jae Yi, go and help them.

891
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,800
The mighty Yoo Jae Yi takes the mound!

892
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,200
- Give it to me.
- Here you go.

893
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,370
Now that it's settled,

894
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,310
get up, everyone. We should pay our respects.

895
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,280
Dong Sik, come join us.

896
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,490
Four days ago, within our jurisdiction,

897
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,090
a dead body was found.

898
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,960
It's an unidentified body
whose name and age we can't figure out.

899
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,030
No one knows for certain how she lived her life,

900
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,570
but one thing is for sure...

901
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,640
that in her last moment,
the police weren't there for her.

902
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,210
We must catch the culprit...

903
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,940
so that this never happens again.

904
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,320
Let's close our eyes
and pay respect to the victim.

905
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,920
May she rest in peace.

906
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,260
At ease. Raise your glasses.

907
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,870
Are you doing this for the money?

908
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,170
- No, sir!
- No, sir!

909
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,240
Are you all healthy?

910
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,300
- No, sir!
- No, sir!

911
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,470
What's there to life?

912
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,540
- Nothing, sir!
- Nothing, sir!

913
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,680
Then... Let's catch them!

914
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,640
- Let's catch them!
- Let's catch them!

915
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,870
Why are you here?
I thought you were going home.

916
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,270
Where did you go?
What took you so long?

917
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,110
You've been weird since dinner.

918
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,810
What do you mean?
I just took a lap around the house.

919
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:50,150
You ran in the middle of the night in those shoes?

920
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,620
I was going to sleep over,
but it's so cold here.

921
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,430
Let's heat up the house.

922
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,400
The boiler is broken.

923
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,870
Then you should fix it.

924
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,940
It's in the basement, right?

925
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:17,980
You can trust me with it.

926
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,540
The lights are out in the basement.

927
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,350
I don't have a flashlight,
so you won't be able to see anything.

928
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,220
Even the Yu Yeon's case files?

929
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,220
- What?
- The file is gone.

930
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,720
Even Bang Ju Seon's case file is gone.

931
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,560
Dong Sik, did you take them?

932
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,070
- Why would I?
- You can tell me everything.

933
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,070
We're friends.

934
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,200
Why would I take them?

935
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,180
Look at those.
I can't even take them down because of Mom,

936
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,680
and it's driving me crazy.

937
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,180
Of course.

938
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Of course...

939
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,250
I'm sorry.
I'm in charge of general affairs, you see.

940
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,460
I went a bit overboard.

941
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,590
It's so chilly here. I should go.

942
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,100
- Jeong Je.
- Yes?

943
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,900
What is it? Do you have something to say?

944
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,410
Get home safe.

945
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,310
Okay.

946
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,580
Hey.

947
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,390
I'm not the one who found out the files are missing.

948
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,350
Inspector Han Ju Won.

949
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,660
He found that out.

950
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,430
Goodnight then.

What are you doing here?

962
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,270
I'm getting used to the neighbourhood.

963
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,670
As you know, this is my jurisdiction.

964
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,970
As you know, it's also my jurisdiction.

965
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,680
Do you want me to give you a tour?

966
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,650
I'm good. I don't want to bother you.

967

Inspector Han, you're a lucky man.

968
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:26,490
Because I think
you'll go back to where you belong.

969
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,590
- What do you mean?
- You're out early in the morning...

970
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,030
for preparation.

971
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,700
Leave 8305 here.

972
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,900
I said I'm good.

973
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,540
Officers should work on foot.
What are you doing with your car?

974
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,910
Come along.

975
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,880
Let's take a tour of our jurisdiction
slowly and thoroughly.

976
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,850
Now, we just came all the way down from my place.

977
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:01,360
If you go straight and turn left,
you'll find our substation.

978
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,830
If you turn right and go straight,
you'll find the town hall.

979
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,500
The back alley of the town hall
leads to the hiking trail.

980
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,400
Is there an empty house near here?

981
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,670
I'm thinking about moving here.

982
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,720
But you'll be going back soon.

983
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,650
Isn't it too much to move here?

984
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,630
This place is growing on me.
So I'm going to move...

985
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,660
to a house in this neighbourhood.

986
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,870
Which part of me are you so interested in?

987
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,840
I guess it's not Lee Dong Sik,
the police officer.

988
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,820
Is it Lee Dong Sik, the suspect?

989
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,890
Then which part of me are you so interested in?

990
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,560
It seems like you're very curious about...

991
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,630
what I've been working on at Foreign Affairs.

992
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,820
Why? What is it?

993
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,600
(Chinese Restaurant)

994
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:17,430
Did he just ignore me?
I'm Kang Min Jung.

995
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,160
Min Jung...

996
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:27,360
(Manyang Supermarket)

997
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:10,110
(We'd like to thank Lee Do Hyun
for his special appearance.)

998
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,890
=Beyond Evil=

999
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,460
The suspect appeared again after 20 years...

1000
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,130
and committed a crime using the same MO.

1001
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,600
What's more interesting is...

1002
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,270
that the man who was the suspect 20 years ago...

1003
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,870
recently moved back to this neighbourhood.

1004
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,400
Don't get involved this time.

1005
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,340
Don't listen to anything
and don't look at anything.

1006
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,540
Why do you not want me to be here so badly?

1007
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:49,610
Jeong Je, you don't think
Dong Sik is the killer, do you?

1008
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,180
What are you going to do now?
What are you going to do?

1009
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,450
I'm going to get you.
I'll make sure of it.
