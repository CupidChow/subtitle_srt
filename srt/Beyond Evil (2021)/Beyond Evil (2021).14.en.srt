(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:18,321
I'll...

4
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,950
stay out of trouble,
so please let it go this time.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,420
How many times do I have to let it go?

6
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,661
Do you know what happened to me?

7
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,601
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,201
So please don't lock me up.

9
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,840
Ju Won is only seven years old.

10
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,010
He needs a mother, right?

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,211
Have you ever...

12
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,851
been a mother to him?

13
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:51,181
In Ju Won's life,

14
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,050
you're nothing but a burden to him.

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,590
I'll be better from now on.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,131
I'll stop drinking,
and I'll never try something like this.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,660
Trying it isn't the problem.

18
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,160
The problem is that you fail every time.

19
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:13,541
Get out of my sight.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,981
I want a divorce.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,781
Just let me go
before I suffer to death!

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,380
My family can't support you anymore.

23
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,151
Commissioner General?

24
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,520
How can you hold on to me
for such a thing?

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,591
Such a thing?

26
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,291
I even married you
when you were married to another man...

27
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,490
for such a thing.

28
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,800
For such a thing...

29
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,300
I had a child with you.

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,430
And for such a thing,

31
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,270
I'm helping Oh Il Construction,
your father's darn company.

32
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,410
How long do I have to live with a bomb like you?

33
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:54,111
My life has to be perfection itself.

34
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,921
Just stay put quietly...

35
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,720
in the loony bin until you die.

36
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:06,621
Just let me take Ju Won with me.

37
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,830
Mom.

38
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,330
If I leave him here,
will you let me go?

39
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:32,180
- Yes, sir.
- Ju Won.

40
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,481
I'll open the door.

41
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,750
Mom and Dad aren't fighting.
Come here.

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,460
Ju Won, come to Mommy.

43
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:40,161
Ju Won.

44
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,560
Come and hold me.

45
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,530
Ju Won, come here.

46
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,430
Ju Won!

47
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,240
Take her and leave.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Honey, please!

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Ju Won! Come and grab me!

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,981
Please come and hold me!

51
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,641
Ju Won!

52
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,351
Ju Won!

53
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,120
Ju Won, don't worry.

54
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,030
Our lives will...

55
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,131
become perfect now.

62
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,620
Hey, you can't just barge in here.
Leave the room now.

63
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,261
I'm Officer Lee Dong Sik
from Seoul General Investigation Unit.

64
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,761
What are you doing?

65
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,330
Can't you see
we're in the middle of a hearing?

66
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,231
This is a hearing for the Commissioner General!

67
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,231
Is there a time and a place
to administer justice?

68
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,000
Is that so,
Nominee for Commissioner General Han Gi Hwan?

69
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,210
(Confirmation Hearing
for Commissioner General Nominee)

70
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,911
Release my officer
in the middle of administering justice.

71
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,721
What is the matter, Officer Lee Dong Sik?

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,291
I'm here to arrest someone without a warrant, sir.

73
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,430
What?

74
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,640
Inspector Han Ju Won.

75
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:37,841
You are...

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,250
under arrest for misconduct of your authority...

77
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,211
and abetting Lee Geum Hwa's murder.

78
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,550
What is he talking about?

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,591
Who did what? What's going on?

80
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,760
You have the right to remain silent

81
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,861
and consult an attorney.

82
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,560
You will get a chance to present your case,

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,630
and you have the right
to seek a writ of habeas corpus.

84
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,300
You remember Lee Geum Hwa, don't you?

85
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,680
What are you doing?

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,541
What do you think?

87
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,550
You should be punished
if you committed a crime,

88
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,820
Inspector Han Ju Won.

89
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,231
What did you just say?

90
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,401
I asked you to arrest me without a warrant...

91
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,731
during the hearing tomorrow.

92
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,070
Under what charge?

93
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,740
For misconduct of my authority
and abetting Lee Geum Hwa's murder.

94
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,740
You're now a part
of the General Investigation Unit...

95
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,281
at the Seoul Police Agency,

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,541
so it's possible.

97
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:50,450
Why should I put on a show like that?

98
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,750
You already threw a bait at that jackal,
Im Gyu Seok.

99
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:57,320
My father, Mr. Han Gi Hwan,

100
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,591
is a man who seeks perfection.

101
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,990
He waited all his life for this hearing.

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,731
There's a high chance
he'll put up an iron wall.

103
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,541
You'll throw yourself at the iron wall
to attack him?

104
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,271
The word sacrifice has no place in his life.

105
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,481
He probably thinks
I'm just like him as his son.

106
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,950
He won't expect this.

107
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,250
If he can't expect this,
he won't be able to protect himself.

108
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,250
Arrest me.

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,591
If you get arrested
in front of cameras without a warrant,

110
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,690
a suspension won't be the end of your punishment.

111
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,260
Your life might be ruined for good.

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
Are you worried about me, Inspector Lee?

113
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,070
Are you insane?
Why would I worry about you?

114
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:50,971
Remain silent.

115
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,911
Don't admit to your charges.

116
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,281
It's not that I like you.

117
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,851
It just looks like
we have many more things to do.

118
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,390
If you don't promise to do that,
I'm not going to arrest you.

119
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,661
Do you understand?

120
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,060
Okay.

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,911
I'm Inspector Lee Dong Sik
of General Investigation Unit, Seoul.

122
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,640
I will begin the investigation.

123
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,010
Inspector Han Ju Won,

124
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,380
do you admit to your charges...

125
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,390
of abusing your authority and abetting the murder...

126
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,560
of Ms. Lee Geum Hwa?

127
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,401
So you're going to plead the Fifth?

128
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,570
Okay.

129
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,401
Last November 12, right in this investigation room,

130
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:58,211
you made a confession yourself,
and we have that on paper.

131
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,851
"I made a victim
because I made my own judgement..."

132
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,820
"and forced a sting operation."

133
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,760
The record says you clearly made a confession...

134
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,890
You're right. It's true.

135
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:19,331
I forced a sting operation...

136
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,930
and made a victim.

137
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,630
The victim's name is Lee Geum Hwa.

138
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,440
I wasn't punished properly
during the last investigation.

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,870
The case was closed with just three months of leave.

140
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,341
Please punish me
according to Article 123 of the Criminal Code.

141
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:33,611
Inspector Han. Wait.

142
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,181
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,681
I'm admitting to my charges.

144
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,760
This isn't what you promised.

145
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,660
What promise?

146
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,861
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

147
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,500
Man.

148
00:08:57,731 --> 00:09:00,370
- One second.
- Unlike someone,

149
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,670
there's no need for me
to go back to where I used to belong.

150
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,941
That other person didn't turn himself in...

151
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,410
and broke our promise.

152
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:14,081
Why should I keep the promise?

153
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:18,051
I will...

154
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,691
get punished.

155
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:32,670
You idiot!

156
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,370
You just joined our unit,
and you're out doing things on your own?

157
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,611
Who gave you the permission
to barge into the hearing?

158
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,780
If you punished me properly last time,

159
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:43,211
I wouldn't have been arrested
during the hearing.

160
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,451
Inspector Han, are you out of your mind?

161
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,920
My mind is very clear.

162
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,120
Tell me my punishment.
I'll accept anything.

163
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,461
Inspector Han, there really is no need.

164
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,890
I already wrapped up this case...

165
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,361
Let's punish him.
He wants to be punished that badly.

166
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:01,770
Since you admitted to what you did,
he won't have to be confined.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,841
You're suspended until a disciplinary committee is held.

168
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,971
Okay?

169
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:11,270
How dare you suspend him?

170
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,880
Lee Dong Sik, you really are a nut case.

171
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,910
(Han Ju Won, Korean National Police Agency)

172
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,581
I accept the punishment.

173
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,851
If you get suspended now,

174
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,150
Chief Superintendent Han will...

175
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,461
What are you up to?

176
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:08,231
How dare you let Ju Won in
during the hearing?

177
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,640
I'm sorry.
I didn't know Ju Won would get arrested.

178
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,770
Who do you think you are
to pull something like this?

179
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,770
What are you and Ju Won up to?

180
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,270
There's nothing going on.

181
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,111
If I had an ulterior motive,
I wouldn't have told you...

182
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,880
about that article.

183
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,051
I helped you stop that article
from getting published.

184
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,920
Did you honestly think I didn't know about that?

185
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,990
My Intel already had that information.

186
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,591
You took Ju Won's side,

187
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,660
then brought that information
as if it's something huge,

188
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,691
only to turn my eyes in order to betray me?

189
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:36,130
I'm falsely blamed.

190
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,861
And I didn't hear about that article from Ju Won.

191
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:42,071
He only wanted to be there
to see you get through the hearing.

192
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,000
He wanted to be there as your support.

193
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,740
I'm sure he meant that.

194
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
He meant that?

195
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,311
What do you know about him?

196
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,750
You don't know a thing about him.

197
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,851
Even if you were born again a hundred times,

198
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,750
he'd still have all of you
in the palm of his hand.

199
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:08,961
I'm only a guy born from a family
in the fruit wholesale trade.

200
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,101
So are you trying to say...

201
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,701
I'm not even to be compared with your son?

202
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,101
If that's what you're trying to say...

203
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:27,841
- Prosecutor Kwon.
- It doesn't matter...

204
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,181
if he's your son or not.

205
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,051
Because he even has you in the palm of his hand.

206
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:38,620
I work for the Prosecutors' Office,
not for the Police Agency.

207
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,030
How long do I have to show loyalty to you...

208
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,201
to earn your trust?

209
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,030
You're aiming too high.

210
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:53,140
Because there's only one person my father trusts.

211
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,140
And that's himself.

212
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,370
Han Ju Won, you little brat!

213
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,681
Do not yell at me.

214
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,311
I should be yelling at you.

215
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,780
Because of that crazy man...

216
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:07,721
whom you liked so much to offer a job
at the Seoul Police Agency,

217
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,821
I'm in big trouble now.

218
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:11,821
What?

219
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,691
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,931
I didn't want you to be in trouble.

221
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,630
Are you sure
you didn't know about the arrest?

222
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,971
How are you here right now?
You were under arrest.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,071
Yes, I was.

224
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,441
I admitted the charge.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,211
So I got suspended.

226
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,471
You got what?

227
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,780
- You admitted the charge?
- I don't want to live like you.

228
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,851
You stupid boy.

229
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:38,311
I'm stupid because I'm like you.

230
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,620
Maybe because I'm your flesh and blood.

231
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:44,420
Get out of my house.

232
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,461
Father.

233
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,691
If you tell me everything,

234
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:53,130
I will listen to you.

235
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know...

236
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,040
why I'm doing this.

237
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,640
But I can tell you...

238
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,851
that I will listen to you.

239
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:10,851
Prosecutor Kwon.

240
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,290
Get him out of my sight.

242
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,250
I've been telling you...

243
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,461
not to cause any trouble.

244
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,660
Get out of my sight.

245
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,630
It seems like you two are family.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,040
Let's go, Ju Won.

247
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,311
I'll leave.

248
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,420
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,420
Father.

250
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,760
I never thought this day will come.

251
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,460
I'm surprised the councilwoman's son asked to see me.

252
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,940
I know. I've heard you've been wanting to see me...

253
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,840
so that you can put me
in a mental institute again.

254
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Like you did in 2000.

255
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,410
This guy is completely crazy.

256
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,220
I guess you remember things now...

257
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,350
since you wanted to see me at this location.

258
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,920
So are you okay now?

259
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,160
Because you were a mess back then.

260
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,930
This is interesting.

261
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,670
This is really interesting.

262
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,390
This is a mess.

263
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,700
If I'm not okay,

264
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,200
what will you do?

265
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,500
There's nothing I can do about it.

266
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,140
You're someone else's problem.

267
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,070
I guess your mother has to take care of it.

268
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,110
Isn't that right, Councilwoman Do?

269
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,090
They've both gone crazy.

270
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,690
Councilwoman Do, what a surprise.

271
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,190
Are you that surprised?

272
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,990
Actually, I'm not.

273
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,860
Well, I hate surprises.

274
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,170
But this is unpleasant.

275
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,040
I thought only you would be here
but you brought your mother.

276
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,380
So I thought you were a scared little boy.

277
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,380
But did you just grab me?

278
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
So you should've...

279
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,950
answered my calls.

280
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,050
You haven't either.

281
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,020
You answer my calls...

282
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,290
only when you need me. So what?

283
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,490
Didn't you avoid her calls...

284
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,960
because you were too busy
seeing Chief Superintendent Han?

285
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
What have you been doing...

286
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,170
with Chief Superintendent Han behind my back?

287
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,340
I'm disappointed you have a secret from me.

288
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,110
I haven't been doing anything with him.

289
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,410
Does it have anything to do with Kang Jin Mook?

290
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,980
Did you and Chief Superintendent Han...

291
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,350
kill Kang Jin Mook?

292
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,380
Is that it?

293
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,990
What are you going to do if we did?

294
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,890
Will you report it to the police?

295
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,290
Then you will be in trouble too.

296
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,490
Not to mention your son.

297
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,460
Oh, the Munju redevelopment project...

298
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,970
you've been working so hard on
will be terminated too.

299
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,200
- Chairman Lee.
- Yes, Councilwoman Do.

300
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,770
October 15, 2000.

301
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,710
Early in the morning.

302
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,680
Why are you talking about that day?

303
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,740
Because it suddenly popped into my head.

304
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,450
Because I think I helped some people clean up their mess.

305
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,150
Haven't you heard of carrying one's gratitude
beyond the grave?

306
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,520
If you're a human being,
you should repay another's kindness.

307
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,690
What...

308
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,860
But you didn't do anything to help us that day.

309
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,190
Because while you were moving my car
to another location,

310
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,090
Yu Yeon disappeared.

311
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,550
Kang Jin Mook took Yu Yeon's body...

312
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,150
and buried her in the basement wall
of Dong Sik's house.

313
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,260
You knew you'd be in trouble
if she found out you didn't do your job.

314
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,130
So you helped Kang Jin Mook commit suicide.

315
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,280
(Death Certificate Postmortem Examination Certificate)

316
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,580
But...

317
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,520
how did you get the surveillance camera
at the holding cell...

318
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,090
to stop recording that night?

319
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,930
I really can't see how you could've done it.

320
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,230
That means you had someone helping you
inside the police force.

321
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,270
Wait a minute.

322
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,800
There's something I really can't figure out too.

323
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,240
Councilwoman Do.

324
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,080
Are you that desperate to find out?

325
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,380
Enough to use your son to call me out?

326
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,520
Well, here's what I think.

327
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,850
I think I deserve to know
if there's a secret between us.

328
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,660
- Hey, stop!
- Let go!

329
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,260
What are you doing? Hey!

330
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,300
(Lee Dong Sik)

331
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,900
Hey, Park Jeong Je.

332
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,570
I'm sorry, Mother.

333
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,240
Hello? Lee Dong Sik?

334
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,680
Hello, Lee Chang Jin.

335
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,460
Hello? Lee Dong Sik?

336
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,970
Hello, Lee Chang Jin.

337
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,670
Of course.

338
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,610
Who else would want to know about
what happened that day?

339
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,380
Come on. That's not true.

340
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
That's not the only thing I want to know.

341
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Nam Sang Bae.

342
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,550
I want to know about my chief too.

343
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,420
Who was Nam Sang Bae?

344
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,590
I can't remember things well these days.

345
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,890
You're a smart man.
How could you not remember it?

346
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,600
You have a big head too.

347
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,330
Do you use what's in your big head
only for bad purposes?

348
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,270
Good purposes and bad purposes.

349
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,770
Who decides what's good and bad?

350
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,170
Does the law decide it?

351
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,110
Well, the councilwoman's son is a criminal,

352
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,580
so he doesn't have the right, I guess.

353
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,050
Is the councilwoman to judge it?

354
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,220
- Jeong Je, let's go.
- You're not going anywhere!

355
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,560
Hey, Lee Dong Sik.
Why don't you judge it?

356
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
Get out of the car, you punk.

357
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,930
You came all the way here,
so stop toying with your phone.

358
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,460
Well, I would love to go,

359
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,770
but I'm on a different team now.

360
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,240
Today, Oh Ji Hwa is the one to judge.

361
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,640
Oh Ji Hwa?

362
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,050
Is this a school reunion or what?

363
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,360
We'll talk further back in the station.

364
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Are you telling me to go to a police station?

365
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,160
Seriously, ma'am?

366
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,570
Jeong Je, let's just call it for today.

367
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,770
- Wait.
- Park Jeong Je!

368
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,740
You can't do this.

369
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,540
Mr. Lee, I really didn't know.
You should leave now.

370
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,580
Park Jeong Je! This is just not right.

371
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,780
We're supposed to have a quiet talk alone here.

372
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,520
Well, the body is already discarded.

373
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,050
I will let it slide this time,

374
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,730
but Councilwoman Do,
you should be careful next time.

375
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,900
I have heard something.

376
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,430
Your precious little secret...

377
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,570
somebody would take to his grave.

378
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,180
What's the secret?

379
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,350
I said, what is it?

380
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,590
If everyone knows about it,
it's not a secret anymore.

381
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,220
I should keep it a secret
because he worked so hard for it.

382
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,790
Right, ma'am?

383
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,530
My love, Ji Hwa.

384
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,830
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

385
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,740
I missed you too.

386
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,370
I'll take the car.

387
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,610
I want you to put it
in front of the police station.

388
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,110
- Let's go.
- You punk.

389
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,410
- Bring the car.
- Okay.

390
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,290
- Hey, are you all right?
- What?

391
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,450
Yes.

392
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,360
I appreciate your hard work.

393
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,060
Ma'am, thank you for your cooperation.

394
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,260
Cooperation? Cooperation?

395
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,300
Hey! This is illegal!

396
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,870
I'm going to file an official complaint!

397
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,700
Oh Ji Hwa! You and your minions...

398
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,940
will all be all put behind bars!

399
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,560
Mom, what was it?

400
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,970
- What?
- What's that secret?

401
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,010
There's no secret, son.

402
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,710
- Mom.
- So from now on,

403
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,650
don't you ever do anything like this again.

404
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,030
(JL Construction Chairman Lee Chang Jin)

405
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,440
(Police Agency Chief Superintendent Han)

406
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,860
Where are you? I need to talk to you.

407
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,400
I'll see you at Munju Station's parking lot
next to the back door.

408
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,670
Munju Station's parking lot next to the back door?

409
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,550
What are you doing here?

410
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,750
It looks heavy. Let me help you.

411
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,350
No.

412
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,620
I thought you'd be in jail now.

413
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,230
I guess your father did you a favour...

414
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,260
even though you sabotaged his hearing.

415
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,830
My father did?

416
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,900
You don't have a loving relationship with your father,

417
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,320
and your mother didn't look for you.

418
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
You remember it.

419
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,290
I guess privileged boys
can have a sad history too.

420
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,400
Don't tell me about it though.

421
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,600
I don't want...

422
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,300
to concern about others' pain too.

423
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,610
You're concerned because you heard it?

424
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,840
Why?

425
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,780
That's what people are like.

426
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,350
We see each other, eat together,

427
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,050
and when we get used to it,
we keep thinking about each other,

428
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,460
remember what the other said,
and concern about it.

429
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,300
Never mind.

430
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,000
What is it? What brings you here?

431
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,870
- I want to ask you a favour.
- Me?

432
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,440
But whatever it is,

433
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,910
I don't want you to concern about it.

434
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,180
I will take all the responsibility...

435
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,310
for what this favour will cause.

436
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,620
- What's the favour?
- Are you...

437
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,520
a good driver?

438
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,570
Honey, I told you I would do it.

439
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,470
This is illegal.

440
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,970
Mr. Kang Do Su.

441
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,070
Right now, I'm not your wife.
I'm a cop.

442
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,450
And I want to show my Hee Mang
that I'm a capable cop.

443
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,980
It's illegal,

444
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,520
so I'm not going to agree with
submitting this as evidence.

445
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,420
You won't need to.

446
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,190
- What?
- Because there's nothing.

447
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,190
Where's Officer Im?

448
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,330
This place is clean too.

449
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,330
This is why he willingly gave us the key.

450
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,300
- I appreciate your work. Thanks.
- Thank you.

451
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,940
Honey, well done.

452
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,380
- Isn't this Lee Chang Jin's car?
- Oh, Inspector Han.

453
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,810
We should start the investigation.
Get back to the station.

454
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,910
Yes, sir.

455
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,090
Are you starting an investigation
into Lee Chang Jin?

456
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,130
You can't have the warrant yet.
This is illegal again.

457
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,900
Gosh, stop saying that, all right?

458
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,800
Don't you regret it?

459
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,070
Regret what?

460
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,310
That you didn't arrest Kang Jin Mook straight away...

461
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,210
and discarded Kang Min Jung's fingers.

462
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:31,380
Wouldn't regretting be a luxury for me?

463
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,360
I think the question is wrong.

464
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,160
You want to ask me

465
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,030
if I would do the same
if I could go back in time, right?

466
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,400
Would you...

467
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,200
do the same?

468
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,810
Yes.

469
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,870
I would.

470
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,280
Inspector Lee.

471
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,550
Do you know how wolves hunt rabbits?

472
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,890
Rabbits?

473
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,690
When wolves hunt rabbits,

474
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,360
they each have their own roles.

475
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,490
Those who lure, chase,

476
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,660
and watch.

477
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,130
When one wolf lures the rabbit,

478
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,970
the chaser chases after it
until it gets caught.

479
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,500
And there's another wolf
that watches everything from a hill.

480
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,970
If anything unexpected happens,

481
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,610
that wolf needs to get involved.

482
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,280
It can never take its eyes off the rabbit...

483
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,280
in order to drive it to a corner.

484
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,450
A rabbit?

485
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,380
Who's the rabbit?

486
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,390
Whom are you trying to corner?

487

("The Development of Munju
Catches up With Ilam-Dong")

488
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm sorry.

489
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,130
I came late due to traffic.

490
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,900
How interesting.
I'm sure you took the same route.

491
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,770
Right, Ji Hwa?

492
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,810
I'm Inspector Oh Ji Hwa,
and I'm only here to observe.

493
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,950
I will neither be questioning nor answering you.

494
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,420
You called me so many times.

495
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,050
But you want me to talk to him?

496
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,490
I'm Officer Kang Do Su,
and I'll be investigating you today.

497
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,020
- Mr. Lee Chang Jin.
- I have something to confess first.

498
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,220
About what happened at the reed field.

499
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,360
The conversation I had
with Councilwoman Do and her son...

500
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,970
regarding Chief Superintendent Han
and Kang Jin Mook.

501
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,510
It seems like Inspector Lee overheard everything
via cell phone.

502
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,010
Anyway...

503
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,340
about all that...

504
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,910
You're saying it's all false?

505
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,410
What?

506
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,250
We listened to the recording.

507
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,050
Senior Inspector Park did all the talking.

508
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,790
You said something like,
"What if it was the case?"

509
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,490
You were hypothetical.

510
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,000
It wasn't a confession,
which means it's false.

511
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,500
So I get it.
You're not the one we're interested in.

512
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,040
Mr. Lee, you're smart.

513
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,340
So try to remember this one.

514
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,710
You know Oh Il Construction, right?

515
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,110
"Oh Il Construction"?

516
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,920
Yes, I know.

517
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,120
How?

518
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,520
It's hard not to know
if you're in the construction business...

519
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,790
considering the size of that firm.

520
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,620
You have a point.

521
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,590
Then do you know
Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan?

522
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,860
"Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan"?

523
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,860
Do you know him?

524
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,900
Yes, I do.

525
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,500
He got nominated
to be the next Commissioner General.

526
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,340
But I'm not sure if that will happen
after the mess his son caused...

527
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,610
at the hearing today.

528
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,970
Do you know him on a personal level?

529
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,940
Your license plate number is 3786, right?

530
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,880
We checked
the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency entry log.

531
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,020
And it turns out you visited him
last year on November 5.

532
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,090
Are you going to tell us that it was your car,

533
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,650
but it wasn't you who visited?

534
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,820
Oh, gosh.
I pretty much told him what to say.

535
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,830
I'm sorry, ma'am.

536
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,460
Ji Hwa, you know I don't play dirty like that.

537
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,100
Yes, I did visit him,
and I do know him on a personal level.

538
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,670
The reason I visited him that day...

539
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,640
You don't need to tell us why.

540
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,870
- What?
- We don't need to know why.

541
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,240
I never asked, so you don't need to tell me.

542
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,910
Just a second.

543
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,180
Let me write the case report.

544
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
Ji Hwa, is he okay?

545
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,850
Sorry.

546
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,420
I still type pretty slow.

547
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,960
Dong Sik, what are you doing here?

548
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,990
I thought you got transferred
to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

549
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,260
Long time no see, sir.

550
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,670
Who's he?

551
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,670
Is he Ji Hwa's ex-husband?

552
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,070
What are they doing with him?

553
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,370
They didn't even report this to the section chief!

554
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,280
October 15, 2000.

555
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,510
You were in charge of Lee Yu Yeon's case, right?

556
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,550
That's what they're investigating right now

557
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,330
Dong Sik.

558
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,730
Do you trust me?

559
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,430
Like you just mentioned,
I was in charge of that case.

560
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,300
Do you still trust me?

561
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,670
Should I?

562
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,810
I don't care.

563
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,210
Does he have anything to do
with Sang Bae's death?

564
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,750
Probably.

565
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,350
I think so.

566
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,920
And they didn't even call me?

567
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,820
They have no respect for their boss.

568
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,860
Dong Sik, consider yourself lucky.

569
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,430
Watch carefully.

570
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,130
I'll tell you whether or not he's lying...

571
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,600
based on the stuff that Sang Bae has taught me.

572
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,540
I'll look forward to it.

573
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,910
I'll continue with the interrogation.

574
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,340
You know Oh Il Construction, right?

575
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,210
"Oh Il Construction"?

576
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,210
I already told you earlier that I do.

577
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,780
How do you know that firm?

578
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,190
I told you that everyone
who's in the construction business knows...

579
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,760
Wait a minute.

580
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,160
Now I get why you asked about Chief Superintendent Han.

581
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,530
Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan's in-laws
own Oh Il Construction.

582
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,370
So are you asking me if that's how...

583
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,670
I got to know the chief superintendent...

584
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,610
on a personal level?

585
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,510
Yes.

586
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,880
You must not have a very good memory.

587
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,920
("The Development of Munju
Catches up With Ilam-Dong")

588
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,650
Back in 2000, when Munju City
was planning to be developed,

589
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,490
Jin Li Construction,
which you were the owner of, was in charge,

590
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,760
and you were working with Do Hae Won,

591
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,860
the chairwoman of Gwanghyo Foundation.

592
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,760
And you guys were choosing
which firm to give the project to.

593
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,360
If you read the article here,

594
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,730
one of the firms that bid
to take part in the project...

595
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,200
was Oh Il Construction.

596
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,970
Congratulations.

597
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,640
Now that Jin Li Construction
is in charge of the project,

598
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,140
you're going to make a lot of money.

599
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,480
And Do Hae Won, the chairwoman
of Gwanghyo Foundation will...

600
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,250
use this opportunity to enter the political world.

601
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,650
Yes, thank you.

602
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,920
But I guess the real hero was...

603
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,360
Superintendent Han
who let us get rid of the landowners...

604
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,860
who were holding out against the development.

605
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,200
- So let me pour you a drink.
- No, thanks. If you'll excuse me.

606
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,070
They say the bidding war for the contractor is...

607
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,970
like burying their heads in the sand.

608
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,710
But what if Jin Li Construction doesn't choose...

609
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,580
your in-law's company, Oh Il Construction?

610
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,920
You said you don't want any money.

611
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,650
But you wanted me to pick your in-law's company.

612
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,660
Okay. This means we are in the same boat now.

613
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,560
But you're too proud
to have a drink with a gangster, right?

614
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,130
Oh Il Construction, Councilwoman Do,
and Chief Superintendent Han?

615
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,600
What's this all about?

616
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,740
It means they've known each other for 21 years.

617
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,440
But why is that a problem?

618
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,810
Exactly.

619
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,010
So what if they're acquainted?

620
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,510
That's not the problem.

621
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,310
The problem is what they exchanged with each other.

622
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,380
Back then, I assume the development of Munju City...

623
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,290
was very important to you.

624
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,590
And according to your ex-wife, Oh Ji Hwa...

625
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,030
I'll go ahead and testify once again.

626
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,260
This is what you said every time you got drunk.

627
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,770
"I lost tons of money
because Munju City never got developed."

628
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,300
"Those with power,
who wanted to develop the city,"

629
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,200
"used me to their advantage and sucked me dry."

630
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,770
"I did all the dirty work."

631
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,110
"But they didn't give me anything in return."

632
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,880
That's what he frequently said.

633
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,350
I remember it very clearly.

634
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,720
Why don't you tell us...

635
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,820
what kind of dirty work you did...

636
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,020
for those so-called people with power.

637
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,230
Ji Hwa, your memory is very good.

638
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,300
I do remember saying something like that.

639
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,240
But I'm sorry, Ji Hwa.

640
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,170
I only said that...

641
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,370
to impress you.

642
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,740
I was head over heels for you.

643
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,850
So I lied.

644
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,010
You lied?

645
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,420
Like she just testified,

646
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,690
the development went down the drain.

647
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,750
So I never got used.

648
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,420
You all know...

649
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,260
that the development never happened...

650
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,360
because people died and went missing.

651
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

652
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,100
That jerk won't ever tell the truth.

653
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,010
Superintendent Jung will be here soon.

654
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,840
Inspector Han went to tell him everything.

655
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,950
Inspector Han was the one
who told me about this too.

656
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,790
What do you think you guys are doing?

657
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,620
Let him go right now!

658
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh Ji Hwa. Kang Do Su.
Have you lost your minds?

659
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,670
He followed my orders.

660
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,010
Ji Hwa, you're amazing.

661
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,840
You're protective of your subordinates.

662
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,780
My goodness, Mr. Lee.

663
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,180
I'm sorry about this.

664
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,250
It's okay.

665
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,190
But that might not have been the case
if you got here too late.

666
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,630
Please forgive them for my sake.

667
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,790
Come on.

668
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,470
I guess I can do that.

669
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,680
Sir, at least let us finish investigating him.

670
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,510
What are you talking about?
You have no reason to do this.

671
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,630
Did you run over
in case your father's name gets mentioned?

672
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,900
You also must've been worried
the hearing may go wrong.

673
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,970
Blood is always thicker than water.

674
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,640
(Meeting Room)

675
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,440
Inspector Han, are you the source?

676
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,880
Yes, what's illegal is illegal.

677
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,050
Inspector Han, we're a team.

678
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,510
A team?

679
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,150
Inspector Lee Dong Sik
of General Investigation Unit, Seoul,

680
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,620
have we ever worked as a team?

681
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,190
I guess not.

682
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,330
No.

683
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,440
You didn't have to see me out this far.

684
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,010
- Thank you for your help today.
- I'm only doing this...

685
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,540
because I also have a reason.

686
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,850
(November 10, Munju Police Station Jail, CCTV)

687
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,480
What?

688
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,790
I'll make a call soon.

689
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,530
Make sure you pick up.

690
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,510
(Unknown: October 15, 2000, 1 hour later)

691
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,650
"October 15, 2000, 1 hour later"?

692
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,820
People say
criminals always return to their crime scenes.

693
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,520
Why do they want to go back
to where they caused trouble?

694
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm sorry. I ran a little late
because of the traffic.

695
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,510
Take my car and drive it back to my place.

696
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,840
Yes, sir.

697
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,970
"One hour later."

698
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,170
One hour.

699
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,310
Darn it, those persistent jerks.

700
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,310
I can't even call them.

701
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,350
(Restricted Number)

702
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,420
Speak of the devil.

703
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,690
Please tell your son I said thanks,

704
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,660
Chief Superintendent Han.

705
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,860
So Ju Won got you out?

706
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,730
What did you say to him
to get him back into his right mind?

707
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm not sure
if he's really in his right mind.

708
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,730
Okay. So he's not?

709
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,170
Then is your son following me to find you,
Chief Superintendent?

710
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,210
Do you have a tail?

711
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,910
I think it's Ji Hwa.
Don't worry about that.

712
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,610
Let me know if you're going to be late.

713
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,780
An hour.

714
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,280
No, to be exact,
I'll see you in 48 minutes.

715
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,720
I'll see you there.

716
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,320
Darn it.

717
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,130
Whoa, that idiot!

718
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,900
Lee Chang Jin is the president
when it comes to illegal acts.

719
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,840
Ji Hwa, you've become a pretty decent driver.

720
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,480
Hold tightly, Ji Hwa.

721
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,220
Yes?

722
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,130
Sir, about the car number 23M 9113
you wanted to look up.

723
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,100
- Yes?
- It belongs to one of our staff.

724
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,230
Who?

725
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,000
Seoul Police Agency, General Investigation Unit,

726
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,370
Inspector Lee Dong Sik.

727
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,740
Thank you.

728
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,310
Where are you going, Mr. Han?

729
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,470
Goodbye, Ji Hwa.

730
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,700
- Darn it.
- Darn it. That crazy man.

731
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,910
I'll call Jae Yi.

732
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,550
Leave her alone. She can do it.

733
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,780
Hello, DUI checkpoint.

734
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,970
Something doesn't feel right.

735
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
Hello, DUI checkpoint.

736
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,780
Yes, thank you.

737
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,090
One second. Does this car belong to you?

738
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,220
What?

739
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,890
May I see the vehicle registration
and your driver's license?

740
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,700
This was way too petty.

741
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,030
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

742
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,340
Yes, I let Ms. Yoo borrow my car.

743
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,570
Yes.

744
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,200
That was very cheap of him
as a chief superintendent.

745
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:33,450
It means there's something
they must discuss in person.

746
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,610
Man.

747
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,550
What should we do?

748
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,260
Inspector Han.

749
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,160
What more do you need me to do?

750
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,070
Ms. Yoo will go after him in my place.

751
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,530
You and Ms. Oh can...

752
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,240
tail Lee Chang Jin.

753
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,380
No, just pretend you're chasing him
like it's a real situation.

754
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
What happens after I chase him
like it's a real situation?

755
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,950
I'll be expecting Han Gi Hwan there.

756
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,240
Where?

757
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,490
I'll have to wait until then to know for sure.

758
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,610
All by yourself?

759
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,180
But I'll make sure I call you.

760
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,860
In that case,

761
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,840
- make sure...
- I promise.

762
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,070
I'll be in contact.

763
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,550
And now I wait...

764
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,090
for Han Ju Won.

765
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,200
Leave your phone there and get in my car.

766
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,630
Interesting.

767
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,450
Very interesting.

768
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,700
Do you really want to come back here?

769
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
Why does everyone want to meet here?

770
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,740
If you got caught here tonight,

771
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,160
there's no place that's safer.

772
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,610
They won't think to come back here?

773
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,820
Okay. Give me your phone.

774
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,700
Do you think I'm going to record something?

775
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,320
We're in the same boat now,

776
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,760
so it doesn't really matter,

777
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,030
but it felt awful to be backstabbed.

778
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,530
I received something.

779
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,070
The CCTV footage of the holding cell.

780
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,220
My gosh.

781
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,390
The one who sent me there,

782
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,430
and the one
who ordered me to kill Kang Jin Mook.

783
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,950
It was all you, you jerk.

784
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,140
If you tell me everything,
I will listen to you.

785
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,110
I don't know...

786
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,320
why I'm doing this.

787
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,090
But I can tell you...

788
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,280
that I will listen to you.

789
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,360
Prosecutor Kwon.

790
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:14,990
Get him out of my sight.

791
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,630
After all that,

792
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,430
you're trying to backstab me?

793
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,070
That was something
Superintendent Jung did on his own.

794
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,970
I know that fool won't do anything
unless you tell him to.

795
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:05,570
Why do you think
I took Superintendent Jung into my care?

796
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,140
Because you were blackmailed.

797
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,220
Because that jerk blackmailed you
with the CCTV footage.

798
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,910
There was a reason for everything.

799
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,990
That Jung...

800
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:19,390
no wonder he got me out so forcefully today.

801
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,360
That jerk.

802
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,430
We need to get rid of him, no matter what.

803
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,200
But how?

804
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,260
I'm sure you'll take care of it, as always.

805
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,430
Superintendent Jung has rats everywhere.

806
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,410
He's not like Nam Sang Bae.

807
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,840
Do you really think
he'll show up at a car junkyard alone from a text?

808
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,780
He won't show up
knowing he'll die like Nam Sang Bae.

809
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,720
I feel lonely to leave without you

810
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,780
(Let's meet at the Munju Junkyard. Now.)

811
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,890
I feel so lonely

812
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,970
Don't cry

813
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,240
If I hadn't surprised him from behind,

814
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,340
he would've shot me dead.

815
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,140
That has nothing to do with me.

816
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,930
You don't want to know the details?

817
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,450
Why not? Because you're police?

818
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:15,910
You're no ordinary police officer anymore now.

819
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,340
You're the Commissioner General now.

820
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,860
Let's take care of this properly.

821
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,160
The way we always do.

822
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,760
Earlier, the Violent Crimes Unit
from the Munju Police Station...

823
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,970
were asking about Oh Il Construction.

824
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,260
Oh Il Construction?

825
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,140
Please prepare properly at the front gate.

826
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,240
I need this construction
to go through no matter what.

827
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,910
I'll trust you, Commissioner General,

828
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,700
and give this work my best.

829
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,570
- Get out now.
- Your answer?

830
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,140
All right.
I'm telling you to get out now.

831
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,990
And from now on,

832
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,890
don't ignore my calls.

833
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,550
Don't pick up any of Councilwoman Do's calls.

834
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,530
Why would Do Hae Won call me?

835
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,860
That woman and her son...

836
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,110
were suspicious about Kang Jin Mook's death.

837
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,840
They asked if we were working together...

838
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,880
behind her back.

839
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,450
Of course,
if you think it's fine to tell her, go ahead.

840
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,360
I don't know what I would tell her.

841
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,180
If you're talking about the reason
we made Kang Jin Mook die,

842
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,030
or the reason we sealed his lips...

843
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,530
Say it.

844
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,700
I don't remember what it was.

845
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,340
No.

846
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,450
Say it.

847
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,610
You really don't remember...

848
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:05,320
that very interesting story I heard
from Kang Jin Mook...

849
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,320
on that day?

850
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,820
On October 15, 2000,

851
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,570
he was here that day, at dawn.

852
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,640
He saw everything.

853
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:22,300
- Do you know me?
- Jin Li Construction.

854
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,300
The owner of the deer farm.

855
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,140
You were there that night.

856
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,070
The night Yu Yeon died.

857
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,160
You were watching?

858
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,130
Yes.

859
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,110
He saw me?

860
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,070
Did that man...

861
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,510
really see me?

862
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,010
Did Kang Jin Mook...

863
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,160
see me cause the accident?

864
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,030
You're saying he saw me...

865
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,700
hit Lee Yu Yeon?

866
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,220
(12:05am, February 27, Saturday)

867
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:34,970
You haven't...

868
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,950
responded yet.

869
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:27,820
=Beyond Evil=

870
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,800
What if Inspector Han finds out about all this?

871
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,470
Then will you kill your son too?

872
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:36,260
You all seem to
keep a lot of secrets from each other.

873
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,240
You should turn yourself in right now.

874
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,300
Do you still hear the deer crying?

875
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,180
Dad, I hope you really become the Commissioner General.

876
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,780
You darn punk!

877
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,240
You just wait.

878
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,590
I'll catch him no matter what.

879
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,090
I got one!

880
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,260
Do you even know what it is
that he didn't know?

881
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,320
Stop putting on a show.

882
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,360
Quietly alone?

883
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:04,050
What?

884
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,470
What is Han Ju Won doing?

885
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,260
Han Ju Won is here, isn't he?
