1
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:03,725
Move aside. Move.

2
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:06,065
You can't do that around here.

3
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,765
Please, I need you to move.

4
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:13,434
- What's going on here?
- What is it?

5
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:16,035
- Will you please leave for now?
- Please go.

6
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,544
Well, it was all there.

7
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:25,415
Everything was there just as I had organized it.

8
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:28,915
- Everything was all there.
- Jin Mook.

9
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:33,154
But Min Jung is gone now.

10
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:37,194
Where could she be?

11
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:39,925
Jin Mook, we need to go.

12
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:42,334
You have to leave for now.

13
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:51,444
What about my Min Jung? Min Jung...

14
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:52,974
Please find her.

15
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,985
Excuse me, please move aside.

16
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,185
Darn it.

17
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,894
You've reached Manyang Substation.

18
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,864
I'm Reporter Im Gi Seok with JSB.

19
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,965
I'm calling regarding the fingers
that were found early today.

20
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:19,804
Have you identified the victim?

21
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,705
According to our information,
they belong to a young woman...

22
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:24,274
at the age of 21...

23
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:26,304
who lives in the same building, Manyang Supermarket.
Is that right?

24
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:29,315
If you cannot give me an answer,
just give me yes or no.

25
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,565
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

26
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:02,375
(Mother)

27
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,615
(Mother, Missed Call)

28
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,484
You idiot. Why aren't you picking up?

29
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,924
Was it really the daughter of the supermarket?

30
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:18,164
Is the case really similar to the one
from 20 years ago?

31
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:37,585
I'm Inspector Oh Ji Hwa of VCU Team One,
Manyang Station.

32
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:41,555
Please be at the police station
by 3pm as a testifier.

33
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:27,865
(Victim 6, Lee Geum Hwa, October 19, 2020)

34

(Victim 7, Kang Min Jung)

35
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:42,474
(The suspect at that time: Lee Dong Sik)

36
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,315
So Dong Sik is like Min Jung's mother...

37
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,484
and half of a father as well.

38
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:49,815
Min Jung...

39
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:21,885
Dong Sik, one more time.
This is what you did.

40
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:25,255
Then you cut off the fingers
just as you did on Bang Ju Seon.

43
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:07,994
What did you just say?

44
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:09,595
I asked you to leave.

45
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,535
It'll only take a second.

46
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:16,275
- What's that?
- Jeong Je.

47
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:18,604
We're friends, aren't we?

48
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,005
You can stay out of this one.

49
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,075
Don't listen to anything or look at anything...

50
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:28,085
today, right now. Okay?

51
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,655
Just say that you weren't here.

52
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,124
Hey, Dong Sik.

53
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:38,794
Get out of here. Now.

54
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:57,244
Dong Sik, by this one,

55
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:00,015
do you mean Min Jung?

56
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:08,255
Did you do that to her?

57
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,835
What did I do?

58
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:24,905
- Did you do that to Min Jung...
- Did I do what to her?

59
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,345
Did I kill her?

60
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,744
Have you arrived? I'm waiting for you.

61
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:04,645
I'm in the statement recording room in the basement.

62
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,994
If anyone just heard us speak...

63
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:23,494
- So what if someone heard us?
- What?

64
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:25,635
Who cares if anyone heard me?

65
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,465
Someone seeing you is the problem.

66
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:30,705
Then what's the dire reason
I shouldn't be seen here now?

67
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:34,575
And that. What is that, Dong Sik?

68
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:44,155
You're here too, right?
Come to the statement recording room.

69
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:46,155
"You're here too"?

70
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:04,744
The statement recording room.

71
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:10,044
If you wanted my statement,

72
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:12,585
why didn't you call me
to the huge office for the VCU?

73
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,145
She's considerate, that's all.

74
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:17,454
Detectives are only human,

75
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:20,355
and she knows how people will look at you right now.

76
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,194
How will they look at me?

77
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,625
Are you all right?

78
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:32,834
I can't believe I asked
if you were all right.

79
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,235
Did you find anything?

80
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:40,775
What about the KCSI?

81
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:44,145
Is there anyone in this area
who doesn't buy things from that market?

82
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,245
Any footprints or DNAs they find...

83
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,954
can't be used as evidence.

84
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,255
What about on the fingers?

85
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,824
The NFS is on it, so it'll take a few days.

86
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,424
They'll need to find something,

87
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:55,924
but they won't.

88
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:58,664
Everything was clean during Yu Yeon's case too.

89
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:03,934
But if you end up finding something,
please let me know.

90
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,934
What are you two doing?

91
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:13,444
Inspector Oh, shouldn't you be excluded
from the investigation?

92
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:14,975
What are you talking about?

93
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:17,214
You should be questioning him
if you brought him as a testifier.

94
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:20,015
But you're telling him about the incident.
And that's not all.

95
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:23,454
The detective in charge was acquainted with the victim,

96
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,694
and everyone in this town was sort of a family.

97
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,725
The detective cannot let feelings
interfere with the investigation.

98
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:33,025
Why not?

99
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,365
- "Why not"?
- Why can't detectives...

100
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,204
investigate their cases emotionally?

101
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:41,375
What's so bad about...

102
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,804
having close relationships as if we're a family?

103
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,814
I want to catch and lock up the jerk
who did that to someone I love.

104
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:52,714
So why not?

105
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,855
Because the situation dwindled down
to something like this.

106
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:01,395
And what exactly is this situation?

107
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,750
You know what I mean. Why do you even ask?

108
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,990
A situation where I brief about the case...

109
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,790
to the suspect from 20 years ago.

110
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,160
Or is it...

111
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,830
a ridiculous situation where we are giving...

112
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,930
the information about the investigation...

113
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,470
to the suspect?

114
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,670
We will begin recording
the interrogation of the testifier.

115
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,370
Observer, please come in.

116
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,480
I'll be observing this interrogation
and I'm Detective Kang Do Su.

117
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,050
And I'm the detective in charge, Oh Ji Hwa.

118
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,190
Both of you rejected the one-on-one investigation...

119
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,990
and chose to be investigated together.
Is that correct?

120
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,460
Let me ask you a question,

122
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,760
Detective Lee Dong Sik.

123
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,330
Did you lure or kidnap the victim, Kang Min Jung,

124
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,930
then disfigure and dispose of her body?

125
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,930
No.

126
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,040
On the 23rd, between 7pm,
when Ms. Kang left Manyang Substation,

127
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,740
and at 12:13am the next day,
when the part of her body was found,

128
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,040
did you see or meet the victim?

129
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,180
No.

130
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,680
Do you know anyone
or have any evidence to prove it?

131
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,720
No, I don't have any.

132
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,950
Right. At the butcher shop.

133
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,720
What time was it?

134
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,630
- Tell me about it. What a waste!
- I know!

135
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,860
No, we're not going to karaoke.

136
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,130
You should go home.

137
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,870
- Oh, my.
- I'm okay!

138
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,470
- Have a safe trip home.
- See you tomorrow.

139
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,870
- You are betrayers.
- Bye.

140
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,380
11pm.

141
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,650
It means I have nothing to prove my alibi after 11pm.

142
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,180
Because I just went home and went to bed.

143
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,850
(The person to prove his alibi was with him
until 11pm at a butcher...)

144
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,050
The person who can prove his alibi before 11pm is...

145
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,550
the detective in charge?

146
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,490
Do you not like me?

147
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,530
We have other detectives too if you want.

148
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,930
You said you were all like family.

149
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,430
Are they one of them?

150
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,200
It's the victim's father and a cop
who are like family.

151
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,440
Are you saying they are not reliable?

152
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,110
It's a reasonable suspicion.

153
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm also a cop and a detective.

154
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,210
Inspector Han Ju Won,
who is a cop and a detective.

155
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,880
I would like to hear that reasonable suspicion of yours.

156
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,690
Two crimes with the same MO happened 20 years apart.

157
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,190
The MO has never been publicly disclosed,

158
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,990
so there's almost no chance
that the second one was imitated.

159
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,400
You think they were done by the same person.

160
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,760
That's why you said that earlier, right?

161
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,000
You said nothing was found from Lee Yu Yeon's case,

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
so you will find nothing this time either.

163
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,470
Do you agree that both crimes
were committed by the same person?

164
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,970
The culprit of an incident
from 20 years ago showed up again...

165
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,410
and committed another crime,
using the same MO.

166
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,780
And you know what's interesting?

167
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,920
The suspect from 20 years ago...

168
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,450
recently moved to this village again
and is now living there.

169
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,390
And that person even happens to be...

170
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,220
the testifier of the two incidents
that happened recently.

171
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,860
He's the first person to have found the victims.

172
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,870
What do you think, Inspector Oh?

173
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,170
Does it sound odd to you too?

174
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,040
Or does it sound like...

175
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,740
just a coincidence?

176
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,680
Actually, I don't care.

177
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,550
I'm not sure
if you're just dull or even a detective.

178
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,990
Not a detective?

179
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,820
I request you to change the investigator.

180
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,960
I will cooperate after that.

181
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,990
Inspector Han, sit down.

182
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,540
- Move.
- You can't leave just yet.

183
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,110
- I said I won't cooperate...
- Cooperate, my foot.

184
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,810
Han Ju Won's alibi.

185
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,680
- Pardon?
- I'm not the only one...

186
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,320
who suddenly showed up here recently.

187
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,420
Dong Sik.

188
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,320
What?

189
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,290
You think Inspector Han wouldn't kill a person?

190
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,660
Does that thing called reasonable suspicion...

191
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,430
apply only to me?

192
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,730
You can't be serious.

193
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,830
20 years ago, I was only 7.

194
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,870
So?

195
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,970
Are you saying a 7-year-old boy
kidnapped and killed 2 women?

196
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,940
That might not be possible,

197
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,810
but right now,
you're a healthy 27-year-old young man.

198
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,810
You agreed earlier
that these were done by the same person...

199
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,920
I don't remember saying that.

200
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,050
The culprit's MO has never been publicly disclosed.

201
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,320
It has indeed never been publicly disclosed.

202
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,920
But you know what?

203
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,660
You said earlier...

204
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,090
that you were a cop and a detective.

205
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,630
That means...

206
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,230
Han Ju Won is not an outsider.

207
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,570
You are an insider
who has the access to the case reports...

208
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,870
anytime you want.

209
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,570
There is no data whatsoever left in the archives.

210
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,580
Is that so? Are you sure?

211
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,980
How do you know that?

212
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,050
Dong Sik, enough.

213
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,590
I mean, Ji Hwa,

214
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,290
just think about it.

215
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,690
The case was from 20 years ago.

216
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,460
Why would anyone care
if its case report went missing?

217
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,530
Only the one who took it would.

218
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,930
You're not going to say you found it elsewhere...

219
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,710
and that's how you know
it wasn't in the archives, are you?

220
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,510
I mean, it just sounds like an excuse.

221
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,820
Are you saying someone imitated the initial crime...

222
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
and that copycat...

223
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,220
is me?

224
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,550
And that person even happens to be the testifier...

225
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,620
of the two incidents that happened recently.

226
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,190
He's the first person to have found the victims.

227
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,830
What a nut. I like him.

228
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,110
He would have made a decent detective.
What a shame.

229
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,610
I wouldn't be so happy if I were you.

230
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,750
That decent detective...

231
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,850
is saying that I'm the culprit.

232
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,950
You wished I would just be quiet
and stay out of trouble,

233
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,420
but I guess it's too late now.

234
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,090
Are you saying
you're going to do something about it?

235
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,360
I can't just watch them make me a copycat.

236
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,370
Well, I remember what you said the other time.

237
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,270
A copycat crime. I like that.

238
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,010
No matter what the NFS does,

239
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,140
they'll never identify this woman.

240
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,340
We can call it a copycat crime,
then push it aside as unresolved.

241
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,880
"Han Ju Won is the copycat."

242
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,950
Should we conclude it like that?

243
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,320
Are you worried that might actually be the case?

244
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,830
Should I conclude it like that?

245
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,360
Han Ju Won.

246
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,730
You pretend you're all rational and sensible,

247
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
but you're more emotional and reckless than anyone.

248
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,270
Can't you see that nut is actually...

249
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,110
a hundred times more rational than you?

250
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,880
If you continue acting like that,
you'll never get to catch that punk.

251
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,120
So are you telling me not to do anything?

252
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,620
What was your alibi?

253
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,020
I'm sure you said something believable.

254
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
Of course, I did.

255
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,290
I don't have any.

256
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
Not at all?

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,800
I left work at 7pm sharp
and headed straight back home.

258
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,830
- And the next day...
- Next day.

259
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,010
In the early morning where no one was outside,

260
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,040
you were in front of my house.

261
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,480
And my house was not so far away...

262
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,710
from the crime scene
where the fingers were found.

263
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,850
You crazy...

264
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,890
Han Ju Won.

265
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,860
What are you thinking?

266
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,260
I want you to help me get the security footage.

267
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,700
Security footage?

268
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,630
Did you leave your apartment building that night?

269
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,230
Not the security cameras at my apartment building.

270
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,400
I want you to get me the footage...

271
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,770
from the security cameras that were set up in...

272
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,540
the hallway in front of
and inside Munju Police Station's archives.

273
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,180
- What for?
- Isn't it obvious?

274
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,750
I'm going to catch that nut you like...

275
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,080
in a rational and sensible way.

276
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,460
Let's spread out.

277
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,960
I get that you barely have anything to do in the archives.

278
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,990
But what's a detective of VCU doing here...

279
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,130
when an incident broke out?

280
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,130
I went to see Jin Mook.

281
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,340
He asked if you were all right despite his situation.

282
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,710
How is he...

283
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,440
doing?

284
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,780
What do you think?

285
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,880
Grab a seat.

286
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,920
Jae Yi said she threw in leftover meat to make this...

287
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,620
since you and Jin Mook probably haven't eaten.

288
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,560
She said that,
but I'm sure she threw in some sirloin in here.

289
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,530
- Come.
- I'll eat it later.

290
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,530
I might sound too cold-hearted
if I say this right now,

291
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,570
but the living has to go on.

292
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,570
The living.

293
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,140
Then what about Min Jung?

294
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,880
Is she dead?

295
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,250
Is she, Dong Sik?

296
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,320
Ji Hwa, do you think Yu Yeon is alive?

297
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,530
What?

298
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,890
It must've been last year.

299
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,830
I saw someone who looks like her at a café.

300
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,740
A freshman in college, probably.
She looked like she was around 20.

301
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,470
She was working part-time at that café.

302
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,740
She looked so much like her
that I was really shocked.

303
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,510
Do you know what I did?

304
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,380
I looked at her fingers.

305
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,750
If she is Yu Yeon,
she'd have to be missing the tips.

306
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,220
I know, man. She couldn't be 20.

307
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,060
She'd be 40 years old by now.

308
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,270
What if I ran into...

309
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,170
the 40-year-old Yu Yeon,

310
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,340
but didn't recognize her?

311
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,040
I worry about that very often.

312
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,810
But then I wonder, why should I worry?

313
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,280
Of course, I'd recognize her.
I'd recognize her right away.

314
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,320
It's not like there are many women out there
without fingertips.

315
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,620
But...

316
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,120
Ji Hwa, over the last 20 years,

317
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,630
was there really no one
who said they've seen Yu Yeon,

318
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,460
a girl without her fingertips?

319
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,740
It means she's dead.

320
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,770
Yu Yeon is dead.

321
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,350
- Isn't that so?
- Is that why you asked me that?

322
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,750
Did you find anything?

323
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,090
Those were your first words. Not,
"Are you looking for her?"

324
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,520
No. And of all people, this was Min Jung.

325
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,220
It's not like we found her body.

326
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,760
Because it's obvious that you'd be looking for her.

327
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,330
Doesn't he know the procedures
in tracking anyone who's missing?

328
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,830
He was sure...

329
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,470
that Min Jung was already dead.

330
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,240
Yes, she's dead.

331
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,740
And you won't find her body either.

332
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,680
Why not?

333
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,250
He doesn't want to give it back.

334
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,420
That jerk does not have any intention...

335
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,190
of giving her body back.

336
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,590
Dong Sik knows who the culprit is, right?

337
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,360
He says he doesn't.

338
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,860
Everyone must be insane.

339
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,670
Dong Sik is out of his mind.
He has no idea what he's saying.

340
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,670
No, he doesn't even know
what he's doing right now.

341
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,970
He's out of his mind,
and he doesn't know what he's doing?

342
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,910
Jeong Je.

343
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,650
You don't think he did it, do you?

344
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,850
Come on, Ji Hwa.

345
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,690
You were suspicious too.

346
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,860
You asked him how he was sure
that Min Jung was already dead.

347
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,800
Yes, I was suspicious. I'm a detective.

348
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,130
I'm a detective too.

349
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,060
What do you say as his friend?

350
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,270
Do you think he did it?

351
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,140
What are you doing?

352
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,510
Are you interrogating me right now?

353
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,870
I'm just curious.

354
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,440
I've always been curious over the last 20 years.

355
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,980
Twenty years ago,

356
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,980
when I wasn't a detective,

357
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,220
I was never suspicious of him, not even once.

358
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,550
Not even as he was arrested...

359
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,790
and was shunned by everyone
who called him the culprit.

360
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,790
Because my friend Dong Sik wouldn't do that.

361
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,290
And I still feel the same way now.

362
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,030
My friend, Dong Sik, isn't a guy who'd do that.

363
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,530
What about you, Jeong Je?

364
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,340
I feel the same way too.

365
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,040
- Do you?
- Yes.

366
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,340
Then why did you do that 20 years ago?

367
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,950
- Do what?
- Why...

368
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,320
didn't you go right away?

369
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Ji Hwa.

370
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,120
I feel the same way.

371
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,300
Twenty years ago and even now, as Dong Sik's friend,

372
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,570
I didn't, and don't think he is the culprit.

373
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,610
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

374
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,750
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

375
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,990
I've never seen this detective.

376
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,890
I already told you last time.

377
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,140
This is a recent picture of him...

378
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,410
in plain clothes.

379
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,350
Let's see. No idea. Haven't seen him.

380
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,560
If he ever shows up as a customer
for your massage session,

381
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,660
type number one and text it to me.

382
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,530
I'll be there right away.

383
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,030
I installed a location tracking app on this phone.

384
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,300
Unbelievable.

385
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,640
What's with you, Detective?

386
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,480
Are you going to keep me
under your watch around the clock?

387
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,410
You can track my location once I text you, okay?

388
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I need to get a warrant from the judge to do that.

389
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,560
Ms. Lee, you are currently an illegal alien.

390
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,860
Are you sure I can report your name to the court?

391
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,070
Darn it.

392
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,870
Gray? This is so tacky.
I like the colour pink better.

393
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,710
I'll just text you the number one, okay?

394
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,350
(On the day of Lee Geum Hwa's disappearance)

395
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:59,990
(Hey, Detective.)

396
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,430
(H, I'm...)

397
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,870
(Hey, Detective. H, I'm...)

398
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,260
- Hey, be careful.
- Why is it so slippery?

399
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,630
- Did you find anything?
- No.

400
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,770
How can she disappear completely?

401
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,970
I'll stay here. You should leave.

402
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,210
You won't see anything once it gets fogged.

403
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,040
Don't stay up all night. Leave around 9pm.

404
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,180
Yes, sir.

405
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,210
My goodness.

406
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,020
Hey, what's that? Go find out! Hey, Ji Hwa!

407
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,000
(Mr. Han Ju Won, you've got new mail.)

408
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,880
(No title, attached files)

409
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,700
(Archives)

410
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,850
Do you have a problem with the security camera?

411
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,480
Why else would you...

412
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,320
stare at the camera from early in the morning?

413
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,160
Open the door to the archives.

414
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
Were you waiting for me?

415
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,030
But why?

416
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,800
Why would you wait for me?

417
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,100
- Please just open the door.
- All right.

418
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,780
What are you doing?

419
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,880
Lee Yu Yeon's case file is back.

420
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,620
Did Lee Dong Sik bring it back?

421
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,920
Or did you put it back?

422
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,930
Actually, I found it in another file box.

423
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,030
So I guess I put it back after I found it.

424
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,970
Did you also find Bang Ju Seon's case file?

425
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,650
That's right. I found that too.

426
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,550
I guess we're lucky to have found them.

427
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
Why didn't I think of that?

428
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,330
How did I miss it?

429
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,770
An accomplice. Lee Dong Sik and Park Jeong Je.

430
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,210
Are you his accomplice?

431
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,050
They'll consider you as his accomplice.

432
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,280
I'm not.

433
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,220
I was with him that night.

434
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,090
We had a drink until the next morning.

435
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,920
I'm telling you the truth. Please believe me.

436
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,790
We even conducted a spot inspection.

437
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,230
You can't do this now.

438
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,860
How can I trust you?

439
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,300
How will you prove
you were with Dong Sik that night?

440
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,140
Do you have a witness?

441
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,410
Dong Sik is my witness.

442
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,880
He's not the guy.

443
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,580
I really was with him that night.

444
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,010
You little brat.

445
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,850
I'm sorry.

446
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,650
I'm really sorry. It's my fault. I'm sorry.

447
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,480
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

448
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,350
Why would you want to take time off?

449
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,360
I want to get some rest.

450
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,820
Doing what?

451
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,230
Whatever I want to.

452
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,170
Don't. Just come to work.

453
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,570
Everyone gave up their vacation
to go out looking for Min Jung.

454
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,740
I can't join the search party.

455
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,370
I'm the initial witness and testifier.

456
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,610
On top of that, I was the suspect 20 years ago.

457
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,280
So are you sure it's a good idea?

458
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,780
Then just patrol the neighbourhood.

459
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,950
If you take time off,
other people have to do your job.

460
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,020
Do as I say.

461
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,060
I don't want to.

462
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,960
You little brat.

463
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,230
It's been a long time since I heard that.

464
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,370
Will you beat me up to make me do
whatever you say?

465
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,700
Just like the old days?

466
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,140
Come on. You don't have to feel guilty.

467
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,020
They were bad at collecting evidence.

468
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,280
Scientific investigation wasn't reliable back then.

469
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,520
So if you felt like you got him,
you had to beat him up...

470
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,090
to get his confession.

471
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,130
Well, you weren't so bad.

472
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,210
Don't try to understand me.
And don't forgive me.

473
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,580
Even so, we're lucky that the world has changed now.

474
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,110
No, it hasn't.

475
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,690
It's all the same then and now.
If there's no evidence,

476
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,420
can you break a case without a confession?

477
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,260
You should do whatever it takes to get a confession.

478
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,200
If you want to get the monster,

479
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,940
you should become one.

480
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,710
There's no other way.

481
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,690
What is it?

482
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,690
Han Ju Won came by.

483
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,320
So?

484
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,290
He came and checked the case files.

485
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,530
- So?
- So?

486
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,470
He laughed like he was crazy.

487
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,280
- He did?
- You...

488
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,580
Why are you laughing? Is this funny to you?

489
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,410
Do you know what he said?

490
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,520
He asked if I'm your accomplice.

491
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,520
I got it. I'm hanging up now.

492
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,360
I'll come to work. You were right.

493
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,000
Things are busy at the station.

494
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,840
So if I don't show up,
it'll take a toll on my partner.

495
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,160
I told you I'll drive.

496
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,620
You must be still learning about our jurisdiction.

497
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,460
I'm smart so I memorize things easily.

498
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,400
Get in.

499
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,930
You must be heartbroken.

500
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,600
Kang Min Jung was like a niece to you.

501
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,540
But you lost her like that.

502
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,960
I don't think you're that smart.

503
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,700
Because you don't remember the route correctly.

504
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,670
We are under an unusual situation
so I'm taking a different route.

505
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,610
There's an old saying homicide detectives always mention.

506
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,810
"Criminals always return to the scene of the crime."

507
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,630
It was you, wasn't it?

508
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,800
You did it, didn't you?

509
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,070
What are you talking about?

510
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,570
- You still think I...
- No, not that.

511
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,810
The case files.

512
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,940
You're the one who put them back, right?

513
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,880
So what if I did? What will you do about it?

514
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,950
Does it really matter...

515
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,560
who put them back?

516
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,500
(Inspector Oh Ji Hwa)

517
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,600
Aren't you going to take that?

518
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,940
Then let's just get back on the road.

519
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,010
Hello?

520
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,270
This is Oh Ji Hwa.
Please get back to the station.

521
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,880
When is the first time
you came to Manyang-eup of Munju?

522
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,280
I came here 16 days ago...

523
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,350
to report on my transfer to Manyang Police Substation.

524
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,990
So you've never set foot in this area before that?

525
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,130
Maybe a couple of times when I was around seven...

526
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,460
since my father used to work
at Munju Police Station.

527
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,560
- What about after that?
- Never.

528
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,770
Did you know Kang Min Jung?

529
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,280
- No.
- It took a while for you to answer.

530
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,810
Why did you pause?

531
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,950
The day before she went missing,

532
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,720
I saw Ms. Kang completely drunk
at Manyang Substation...

533
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
for the first time.

534
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,990
We were in the same space for a couple of hours.

535
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,560
That means I've seen her once.

536
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,690
But I can't say that I knew her. That's why.

537
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,630
So you've never met her
before you saw her at the substation?

538
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,800
No, never. What's this about?

539
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,470
Last night, a search dog
that was looking for Min Jung...

540
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,240
found something.

541
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,940
And I thought you'd recognize it.

542
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,150
It's a cloned phone, and there's no call log.

543
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,850
But there are three texts sent from this phone.

544
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,420
The three texts from the phone...

545
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,930
where there's a trace of Min Jung's scent...

546
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,300
were sent to you, Inspector Han.

547
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,570
Inspector Han, did you really not know Min Jung?

548
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,040
No.

549
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,710
Then whose phone is this?

550
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,510
(Report on Digital Analysis)

551
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,290
(Result, three texts were sent to
phone number 010-0421-1001.)

552
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,920
That arrogant, crazy jerk.
He must be out of his mind.

553
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,190
Chief Superintendent Han, please calm down.

554
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,630
Maybe they were sent to the wrong person.

555
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,170
You know Ju Won.
He'd never get involved in a crime.

556
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,000
Are you saying three texts were sent wrong?

557
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,540
When did you first come to my house for tutoring?

558
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,740
It was in 2010.

559
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,510
How can you say that
when you've known him for 10 years?

560
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580
You're a bad judge of character.

561
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,150
How will you achieve bigger things?

562
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,450
So what do we have so far?

563
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,980
Did they get a DNA result?

564
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,950
The NFS is examining it.

565
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,130
Hyeok, about the corruption
you dealt with last time...

566
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,900
I hear you did a great job with it.

567
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,670
All the high officials are praising you for it.

568
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,600
It's all thanks to you for setting everything up.

569
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,840
That's how I could indict him.

570
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,910
Thank you.

571
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,710
Well, it's not a bad idea to stay
as a prosecutor for economic crimes,

572
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,710
but to achieve better things,

573
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,620
wouldn't you need more people around you?

574
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,290
Luckily, there’s a head from VCU...

575
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,650
at the Munju District Prosecutor’s Office
that only deals...

576
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,920
with violent crimes.

577
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,890
And he happens to be my junior from my high school.

578
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,030
They need more people.

579
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,560
I'm hoping to work as a violent crime specialist.

580
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,570
But, sir, as you well know,

581
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,570
this crime's keywords
are female college student and fingers.

582
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,610
If we aren't careful, we might...

583
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,910
I thought they might bring it up again.

584
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,950
It's a story that the public and press like.

585
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,580
Even if I transfer,
I'm not that good judge of character,

586
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,350
as you know.

587
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,020
I'm a man of poor calibre to achieve bigger things.

588
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,020
The head of the VCU...

589
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,620
already has his ace player.

590
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,600
Prosecutor Kwon, I can make an ace player.

591
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,670
Don't worry, and get ready to move.

592
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,940
I'll do my best, sir.

593
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,270
Oh, right.

594
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,380
If the NFS finds something, let me know.

595
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,940
Yes, sir.

596
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,090
If they find something?

597
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,160
Does that mean there's something
that they shouldn't find?

598
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,670
Thanks, Ju Won.

599
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,770
What on earth did you do?

600
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,110
A big incident occurred in my district,

601
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,810
so it's only natural for me to visit you guys.

I'm also part of the cop family.

605

Family members should help each other.

I didn't want to cause trouble...

609
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,510
and put you all in a pickle.

610
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,780
I couldn't even get you any drinks.

611

We're all grateful that you came to visit us...

612
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,780
and for your words of encouragement.
Am I right?

00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,890
- Yes, he's right.
- Yes.

- Right.

00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,290
Don't act like you don't know!

647
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,460
Why did you call that punk Lee Chang Jin?

648
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,490
Lee Chang Jin of JL Construction?

649
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,960
- Chairman Lee is here?
- Mom!

650
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,100
I should give him a call. It's been a while.

651
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,640
Don't you do it.

652
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,340
Don't ever join hands with him.

653
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,740
Put it up there,

654
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,480
- and to Mr. Jung...
- Okay.

655
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,180
My, look who it is.

656
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,350
It's been so long, Ji Hwa.

657
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,690
So you've really become a detective?

658
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,490
- Get back inside first.
- Okay.

659
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,400
Is he your subordinate?

660
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,900
You're so awesome, Ji Hwa.

661
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,770
Who are you calling my subordinate?

662
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,940
You haven't changed at all, Lee Chang Jin.

663
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,110
Right.

664
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,110
If people change, they die.

665
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,350
So what brings you here?

666
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,880
I just missed my ex-wife.

667
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,820
Of course, she's not here.

668
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,590
Isn't that so?

669
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,960
I missed the renewal period.
I had to pay 20 dollars for it.

670
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,300
What a waste.

671
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,260
You live in Seoul,

672
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,330
so why would you renew your license here?

673
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,400
I'm going to come down here more often now.

674
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,440
I might even move, actually.

675
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,510
Why would you move?

676
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,880
I met you here 20 years ago,

677
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,480
and I married, then divorced you.

678
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,680
I'm back here to do all the things
I couldn't back then.

679
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,890
(JL Construction, Chairman Lee Chang Jin)

680
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,330
I need to make it this time.

681
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,400
So Ji Hwa,

682
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,630
don't seduce me this time.

683
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,870
You jerk.

684
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,070
I know you like it.

685
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,000
Come on.

686
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,880
What is this?

687
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,180
I told you I have no time,
and you still called me out.

688
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,750
It's about the phone they found in Mount Simju.

689
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,920
Care to listen?

690
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,460
The NFS has finished the examination.

691
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,860
Before the police get their hands on it,

692
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,760
I got it and called you.

693
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,070
How did you know it was found in Mount Simju?

694
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,330
Did Father tell you that?

695
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,700
Guess which prosecutor is in charge of this case.

696
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,240
Father pled me to take it.

697
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,880
So if there's anything you need to share,
tell me now.

698
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,280
That way, I'll be prepared.

699
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,310
The prosecutor in charge shouldn't do that.

700
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,250
I'll disregard what you just said,
so pass that to the police soon.

701
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,220
Are you sure you'll be okay?

702
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,390
Even if the police dig her up?

703
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,270
The skeleton you found last week...

704
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,470
I'm talking about her.

705
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,470
Her DNA was found on the cloned phone.

706
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,710
You arrogant fool.
Why did you tell her your number?

707
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,480
You just had to let the world know
that you solved the case...

708
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,550
and arrested the culprit
after carrying out a sting operation.

709
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,750
That's why you told her your number
instead of using a cloned phone.

710
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,190
You thought this was your game,
everything would work out your way,

711
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,590
and that you'll succeed?

712
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,020
You arrogant fool.

713
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,460
What will you do now? Tell me!

714
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,830
I have nothing to do with this case.

715
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,270
- What?
- They haven't found anything...

716
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,530
related to me except my number.

717
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,800
- If I act innocent...
- What if the officers of Munju...

718
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,100
bring the matter to Foreign Affairs?

719
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,710
If they reveal
that Foreign Affairs was investigating...

720
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,040
on masseuses and illegal immigrants,

721
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,680
do you think her identity won't show up?

722
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,910
She's an illegal immigrant!

723
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,850
There's no way her identity will be revealed,

724
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,380
even if it does, there's no proof that says...

725
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,680
that I'm related to her.

726
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,790
Everything is just circumstantial.

727
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,760
They're circumstantial?

728
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,500
You still haven't come to your senses.

729
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,600
When the press finds out,
they'll pronounce you guilty...

730
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,800
with just circumstantial evidence!

731
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,130
Even if you don't get arrested,
that'll just be the end for you!

732
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,740
I'll soon be promoted as Commissioner General,

733
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,870
but should I lose that chance
because of a fool like you?

734
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,870
(Analysis of Digital Evidence)

735
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,470
What was this...

736
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,900
(Found in Mount Simju)

737
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,970
doing there?

738
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,510
About the phone with Min Jung's scent.

739
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,850
Why was it there?

740
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,320
We searched for her all over the mountain,
but we couldn't find her.

741
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,120
That wasn't Min Jung's.

742
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,960
Jin Mook has never seen it too.

743
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,730
How can the search be over
after just finding a phone?

744
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,230
So many officers were involved in the search.

745
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,100
(Chief's Office)

746
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,330
- Actually, on the phone...
- Hey, Inspector Hwang.

747
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,570
Chief, I've been thinking,

748
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,770
and I don't think we can cover it up.

749
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,410
All of our team members should know.

750
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,010
Something worse could happen, and...

751
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,240
What do you mean?

752
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,180
What could be worse than
not being able to find Min Jung?

753
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,780
What's wrong with you, Chief?

754
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,750
Aren't you too laid back,
now that you're retiring soon?

755
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,520
We all have a lot ahead of us.

756
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,960
- Why you little...
- Chief! Please don't!

757
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,360
Officer Lee, did you hear from your partner?

758
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,960
Yesterday, Inspector Han
was called to the Munju Police Station...

759
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,600
in the midst of his patrol.
Do you know why?

760
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,070
No.

761
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,500
Why was he called there?

762
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,600
What's it about?

763
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,640
Are Min Jung and Inspector Han related?

764
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,010
Are they?

765
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,710
Well... On the cloned phone found in Mount Simju,

766
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,750
they found Inspector Han's number.

767
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,250
- What?
- What?

768
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,590
That's not the only thing they found.

769
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,390
I heard this in the morning.

770
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,690
Constable Oh, Officer Lee, and Inspector Han...

771
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,260
They found a skeleton together, remember?

772
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,060
That skeleton was a woman's,

773
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,160
and her DNA was found on the cloned phone.

774
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,070
What? Is that true?

775
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,070
That's right.

776
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,540
That's what happened.

777
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,840
I came to tell you,
but I see that you already have.

778
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,750
Thank you so much, Inspector Hwang.

779
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,720
No, it's not that.

780
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,120
Chief, I'll be taking a leave of absence for a while.

781
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,160
I'm sorry.

782
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,190
Officer Lee.

783
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,900
I'm sorry about that.

784
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,450
Inspector Han.

785
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,020
Thank you for everything.

786
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,530
Goodbye.

787
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,210
Did you just laugh?

788
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Sorry?

789
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,520
Do you find this funny?

790
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,020
Are you that pleased...

791
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,560
now that your hindrance is gone?

792
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,420
You think you have control
over everything now, don't you?

793
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,030
Do you think you can get your way?

794
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,200
Inspector Han, there must've been a misunderstanding.

795
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,400
I...

796
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,730
won't be gone.

797
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,640
I'm saying,
I won't be gone from your sight.

798
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,510
I'll catch you.
I'll catch you no matter what.

799
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,240
Oh, dear.

800
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,580
I think you're having a nervous breakdown.

801
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,490
- What?
- You need to get some rest.

802
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,590
Or you can get therapy.

803
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,650
Hey.

804
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,260
You jerk...

805
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,500
Let go. You know the officers in there.

806
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,940
Let go of this. Hurry.

807
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,040
It wouldn't do you any good
to be caught by the camera.

00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,560
(Mount Simju)

810
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,060
A security camera?

811
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,160
They don't even install working cameras
on the streets.

812
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,690
Why would I use my money to install one?

813
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,360
Then have you seen a car
that regularly goes up the mountain...

814
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,170
to the parking lot near the trail
to park their car?

815
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,800
A car that regularly parks there?

816
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,340
In the Mount Simju parking lot?
Why do you ask?

817
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,040
You must be from Seoul.

818
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,140
There are so many buildings in Seoul,

819
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,850
so it must be hard to find a space to park,

820
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,850
but there are many vacant lots here.
Look around.

821
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,750
Why would anyone go up there to park their cars?

822
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,420
They can just park anywhere
that's near their house.

823
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,160
Thank you for your cooperation.

824
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,000
They can just park anywhere
that's near their house?

825
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,630
Is anybody home?

826
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,570
Hello?

827
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,280
(Clorox)

828
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,810
Bleach.

829
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,990
(Missing Person Bang Hyun Suk, 34)

830
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,500
Hey, what are you doing? What's going on?

831
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,160
Why are you doing this? Don't do this.

832
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,600
What on earth is she talking about?

833
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,640
That's nonsense. Ji Hwa...

834
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,310
But even so... This doesn't make any sense.

835
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,980
My goodness.

836
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,410
Inspector Oh, I'll do it.

837
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,750
Officer Lee.

838
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,920
Yes.

839
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:35,290
You're under arrest
for abduction and malicious wounding...

840
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,560
of Kang Min Jung.

841
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,870
Lee Dong Sik arrested without a warrant.

842
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,410
Being transferred to Munju Police Station now.

843
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,620
=Beyond Evil=

844
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,890
You arrested me without a warrant
and dragged me here.

845
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,430
And you let the reporters take pictures of me.

846
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,860
You witch.

847
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,660
Are you saying we're putting on a show?

848
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,130
You do know that you're overreacting, don't you?

849
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,670
Did she even know...

850
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,840
you were making her walk into a death trap?

851
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,340
You have to release Officer Lee right now.

852
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,380
I heard they found text records for your son
on a cloned phone.

853
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,150
We're in a mess because of that jerk.

854
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,250
Han Ju Won, walk away from the case.

855
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,620
Why do you have Min Jung's blood in your basement?

856
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,850
Do you trust me?

857
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,690
You've never shot anyone, have you?

858
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,790
I appreciate what you've done, Inspector Han.
