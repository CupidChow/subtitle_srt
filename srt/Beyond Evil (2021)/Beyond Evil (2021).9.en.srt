Your father, I mean,

5
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:32,673
Chief Superintendent Han already
had a press conference on this.

6
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,644
That's why we asked you to appear
for the second time.

7
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,773
But this will be the end of the inspection.

8
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,813
Congratulations on the great news.
I heard you'll be promoted.

9
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:43,214
- It was a sting operation.
- Sorry?

10
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:45,083
I never reported this to my superiors...

11
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:47,383
and pressed ahead on my own judgement.

12
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,394
The victim was Lee Geum Hwa,
a 38-year-old woman.

13
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:53,424
She's a Korean-Chinese
who holds citizenship in China.

Around 7:28pm on October 19,

15
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,364
at a reed field
in Manyang-eup, Munju, Gyeonggi Province,

16
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:04,133
her skeleton was found.

17
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,643
She was first found by...

18
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:07,744
Assistant Inspector Lee Dong Sik
and Constable Oh Ji Hun...

19
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:10,244
of Manyang Police Substation, and me,

20

Han Ju Won.

21
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:15,313
We were not aware of the location of her body
when we found her.

22
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:16,354
Hey, wait.

23
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:19,223
What are you doing?

24
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:20,854
The inspection is over.

25
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,524
Article 123 of the Criminal Code.

26
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:25,964
"When a civil servant
overuses his or her authority..."

27
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:27,593
"to make a civilian do something
against their obligation,"

28
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,194
"he or she can be imprisoned
for up to five years,"

29
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,404
"be suspended for up to 10 years,"

30
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,733
"or be fined up to 10,000 dollars."

31
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,304
I know that article way better than you do.

32
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,673
So why did you spill that to me?

33
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:41,813
I made a victim
because I made my own judgement...

34
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:44,373
and forced a sting operation.

35
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:47,544
And that's how you finally arrested
the culprit last week,

36
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,783
that man who killed himself.

37
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:51,854
I abused my authority, and a person...

38
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:55,753
Ms. Lee Geum Hwa died.

39
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:59,123
And Inspector Han, that is how...

40
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:01,123
you arrested that serial killer
who kept his act going...

41
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,063
for the last 20 years.
It's all thanks to that.

42
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:09,533
We can figure out a way around this
by creating a belated report on...

43
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,573
Please have me...

44
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:12,704
punished.

49
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,163
Dong Sik, is that you?

50
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:39,063
Ma'am, it's me.

51
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:41,603
It's Jin Mook.

52
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:43,704
Where's Dong Sik?

53
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:48,313
Dong Sik went to serve in the army.

54
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:54,714
That's why you've been knitting this for him.

55
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:56,654
Don't you remember?

56
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,484
Yes, right. I remember.

57
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:05,663
Eat up, ma'am.

58
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,734
You need to eat something to keep up your energy.

59
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:10,063
Turn that off.

60
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:13,234
It'll only upset Dong Sik even more
if he sees this.

61
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,234
You must be tired from doing construction work at home.

62

You can take Min Jung and go.

63
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:24,214
I'll just make some porridge before I leave.

64
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:41,934
Dong Sik, no.

65
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:47,704
It'll only upset Dong Sik even more
if he sees this.

66

You must be tired from doing construction work at home.

67

My gosh.

85
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,120
I wanted to get warmed up quickly
because I felt so cold. That's hot.

86
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,750
It's freezing.

- Who's an idiot?
- Our team.

89
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,390
Ju Won took a leave long ago, and it's already...

90
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,690
the February of the new year.

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,230
So how long do we have to live like idiots?

92
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,100
You made connections at the station
to go back there one day.

93
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Have you heard anything?

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,540
The ones up there seemed to be troubled too.

95
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,970
The ones up there? Why?

96
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,570
We'll need to have a vacancy for us
to get another officer.

97
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,310
Inspector Han turned in his request for leave.

98
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,580
They contacted him to process it,
but he's unreachable.

99
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,510
He went completely off the grid for three months.

100
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,150
No one knows what on earth he's up to.

101
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,120
What about Chief Superintendent Han?
I'm sure his dad would know.

102
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,350
He wouldn't let anyone bring up
even a syllable of his name.

103
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,490
I'd be furious if I was his dad too.

104
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,160
When they arrested that guy,

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,760
even Jeong Je became a senior inspector.

106
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,800
But in Inspector Han's case,
a banquet was prepared for him...

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,330
but he turned over the table with his own hands.

108
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,400
He's an upright person I guess.

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,870
Upright, my foot.
I would do the same if I were him.

110
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,710
You would ruin a chance to become a senior inspector?

111
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,050
I said I would if I were him.

112
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,050
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

113
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,050
Inequalities are pervasive
so opportunities aren't given equally.

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,490
Han Ju Won will have
as many opportunities as he can get.

115
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,160
So it wouldn't matter if he misses one.

116
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,230
But it could be once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some.

117
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,000
And those people are the ones
to hold on to a rotten rope.

118
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,570
A rotten rope...

119
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,880
But I still don't understand
why he took a leave of absence.

120
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,740
I thought Dong Sik would take a leave of absence.

121
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,210
I agree.

122
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,820
Kang... Because Kang Jin Mook committed suicide,

123
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,320
we had no right of indictment...

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,520
so it ended without prosecution.

125
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,820
That means he has no way of finding his sister now.

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,190
He must be so frustrated.

127
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,830
That's why he causes so much trouble
early in the morning.

128
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,290
Team 2 worked the night shift last night...

129
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,600
and they told me they got so many complaints.

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
He looks so normal during the day.
I don't understand.

131
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,070
He may look normal, but he's definitely lacking.

132
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,800
And it's understandable.

133
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,580
My gosh. Is that hazelnut?

134
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,610
It smells great. Let me have some.

135
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,580
"Hazelnut"? We're in such a different league.

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
This one costs 8 dollars per 10g.

137
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,720
It's called "Kenya Thunguri" and it's...

138
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,520
Never mind.

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,820
Just have a cup of coffee mix.
Have two.

140
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,460
- Come on. Let me have some Thung.
- That's not what it's called.

141
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,130
- Let me taste it.
- Just have a coffee mix.

142
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,470
- Come on.
- Just have what you usually have.

143
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,300
Let me taste it.

144
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,770
Are you dancing together?

145
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,340
We're on the job with our heart and soul, Chief.

146
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,040
We're already short-handed.
What if I take sick leave?

147
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,480
What do you mean we're short-handed?

148
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,350
I don't think we're short-handed.

149
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm currently very satisfied
with the working environment, Chief.

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
Has it been three months
since Inspector Han took time off?

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,490
It's February for goodness' sake.

152
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,060
So how long do we have to work short-handed?

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,030
It's too cold to be dispatched so often.

154
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,860
Besides, Officer Lee gives us a headache too.

155
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,430
I understand why he'd be out of his mind though.

156
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,500
- What are you talking about?
- Well, last night...

157
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,540
Inspector Hwang,
you heard what officers from Team 2 said.

158
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,210
- I did?
- Hey.

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,980
What is it? Tell me.

160
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,220
If you started a conversation,
you should finish it.

161
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,720
He's not here
because he's on patrol on a cold day.

162
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,790
So let's hear what Team 2 had to say about him.

163
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,420
Why is he out of his mind?

164
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,630
Jae Yi's phone is off again today.

165
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,140
Aren't you worried about her?

166
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,810
If I go to Busan

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,350
Will I be able to see you again?

168
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,950
Her soft hair

169
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,790
Ruffled in the wind when she welcomed me

170
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,660
Gosh, I'm sick of hearing
"When I Go to Busan".

171
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,000
Stop singing the song
and let's really go to Busan.

172
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,500
Let's go see if she really is there.

173
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,740
I don't know where to go

174
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:27,180
Because you're not here with me anymore

175
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,830
Oh, no. My goodness.

176
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,340
What? What is it?

177
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,940
(Isulo)

178
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,700
This is Officer 1. Officer 1.
We have a situation.

179
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,440
It's about Officer Cho's wife.

180
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,900
My wife?

181
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,640
What about my wife?

182
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,710
That's not all. Dong Sik...

183
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,150
I mean Officer Lee is...

184
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,750
Why are you talking about my wife and Dong Sik?

185
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,820
They're not even close.

186
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,350
Is this what I think it is?

187
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,160
My goodness, Dong Sik that nut case.

188
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,990
His nut gauge is shooting up.

189
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,800
Dong Sik... I mean, Officer Lee.

190
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,300
Oh, right. I heard you got promoted.

191
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,500
With all due respect,
Senior Inspector Lee...

192
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,270
Well, this is... I mean we were just...

193
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,510
- Having fun.
- Yes, we were having fun.

194
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,940
Right. We're having fun.

195
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,850
She's right. Just for fun.

196
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,850
We were so bored so we just had some fun.

197
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,220
- That's right. We were.
- Right.

198
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,420
Dong Sik, we were just having fun.

199
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,660
I know you're busy so you can just leave.

200
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,930
- She's right.
- Yes, you should leave.

201
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,500
- Gosh, you're overreacting.
- Yes, you know how he is.

202
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,430
- You're too sensitive.
- Stop!

203
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,600
- Quiet down.
- Dong Sik.

204
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,940
Dong Sik, why are you doing this?

205
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,770
We're no strangers.

206
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,810
As of now, everyone in this room is...

207
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,680
immediately under arrest
for trespassing, fraud, gambling,

208
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,420
and abetting in gambling.

209
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,020
My goodness. What is he saying?

210
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,650
- Have you gone mad again?
- There's nothing wrong to have fun.

211
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,190
You can't arrest us.

212
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,960
You have the right to remain silent
and to consult with a lawyer.

213
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,390
You have the opportunity to justify your actions.

214
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,900
And you have the right to request the court...

215
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,400
to review the legality of the arrest or detention

216
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,100
- Has he gone mad?
- I didn't even grab his hair.

217
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,870
How come you're always the same?

218
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,140
You should act differently
now that you're promoted.

219
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,170
You should be more mature.

220
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,080
Registration number 710915-2135740.
Lee Gang Ja, right?

221
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,950
Would you say you're on the run now?

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,120
On the run? No way.

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,560
By the way, why do you know my registration number?

224
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,190
It's an abuse of authority
and disclosing private information.

225
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,430
- You're right.
- Yes, she's right.

226
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,430
- Experience is the best teacher.
- Totally.

227
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,500
She's indeed an officer's wife.

228
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,440
- Yes, she is.
- You can put him in trouble.

229
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,970
Officer Oh, close the shutters.

230
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,280
Come on. Don't do this.

231
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,810
- No, Ji Hun.
- Ms. Lee Gang Ja.

232
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,620
Do you want to be charged
with obstruction of justice too?

233
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,550
Darn it.

234
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,520
Charge me. All right? Run!

235
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,190
- Run!
- Let's get out of here.

236
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,390
- What are you doing?
- Open the door!

237
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,430
- My goodness. He won't move.
- Gosh!

238
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,670
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

239
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,600
- Open the door!
- I'll give you my money!

240
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,010
We went through a lot
the last time he arrested us.

241
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,040
And he had nothing to charge us with, right?

242
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,680
- She's right.
- He had nothing.

243
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,050
So what were you doing at someone else's store?

244
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,680
Last time, he accused me...

245
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,920
of starting a gambling den at my salon.

246
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,790
I couldn't sleep for days after that incident.

247
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,630
I was so stressed out that I got partial hair loss.

248
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,660
I don't ever want to be accused of anything.

249
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,430
That brat Dong Sik makes us seem guilty of something.

250
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,900
Ever since her mother disappeared,

251
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,200
everyone in this town knows
where Jae Yi puts the key.

252
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,070
She put the key there...

253
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,310
in case her mother comes back.

254
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,810
Besides, Jae Yi won't be mad at us
for using the place.

255
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,950
- She's right.
- She won't be mad.

256
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,850
So you've been using the place
since she closed down the shop?

257
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,550
For the last three months in this cold weather?

258
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,750
Just answer the question.

259
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,660
Why are you wearing
that black plastic bag over your head?

260
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,990
Don't talk to me.

261
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,990
- I have the right to remain silent.
- My goodness, Woman!

262
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,230
Under Article 260 of the Criminal Code,

263
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,900
the person who physically assaults another person...

264
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,870
may face up to two years of prison
or a fine of 5,000 dollars.

265
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,340
The person could be put in detention or fined.

266
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Dong Sik, I know where you're going with this.

267
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,010
1 and 2 cents add up to 10 and 20 cents.

268
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,180
10 and 20 cents add up to 1 and 2 dollars.

269
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,240
Many a mickle makes a muckle.

270
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,280
A journey of a thousand miles begins
with a single step. I know.

271
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,450
- That's not it.
- What?

272
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,850
This isn't about a cent, 10 cents, or 1 dollar.

273
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,320
Wait. What?

274
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,030
What is this?

275
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,960
If you exchange it at the bank,
1 Yuan is worth 17 or 18 cents.

276
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,970
But if they get it as cheap as 16 cents,

277
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,600
and if it's not 1 Yuan but 2 or 3 Yuan...

278
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,670
I can't calculate right away
according to the exchange rate.

279
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,340
But you don't realize
how much this is because...

280
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,380
the number on the currency
is much less than 10 or 20 cents.

281
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,310
I'm sure the stake kept going up.

282
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
Ms. Lee.

283
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,550
I'm going to ask you just once.

284
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,480
The Yuan you used to play.

285
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,390
Who let you borrow this?

286
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,560
That darned right to remain silent!

287
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,800
Do not move!

288
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,630
Constable Oh, lock the doors!

289
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Don't you dare open that door.

290
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,070
I'll bet my entire career
and make sure you're punished.

291
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,510
- Don't say that to us.
- I have nothing to do with this.

292
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,060
Manyang is still the same.

293
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
Inspector Han Ju won,
I'm here to report my reinstatement.

294
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,800
Whatever, lock the doors.

295
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,040
- Hey, move aside.
- Move aside, will you? Come on.

296
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,040
- My goodness.
- Goodness.

297
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,550
What is it?

298
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,320
Yoo Jae Yi came voluntarily
at the VCU of Munju Station.

299
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,510
(Community Safety Division Section Chief Park Jeong Je)

300
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,260
Ms. Yoo Jae Yi.

301
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,200
Did you make a voluntary appearance here
at Munju Police Station?

302
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,540
- Yes, I did.
- I'll proceed with the questions.

303
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,010
On November 10, 2020,

304
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,610
around 5:46am,

305
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,610
were you near Munju Police Station?

306
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Yes.

307
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,320
Why were you there?

308
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,360
I came to kill...

309
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,990
Kang Jin Mook.

310
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,420
Someone suddenly made this report?

311
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,860
Wait.

312
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,590
Look at the timeline. November 10 is...

313
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,430
That... Isn't that the day that person died?

314
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,330
So what? What about that?

315
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,900
I mean...

316
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,700
I'm sure the time is also...

317
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,300
What was the estimated time of his death?

318
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,510
Wasn't it around this time?

319
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,740
But he wasn't stabbed to death.

320
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,380
The NFS concluded he committed suicide...

321
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
by hanging himself, using a fishing line.

322
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,280
Jae Yi had a clear motive.

323
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,250
And there's a video of her...

324
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,550
walking into the station
with a knife right at that time.

325
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,390
Anyone could see how suspicious this is.

326
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,790
She easily could have killed that person...

327
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,090
"That person"?

328
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,530
Why can't you say his name?

329
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,900
You're right.
You can just call him Kang Jin Mook.

330
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,830
Dong Sik, I mean, Inspector Lee,
where are you going?

331
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,710
Officer Cho must be frustrated.
We should finish arresting them.

332
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,440
Please excuse me.

333
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,580
What about Jae Yi?

334
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,650
So?

335
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,820
Did you kill him?

336
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,320
No.

337
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,860
Why didn't you kill him?

338
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,580
I couldn't get in.

339
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,310
Why not?

340
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,280
Not everyone has access to VCU's jail.

341
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,390
I asked you again and again,
but you flat out said no.

342
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,560
And that's why you didn't go in?

343
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,630
Why do you keep asking me?

344
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,160
Go check the CCTV footage
in the hallway of the station.

345
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,270
You don't have it?
There's no CCTV there?

346
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,100
- Well, that's...
- Do Su.

347
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,900
Shut your mouth.

348
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,670
Why did you show up here voluntarily?

349
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,740
We didn't even call you.

350
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,550
Because I was threatened.

351
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,920
Someone said this dashcam footage...

352
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,590
will be reported to Manyang Police Substation.

353
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,370
(I will send this video at 2pm, February 1, 2021.)

354
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,440
You never eat raw meat.

355
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,510
Are you saying you'll eat raw meat
and live a tough life from now on?

356
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,750
No, it's good.

357
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,390
I've made such rash judgements
on such little experiences I had.

358
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,890
I'm going to try doing everything
no matter what it may be.

359
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,060
You just said you're now up for anything,

360
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,530
but the first thing you did
after three months of leave...

361
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,300
was getting reinstated at Manyang Substation?

362
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,800
Yes. I kept thinking about them.

363
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,270
It's a pretty interesting place.

364
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,770
Stop this nonsense
and return to Seoul Police Agency.

365
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,840
- I don't want to.
- Ju Won.

366
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,890
- Prosecutor Kwon?
- Mr. Han, I'm sorry I'm late.

367
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,890
- Why are you here?
- Sorry?

368
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,220
I invited him.

369
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,990
You seem to consider him a son as much as...

370
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,090
No, you seem to think of him more
as your own than me.

371
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,360
I had to see you tonight anyway.

372
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,900
Did you receive the update regarding Munju?

373
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,470
Munju?

374
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,870
It's...

375
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,540
You should take a look.

376
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,120
What is this video?

377
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,520
The footage from a dashcam
on the night Kang killed himself.

378
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,560
Take a look at the date.

379
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,760
November 10, 2020.

380
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,860
What about this?

381
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,330
The problem with the fishing line
wasn't resolved with his suicide.

382
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,900
Well, if this continues,

383
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,630
it would've ended as nothing.

384
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,670
But there's this woman
who was caught on camera.

385
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,040
She hides a knife
and heads over to the station.

386
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,480
Ju Won, why aren't you surprised?

387
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,620
I heard it at the substation.

388
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,990
It's her, right?

389
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,090
You asked me to get her information.
The one you had a thing with.

390
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,160
"A thing"?

391
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,930
"A thing"?

392
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,860
That never happened to this day,

393
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,570
but I guess I'll give it a try.
I've never done that before.

394
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,700
Ju Won!

395
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
Why are you screaming at me?

396
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,370
Do you think she's not good enough?

397
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,940
Or is it because...

398
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,640
she's involved in the Kang Jin Mook case?

399
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,180
Return to Seoul immediately.

400
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,320
I already went to work.

401
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,050
And I'm done living that life of coming
and going at your word.

402
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,430
By any chance,

403
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,230
are you in dire need of me?

404
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,470
- What?
- What's so great...

405
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,040
about being a commissioner general?

406
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,170
You should manage that by yourself.

407
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,140
Hyeok, make sure you escort my dad home
before you go.

408
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,280
What?

409
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Okay.

410
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,690
(The miracle in the value of togetherness!
New Munju 2021!)

411
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,020
(Let's go with Do Hae Won!)

412
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,690
Goodness, come on.

413
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,030
Those people at Munju are awfully nosy.

414
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,370
"Nosy"? Do you think this is that simple?

415
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,030
Then should I make it more complicated?

416
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,440
Look at the date of that video.

417
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,410
That's the day
when the supermarket killer died.

418
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,910
So what?

419
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,980
Things finally calmed down
after that man killed himself,

420
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,280
and I'm finally here.

421
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,520
What if things get rough again
because he was murdered?

422
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,320
What are we going to do with Seo-Gu?

423
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,260
Murdered. Why do you think he was murdered?

424
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,620
By any chance,

425
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,900
did you kill him?

426
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,630
What? Me?

427
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,170
You should know better
if you have known me for over 20 years.

428
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,510
Do you think I'll get any blood on my hands?

429
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,710
You just don't get any blood on it,
but you do everything else.

430
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,410
Darn you.

431
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,110
I told you not to jabber in Russian!

432
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,850
My gosh, that old woman.

433
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,490
Your menopause is lasting a while.

434
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,520
- What?
- I said you're beautiful.

435
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,490
How could you remain so beautiful over 20 years?

436
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,060
Have you gone insane?

437
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,000
Anyway, you're quick.

438
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,340
(Send to Myself, Lee Chang Jin)

439
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,170
It was given to the police
so maybe it was leaked from the inside.

440
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,680
(Email sent)

441
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,110
Maybe Senior Inspector Park sent it.

442
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,650
I doubt that he did it.

443
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,690
I sent him to Public Safety Bureau
to get some help.

444
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,090
But he's cold as ice to me.

445
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,390
Then who did you get it from?

446
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,030
Well, I have a source of information.

447
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,070
Gosh.

448
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,460
Park Jeong Je. Lee Dong Sik.

449
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,560
- What are you doing?
- We didn't do anything.

450
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,900
Why are you exchanging glances?

451
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,800
We were not...

452
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,230
Are you doing something behind my back?

453
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,270
You knew about this, didn't you?

454
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,770
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Jae Yi.

455
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,180
She had to hide for three months.

456
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,010
But you didn't even look for her.

457
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,280
I just thought that I would do the same
if I were her.

458
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,190
Ji Hwa, they didn't know about this.

459
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,520
Am I supposed to believe that?

460
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,690
This isn't the first time you deceived me.

461
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,460
You guys also did it
when Kang Jin Mook was arrested.

462
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,000
You, Han Ju Won, Jeong Je, and Jae Yi.

463
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,130
Four of you knew something.

464
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,130
That's why two of you ran to the reed field...

465
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,040
and the other two ran to Manyang Supermarket.

466
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,500
- Ji Hwa.
- Gosh.

467
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,210
Stop defending Dong Sik, Chief.

468
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,410
I know you're in it too.

469
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,550
Ji Hwa, it's because Dong Sik has good intuition.

470
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,250
"Good intuition"?
Are you talking about intuition now?

471
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,690
He's not the only detective here.

472
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,790
I've been a homicide detective for 11 years.

473
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,060
Dong Sik, Jeong Je, and Jae Yi.

474
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Are you having fun fooling me?

475
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,000
You think I won't stand by your side
because I'm the team leader?

476
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,710
Ji Hwa, that's not it.

477
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,980
You're right. I won't stand by your side.

478
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,610
I'm a cop.

479
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,380
And this is my case.

480
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,950
So let me ask you a question, Dong Sik.

481
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,990
You answer yourself.

482
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,320
On the day Kang Jin Mook committed suicide.

483
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,130
Did you know
Jae Yi came by the station that day?

484
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,100
Dong Sik didn't know. Actually, no one knew.

485
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,340
No one knew.

486
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,740
Did you two...

487
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,240
kill Kang Jin Mook together?

488
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,550
It would've been great if that was true.

489
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,590
If I knew this would happen,

490
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,160
I should've killed him myself.

491
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,660
Turn that off. It'll only upset Dong Sik...

492
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,870
even more if he sees this.

493
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,900
You must be tired from doing construction work at home.

494
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,170
You can take Min Jung and go.

495
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,940
"Construction work"?

496
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,310
Do you think Yu Yeon is...

497
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,680
She's not here. I don't think she's here.

498
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,080
When I found out that he left everything...

499
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,020
to you and Min Jung,

500
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,860
I realized you had...

501
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,130
to go through everything that he left yourself.

502
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,690
That's when I knew he was a psychopath.

503
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,500
But I guess that's how you found this.

504
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,040
I still don't understand him.

505
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,510
Are you trying to understand a killer? Don't.

506
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,680
They're killers who take people's lives.

507
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,640
So don’t try to understand,
see their motivation...

508
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,550
or expect a storyline behind it.

509
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,120
"I didn't kill Yu Yeon."

510
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,990
"I sent Yu Yeon back to you."

511
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,060
I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying.

512
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,460
I sent Yu Yeon back to you.

513
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,430
Do you think
that's why he left everything to you?

514
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,500
Do you really believe that he didn't kill Yu Yeon?

515
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,970
No, I don't believe him.

516
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,970
But now...

517
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,910
I have no choice but to believe him.

518
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,850
Because we don't have any other leads.

519
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,650
Construction work.

520
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,820
If it's not this house,
then which one would it be?

521
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,020
I went through some records...

522
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,390
to find the construction sites Kang Jin Mook...

523
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,230
might have worked at as a labourer.

524
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,830
But it's been a long time.

525
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,700
I don't think he moved to other regions.

526
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,940
I think he just stayed in Manyang the whole time.

527
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
Based on the video.

528
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
So?

529
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,270
One guy has been trying to
break down the house every night.

530
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,180
And the other guy's been looking through records everywhere.

531
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,510
So only you two have been working together.

532
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,220
Ji Hwa.

533
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,990
I really respect you.

534
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,460
What are you doing?

535
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,290
You've been a homicide detective for 11 years.

536
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,760
I know it hasn't been easy.

537
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,200
I wish you would stay the same
abiding by the law...

538
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,630
as a good detective you are now.

539
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,870
Don't be silly.

540
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,940
Wait a minute. What about me?

541
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,380
I'm an officer too.
But is it okay for me to break the law?

542
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

543
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
What's with you two?

544
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,580
Why are you always teasing me?

545
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,420
Are you having fun?

546
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,450
Senior Inspector Park is angry.

547
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,130
Ji Hwa, I'm sorry.

548
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,860
Shut up.

549
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Hey, don't you dare make up with each other.

550
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,930
You should apologize to me.

551
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,440
- Jeong Je.
- What?

552
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,610
After your mother became
the school's foundation director,

553
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,910
didn't Kang Jin Mook work
at the school's facilities office?

554
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,780
Well...

555
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,020
It wasn't in 2000.

556
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,390
It was 1998. We were sophomores in high school.
I remember him.

557
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
What about after that?

558
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,930
They hired a janitor to take care of the facilities.

559
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,690
But my mother...

560
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,300
kept treating Kang Jin Mook like a servant.

561
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,830
But in 2000, we didn't work on...

562
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,600
any big construction projects that required...

563
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,170
to redo the walls or the floors of the house.

564
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,710
What if it wasn't a house?

565
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,110
Didn't Kang Jin Mook manage that place too?

566
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,920
Well, that place was...

567
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,250
What place are you talking about?

568
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,220
The place Jeong Je and I were at...

569
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,490
on the day Yu Yeon disappeared.

570
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,530
It was our hideout.

571
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,160
But I don't think that's the place.

572
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,270
- It's not.
- How do you know?

573
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,640
Because Mother sold that place right away.

574
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,170
Right away?

575
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,040
Well, she didn't like the fact
that I was there that day.

576
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,480
She said it's bad luck so she sold it.

577
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,180
Selling land isn't an easy process.

578
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,850
Land development was booming back then.

579
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,420
We can't get in if it's a private property.

580
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,820
Who bought it?

581
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,160
Who is it?

582
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,130
Lee Chang Jin.

583
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,670
(No public right of way.
Violators will be prosecuted.)

584
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,840
(This is a private land
that belongs to Jin Li Construction.)

585
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,970
(Warning, No public right of way.)

586
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,840
(Violators will be prosecuted.)

587
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,280
(Simju Deer Farm)

588
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,340
Shovelling again?

589
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Inspector Han, you're here. Goodness.

590
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,110
Hello, Chief.

591
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm sorry I asked you here on your day off.

592
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,820
It's okay.
I'm an officer at Manyang Substation too.

593
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,190
I thought you were a kid,
but I guess you're mature enough.

594
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,620
- Yes, you're a grown-up now.
- Oh, let me.

595
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,260
- No, I can do it.
- Just stay there.

596
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,600
You're in your 60s.
What if you break your back?

597
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,870
Give it to me.

598
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,100
- Don't work too hard.
- All right.

599
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,250
Let's keep digging.
I'm not sure what we'll find though.

600
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,080
Why did you come here?

601
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,120
I came to dig in.

602
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,190
Why are you back in Manyang?

603
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,920
Am I not supposed to?

604
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,860
No, not really.

605
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,690
- Absolutely not.
- Are you going...

606
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,860
to turn yourself in this time?

607
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,430
If you find Lee Yu Yeon here,

608
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,540
will you turn yourself in this time?

609
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,630
We should say goodbye to each other now.

610
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,900
You should go back to where you belong.

611
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,000
Are you saying...

612
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,170
you're going to turn yourself in?

613
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,370
We couldn't find Yu Yeon.

614
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,310
Turning myself in?

615
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
Why would I?

616
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,510
What did I do wrong?

617
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,980
You confessed it to me.

618
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,150
Min Jung's finger.

619
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,920
You said you put it there.

620
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,290
You also know she was alive
when she was abandoned.

621
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,830
If you had reported then,
Min Jung could have...

622
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,630
You promised me.

623
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,770
You promised me!

624
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,010
Get home safe.

625
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
Lee Dong Sik.

626
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,550
No.

627
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,950
You're not going to do it.

628
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,490
You will never do something
like turning yourself in.

629
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,160
Is that why you came back?

630
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,230
To catch me?

631
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,470
What?

632
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,510
Dong Sik!

633
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,510
- What is it?
- Dong Sik!

634
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,520
- There's a person.
- Wait. Hey.

635
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,560
I will request assistance.

636
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,540
Here...

637
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,150
on the warning notice,
you even put your name.

638
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,780
"Chairman Lee Chang Jin, Jin Li Construction".

639
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,890
Before you changed the company name
to JL Construction in 2006,

640
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,990
you had run a company called Jin Li Construction.
Is it correct?

641
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,590
You're still cute.

642
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,090
My Ji Hwa.

643
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,800
Speak Korean. Will you?

644
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,930
I don't want to.

645
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,470
People will think you're Korean-Russian.

646
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,340
Don't think about
pulling a trick on me with Russian...

647
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,750
you picked up at the nightclub
on Russia Street in Busan.

648
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,880
Speak your mother language.

649
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,880
Seriously.

650
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,990
No one knows better than me than my Ji Hwa.

651
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,960
Does this farm belong to you?

652
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,290
A skeleton was found in the farm today.

653
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,560
Are you the owner of the land?

654
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,570
Well, it says here.

655
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,870
"This is a private land
that belongs to Jin Li Construction."

656
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,340
"No public right of way."

657
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,110
"Violators will be prosecuted."

658
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,120
Then, don't you think
I should've received something in advance?

659
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,350
Like a search warrant.

660
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,550
Or a request for entry.

661
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,990
Without a warrant nor permission,
you entered a private land...

662
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,630
and found a skeleton.

663
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,060
Yet you wanted me to be present
at the police station immediately?

664
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh, my, Ji Hwa.

665
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,500
It seems like you still don't know the world.

666
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,400
- That's an abuse of power.
- Mr. Lee.

667
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,270
What was your relationship with Kang Jin Mook?

668
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,640
My relationship?

669
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,880
I can't remember at all.

670
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,950
I mean I can't remember
because I don't know him.

671
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,790
I would see him when a member
of a provincial council called me...

672
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,790
for advice on development or election.

673
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,220
But Ms. Oh.

674
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,290
Who is it?

675
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,630
The body.

676
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,830
Is it the college girl
who went missing in the 2000s?

677
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,500
Why would you want to know?

678
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,170
Because the land belongs to me.
I should know who was buried at least.

679
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Ms. Oh.

680
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,510
(Officer Kim: We're searching further.)

681
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,650
(There are more bodies found
besides the one found in the morning.)

682
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,920
Mr. Lee.

683
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,390
Do you really not know Kang Jin Mook?

684
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,590
- No, I don't.
- Then...

685
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,060
please write a paper
to grant an ex post facto permission...

686
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,390
to search your farm.

687
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,900
- I'm not sure about that.
- Lee Chang Jin.

688
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Do it.

689
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,170
Unless you want to get screwed.

690
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,640
Okay, I'll give you permission, ma'am.

691
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,540
Follow me to write the paper.

692
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,020
Dead bodies were found in the deer farm.
A lot.

693
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,820
What?

694
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,630
(Simju Deer Farm)

695
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,270
Dong Sik.

696
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,240
Just stay here.

697
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,680
Officer Yoon, Officer Lee.

698
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,180
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

699
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,190
What? What happened?

700
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,660
I can't tell because nothing is confirmed.

701
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,220
It's okay. Just say it.

702
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,230
We checked the teeth of all the dead bodies.

703
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
We only checked them with the naked eye.

704
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,600
Nothing is confirmed before we send them to NFS.

705
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,540
It's okay. Say it.

706
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,970
I don't think no one was in their 20s.

707
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,980
We can only be sure after NFS confirms it.

708
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,310
Right. I know.

709
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,480
It will take a long time.

710
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,020
Yes.

711
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,020
I'll go home and wait.

712
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,160
- Yes. Get on my car.
- I want to walk a little.

713
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,030
Good work. Bye.

714
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,440
Dong Sik, you're doing well, right?

715
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,750
He went to search Yu Yeon.

716
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,150
Don't worry.

717
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,790
We will find her.

718
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,390
- You came?
- Why did you come here?

719
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,930
Sorry. I didn't fix my habit yet.

720
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,710
You remember it, right?

721
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,410
I frequented your basement so much,

722
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,450
you were thinking of asking me to pay rent.

723
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,150
I thought you only sneaked into my basement.

724
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,650
This place also belongs to you.

725
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,760
I heard Kang Jin Mook left his will.

726
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,190
"Give half of my property to Kang Min Jung."

727
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,560
"And the other half to Lee Dong Sik."

728
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,560
Kang Min Jung is dead.

729
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,960
So it's all yours.

730
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,570
Is that why you've been breaking everything?

731
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,380
I don't feel like playing with you today.

732
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,280
Why not?
Because you couldn't find Yu Yeon again?

733
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,880
The news spread so quickly.

734
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,820
That's why you baited me back then.

735
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,660
Inspector Han, you're a lucky man.

736
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,130
Because I think you'll go back
to where you belong.

737
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,560
What do you mean?

738
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,130
You're out early in the morning...

739
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,970
for preparation.

740
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,810
You thought I would've bitten a good one...

741
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,210
because I'm good at preparing in advance.

742
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,210
It's really hard to fix a habit.

743
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,920
You still babble at me...

744
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,150
without doing anything yourself.

745
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,020
You're right.

746
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,190
I'm that kind of person.

747
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,430
You became cuter, Inspector Han.

748
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,660
You look very cute to me as well, Mr. Lee.

749
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,070
I wonder if you really want to find your sister.

750
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,300
It feels like you're putting on a show.

751
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
A show?

752
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,080
The person who gave Kang Jin Mook the fishing line
is still unknown.

753
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,850
Because at that time
when Kang Jin Mook committed suicide,

754
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:22,420
the CCTV at the Violent Crimes Unit of Munju Police Station...

755
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,650
happened to be broken.

756
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,930
(Death Certificate,
Postmortem Examination Certificate)

757
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,030
(Name: Yoon Mi Hye)

758
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,040
(Place: On the road)

759
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,550
The death certificate found
in Kang Jin Mook's stomach.

760
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,750
It's not something anyone can get.

761
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,880
It's either her family or the police.

762
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,650
As you know, Yoon Mi Hye was an orphan.

763
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,420
So this time, I killed Kang Jin Mook?

764
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,200
What are you talking about?
As if he's the only one you killed.

765
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,470
You also killed Kang Min Jung.

766
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,500
You found her finger
but didn't report it.

767
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,840
Because they're both dead...

768
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,510
everything they had including this house...

769
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,480
is yours now.

770
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,480
You're right.
This is my private property now.

771
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,250
So you should leave.

772
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,890
Han Ju Won.

773
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,370
When I find Yu Yeon,

774
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,540
- I will...
- Don't. You don't have to.

775
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,870
Because Lee Yu Yeon isn't important to me anymore.

776
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,250
Lee Dong Sik.

777
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:35,820
Did you know the word "law"
came from an animal called "xiezhi"?

778
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,390
It looks like a bull
but has horns on its head.

779
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,460
I heard it was very faithful.

780
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,960
It rammed into dishonest people...

781
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,760
and bit off unright people.

782
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,330
That's what the law used to be.

783
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,670
It rams into you and bites you off.

784
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,370
So are you planning to ram into me bite me off?

785
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:02,980
Yes.

786
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,880
If you're putting up a show right now,

787
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,920
it's shameful that you used your mother for this.

788
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,790
I know nothing about the love between mother and son.

789
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,360
But I know it's wrong to do it as a human being.

790
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,400
Guys like that should be torn into pieces.

791
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,870
I enjoyed listening to your resolution.

792
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,940
I hope you get what you want.

793
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,270
All right.

794
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,080
What are you doing?

795
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,380
What?

796
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,990
Is it you, Jin Mook?

797
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,560
Jin Mook.

798
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,760
I fed Min Jung and put her down for a nap.

799
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,770
So have a meal...

800
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,040
and go home.

801
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,110
Yu Yeon...

802
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,810
must be shivering outside.

803
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,380
And my Dong Sik...

804
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,220
must be somewhere cold too.

805
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:11,290
I can't stay in a warm room
when they're not.

806
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,400
I can't do that.

807
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,340
Don't do the construction work.

808
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,350
Just leave the boiler.

809
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,120
Jin Mook.

810
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,550
Don't do the construction work.

811
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,560
Mom.

812
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,190
What did you just say?

813
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,460
Who are you?

814
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,660
It's me. Dong Sik.

815
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,470
Did you just say construction work?

816
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
Did you do a construction work for the boiler?

817
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,310
I'm really sorry.

818
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,680
I have sinned greatly.

819
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,180
I lost a child so I have sinned greatly.

820
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,290
- No, don't say that, Mom.
- I have sinned.

821
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,890
Don't say that.

822
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,960
My children are shivering with cold.

823
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,910
I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying.

824
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,410
I sent Yu Yeon back to you.

825
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,420
Yu Yeon.

826
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,860
You were here.

827
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,360
I didn't know.

828
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,760
I swear I didn't know you were in here.

829
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,150
I know...

830
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,350
I'm too late.

831
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,760
I'm so sorry.

832
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,350
Chief Nam Sang Bae.

833
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:42,900
Thank you.

834
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,270
I heard you were at the farm all day.

835
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,900
You must be tired.
So why did you stop by?

836
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,810
Jae Yi, there's something...

837
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,140
I really need to ask you.

838
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,680
Me?

839
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,820
I went to Busan several times.

840
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,020
Jae Yi, you should become a cop.

841
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,620
How come you're so good at running away?

842
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,870
About the day you were caught on the dashcam.

843
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,340
I'm talking about
the day you stopped by the station.

844
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,580
You...

845
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,310
saw me, didn't you?

846
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,640
Why are you shaking so much?

847
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,480
Are you scared of me?

848
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,920
- Mr. Nam.
- Yes.

849
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,120
Kang Jin Mook. Did you kill him?

850
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,470
You were really here.

851
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,140
What is it?
Why are you guys walking around in a group?

852
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:33,340
Well...

853
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,410
A warrant for an emergency apprehension was issued.

854
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,280
Why? Is it because of the dashcam video?

855
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,480
No, the evidence...

856
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,760
Anyway, I came myself. I thought I had to.

857
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,300
Nam Sang Bae,

858
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,130

You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a lawyer.

861
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,180
You have the chance to defend yourself.
You have the right...

862
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,340
to seek a writ of habeas corpus.

863
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,650
All right.

864
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,020
(Oh Ji Hwa)

865
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,260
Yes, Ji Hwa.

866
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,660
Lee Dong Sik.
Come to Munju Police Station right now.

867
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,890
Chief Nam is under emergency arrest.

- Hi.
- Did you find anything?

870
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,140
- Search everything in here.
- Search them all.

871
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,180
Nothing has been found.

872
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,110
- Of course, I know.
- Yes.

873
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:53,780
Dong Sik.

874
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,180
Yu Yeon is not the one.

875
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,690
(Not the one)

876
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,620
(Please help us find the missing Yu Yeon.)

879
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,430
Why did you bring the fishing line
and the death certificate?

880
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,360
Do you have evidence?

881
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,260
Do you really think you belong to Manyang?

Do you think that person...

883
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,500
isn't hiding anything from you?

884
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,170
In 2000, what happened to Lee Yu Yeon?

885
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,940
What happened to Lee Yu Yeon?

886
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,750
Were you here?

887
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:08,350
Let go of me.

888
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,390
Did you kill Kang Jin Mook?

889
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,720
The suspect's car is an older model
of a silver SUV.

890
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,490
I will not miss him and chase him.

I will catch this jerk no matter what.
