00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,870
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,660
You haven't...

4
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,359
responded yet.

5
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,510
Your son, Inspector Han.

6
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,650
What if he finds out about all this?

7
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,079
Then will you kill your son too?

8
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,219
Why do you have to bring that up?

9
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,529
Because I need to know
how far you're willing to go.

10
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,689
How far?

11
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:27,900
How dare you...

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,159
Who do you think is responsible for all this?

13
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,870
Your son and his partner are poking around.

14
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:38,639
But you promoted that nut case Lee Dong Sik.

15
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,109
And that's why you ruined your hearing.

16
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,049
Let's face it.
Everything happened because of you.

17
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,850
Because of what you did 21 years ago.

18
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,790
If you hadn't killed that girl,

19
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,659
we wouldn't be in such a mess.

20
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,790
What do you mean, kill?

21
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,460
It was a mistake.
A minor mistake.

22
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,430
A minor...

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,900
mistake...

24
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,380
Have you heard of that Aesop's fable?

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,250
The one about the race
between a rabbit and a turtle?

26
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:28,489
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

27
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,160
While the rabbit was sleeping,

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,200
the turtle kept on going...

29
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,570
and finally won the race.
You know the story, right?

30
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,829
What do you think
we should learn from the story?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
That a complacent attitude will ruin your life?

32
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:44,769
No.

33
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,139
If the stronger one doesn't make any mistake,

34
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,010
there's no way for the weaker one to win.

35
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,880
Han Ju Won.

36
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,649
Yes, he's my son.

37
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,290
But he takes after his mother more than me.

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,989
They wait for others to reach out to them.

39
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,260
But they're so weak
that they can't reach out to others first.

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,760
Ju Won.

41
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,440
Come and hold me.

42
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,269
If someone reaches out to them,

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Ju Won, come and hold me.

44
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,239
Ju Won.

45
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,209
Please come and hold me.

46
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,880
they just can't accept it.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,450
They pretend they’re okay,
strong, and cold-hearted.

48
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,160
They pretend their whole life...

49
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,429
but end up destroying themselves.

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,929
Pathetic people.

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,399
Chairman Lee, I am never...

52
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,809
going to make a mistake again.

53
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:56,639
But what if your son is your mistake?

54
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,780
Then will you get rid of him?

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,720
If you're curious,
you can just keep your eyes on him.

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,030
Lee Yu Yeon, your sister.

57
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,970
Are you sure...

58
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,299
you didn't kill her?

59
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,770
Then what will you do with his partner,
Lee Dong Sik?

60
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,840
I'm just saying
because I'm worried he might hold you down...

61
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,879
as he snoops around everywhere like a nut case.

62
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,509
There's no police officer in Korea who can arrest me.

63
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,249
You're right.
I know you'll become the Commissioner General.

64
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:15,390
You can forget about Kang Jin Mook.

65
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:19,059
Who cares what that dead man saw?
It's not that important.

66
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,530
The real problem is Do Hae Won.

67
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,830
What and how much...

68
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,929
did she hear from Kang Jin Mook?

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,569
What do you mean, she heard something?

70
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,939
Before Kang Jin Mook died, he told me this.

71
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,609
"Didn't you hear anything..."

72
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,609
Didn't you hear anything from the councilwoman?

73
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:42,619
The councilwoman? Do Hae Won?

74
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,160
Nothing?

75
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,890
What should I have heard?

76
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,730
You people keep...

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,299
lots of secrets from each other too.

78
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,939
That means she kept her mouth shut to this day.

79
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,369
If she's holding onto another secret...

80
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:09,009
other than how she hid the report
with her son's fingerprint...

81
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,239
What is it?

82
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,080
It's...

83
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,189
Man, I have no idea either.

84
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,759
That's for you, Chief Superintendent...

85
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,989
I mean, Commissioner General, to find out.

86
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,299
Goodness.

87
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,140
They all deserve to die.

88
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,119
They all deserve to die.

92
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,710
I promise.

93
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,509
I'll be in contact.

(Han Ju Won)

95
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,689
Come in for now.

96
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,030
Did he see me?

97
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,970
Did that man see me...

98
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,939
on that day?

99
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,840
So Kang Jin Mook saw me...

100
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,679
getting into that accident,

101
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,109
hitting Lee Yu Yeon...

102
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:28,780
on that day?

103
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,390
You haven't...

104
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,860
responded yet.

105
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,229
Did he see me?

106
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,000
Did that man see me on that day?

107
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,809
So Kang Jin Mook saw me...

108
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,740
getting into that accident,

109
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,179
hitting Lee Yu Yeon...

110
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,049
on that day?

111
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,819
Mr. Lee.

112
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,459
- Move aside.
- I...

113
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,030
I'll do it.

114
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:19,929
What?

115
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:24,069
I will catch him.

116
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:31,010
What can you do if you run over to him now?

117
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,809
Do you think you'll get an apology...

118
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:36,020
if you play this for him?

119
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,449
It was recorded without his knowledge.

120
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,189
It can't be used as evidence.

121
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,120
Even if we disclose it to the world,

122
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,760
he'll blame everything on Lee Chang Jin.

123
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,530
- I can just kill him.
- I'll do that.

124
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:51,929
You're covering for your dad.

125
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,099
I'll lay a trap for him.

126
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:58,469
I'll be the bait.

127
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,709
I'll become a monster,

128
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,910
grab Han Gi Hwan in my arms,

129
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:08,679
then drop down...

130
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,250
into a pit of fire from the highest place.

131
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,790
That's how I'll make my apology.

132
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,400
That is...

133
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,069
the best way of avenging that man.

134
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,469
If I don't do it...

135
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,339
No, if I can't seem to do it,
feel free to expose...

136
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,809
that recording to the world.

137
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,880
You can't...

138
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,920
do this anymore.

139
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,990
Please don't do this.

140
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:54,660
I will...

141
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,479
I will...

142
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,110
be tormented.

143
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,000
The confirmation hearing for Han Gi Hwan,

144
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,170
the Commissioner General nominee
will be resumed tomorrow at 10am.

145
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,110
On the 26th, 10 days ago,

146
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,969
the hearing was held for nominee Han Gi Hwan.

147
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,179
However, the nominee's son,

148
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,949
Inspector Han of Manyang Substation was...

149
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,049
arrested without a warrant
during the hearing,

150
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:48,949
putting a halt in the hearing.

151
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,219
The next day, the nominee, Han,

152
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:53,490
announced that Inspector Han had been suspended.

153
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,990
Once again, he promised
to conduct a fair investigation...

154
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,959
without making any exceptions.

155
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,660
This incident broke out
before he managed to explain...

156
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,400
the suspicion of bribery...

157
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,829
during the hearing prior to this incident.

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,599
Many are skeptical of the nominee's...

159
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm done making breakfast.
Where are you going?

160
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:20,849
To work.

161
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,620
Work? To do what?

162
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,920
I'm a councilwoman of Munju,

163
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,189
and a future mayoral candidate.

164
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,689
I got enough rest.
I should get back to work.

165
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,689
I thought you were quitting.

166
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,059
You did? Why should I?

167
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,599
Don't come near me.
You'll get water on me.

168
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:48,839
Wasn't it enough...

169
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,079
you did something like that,
then hid it for 20 years?

170
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,150
And now what?

171
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,849
Work as a councilwoman of Munju?

172
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,020
The least you can do is turn yourself in,

173
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,689
- but you're going to run for mayor?
- Why...

174
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,490
do you think I did that?

175
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,130
Who do you think...

176
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,569
made me struggle for the last 20 years...

177
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,599
trying to hide what happened?

178
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,209
Yet you always find your friend...

179
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,809
more precious than me, don't you?

180
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,410
- Mom, that's not what I meant.
- Jeong Je.

181
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:33,120
Can you still hear the cry of that deer?

182
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,760
- What?
- When you were younger,

183
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,530
I used to lock you up in your dad's deer farm.

184
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,599
I was sick and tired of you.

185
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,270
You couldn't look me in the eyes,
so your timidness annoyed me.

186
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,170
- Mom.
- Whenever you said...

187
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,270
you can see deer...

188
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,709
and that you can hear a deer cry,

189
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,380
I began to think I probably drove you insane.

190
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,780
That's when I braced myself...

191
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:03,179
and did my best to live as your mother.

192
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:07,319
For over 20 years,
I've been trying really hard.

193
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,959
But, Park Jeong Je,

194
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,760
shall we stop here now?

195
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,929
- Mother.
- Mother.

196
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,569
I think I have done enough of being that.

197
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,910
Maternal love isn't something for me,

198
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,610
and yet I have been pretending to have
that for such a long time.

199
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,040
Now, I need to get my name back.

200
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,209
I need to be myself.

201
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,420
I need to live as Do Hae Won.
Don't you think?

202
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,920
So Park Jeong Je,

203
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,189
I want you to just listen...

204
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,559
to the sound of the deer coming.

205
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,849
Let's go.

206
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,160
(Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan
Holds a Confirmation Hearing)

207
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,939
Sorry to bother you at this early hour, Jae Yi.

208
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,870
Don't worry.
This is just adding a few more rice bowls.

209
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,069
I'm happy that I'm not alone.

210
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,780
Where's Dong Sik?

211
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,179
He went to the senior care center
to visit her mother today.

212
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,709
What about Jeong Je?

213
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,250
I don't know.

214
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,420
He doesn't answer his phone.

215
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,790
Have you heard from Mr. Han yet?

216
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,459
I haven't heard anything from him.

217
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,360
Hasn't he come home yet?

218
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,229
Do Su visited his place yesterday,

219
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,299
and he said there seemed to
have been no one in there.

220
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,799
Dong Sik said he's going to be okay.

221
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,640
He must be fine. Don't worry.

222
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,240
Why would I worry about him?

223
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:10,410
I worry about him a bit.

224
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,579
Parents and children are humans too, after all,

225
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,620
but this is just so complicated.

226
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:21,760
The relationship between parents and children
is never easy.

227
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,319
If it were so easy,
they wouldn't have become family to begin with.

228
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,160
You said once our mom came back,
you would leave everything to her...

229
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,599
and just go back to Busan.

230
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,660
When I go to Busan

231
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,870
You've been singing that all the time.
What happened to you?

232
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,670
What's that?

233
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,199
That woman has gone to Busan.

234
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,209
Sisters, enjoy your meal.

235
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,880
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks.

236
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,620
Mom.

237
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,390
Do you remember?

238
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,229
You always told me,

239
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,900
whenever people compared me to Yu Yeon,

240
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,209
that it's not so important
to become a successful person.

241
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,949
You said pooping well,
eating well, sleeping well,

242
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,350
and not hurting others are what make life great.

243
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,620
You said that.

244
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,400
You shouldn't get hurt anymore.

245
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,410
You shouldn't be broken like me.

246
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,580
Please give me some more time.

247
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,650
I will do...

248
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:02,090
whatever it takes to catch him.

249
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,300
Dong Sik.

250
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:25,779
Me?

251
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,110
Don't skip...

252
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,920
your meals.

253
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,390
Make sure...

254
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,289
you don't skip your meals.

255
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,529
Okay.

256
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,670
Don't skip your meals.

257
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:02,380
Let's eat.

258
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,219
(Han Ju Won, Let's eat.)

259
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,080
Why did you want to eat with me,
all of a sudden?

260
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,650
Gosh, look at your face.

261
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,449
You've been starving.

262
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,789
Let's go in.

263
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:48,929
Thank you.

264
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
What's wrong?

265
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,400
Oh, right.

266
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,269
You didn't eat the blowfish soup either.

267
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,179
I guess you don't like fish soup.

268
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,880
I don't.

269
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,249
This is not like other fish soup.

270
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,380
If I hadn't told you what this was,

271
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,489
you would have had no idea
if this was fish soup with noodles.

272
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,920
You should try it first.

273
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,900
Gosh, it tastes so good. It's so refreshing.

274
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:31,570
It's not bad, right?

275
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,340
It tastes good.

276
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,459
You were crying in the rain then,

277
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,929
but look at you now, enjoying the noodles.

278
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,560
Crying?

279
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,999
I didn't cry.

280
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,269
Well, maybe you didn't.

281
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,209
I will...

282
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,749
be tormented.

283
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,160
About that recording...

284
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,729
I saved the file using different methods.

285
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,969
So that if you get out of my sight,

286
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,400
I can spread it right away.

287
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,100
That will never happen.

288
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,080
The hearing will be held tomorrow.

289
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,820
Tonight, I'm going to head back to Seoul.

290
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,779
To meet your father?

291
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,890
Yes.

292
00:21:58,689 --> 00:21:59,830
Eat up.

293
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm good.

294
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,330
Even when your family die, you get hungry.

295
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,600
In the end, you will have to eat anyway.

296
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,070
So why would you starve yourself?

297
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,449
You wouldn't want to be hungry
while in your fiery pit.

298
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,120
I guess you're right.

299
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:03,759
Are you going to the hearing?

300
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,729
Why wouldn't I be?

301
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,860
I'm not sure.

302
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:18,039
After being gone for a week,

303
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,310
are you saying, "I'm not sure"?

304
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,969
You told me to get out of your sight.

305
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,070
Han Ju Won.

306
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,979
I'm not sure what you're thinking,

307
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:27,979
but you shouldn't do anything...

308
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,219
I, too,

309
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,719
don't want to do anything.

310
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,860
But I'm afraid you would ruin everything.

311
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,259
So I can't do that.

312
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,729
What?

313
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,140
The one who sent me there,

314
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:54,310
and the one who ordered me
to kill Kang Jin Mook.

315
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,140
It was all you, you jerk.

316
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,850
After all that,
you're trying to backstab me?

317
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,019
Did he see me?

318
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,660
Did that man see me on that day?

319
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,660
So Kang Jin Mook saw me...

320
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:15,999
getting into that accident,

321
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,400
hitting Lee Yu Yeon...

322
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,929
on that day?

323
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,469
They all deserve to die.

324
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,660
Breaking it doesn't make any difference.

325
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,929
There's no way...

326
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,630
I saved the file to this phone only.

327
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,400
You jerk!

328
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:59,969
Take your hands off me.

329
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,840
You're getting blood on my clothes.

330
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,120
What do you want?

331
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,890
What I want...

332
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,560
is for you to become Commissioner General.

333
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,630
- What?
- Why?

334
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,900
Did you think
I would drag you down or something?

335
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,140
I'm Han Ju Won.

336
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,370
- Your son.
- My son?

337
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,179
Yes. Father.

338
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,320
I should be the next Commissioner General,
don't you think?

339
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,289
So you must become Commissioner General now.

340
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,160
I'll help you.

341
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,729
How?

342
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:56,999
Stop getting stabbed from behind by those
who should be gotten rid of.

343
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,699
And hold my hand.

344
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,840
Father.

345
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,810
You must become Commissioner General.

346
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,179
Don't even leave a single stain on me.

347
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,360
Thank you, son.

348
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,600
Don't mention it.
It's what I should do.

349
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,370
You're going to remove the recording, aren't you?

350
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,499
Oh, yes.

351
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,870
If you do me a favour.

352
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,110
What is it?

353
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,910
I'll immediately return to work.

354
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,179
General Investigation Unit
at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

355
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,610
- What?
- We should catch Jung Cheol Mun.

356
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,279
We can't just hit him from behind
and throw him into water.

357
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,189
You're making small mistakes
because of that method.

358
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,289
Father.

359
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,330
Those who legally have guns and handcuffs like us.

360
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,870
We should get rid of them in the same way.

361
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,100
Please have me return to work.

362
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,239
Father.

363
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:18,080
I, a candidate for a government official,

364
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,679
swear I will tell the truth...

365
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,519
without concealing or fabricating anything...

366
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,350
according to my conscience.

367
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,160
The hearing on the appointee
for Commissioner General...

368
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,120
resumed at 10am today at the National Assembly.

369
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,259
It has been revealed...

370
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,160
that Inspector Han Ju Won
who was arrested without a warrant...

371
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,699
at the hearing was ordered...

372
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,769
to return to General Investigation Unit
at the Seoul Police Agency,

373
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:44,499
which prompted questions from the Peninsular Party.

374
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,570
How long has it been...

375
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,370
since you promised a fair
and incorrupt investigation?

376
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,080
How can you back pedal so easily?

377
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,519
Inspector Lee Dong Sik
who arrested my son at the hearing...

378
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,019
led the investigation
and that's what his conclusion.

379
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,320
"You can just watch," he said.

380
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,920
But what is he doing?

381
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,499
I guess you two did something behind me again.

382
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:11,660
No way.

383
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,429
Yes, you're an outcast.

384
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:18,499
Did you solve the issue with your son?

385
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,810
My son?

386
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,439
Do I have a son?

387
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:24,340
That doesn't sound anything like you?

388
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,850
They say people die when they change.

389
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,850
Why? Are you going to kill me?

390
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,219
That won't be easy.

391
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:37,360
I will become the mayor of Munju
no matter what.

392
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,929
Of course.
You will become a mayor no matter what.

393
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,300
Why would I kill you?

394
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,769
If you can raise
the approval rate of the candidate in last place...

395
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:48,070
by just a little...

396
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,739
Only development...

397
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,900
can raise the approval rate.

398
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:58,380
You know, Oh Il Construction...

399
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,150
If what happened 21 years ago...

400
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,219
is brought up with that...

401
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:08,189
What happened 21 years ago? What?

402
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,820
Someone...

403
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,130
Buried it until they died.

404
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,029
A very precious secret?

405
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,009
You...

406
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:34,009
didn't hear anything
from Kang Jin Mook, that jerk, did you?

407
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:36,779
If you had,

408
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,320
there's no way you didn't know it back then.

409
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,590
So what is it?

410
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,920
The guitar pick...

411
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,259
that was found near...

412
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:49,929
where Bang Ju Seon died.

413
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,529
The one that belongs to Lee Dong Sik?

414
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,870
What about that?

415
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,370
My son, Jeong Je's fingerprints were on it.

416
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,880
Gosh.

417
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,779
I didn't know
you had a 21-year-old secret from me.

418
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:12,920
Please, assemblywoman!

419
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,929
Do you even know
what it means that you didn't know?

420
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,459
You don't even know
what I'm talking about, do you?

421
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:30,870
I'm not sure.

422
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,269
Do I or don't I?

423
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,949
Mr. Lee. We've seen each other
for over 20 years.

424
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:42,949
Do you think I don't know you?

425
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
Don't put on a show.

426
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,989
If the development plan is cancelled again,

427
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,100
I won't stay still. I mean it.

428
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,170
Solve the issue...

429
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,269
and raise my approval rate.

430
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,939
Okay?

431
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,509
Please.

432
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:17,719
(A suspicion he tried to
conceal the Munju college student case...)

433
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,390
Hello. It's JCM.

434
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,699
Let's meet tomorrow.

435
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,969
JCM.

436
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,939
Jung Cheol Mun.

437
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:40,310
This scumbag.

438
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,789
Lee Chang Jin. He's late.

439
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,689
He's not in his right mind.

440
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:23,150
(Car Registration)

441
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,420
(My Dong Sik)

442
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:50,209
I'm going to hook you!

443
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,679
You're a fighter.

444
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,030
You're a fighter.

445
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,310
Nice shot!

446
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,430
Goodness, what brings you here, Inspector Lee?

447
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,330
Why would I be at a reservoir?

448
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,900
I came to fish.

449
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,200
Here? Of all places?

450
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,540
Why did you clap? I lost that fish.

451
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,010
Goodness, what a loss.

452
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,780
But that was a really nice shot just now.

453
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,910
Isn't that so, Mr. Lee Chang Jin?

454
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,780
Nice shot? What are you saying?
I wasn't playing golf.

455
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,390
Don't people say that while fishing?

456
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,420
It goes really well with it, though.

457
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,660
Anyway, Mr. Lee.
What brings you here?

458
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,400
There's a storage I own over there.

459
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
The storage is over there?
So why are you here?

460
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,340
I really love to fish.

461
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,740
I stopped by to see
how abundant the water is today.

462
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,750
And you just happened to
run into Superintendent Jung?

463
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,150
Yes, what are the chances?

464
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,450
Please excuse me, then.

465
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,320
Superintendent Jung,
have a nice time fishing.

466
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,560
Sure.

467
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,530
Wait, what are the chances
of running into each other?

468
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,260
Let's have a talk at the Seoul Police Agency.

469
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,900
What are you talking about?

470
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,070
I'm here to do my job
as the General Investigation Unit.

471
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,340
Hey, I'm sorry.

472
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,910
But I'm a little busy today.

473
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,850
If you send me a summons,
I'll make sure I show up.

474
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,560
Inspector Lee.

475
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,260
I have no idea how you found me here, but...

476
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,600
I traced your phone...

477
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,800
illegally.

478
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,100
What?

479
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,870
You crazy idiot.
Are you insane?

480
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,140
Superintendent Jung, you know,

481
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,870
I just saved your life.

482
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,440
I stopped that jerk...

483
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,680
from striking you with his cane to kill you.

484
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,850
You should be careful, really.

485
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,420
It's not Jung Cheol Mun's turn yet.

486
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,660
Hey, you. Lee Dong Sik!

487
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,790
- Are you threatening me right now?
- Yes, I am threatening you.

488
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,670
Mr. Lee Chang Jin!

489
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,500
Come and talk to me.

490
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,710
If you don't want to go to Seoul,
we can talk here.

491
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,860
How cute.

492
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Let me escort you to the Seoul Police Agency.

493
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,680
- Why?
- You can't say anything stupid.

494
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,140
What?

495
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,650
My father needs to get appointed
as the Commissioner General.

496
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,890
So you better...

497
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,190
watch what you say,

498
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,230
Mr. Lee Chang Jin.

499
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's go.

500
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,250
Did you have to rush all the way here,
Inspector Han?

501
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,190
You'll save yourself from problems in the future...

502
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,230
if we conducted the investigation as partners,
Inspector Lee.

503
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,230
In the future. Problems in the future?

504
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,430
Aren't you here to keep a watch
for your father's sake?

505
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,070
You're right. I'm here to keep my eyes on you.

506
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,580
- Me?
- You're infamous for illegal acts.

507
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,440
The General Investigation Unit...

508
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,580
arrests officers who conduct the investigation...

509
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,780
in illegal methods.

510
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,220
Is that so?

511
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,450
Okay, that's enough.

512
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,360
Thanks for the show.

513
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,790
In a nutshell,

514
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,860
you two are trying to show me...

515
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,330
that there's bad blood between you two.

516
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,800
Is it something like that?

517
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:11,770
What are you talking about?
We're in a great relationship.

518
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,140
Let's begin the investigation.

519
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,540
About that leg.

520
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,110
That leg? My leg?

521
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,320
You'd limp, then walk fine,
then you'd limp again.

522
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,620
Does your pain go on and off?

523
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,390
From what I heard,
you also go on and off medicine...

524
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,860
because of the pain in your legs.

525
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,900
I heard you take lots of painkillers.

526
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,530
Do you do any drugs?

527
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,170
Goodness, don't say that.

528
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,970
Why are you so interested in me?

529
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,100
You're making me feel shy.

530
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,640
I stopped taking painkillers.

531
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,780
I was no longer in pain
since the day I found Yu Yeon.

532
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,780
But now that I'm here looking at you,

533
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,450
I'm starting to feel the pain again.

534
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,920
That's why I want to ask you this.

535
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,260
Between 10pm to midnight
on February 5 this year,

536
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,930
what were you doing?

537
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,300
February 5.

538
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,370
That's the day Chief Nam Sang Bae passed.

539
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,540
That's pretty late,

540
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,970
so I was probably at home.

541
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,010
In that case, on November 10 of last year,

542
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,020
where were you and what were you doing
between 4am to 5:30am?

543
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,350
What happened on that day?

544
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,020
Kang Jin Mook died.

545
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,660
Why are you asking me about the day he died?

546
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,060
Wait.

547
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,590
Let me try to recall.

548
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,060
Yes, right.

549
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,630
I think I was home on that day too.

550
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,010
You were home.

551
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,640
I wonder where Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan was.

552
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,650
Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan?

553
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,880
Why do you suddenly bring him up?

554
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,120
I just got curious.

555
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,050
Isn't this a time to ask questions?

556
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,320
We are the ones...

557
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,820
asking questions.

558
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,260
You'll just answer the questions...

559
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,430
No.

560
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,400
Mr. Lee.

561
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,070
Ask away.

562
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,140
I mean, I'm just saying
I don't want to just answer...

563
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,970
the questions as asked.

564
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,640
I actually have many things to say right now.

565
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,350
October 15, 2000.

566
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,580
To be exact, it was October 14.

567
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,750
I'd like to talk about that day.

568
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,160
Go ahead and spill it out.

569
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,930
I was with Do Hae Won,

570
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,630
who was the chairwoman
of Gwanghyo Foundation at that time...

571
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,430
and Inspector Han's father,

572
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,070
Chief Han Gi Hwan,
the chief of Munju Station at that time.

573
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,900
The three of us had a drink that night.

574
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,410
We had a meeting regarding Oh Il Construction,

575
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,940
the one brought up during his hearing yesterday.

576
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,510
That company belonged to your mother,
Inspector Han, right?

577
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,450
This was the testimony
I gave to my dear Ji Hwa...

578
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,060
and her minion.

579
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,690
Oh Il Construction was the first
to make a bid...

580
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,430
to be the constructor
of Munju's development we planned.

581
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,100
Han Gi Hwan, the superintendent of that time,

582
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,300
offered to come and grab a drink
just to see me.

583
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,610
I figured he was going to bribe me
to help out his wife's company.

584
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,940
Back then, your mother's company
wasn't in a good shape,

585
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,550
like a lamp faced with a wind.

586
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,820
And?

587
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,790
And just as I expected,
he asked me to do him a favour...

588
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,220
and drop her company.

589
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,630
- What?
- Inspector Han.

590
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,370
You saw his hearing yesterday, right?

591
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,200
He's an amazing guy.

592
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,570
He's a police officer
who's unbelievably upright...

593
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,740
back 20 years ago and even now.

594
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,240
I was totally touched...

595
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,910
when he said this yesterday.

596
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,850
What did you just say?

597
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,080
Did you say you want to know
why the suspect of the murders...

598
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,150
in Munju killed all those people?

599
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,260
And did you just say you want to know...

600
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,420
the women's occupations?

601
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,690
Why do you want to know that?

602
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,330
Are you telling me to narrate the story...

603
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,070
of that murderer in front of the entire nation?

604
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,940
Listen.

605
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,500
Taking someone's precious life is...

606
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,040
the most brutal kind of crime
a human being can commit.

607
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,340
We must never share
the back story of such criminals...

608
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,810
no matter what the reason is.

609
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,780
What I am saying is...

610
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,350
we shall not let those people take the microphone.

611
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,320
Goodness, the microphone was too close to him.

612
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,490
His voice is ringing in my ears.

613
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,430
Inspector Lee.
I think this is enough for today.

614
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,700
- No, I don't think it's enough.
- I don't think so either.

615
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,000
What happened on October 15 early in the morning.

616
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,530
I haven't said anything about that yet.

617
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,070
Okay. Go on.

618
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,740
That day, Chief Superintendent Han...

619
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,010
insisted I drop Oh Il Construction.

620
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,050
He drank a lot until the next morning.

621
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,850
He even tried to drive his car.

622
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,490
So I...

623
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,990
My goodness.
I told you I'll drive you home.

624
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,630
Let him go.
He insists on driving back himself.

625
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,030
I'm leaving too. Bye.

626
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,390
I drove him home.

627
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
You drove him home?

628
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,060
Yes. Because I didn't drink much that night.

629
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,860
Wait a minute. That night...

630
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,360
someone did drive under the influence of alcohol.

631
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,830
It was Councilwoman Do.

632
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,000
Oh, right.

633
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,340
Inspector Lee, didn't your sister disappear...

634
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,780
early in the morning that day?

635
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,480
I heard the injuries to her bones say...

636
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,520
that she was in a car accident, right?

637
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,690
You make it sound like
Councilwoman Do caused an accident.

638
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,190
No, no. I can't be sure of that.

639
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,730
But she did sell the deer farm to our company.

640
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,470
Bodies of Kang Jin Mook's victims
were found at the place.

641
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,500
So I was summoned by Ji Hwa many times.

642
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,170
Jin Li Construction owned the property.

643
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,380
But Councilwoman Do managed the place.

644
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,580
I didn't even get the key to the place.

645
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,280
I wonder how Kang Jin Mook got access...

646
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,920
and buried the bodies there.

647
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,520
Mr. Lee Chang Jin.

648
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,920
If something happens to Councilwoman Do,

649
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,890
won't it ruin your redevelopment project...

650
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,600
in Munju?

651
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,460
Why would it ruin the project?

652
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,530
It's not like she's the mayor of Munju.

653
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,900
She just owns a lot of land around there.

654
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,540
So you think you don't need Councilwoman Do...

655
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,880
to push the project forward.

656
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,980
Come on. You can't put it like that.

657
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,750
She needs to take some rest now.

658
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,420
Her crazy son is in a loony bin.

659
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,820
What?

660
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,790
I'm talking about Park Jeong Je.

661
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,960
He's a grown man
but he was dragged by his mother...

662
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,160
and got locked up in a mental institute.

663
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,900
Aren't you his friend?

664
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,830
But you didn't even know about it?

665
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,570
Gosh, how can you call yourself his friend?

666
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,570
Just go get him out of there.

667
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,540
I think that's enough for today.
You may leave.

668
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,880
Seriously? Will you let me go as well?

669
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,520
Yes. You'll be hearing from me again.

670
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,720
Okay. Call me whenever you need me.

671
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,350
I should help you
since you're Ji Hwa's friend.

672
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,390
Thank you, Inspector Han.

673
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,230
Gosh, my leg hurts.

674
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,340
My goodness.

675
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,340
Goodbye.

676
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,450
Darn it.

677
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,380
It was a magnificent show.

678
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,550
But we weren't the leading roles.

679
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,850
Lee Chang Jin...

680
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,120
and Han Gi Hwan were.

681
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,090
Maybe they...

682
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,660
decided to leave Councilwoman Do out.

683
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,210
(Park Jeong Je)

684
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,440
The number you dialled does not exist.

685
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,310
Please check and try again.

686
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,680
Hi. I need to find someone.

687
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,520
Someone who's admitted to a mental institute.

688
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,590
I'll text you his personal information.

689
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,320
Find him as soon as possible.

690
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,120
Father?

691
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,990
Tell him.
It doesn't matter if he knows.

692
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,230
Who was that?

693
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,200
He's a prosecutor
from Munju District Prosecutors' Office.

694
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,370
He's actually a lot like my father.

695
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,540
He's like a son to my father.

696
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,180
Why do you think they decided to leave her out?

697
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,280
Why did he have to tell us about Jeong Je?

698
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,820
It seems like he's trying to stall us.

699
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,650
Inspector Lee, I think Superintendent Jung...

700
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,320
Hey, are you keeping your eye on Jung Cheol Mun?

701
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,590
So where are you right now?

702
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,200
He's in the office.

703
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,540
- Did anyone else go in?
- No one.

704
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,680
Sir, this is Oh Ji Hwa. Are you inside?

705
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,580
Sir?

706
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,060
Inspector Han.

707
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,700
Inspector Lee. Why are you all here?

708
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,860
(Head of Munju Police Station Jung Cheol Mun)

709
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,770
Are you going somewhere?

710
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,700
Oh dear.

711
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,610
Haven't you heard from your father?

712
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,110
I thought I won't be able to
go back to the Police Agency.

713
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,080
But Chief Superintendent Han...

714
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,510
assigned me to the intelligence department there.

715
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,480
I guess we do not know what may happen tomorrow.

716
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,150
Don't you think so, Inspector Lee?

717
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,230
Inspector Oh, thank you for everything.

718
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,670
I'll talk to the others
when I'm officially assigned.

719
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:21,470
Let's keep it between us until then.

720
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,870
Certainly, sir.

721
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,840
I'll drive you there.

722
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,710
Okay. You know where the Geumya Housing Area is, right?

723
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,210
- Yes, sir.
- Do Su, drive safely.

724
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,480
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

725
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,120
Inspector Han,
you know blood is thicker than water, right?

726
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,090
Don't you forget that, all right?

727
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,490
Good night, sir.

728
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,370
- I'll follow the car.
- I'll go with you.

729
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,240

731
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,950
Yes. Did you find him?

732
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,750
Where?

733
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,150
The outskirts of Munju?

734
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,920
The outskirts of Munju?
What is he talking about?

735
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,460
Ji Hwa, go on ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

736
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,730
Okay. I'll see you later.

737
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,370
Where are you right now?

738
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,320
Where are you right now?

739
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,860
Right now? I'm at home.

740
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,060
You can text him now.

741

Inspector Lee, may I use your phone?

745
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,560
My battery went dead
so I couldn't get the location.

746
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,930
Thank you.

- Okay.
- Whose phone is this?

751

You're not at home.
You're with Father, aren't you?

as Commissioner General.

Yes, sir.

Yes.

01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,620
- Are you sure it's Kang Jin Mook?
- Yes.

826
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:37,620
Keep holding onto it
and get thrown on the ground together.

827
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,560
Or let go of it when you have a chance.

828
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,830
Take a break for a while.

829
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,560
I'll take care of it.

830
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:49,070
Do you think Jeong Je can handle it?

831
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,570
I'm sorry, Dong Sik.

832
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:53,170
Can you ask my mom about it?

833
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,110
Jin Mook.

834
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,380
The one who committed the crime
should be the one who pays for it.

835
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,750
Ju Won.
