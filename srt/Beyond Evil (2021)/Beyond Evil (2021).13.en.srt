1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,840
(All characters, organizations, locations,)

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,471
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,380
(Gyeonggi 23 M 2965)

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,621
(Munju Hyang)

5
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,487
Let me pour you a drink, sir.

6
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,227
No, thanks. I have to drive.

7
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:57,426
Oh, come on.
You're late, so have a drink.

8
00:00:57,426 --> 00:01:00,996
We've been dreaming of redeveloping Munju.

9
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:02,697
And it's right around the corner.

10
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,236
Congratulations.

11
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:08,076
Now that Jin Li Construction
is in charge of the project,

12
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,406
you're going to make a lot of money.

13
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:13,207
And Do Hae Won,
the chairwoman of Gwanghyo Foundation will...

14
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,847
use this opportunity to enter the political world.

15
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:18,317
Yes, thank you.

16
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:19,716
But I guess the real hero was...

17
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,486
Superintendent Han
who let us get rid of the landowners...

18
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:25,587
who were holding out against the development.

19
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:29,097
- So let me pour you a drink.
- No, thanks. If you'll excuse me.

20
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:32,597
They say the bidding war
for the contractor is...

21
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,406
like burying their heads in the sand.

22
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,636
But what if Jin Li Construction doesn't choose...

23
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,606
your in-law's company,
Oh Il Construction?

24
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,447
My arm hurts, so maybe my hand will slip.

25
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:52,746
Oh, don't be like that, Chairman Lee.

26
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,587
You said you don't want any money.

27
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:00,087
But you wanted me
to pick your in-law's company. Okay.

28
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,597
This means we are in the same boat now.

29
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:05,526
But you're too proud
to have a drink with a gangster, right?

30
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:08,597
A gangster? What are you talking about?

31
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,437
You're a respectable businessman.

32
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:22,616
I'm a public official.

33
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:25,717
So I try not to drink alcohol
when I bring my car.

34
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:28,687
Is that so?

35
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,697
Superintendent Han, just have one drink.

36
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:35,027
Just one drink.

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,856
Go on. Pour him a drink.

38
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,097
Come on.

39
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,336
Here it is.

40
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:51,646
You know what?

41
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:56,016
I'm a man of few words,
and I'm very resourceful.

42
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,386
I'd be happy to be of help.

43
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,997
I guess you really needed a drink.

44
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,227
Let me fill your glass.

45
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,296
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:17,537
I heard you're training at the taekwondo studio.

47
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:22,477
My job is to ensure public safety
and prevent crime in Munju.

48
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,176
It's important to ensure public safety in Munju.

49
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,886
Because it's a lucky charm for me.

50
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:34,757
I made money and found love in this place.

51
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:36,257
Love?

52
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:39,127
With a girl who lives here?

53
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:45,527
It's not Oh Ji Hwa,
the daughter of Manyang Taekwondo Studio, is it?

54
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:47,636
Do you know my Ji Hwa?

55
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,766
Did she go to Gwanghyo Foundation's school?

56
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:53,736
Ji Hwa and my son went to the same school.

57
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,477
So are you going out with her?

58
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,447
No, we're not going out.

59
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,806
I'm just into her.

60
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,317
I'm going to marry her.

61
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:05,947
One more drink.

62
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,727
Try not to become the talk of the town.

63
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,597
You should just focus on business.

64
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,467
Why?

65
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,467
It seems you're blinded by love too.

66
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:22,996
Isn't that why
you're trying to help your in-laws?

67
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,777
Why her? What do you like about her?

68
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:37,387
I touched her shoulder once.

69
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,946
She just pushed me
and punched me in the stomach.

70
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:44,527
Her eyes were shining brightly.

71
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:47,827
She was so cool.

72
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,236
Are you sure 3786 is Lee Chang Jin's car?

73
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,936
Do you see the parking space for VIPs?

74
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,707
Look across from it.

75
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,347
He's sitting in the car.

76
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,046
It's been about an hour.

77
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:13,746
The police station is the place he hates the most.

78
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:17,157
But yet he's here and waiting for someone.

79
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,387
I checked the entry log.

80
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:23,027
This isn't the first time
he paid a visit to the agency.

81
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,397
He also came by on November 5 last year.

82
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,366
Do you know where he visited?

83
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,037
Chief Superintendent's office.

84
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,267
Chief Superintendent's office?

85
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,707
Chief Superintendent Han?

86
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:38,777
Yes, Inspector Han Ju Won's father.

87
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,577
One of my senior officers works
at the security unit here.

88
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:45,946
I asked him if anything happened to
high ranking officers like him...

89
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,756
around November 5.

90
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:51,756
He told me Chief Superintendent's secretary
called them that day.

91
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:53,756
Why are the cops crawling out...

92
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:56,626
and searching every corner of Manyang-eup right now?

93
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,227
They're going from door to door...

94
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,936
and making a big fuss of it!

95
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:06,907
Is that enough reason for me to barge in or not?

96
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:09,837
Chairman Lee.

97
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:13,077
Serial murders.

98
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,277
Munju will always remind people of the word.

99
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,946
Darn it.

100
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:19,147
You sit your butt down and listen to me.

101
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,256
The secretary said
an unpleasant man in his 40s visited the office.

102
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,256
And that he was making a scene.

103
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:31,926
- And?
- She called back 10 minutes later.

104
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,337
And said Chief Superintendent Han said
everything was okay.

105
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,037
She thought she was making a big deal out of nothing...

106
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,566
and asked not to leave any record of it.

107
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,277
But if Chief Superintendent Han
is related to the case...

108
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:46,546
- Inspector Han would be...
- Kang Do Su.

109
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,017
It's not the right timing to say that out loud.

110
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,717
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:56,517
It feels like Inspector Han is one of us now,
so I'm worried.

112
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:58,087
One of us?

113
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:01,897
Yes. We're kind of like the Avengers unofficially.

114
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,527
Me, you, Dong Sik...

115
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:07,126
Inspector Han, and Park Jeong...

116
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:19,876
You were friends with those two
since you were kids, right?

117
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,676
Yes.

118
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:25,116
Back then, I let my kicks do the talking.

119
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,316
Are you all right?

120
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,017
And Dong Sik always stood up for Jeong Je.

121
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,126
- How dare you!
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

122
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,467
Boss, are you all right?

123
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:42,936
No, I'm not.

124
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,537
I'm trying really hard to be all right.

125
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:50,106
But to be honest, I'm worried.

126
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,746
That Senior Inspector Park...

127
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:53,946
might be the culprit?

128
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:57,387
That I might have to choose...

129
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,217
between Dong Sik and Jeong Je.

130
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:05,986
Here he comes.

131
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,426
Congratulations, Chief Superintendent Han.

132
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,996
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations?

133
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:14,436
I heard you were nominated
to become the next Commissioner General.

134
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:15,897
I heard the announcement is imminent.

135
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:17,667
I don't know what you're talking about.

136
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,106
You can go on in.

137
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:20,637
- Goodbye, sir.
- Congratulations.

138
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:22,106
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

139
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,017
Did you just see that?

140
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,576
That darned jerk!

141
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:01,716
What is he saying?

142
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:04,387
"That darned jerk" in Russian.

143
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,987
Lee Chang Jin is really mad.

144
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,887
He's mad at Chief Superintendent Han?

145
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:10,456
They're up to something, aren't they?

146
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:12,686
Let's go to the station.

147
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:14,657
We're not going to follow him?

148
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:17,726
Why did he come all the way
to the Police Agency...

149
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,627
to meet with Chief Superintendent Han?

150
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,696
Because he couldn't get in contact with him?

151
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:24,507
Let's find out how desperate he was
to get in contact with him...

152
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:27,237
by requesting his cellphone call log
and taking a look at it.

153
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,216
=Beyond Evil=

154
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,716
=Episode 13: Bury=

155
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,987
Inspector Han.

156
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,556
What do you think?

157
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,357
If your family member...

158
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:55,267
did something you couldn't imagine,

159
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,267
will you...

160
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:00,877
hold onto their hand?

161
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:02,107
What...

162
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,076
are you up to now?

163
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:08,647
You're not the type of person
to put meaning into family.

164
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:10,887
Then can I...

165
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,117
trust Han Ju Won?

166
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,456
Even if you find out the truth,

167
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:19,686
will you make sure it doesn't break?

168
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:32,507
Urgent Personnel Change.

169
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,066
Han Gi Hwan was nominated
as the next Commissioner General.

170
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:35,107
Turn on the TV.

171
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:44,517
(Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan...)

172
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:45,887
(nominated as the next Commissioner General)

173
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,696
Your father has become...

174
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,397
the number one police officer in Korea.

175
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:09,277
Congratulations, Inspector Han Ju Won.

176
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:31,167
I was told Yu Yeon was passed out.

177
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,066
What?

178
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,566
When Park Jeong Je hit her with his car.

179
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,637
Apparently, she was passed out.

180
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:41,907
I killed Yu Yeon with my car...

181
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:45,507
when she was collapsed on the ground.

182
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,576
What...

183
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:52,787
did you just say?

184
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:55,857
I killed...

185
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,527
I killed Yu Yeon with my car...

186
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,497
when she was collapsed on the ground.

187
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,726
Did you really...

188
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,066
hit Yu Yeon with your car
when she was collapsed on the ground?

189
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,167
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,367
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,637
You hit Yu Yeon with a car
when she was collapsed on the ground?

192
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:20,507
Yes. I killed her, Dong Sik.

193
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:24,716
I'm pretty sure...

194
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,987
Lee Yu Yeon was...

195
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,816
facing the car directly.

196
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:34,426
What are you talking about?

197
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:36,757
Officer Im said that she was standing.

198
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,426
There were fractures
in the same place below her knees.

199
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,936
Park Jeong Je said that he hit Yu Yeon
when she was collapsed,

200
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,737
but Yu Yeon was definitely standing.

201
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:49,377
He was confessing to me like a madman
as his memories came back,

202
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:52,576
so why would he lie
that she was collapsed when she was standing?

203
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,576
But then JL's Lee Chang Jin...

204
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,147
despite not answering his phone...

205
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,056
You killed her.

206
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:05,887
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

207
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,657
But...

208
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:13,066
I don't think you killed her alone.

209
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,336
No. I...

210
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:18,566
I killed her, Dong Sik.

211
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:21,076
Come to your senses, you jerk.

212
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:30,576
(Oh Ji Hwa)

213
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,586
- Hey.
- How's Jeong Je?

214
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,487
I think there's more to the story.

215
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:39,787
What happened with Lee Chang Jin?

216
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:43,426
I think he's connected
to Chief Superintendent Han.

217
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,696
Chief Superintendent Han?

218
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:46,997
Han Gi Hwan?

219
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:49,367
The person he was waiting for
in the parking garage...

220
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,667
was Chief Superintendent Han.

221
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:53,137
But Chief Superintendent Han
didn't let him come near him.

222
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:56,137
Whenever he gets mad,
he always curses in Russian.

223
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:58,476
But he said it at Chief Superintendent Han.

224
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,206
He said, "That darned jerk!"

225
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,877
"That darned jerk"?

226
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:04,887
I pull up Lee Chang Jin's call log and checked it.

227
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,546
He's been calling him since two days ago,

228
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:09,987
but Chief Superintendent Han
didn't answer a single call.

229
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:13,456
For the past four days, he called him...

230
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,096
14 times.

231
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:17,826
Did he call anyone else?

232
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,367
Jeong Je's mother.

233
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:23,167
He called Councilwoman Do eight times.

234
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,007
He kept calling Chief Superintendent Han,

235
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,206
and he even went to see him.

236
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:34,007
Lee Chang Jin and Han Gi Hwan.

237
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,517
What kind of relationship
do the two of them have?

238
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:40,046
Why are you bringing up
Lee Chang Jin all of a sudden?

239
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,556
What do you mean "all of a sudden"?

240
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:45,056
Do Hae Won sold Lee Chang Jin land
at a cheap price.

241
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,956
Isn't that why we were all...

242
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,696
tailing Lee Chang Jin too?

243
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:50,857
So...

244
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,466
are you saying
Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan is...

245
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,796
connected to Do Hae Won and Lee Chang Jin?

246
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,267
In my opinion,

247
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,706
this corresponds to your specialty,

248
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:03,306
reasonable suspicion.

249
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,747
You're right.

250
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,816
It is open to question.

251
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:13,586
I understand that Lee Yu Yeon's case
and Do Hae Won are connected,

252
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,287
and that Lee Chang Jin
and Chief Superintendent Han are...

253
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,926
connected with some type of relationship.

254
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:20,287
However,

255
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,397
why are you trying to connect
Lee Yu Yeon's case to my father?

256
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:27,226
You think I'm trying to connect...

257
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,336
my sister to your father?

258
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,936
Why are you suspecting my father?

259
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,537
Officer Cho Gil Gu also went to
see Chief Superintendent Han.

260
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,206
I believe he said he didn't know why...

261
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:40,277
That's what Chief Superintendent Han claims.

262
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:45,417
Did you believe in what Chief Superintendent Han said...

263
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,216
right away?

264
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,456
Officer Cho Gil Gu definitely said...

265
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:53,987
that it was an order he received
from the higher-ups.

266
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:00,397
Who among the higher-ups could it be?

267
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,696
Superintendent Jung Cheol Mun.

268
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,267
21 years ago, so in 2000,

269
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,206
who was the person
who selected Jung Cheol Mun,

270
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,877
who was a violent crimes inspector
at Munju Police Station,

271
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:11,247
and brought him to the Seoul Agency?

272
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,046
Han Gi Hwan.

273
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:18,546
He was the superintendent
of Munju Police Station at that time.

274
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:22,987
Who was the person that...

275
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:26,027
closed the case unprecedentedly fast 21 years ago?

276
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,357
("Superintendent Announces the End of Investigation")

277
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:28,497
Han Gi Hwan.

278
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,657
The superintendent of Munju Police Station.

279
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,237
Furthermore, Lee Chang Jin is looking for
Han Gi Hwan like crazy.

280
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,936
I'm not suspecting him because I want to.

281
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:41,907
All of the evidence
is pointing towards your father.

282
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,576
So...

283
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:48,777
that's why you sent Park Jeong Je home?

284
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:51,747
What did you say to him?

285
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,686
"You're not the culprit."

286
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:56,816
"It could be Chief Superintendent Han,
so go home."

287
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:00,326
Yes. That's what I said.

288
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,857
Are you out of your mind?

289
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:05,996
Okay.

290
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:07,966
Now...

291
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,867
what will Inspector Han Ju Won do?

292
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:16,337
- What?
- Do whatever you want...

293
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,907
on your own.

294
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:27,317
You're crazy.

295
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,256
You're a crazy lunatic.

296
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:36,226
I still haven't received an answer from you.

297
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,867
Can I trust Han Ju Won?

298
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,236
Even if you find out the truth,

299
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,536
will you make sure it doesn't break?

300
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:10,226
I...

301
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:14,996
I don't trust you.

302
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:18,637
I don't trust Han Gi Hwan.

303
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:20,436
I...

304
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:25,446
don't trust myself either.

305
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:31,117
I trust no one.

306
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,917
So whether you trust me or not...

307
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:38,786
isn't important to me.

308
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,176

Do you want to die?

00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,456
- Yes.
- No way.

318
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:20,986
What?

319
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,996
After I find the one who killed Yu Yeon.

320
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:27,496
You can die after that.

321
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,307
Why did your mother...

322
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,276
give money to Lee Chang Jin?

323
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,547
- What?
- A month after Yu Yeon died...

324
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:46,946
your mother handed over a piece of land to him.
Why did she?

I was worried sick.

Were you worried about me?

328
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:13,206
Is that why you sent Secretary Jang?
To lock me up again?

00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:15,047
What do you mean, lock you up?

330
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:18,077
I just don't want you to get in trouble.

331
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,617
Why would I get in trouble?

332
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:23,057
Well...

333
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:29,057
because sometimes,
it seems like you're losing your mind.

334
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:39,266
- Jeong Je.
- I remember.

335
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:42,536
- What?
- I remember everything now.

336
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:46,446
That I hit Yu Yeon with my car.

337
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:12,706
And that I called you on your burner phone.

338
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:15,907
Park Jeong Je.

339
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:40,196
Park Jeong Je, you're late again.

340
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:45,736
Honey, when will you get your act straight?

341
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:49,676
What... What do I do, Mom?

342
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:53,607
- Mom...
- Jeong Je?

343
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:57,016
Say it slowly, all right?

344
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:58,986
What's going on?

345
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:04,716
I think... I...

346
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:09,226
I hit a deer with my car.

347
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,726
- What?
- Actually...

348
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,766
I... I hit someone.

349
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,807
Jeong Je? Son?

350
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:25,347
Where are you right now?

351
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:28,716
Jeong Je?

352
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:31,047
Is that why you gave money to Lee Chang Jin?

353
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:35,516
Why would I give money to Lee Chang Jin?

354
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:39,887
You gave him the deer farm and the land in Munju.

355
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,087
That's money too.

356
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,097
Well, I needed some quick cash.

357
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:48,127
I don't think so.

358
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:51,236
I think you paid him for cleaning up the mess.

359
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,567
That night...

360
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,736
you called Lee Chang Jin out.

361
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:25,667
Jeong Je, wake up.

362
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:27,667
(Lee Chang Jin)

363
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:34,907
Chairman Lee.

364
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:37,476
I need your help.

365
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:41,016
If I go down,

366
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:43,357
our project goes down too.

367
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,286
We're on the same boat, remember?

368
00:24:48,357 --> 00:24:49,996
So I need you here right now.

369
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:19,026
This is a mess.

370
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,256
You asked him to take Yu Yeon's body,

371
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:26,196
and you sent me to the mental institute.

372
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,797
Don't you remember?

373
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,557
Son.

374
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,887
Did you tell anyone about this?

375
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:59,597
To Dong Sik, Han Ju Won, or Oh Ji Hwa.

376
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,526
Did you tell any of them?

377
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:05,167
- Mom.
- You didn't, right?

378
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,706
Mom.

379
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,077
Who killed Yu Yeon?

380
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:15,547
- What?
- I mean Yu Yeon.

381
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,417
Who killed her?

382
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,617
Lee Chang Jin was at the scene.

383
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:23,087
Why would he come to the scene?

384
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,627
Mom called him there.

385
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:27,557
And Yu Yeon...

386
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:32,026
And she asked him
to take care of Yu Yeon's body.

387
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:36,597
We left him with her.

388
00:26:41,036 --> 00:26:42,377
Was she not dead?

389
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:44,407
- Was she alive?
- No.

390
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:47,206
You're the one who killed Yu Yeon.

391
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,686
Or maybe Lee Chang Jin killed her.

392
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:57,557
What?

393
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:59,756
Yu Yeon was standing up.

394
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:03,597
So maybe someone hit her
while she was standing up...

395
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:05,196
and that's why she died.

396
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:07,996
What are you talking about? What are you...

397
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:08,996
Park Jeong Je.

398
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,536
- Yes.
- Do you know...

399
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:13,936
why you're still alive?

400
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:19,547
Why? Why am I still alive?

401
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,317
Because you need to find who killed Yu Yeon.

402
00:27:25,516 --> 00:27:29,186
That's the only reason why you're alive.

403
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,486
Got that?

404
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:39,797
Go home now.

405
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:43,436
What?

406
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:46,766
Go to your mom and tell her something for me.

407
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:49,337
Mom.

408
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,577
Who killed Yu Yeon?

409
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:56,617
You didn't recover your memories.

410
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,617
You're completely out of your mind.

411
00:28:00,617 --> 00:28:02,216
Why am I out of my mind?

412
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:05,587
You don't remember clearly. You don't.

413
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,057
What do you mean, I don't?

414
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:08,456
You don't.

415
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:11,627
You don't remember it correctly.

416
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:13,766
What do you mean,
I don't remember it correctly?

417
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:16,097
You killed Yu Yeon!

418
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:20,367
You killed her with your car.

419
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:30,216
No. Never mind.

420
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,746
Son, never mind what I said.

421
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:34,016
You're right.

422
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:38,087
I did kill Yu Yeon.

423
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:39,756
What?

424
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:43,256
It would have been nice
if you were honest with me in the first place.

425
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:45,766
It's okay, son.

426
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:47,726
It was just a mistake.

427
00:28:48,196 --> 00:28:50,367
You just made one drunken mistake.

428
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:54,006
Mom took care of it.

429
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:57,107
Took care?

430
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:05,986
Lee Chang Jin is the one who took care of it.

431
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:10,857
By the way, why was Yu Yeon found
inside the wall in that house?

432
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:14,157
Don't you want to know?

433
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:16,496
You definitely said...

434
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:18,996
you would take care of Lee Yu Yeon's body,

435
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,466
so we should just leave.

436
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,766
And I thought you did for the last 21 years.

437
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,337
And why was that...

438
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:30,107
found inside the wall in that wench's house?

439
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:35,817
Yu Yeon's body was buried by Kang Jin Mook.

440
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:37,847
Kang Jin Mook said...

441
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:40,617
he gave her back to Dong Sik.

442
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:49,196
Chang Jin, that punk...

443
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:52,526
Exactly. That punk didn't take care of anything.

444
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,627
He's been fooling you for 21 years.

445
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,236
But you gave him everything he asked.

446
00:29:57,236 --> 00:29:59,766
Money, land, and everything.

447
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,736
But do you think...

448
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,907
that was it?

449
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,877
Go and tell her that Lee Chang Jin...

450
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:14,087
is secretly meeting Han Gi Hwan.

451
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:15,756
Han Gi Hwan?

452
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:18,016
Lee Chang Jin and Han Gi Hwan are...

453
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,557
keeping a secret from Do Hae Won.

454
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:27,127
Lee Chang Jin and Han Gi Hwan.
They're keeping a secret from you.

455
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,167
They are meeting secretly.

456
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,236
What?

457
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,476
That's not possible.

458
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:40,147
They despise each other.

459
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:42,347
They would never meet each other without me.

460
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:45,347
Even today, Lee Chang Jin went to see Han Gi Hwan.

461
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,486
To the Police Agency.

462
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,887
All the things you have been thinking you knew.

463
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,097
Do you think they are the truth?

464
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,367
What if the two are using you?

465
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:07,057
You're flattering me.

466
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:10,097
Yes. Thank you.

467
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:12,666
Okay, I'll call you back. Bye.

468
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:35,617
You're such a cold son.

469
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:38,527
People from the entire country
are sending me congratulations,

470
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:40,627
and yet my only son...

471
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:42,827
only showed up now
without any words of greeting.

472
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,367
Isn't it a bit too early
to say congratulations?

473
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:45,496
What?

474
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,496
You're only nominated
as a Commissioner General candidate.

475
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,337
There's still the confirmation hearing left.

476
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,706
You think they won't confirm my appointment?

477
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:54,506
Being Commissioner General
has been your life-long dream.

478
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:57,446
I'm sure you've been very careful for decades.

479
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,047
Well, that's what every public official
should be like.

480
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,587
And you know that's the only thing
I expect from you.

481
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,216
Those animals called humans...

482
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:09,486
are difficult to tame.

483
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:13,827
It looks like
I'm the only obstacle in your life.

484
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,557
It's only morning!

485
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,166
Did you come at this early hour
to argue about that?

486
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:25,236
No.

487
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,246
I'm here...

488
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:32,877
to brief you about the test report
on Cho Gil Gu and Nam Sang Bae.

489
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:34,216
Go on.

490
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:39,117
The DNA test report
Chief Nam Sang Bae talked about.

491
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:40,916
That's...

492
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:44,256
the report on the guitar pick
that was found...

493
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,996
at the crime scene
where Bang Ju Seon's body was found.

494
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:50,166
I'm sure
Prosecutor Kwon already told you about this.

495
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,736
- So?
- And that's...

496
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,567
removed by Officer Cho Gil Gu.

497
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:58,367
Well, to be precise,

498
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,236
he switched it with a fake one.

499
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:05,476
And that was Munju's Councilwoman,
Do Hae Won's request.

500
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:11,386
You and Councilwoman Do
have known each other for 21 years.

501
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:14,987
I'm not sure
if you can say that we know each other.

502
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,056
Evidence?

503
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:19,357
You mean evidence to bring...

504
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,056
Cho Gil Gu and Do Hae Won to justice?

505
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:23,927
- Are you going to punish them?
- Of course.

506
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:30,337
There's no evidence.

507
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:33,277
And even if we arrest him,
Cho Gil Gu won't come clean.

508
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,507
Is that so? Then what should I do?

509
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,777
You can punish Superintendent Jung though.

510
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:41,976
Superintendent Jung?

511
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,587
Yes. Jung Cheol Mun,

512
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:45,147
the Superintendent of Munju Police Station.

513
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:48,217
21 years ago, you promoted him
when he was in Munju.

514
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:51,427
Then you took him to Seoul Agency,
and then to the Police Agency.

515
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:53,427
That Superintendent Jung Cheol Mun.

516
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:54,897
What about Superintendent Jung?

517
00:33:55,897 --> 00:33:59,467
Do you remember
the higher-ups Cho Gil Gu mentioned?

518
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:02,166
I just did...

519
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,936
what the higher-ups told me to do.

520
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:08,277
Do you really not know?

521
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:12,407
I heard it was your order.

522
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,377
That higher-up is...

523
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,616
Superintendent Jung.

524
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:21,257
He used your name to use Cho Gil Gu.

525
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:23,556
And he also seems to have...

526
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,127
set Cho Gil Gu up with Do Hae Won.

527
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,757
And you came to the conclusion
based on what reason?

528
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:30,697
Jung Cheol Mun has been...

529
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:33,766
blackmailing Do Hae Won to get money from her.

530
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:36,436
For a whopping 20 years.

531
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:41,337
Father, no matter how careful you are...

532
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:44,907
Those animals called humans...

533
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,717
are difficult to tame.

534
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:52,587
I heard there were rumours
when he was sent to Munju Police Station.

535
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,556
The rumours had it
that Jung Cheol Mun was bribed...

536
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:57,056
and Chief Superintendent Han
covered it up for him.

537
00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:01,657
- That's not...
- This is the kind of story...

538
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:03,366
that reporters and assemblymen like.

539
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,036
Are you sure...

540
00:35:09,036 --> 00:35:10,536
you're going to be okay at the hearing?

541
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:16,177
(Police Agency)

542
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,987
Sir, congratulations.

543
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,717
This is the moment you've been waiting for.

544
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:28,087
My heartiest congratulations to you.

545
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,786
(Han Gi Hwan)

546
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,270
- Phone.
- Pardon?

547
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,070
Oh, sure. Here.

548
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,180
Sir.

549
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,150
- Get down.
- What?

550
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,580
Get down, you punk.

551
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,220
I apologize, sir.

552
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,820
What are you apologizing for?

553
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,260
Well...

554
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,520
Look at me.

555
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,460
How much money did you take
from Do Hae Won for 20 years?

556
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,000
How much did you take from her?

557
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,470
I apologize, sir!

558
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,370
Why did you switch the report?

559
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,140
That, I don't really know...

560
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,980
What was on that report
that you had to switch it?

561
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,540
I don't know. I really don't know.

562
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,650
Raise your head. Look at me.

563
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,220
What was on the report?

564
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,220
Well...

565
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,660
Do Hae Won's son's fingerprints were found.

566
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,690
I heard it was a mistake.

567
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,730
He accidentally hit the girl...

568
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,230
while drunk-driving.

569
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,500
Senior Inspector Park Jeong Je.

570
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,540
Do Hae Won's son. He's not crazy.

571
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,470
It wasn't a serial killer either.

572
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,440
Kang Jin Mook, that punk, did it.

573
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,180
There won't be any trouble.

574
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,610
I even ordered to remove the switched report...

575
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,350
so it doesn't cause any trouble later.

576
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,950
The NFS staff that tested the DNA...

577
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,850
died of cancer two years ago.

578
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,850
Trust me. There won't be any trouble.

579
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,590
There won't be any trouble?

580
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,360
If you had arrested him then,
this would have never happened.

581
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,730
What do you mean,
there won't be any trouble?

582
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,630
Sir, what's the matter?

583
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,470
For 20 years, you took the money, right?

584
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,620
You're discarded.

585
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,880
Step down and disappear quietly.

586
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
I...

587
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,160
can't do that.

588
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,960
- How dare you?
- The CCTV of Kang at the cell.

589
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,300
You ordered me...

590
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,030
to pause the security camera.

591
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,770
Excuse me?

592
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,700
Do you want me to pause the security camera?

593
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,410
Is the suspect Kang Jin Mook?

594
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,940
I want to meet him.

595
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,240
Can I ask why?

596
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,710
It's the case I left unsolved.

597
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,520
It's the case
I buried in my heart for my whole life.

598
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,920
I want to see the face of the guy.

599
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,960
Is it a difficult request?

600
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,720
No, it's not.

601
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,930
Of course, I should do your favour.

602
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,490
How about around 5am?

603
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,360
When they hand over the duty to another.

604
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,470
Sir,

605
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,500
it might cause a problem later.

606
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,610
- You think so?
- So...

607
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,680
use someone as a pawn.

608
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,480
- A pawn?
- There's a guy called Nam Sang Bae.

609
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,580
He's currently the chief
of Manyang Police Substation.

610
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,450
He's the direct superior officer
of Inspector Han Ju Won.

611
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,520
He was also the officer
in charge of the case 20 years ago.

612
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,890
Why are you bringing him up?

613
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,360
He also asked me the same favour.

614
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,230
He asked me to let him meet Kang Jin Mook...

615
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,600
because he had something to ask to him
about the case in 2000.

616
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,770
- Using Nam Sang Bae as a pawn?
- Yes.

617
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,540
If you meet Kang Jin Mook...

618
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,740
before Nam Sang Bae goes in there,

619
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,670
when it causes trouble later,

620
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,610
Nam Sang Bae will take all the responsibility.

621
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,580
I don't remember that.

622
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,580
You don't?

623
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,550
As far as I remember,
the security camera stopped as it's broken.

624
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,220
No?

625
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,150
What's the matter with you?

626
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,390
If someone stopped the security camera on purpose,

627
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,290
it must be Jung Cheol Mun, the superintendent...

628
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,030
of Munju Police Station who acted independently.

629
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,570
To help Nam Sang Bae meet Kang Jin Mook.

630
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,440
Are you trying to claim
you didn't meet Kang Jin Mook that day?

631
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,840
Well, it's true that you didn't meet him.

632
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,340
Because the person
who came to meet Kang Jin Mook that day...

633
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,320
was Lee Chang Jin from JL Construction.

634
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,390
Do you think I really paused the security camera?

635
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,330
Mr. Han?

636
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,760
(JL Lee Chang Jin)

637
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,710
(Nam Sang Bae)

638
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,680
Has your father not contacted you yet?

639
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,490
It's been already three days...

640
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,120
since you went and told him
about Superintendent Jung.

641
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,730
He went to his office at Munju Police Station...

642
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,490
yesterday and the day before yesterday.

643
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,130
He will probably go to work today as well.

644
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,430
Senior Inspector Park Jeong Je.

645
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,040
Did it work out the way you wanted?

646
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,240
Yes.

647
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,070
It worked and I'm waiting.

648
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,310
We're both waiting.

649
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
What you said is right,
Inspector Han Ju Won.

650
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,820
I'm a crazy guy.

651
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,890
I'm completely ruined.

652
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,330
What are you doing to do?

653
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,140
Are you going to get yourself ruined?

654
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,670
Why would I get ruined?

655
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,780
Your father might ruin you.

656
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,180
- It won't happen.
- Why not?

657
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,450
Because your father...

658
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,350
will never commit a crime?

659
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,990
- That's...
- Or...

660
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,460
because even if he commits a crime,

661
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,900
you have nothing to do with it?

662
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,870
If...

663
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,980
your father is...

664
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,920
related to the death of my sister,

665
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,220
do you think...

666
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,330
you'll be okay?

667
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,370
Are you...

668
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,670
asking me if I will be okay?

669
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,240
Not you?

670
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,540
Why are you asking such a thing?

671
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,950
Whether I'm not okay or not,
why is it important?

672
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,720
You're right.

673
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,520
Why am I asking you such a thing?

674
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,490
Inspector Han. Can we talk for a moment?

675
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,930
Congratulations on
your father Chief Superintendent Han's...

676
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,170
nomination for Commissioner General.

677
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,370
I'd like to interview you.
Just a few words.

678
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,300
- I have nothing to say.
- Stop!

679
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,040
You can't enter!

680
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,550
I guess you don't remember
what Chief Nam Sang Bae said.

681
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,420
Over there!

682
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,220
From the line on the ground over there...

683
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,790
to behind the substation building.

684
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,220
It's the land
that lawfully belongs to Manyang Police Substation.

685
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,890
Mr. Im, you are not allowed
to enter the land from here to the end.

686
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,830
It's an arrogation that doesn't make sense.

687
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:22,460
And...

688
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,770
the chief is not here.

689
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,070
What?

690
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,610
- I mean...
- Mr. Im Gyu Seok.

691
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,780
How about a tip-off
instead of a trashy interview?

692
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,820
You have a tip-off?

693
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,150
About what?

694
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,520
About alleged bribery of the police.

695
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,590
- Who are you referring to?
- Inspector Han.

696
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:52,990
There's a condition.

697
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,030
Releasing the report
right before the hearing on the appointee...

698
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,730
for Commissioner General is my condition.

699
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,670
I'll make sure to do that.

700
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,210
Inspector Han.

701
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,910
You should think through it.

702
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,610
You're right.

703
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,950
I am...

704
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,050
Inspector Han Ju Won.

705
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,460
You're just police officer Han Ju Won?

706
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,260
I'll be back before my shift.

707
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,030
Let's go.

708
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,850
"2914"?

709
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,160
- Yes.
- Is this Officer Lee Dong Sik?

710
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,860
This is the Chief Superintendent's office
at Police Agency.

711
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,300
What made you call me?

712
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,530
The Chief Superintendent wants to see you.

713
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,940
Yes.

714
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,620
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
I'm Lee Dong Sik.

715
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,730
Is this the first?

716
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,070
We've never met before?

717
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,210
No. This is the first time.

718
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,980
Have a seat.

719
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,950
Can I get you something to drink?

720
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,050
Let's just get to the point.

721
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,490
All right.

722
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,930
To get right to the point...

723
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,270
I want you to work for me.

724
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,240
I've been watching you
because I heard you're Ju Won's partner.

725
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,670
In the future, my organization,
the Korean Police Agency,

726
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,410
needs someone like you, Inspector Lee.

727
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,810
So I thought
I would take this opportunity to transfer you.

728
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,950
Where will I be transferred to?

729
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,820
The General Investigation Unit
at the Seoul Police Agency.

730
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,320
Let's catch all the jerks
who are corrupt,

731
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,860
Inspector Lee Dong Sik.

732
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,030
(One week later)

733
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,700
- I heard there's a hearing.
- With the superintendent?

734
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,570
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

735
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,030
(Kang Do Su)

736
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,800
Go.

737
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,470
Officer Oh. Aren't we going to watch the news?

738
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,010
The Commissioner General Confirmation Hearing
is at 10am.

739
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,710
Why bother watching it?
Let's just work.

740
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,510
But still, Chief Superintendent Han...

741
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,620
used to be the superintendent
of Munju Police Station.

742
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,690
My goodness, guys.

743
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,850
Officer Oh said she feels uncomfortable.

744
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,720
She feels uncomfortable? Why?

745
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,660
No. It's not that.

746
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,190
Let's watch it.

747
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,030
Do Su. Turn on the TV.

748
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Hurry.

749
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,470
Jae Yi. Where's the remote control?

750
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,470
I need to watch the hearing,
but I can't find the remote control.

751
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,810
Hey, Oh Ji Hun.
Aren't you going to work?

752
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,680
Our team is off-duty.

753
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,810
If you're off-duty,
you should watch it at home. Okay?

754
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,450
I was told we were watching it here.

755
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,690
Here? Who?

756
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,660
My sister is on duty,
so she can't come,

757
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,020
but Jeong Je and Dong Sik
are all meeting us here.

758
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,790
Jeong Je and everyone else is coming here?

759
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,700
Yes. Why?

760
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,630
Is there a reason
why they wouldn't be able to come?

761
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,510
Nobody is coming,
so you should go. Okay?

762
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,070
You should go.

763
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,480
You should go too.

764
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,610
Senior Inspector Park is here.

765
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,830
Why did you come here?

766
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,400
Well...

767
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,400
I'm not going to run away anymore.

768
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,110
I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

769
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,780
Don't apologize to me.

770
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,110
I'm not the person you should apologize to.

771
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,150
I'm still sorry.

772
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,290
Ji Hun doesn't know.

773
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,220
I don't think Ji Hwa and Dong Sik told him.

774
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,390
Okay.

775
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,170
You're going to accept your punishment, right?

776
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,210
- Yes.
- You will, right?

777
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,410
Yes.

778
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,880
You...

779
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,350
have to accept it.

780
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,550
Okay.

781
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,390
You have to accept your punishment.

782
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,530
I will.

783
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,300
(Hearing on Nominee
for Commissioner General Han Gi Hwan)

784
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,070
- Please take good care of me.
- Of course.

785
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,910
How could your 40 years in a government position...

786
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,110
be so immaculate and clean?

787
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,080
I have so much respect for you, sir.

788
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,680
I'm not worried about this hearing.

789
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,680
Who else could be
the leader of 150,000 police officers?

790
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,680
Please take good care of me.

791
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,510
Ju Won, you're here.

792
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,280
Did you say hello to your father?

793
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,780
Not yet.

794
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,150
He will be so happy to find out you're here.

795
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,260
It's all thanks to you.

796
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,430
You can even get a substation officer like me...

797
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,500
into the confirmation hearing.

798
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,970
I guess you really are a prosecutor.
Thank you.

799
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,170
You said you wanted to come here...

800
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,910
to witness your father
becoming the Commissioner General.

801
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,570
Of course, I should help you out.

802
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,410
Can everyone come to order?

803
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,850
As we have met the quorum,

804
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,620
we will begin the second National Assembly...

805
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,520
Public Administration and Security meeting.

806
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,420
It's starting.

807
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,630
I've never met Chief Superintendent Han before.

808
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,560
I met him once at the Police Agency.

809
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,860
I even shook hands with him.

810
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,630
After you take the oath, please submit...

811
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,870
your signature and written oath to the chairman.

812
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,410
Please take your oath.

813
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,520
Oath.

814
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,530
"I, the nominee,"

815
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,860
"swear to tell the truth..."

816
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,530
"without hiding or supplementing anything..."

817
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,400
"during the confirmation hearing
held by the National Assembly."

818
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,840
"February 26, 2021."

819
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,670
Nominee Han Gi Hwan.

820
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:13,180
Next, we will hear the opening statement
from the nominee.

821
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,590
I'm Commission General Nominee, Han Gi Hwan.

822
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,160
I ask for your interest...

823
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,720
and guidance.

824
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,030
Furthermore, regarding all the questions asked today,

825
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,500
I will answer them honestly and sincerely.

826
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,830
Next is the question and answer portion.

827
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,800
I have a point of order.

828
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,970
Assemblyman Han Kyung Soo of Kangmin Party,
ask your question.

829
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,040
Okay.

830
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,110
We are gathered to verify the leader...

831
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,180
of 150,000 police officers,
who are the foundation of Korea.

832
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,380
I asked that you give an honest answer.

833
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,410
Of course, I will.

834
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,560
Hold on.

835
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,290
(Han Kyung Soo, Kim Young Hoon)

836
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,590
Mr. Han.

837
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,460
You just promised
that you will give an honest answer, right?

838
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,570
Yes, I did.

839
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,970
This is an exclusive article from JSB.

840
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,840
Five minutes ago, an article was released that...

841
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,470
Superintendent Jung,
a close friend of Nominee Han Gi Hwan,

842
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:16,710
has accepted bribes for the past 20 years,
and Han Gi Hwan knew...

843
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,250
but chose to turn a blind eye to it.

844
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,380
(Commissioner General Nominee)

845
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,860
What do you have to say regarding this article?

846
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,130
That is not true.

847
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,130
You told us you would give honest answers.

848
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,900
Are you sure that it's not true?

849
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,000
If you look at this article,

850
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,730
this person, Superintendent Jung,

851
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,270
bought land for half of what it is worth.

852
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,270
Is this not a bribe?

853
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:49,880
They lowered the price of the land
and gave him money.

854
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,480
This article includes the registration too.

855
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,680
Who's Superintendent Jung?

856
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,250
"Through a long-standing relationship
with Han Gi Hwan,"

857
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,390
"he was selected during his time
at Munju Police Station..."

858
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,190
"and went to Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency with him..."

859
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,790
Isn't this about our superintendent?

860
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,560
Officer Oh.

861
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,500
Superintendent Jung...

862
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,100
Isn't that Superintendent Jung Cheol Mun?

863
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,500
- What?
- Look up the article.

864
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,800
Okay.

865
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,810
Who did he accept bribes from?

866
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,680
- Is it in the article?
- It's my mother.

867
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:25,650
- What?
- What?

868
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,750
Superintendent Jung received bribes...

869
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,580
from my mother.

870
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,090
Why does he look so fine?

871
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,230
- Who?
- That man. Han Gi Hwan.

872
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,230
He doesn't seem surprised.

873
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,370
It's true
that Superintendent Jung bought the land.

874
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,840
It is also true that he bought it
for nearly half the asking price.

875
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,600
Then he did receive money.

876
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,410
You were aware of this,
but you didn't say anything?

877
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,380
How could you not say anything?

878
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,550
However, that was a result of a debt.

879
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,850
A debt?

880
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,180
The owner of the land needed money quickly,

881
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,820
and they borrowed a certain amount
from Superintendent Jung...

882
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,590
and repaid the money with the land.

883
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,190
The evidence to support this...

884
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,400
Creating a claim-obligation relationship itself...

885
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,270
does not violate the law.

886
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,970
But it's clear that one should
avoid it as a government official.

887
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,910
A relevant measure was already taken
and Superintendent Jung...

888
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,210
was transferred to a local police station accordingly.

889
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,450
If I'm appointed as Commissioner General later,

890
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:34,120
through grand hearings and inspections,

891
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,420
I will require the police
to behave with honesty...

892
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,490
and strengthen morality.

893
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,320
It is a promise I give to you here.

894
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,690
You made a promise.

895
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,940
I will get it done
no matter what it takes.

896
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,410
Oh, my, Ju Won.

897
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,280
You came all the way to here just with that?

898
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,400
Assemblyman Han Kyung Soo,
your question session is over.

for Commissioner General Nominee)

Next up is Peninsular Party's...

901
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,860
Excuse me for a moment.

902
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,500
Chief Superintendent, my apologies.

903

- Excuse me.

How dare you? Get out right now.

from Seoul General Investigation Unit.

all the corrupt jerks.

Officer Lee Dong Sik.

910
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,160
What are you doing?

911
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,730
Can't you see
we're in the middle of a hearing?

912
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,730
- Get out.
- It's a hearing on a nominee for...

913
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,630
Is there a time and a place
to administer justice?

914
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,300
Is that so,
Nominee for Commissioner General Han Gi Hwan?

915
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,310
(Confirmation Hearing for Commissioner General Nominee)

916
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,750
Lee Dong Sik?

917
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,560
Release my officer
in the middle of administering justice.

918
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,430
What is the matter, Officer Lee Dong Sik?

919
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,070
It's arrest without a warrant, sir.

920
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,040
What?

921
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,950
Inspector Han Ju Won.

922
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:54,820
You're arrested without a warrant on suspicion...

923
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,760
of abuse of authority
and abetting Lee Geum Hwa's death.

924
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,860
A murder case?

925
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,160
A murder case?

926
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,160
What is he talking about?

927
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,040
You have the right to remain silent.

928
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,840
You have the right to consult with a lawyer.

929

You have the opportunity
to justify your actions.

930
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,640
And you have the right
to seek a writ of habeas corpus.

931
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,680
That crazy guy.

What's going on?

935
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,790
Did he just arrest Inspector Han?

936

What do you mean what I am doing?

941
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,620

you should be punished.

I'll take full responsibility...
