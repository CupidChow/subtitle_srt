because she doesn't have 50 dollars.

164
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:51,337
Life is that tough, you know.

165
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,878
Ladies, you need to stay silent.

166
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:58,487
And loosen your fists, okay?

167
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,987
- Okay.
- Okay?

168
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:01,857
I told you to bring it on.

169
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,658
- You can't do that! Don't do it.
- My goodness, what's with you?

170
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,457
Okay, fine. 50 dollars?

171
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:09,357
I'll pay you that money!

172
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,018
Officer 1. This is Officer 1.
This is bad.

173
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,857
Officer Lee's nut gauge is shooting up.

174
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:41,487
- Stop it!
- You!

175
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,058
We were about to get off in an hour.

176
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:46,227
Darn it, I knew they've been too quiet lately.

177
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:49,697
My gosh, Dong Sik and his nut gauge.

178
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,008
- What are you doing?
- Silence!

179
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,207
As of now, everyone in this room is...

180
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:01,008
immediately under arrest
for fraud, assault, gambling,

181
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:04,077
and aiding and abetting in gambling.

182
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:05,918
- What's this nonsense?
- Arrested? What?

183
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,388
Why should I go to the police station?

184
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,987
I just watched, that's all.

185
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:11,658
Many of you seem to
collect criminal records as a hobby.

186
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:15,197
You can keep talking
if you wish to tack on obstruction of justice.

187
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,197
- Gosh.
- I just...

188
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:19,227
You two, get in the patrol car.

189
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,798
The rest of you can grab a car and follow us.

190
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:23,398
- Dong Sik!
- I just watched!

191
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:25,237
Don't you dare go anywhere else.

192
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,908
I'll charge you for fleeing too.

193
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:31,178
It's not like I played hwatu.

194
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,977
I was just there...

195
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:36,077
running my business as usual, Chief.

196
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:40,018
- I didn't do anything!
- Yes, hey. I know that. I do.

197
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,957
Dong Sik, this isn't a criminal case of any sort.

198
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,487
Why are you turning this into such a big deal?
Are you bored?

199
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,128
Why isn't this a criminal case?

200
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,357
Starting a gambling den and aiding
and abetting gambling.

201
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,857
Under Article 247 of the Criminal Code,

202
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:53,268
the person who sets a gambling site...

203
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,638
may face up to five years of prison
or a fine of 30,000 dollars.

204
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:58,538
Am I going to jail then?

205
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:02,378
Officer Lee, Article 247 of the Criminal Code...

206
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:08,648
only applies to those
who set up a gambling site for profit.

207
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:13,187
Don't you see the black plastic bag
on the salon owner's head?

208
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:16,888
It means she's getting a cut
of the winnings at the game today.

209
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:19,957
How do we call that profit?

210
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:21,487
They were just playing for some pennies.

211
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:22,957
Pennies are money too.

212
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:25,058
1 and 2 cents add up to 10 and 20 cents.

213
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,898
10 and 20 cents add up to 1 and 2 dollars.

214
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:29,597
Many a mickle makes a muckle.

215
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:33,138
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

216
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,878
What on earth is going on?

217
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:36,977
Profit, my foot.

218
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:38,847
Why don't you just ban card games then?

219
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,648
- She's right.
- Chief.

220
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,217
Honey, will you just sit back and watch like that?

221
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,817
- Do something.
- Fine.

222
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,248
Goodness, Dong Sik. Fine.

223
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:49,758
My wife has a weak heart.
She shouldn't get too upset.

224
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,857
Please do me a favour
and let it slide this time.

225
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,788
Don't be like this. This is illegal soliciting.

226
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,698
Officer Cho, do you want to be arrested
for illegal soliciting?

227
00:16:58,627 --> 00:16:59,897
Gosh, you really are a nut!

228
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:03,597
- Fine! Arrest me! Go on! Arrest me!
- Hey, hold him.

229
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,978
- Your name, birth date, and address.
- You have a guest.

230
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,077
He's young.

231
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:14,448
How may I help you, sir?

232
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,218
Are you lost?

233
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:23,917
Nice to meet you.

234
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,188
I've been transferred to
Manyang Police Substation.

235
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:27,558
I'm Inspector Han Ju Won.

236
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,920
(Chief's office)

237
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,220
I did get a text that you were coming.

238
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,730
I was wondering why the headquarters texted me.
They never do that.

239
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,330
I thought it was a joke
when they said they'd send us another officer.

240
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,700
- I hope we get along.
- Okay.

241
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,870
Let me see. Where's the handover report?

242
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,980
Wait. It's not today.

243
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,910
Why did you come so early?

244
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,050
I heard you requested an officer a long time ago.

245
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,520
I don't like to waste time.

246
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,150
I see. Right.

247
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,120
It's been over a year
since I put in the request.

248
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,130
Who is my partner?

249
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,560
Darn it. The computer just crashed.

250
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,700
When will they get this piece of trash replaced?

251
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm sorry. Please give me a minute.

252
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,140
Gosh, I need to turn it on again.

253
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,570
Darn it.

254
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,510
All right. It's all over now.

255
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,480
Inspector Han Ju Won.

256
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,390
27 years old. The only son in the family.

257
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,920
Entered Korean National Police University
as a top student.

258
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,290
Graduated summa cum laude.

259
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,130
Gosh. Summa cum laude
from Korea National Police University?

260
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,360
That means he was really smart.

261
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,960
You can't do that just because you're smart.

262
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
To graduate summa cum laude,

263
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,130
one needs to get almost full marks
on the fitness test too.

264
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,400
And he's even good-looking.

265
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,470
Whoever his parents are,
they must be full without eating.

266
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,870
Those who are great
are always from rich families nowadays.

267
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,980
His father is...

268
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,550
the Chief Superintendent at headquarters.

269
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,080
- What?
- Who?

270
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,880
He will be the next Commissioner General.

271
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,920
He's the number two of the Korean Police,

272
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,160
Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan's son.

273
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,760
(Manyang Substation
of Gyeonggi Munju Police Station)

274
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,560
I can't reach him since last night.

275
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,970
And he didn't come home last night.

276
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,700
Why can't I report him missing?

277
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,840
Sir, please calm down.

278
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,610
I just asked you
if your son usually comes home.

279
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,840
Didn't I?

280
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,980
And you said he doesn't.

281
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,750
They thought that woman went missing,

282
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,110
but it turned out that she was murdered.

283
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,580
Well, with that case... That's a woman.

284
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,420
And your son is a man.

285
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,090
How can you be sure
that men won't get murdered?

286
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,320
I'll report him missing.

287
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,590
He said this happens often.

288
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,190
And it's not a woman. It's a man.

289
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,060
You know we wait for a couple of days in this case.

290
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,100
Chief.

291
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,970
Let me help you report a runaway.

292
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,540
"Runaway"? What are you talking about?

293
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,480
Are you saying my son ran away?

294
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,310
It's possible that he just went missing.

295
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,410
But let's report this
as a runaway case for now.

296
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,920
Runaway? He went missing.

297
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,750
I'm here to report a missing person.

298
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm afraid you can't, sir.

299
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,790
Why? Because he's not a woman?

300
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,130
Even if your son is a woman, you can't.

301
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,560
This is ridiculous.

302
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,930
If you don't want to take the report,
just say you don't.

303
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
It's not like
this is the only police substation in the country.

304
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,740
No matter which police station,
substation, patrol division,

305
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,470
or even police agency you go to,

306
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,040
your son...
Well, even if it's your daughter,

307
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,780
you can't report your child missing.

308
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,150
- What?
- Act on the Protection...

309
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,380
and Support of Missing Children, Article Two.

310
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,980
The term "child" refers to a child
under the age of 18...

311
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,050
a person with an intellectual,
autistic, or mental disability,

312
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,190
or a dementia patient.
Only then you can report the "child" missing.

313
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,700
And whether to investigate the case
must be decided without delay.

314
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,400
This is the only law in Korea
regarding missing people.

315
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,110
Does your son apply to any of the cases
I mentioned just now?

316
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,780
Well...

317
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,410
No, but...

318
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,210
Even if your son went missing,

319
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,180
in the Republic of Korea,
he's a man who ran away from home.

320
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,920
He ran away.

321
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,320
Officer Lee Dong Sik.

322
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,030
He seems to know the law very well.

323
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,980
31G 8305.

324
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,580
Nice car.

325
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,140
(Korean beef only)

326
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,560
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

327
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,860
Hey, Oh Ji Hun.

328
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,860
Darn it.

329
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,630
All right. Here's your meal.

330
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,640
You arrested six ladies today.

331
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,940
How could you have an appetite for soup?

332
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,040
Jae Yi, today's soup is very refreshing. I love it.

333
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,210
You basically destroyed 6 households in 1 village.

334
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,880
And you like the soup?

335
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,250
I knew it. Dong Sik, you're such a great friend.

336
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,250
I respect you.

337
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,220
Then fill my glass with respect.

338
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,530
I know you two are best friends,

339
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,890
but you can't do this.

340
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,660
You're practically abusing governmental power.

341
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,530
Oh, my gosh. Jae Yi.

342
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,100
Officer Oh just said
Dong Sik was abusing governmental power.

343
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,140
Hey, Oh Ji Hun. You've gotten pretty big.

344
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,410
Am I wrong?

345
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,040
I am right, though. Right?

346
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,980
Of course. Whatever you say, Officer Oh.

347
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,110
- Arrest me now.
- Come on, Dong Sik!

348
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,210
What's going on?

349
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,650
Why is the rookie so loud?

350
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,180
Hey, Ji Hwa.

351
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,820
I can't believe you got off work this early.

352
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,750
I'm guessing Violent Crimes
was pretty quiet today too.

353
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,120
I can't believe...

354
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,690
I ran into the officer in Munju
who always leaves work on time.

355
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,130
- It's an honour.
- At ease.

356
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,130
What's with your wrist? Did you get into trouble again?

357
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,440
What trouble?

358
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,260
Ji Hwa, Dong Sik's nut gauge shot up to the end today.

359
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,410
Then arrested those ladies who gambled
at five cents per point?

360
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,180
I heard they filed a complaint.

361
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,680
See that? They won't get indicted
for betting five cents per point.

362
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,010
The case can't be indicted, so why did Dong Sik do that?

363
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,780
The lady of the hair salon...

364
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,690
seems to be involved financially
with some out-of-towners.

365
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,930
They didn't look very decent.

366
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,600
He broke off the game because he got worried...

367
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,560
they'll continue to get involved with them
and get in trouble.

368
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,330
Really? I didn't know that.

369
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,410
Once again, he's pretending like he didn't mean to.

370
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,610
Ji Hun, didn't I tell you to trust your partner...

371
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,780
no matter what he does?

372
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,510
- Don't beat up my partner.
- He's my brother.

373
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,850
I'm teaching him some manners.

374
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,550
- You idiot.
- Hey.

375
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,890
I'll let her hit me to get a grip.

376
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,290
Get a grip, will you?

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,630
I don't qualify anyway.

378
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,790
I may not be his partner in a few days.

379
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,560
What do you mean?

380
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,670
We got a new inspector.

381
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,140
He's not my type, though.

382
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,740
Why not? Because of his rad credentials?

383
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,910
Rad? What is that? How rad is he?

384
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,450
He went to the National Police University.

385
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,250
He didn't just graduate from that place.

386
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,420
A guy with his connections can't end up
in a rural area like this.

387
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,220
I really don't get it.

388
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,890
How big are his connections?

389
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,280
Is he the son of the Commissioner General or something?

390
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,660
Soon, probably.

391
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,130
He's the son of the next Commissioner General.

392
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,930
The next Commissioner General?

393
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,970
The deputy chief of headquarters, Han Gi Hwan.

394
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,770
("The Missing Case of University Student Comes to a Halt")

395
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,480
(The case comes to a halt after 4 months and 16 days.)

396
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,450
(Han Gi Hwan)

397
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,960
You're dismissed.

398
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,780
Attention. Salute.

399
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,350
At ease.

400
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,500
I'll drive.

401
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,830
Do you not like it?

402
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,140
I had a lot.

403
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,100
The office in Seoul is disappointed...

404
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,950
that you decided to go to
the west of Gyeonggi Province.

405
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,040
We still have time to revoke your decision.

406
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,840
You don't have to use your power
at this important time.

407
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,220
Then you shouldn't have done this...

408
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,230
to make me do something at this important time.

409
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,320
You just have to stick around...

410
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,660
until this term is over. That's all.

411
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,520
- After that...
- I'll go back to Foreign Affairs.

412
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,140
Ju Won, you need to pull yourself together.

413
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,530
How dare you say you wish to go back?

414
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,210
Lie low.

415
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,250
Ju Won.

416
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,450
Yes, Father.

417
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,430
(31G 8305)

418
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,440
Your car is the only one of its kind in this town,
so you'll stand out.

419
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,260
So what?

420
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,060
I didn't get to introduce myself formally last time.

421
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm Assistant Inspector Lee Dong Sik of Team One.

422
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,920
I don't like touching other people's hands.

423
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,490
I'm Han Ju Won.

424
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,750
What a feisty little young master.

425
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,000
Now that we have Inspector Han with us,

426
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,470
shouldn't we reorganize our teams?

427
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,740
Yes, Inspector Hwang?

428
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,740
- I volunteer.
- To do what?

429
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,570
There's no one else here
who is more informed than I am.

430
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,540
I'll inform Inspector Han...

431
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,150
of every single detail
regarding our jurisdiction...

432
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,750
You can't do that.

433
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,810
We only have two inspectors
in our police station,

434
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,050
so it'd be odd if you two worked as a team.

435
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,110
Right?

436
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,490
I'm a petty officer, so let me volunteer.

437
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,290
I'll assist Inspector Han as much as I can
and learn a lot from him.

438
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,330
Goodness, Officer Oh. I'm very proud of you.

439
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,000
Gosh, we already have two volunteers?

440
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,140
You're a popular guy, Inspector Han.

441
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,570
I'm glad to death.

442
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,040
You said he wasn't your type.

443
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,880
I'll make the sacrifice.

444
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,780
You little punk.

445
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,810
What? What did you say?

446
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,750
- Did you say you want to volunteer?
- No.

447
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,130
- Are you sure?
- No, never.

448
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,580
I don't want him either.

449
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,430
I don't have a thing for nut cases.

450
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,500
I see.

451
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,910
In that case...

452
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,600
I'll just go with whatever you say.

453
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,600
It'll be an honour to assist Inspector Han.

454
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,410
Okay, then. I've come to a decision.

455
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,110
Han Ju Won and Lee Dong Sik,
you are Team One.

456
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,040
- What?
- What?

457
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,190
Why not?

458
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,460
You two are the only people
who hate each other.

459
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,050
So once you two hit it off,

460
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,700
the teamwork here will be perfect.
Don't you think?

461
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,930
Officer Oh, you'll take calls for a while...

462
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,430
and keep the place nice and tidy, okay?

463
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,740
All right, Team One. Time to go on a patrol.

464
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,710
Chief Nam, you cannot create teams
on your own call...

465
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,000
Dong Sik, what are you doing?

466
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,950
I know you're just an assistant inspector...

467
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,310
but think of all of your years with the police...

468
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,220
compared to a much younger inspector.

469
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,420
Look at how absurd our discipline is.

470
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,250
This young inspector is trying to defy the chief,

471
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,250
and this assistant inspector is refusing
to work with an inspector.

472
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,960
Inspector Han, I will serve you to the best of my abilities.

473
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,930
Good. This makes more sense.

474
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay. Get to work.

475
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,990
Does the less experienced officer
have to drive around here?

476
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,550
Gosh, you want to hold this disgusting steering wheel?

477
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,850
It's infested with germs.

478
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,830
You seemed like a wild driver.

479
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,600
So let me drive.

480
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,140
Did you just say I seem like a wild driver?

481
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,270
When you first got here a week ago,

482
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,920
you slammed on your accelerator
as soon as the lights changed.

483
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,990
There are lots of elderly folks in this town.

484
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,390
If you continue to do that
and cause anyone to get hurt,

485
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,420
it'll make my life difficult too.

486
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,130
I never did that.

487
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,530
Seven days ago,

488
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,410
around 19:20,

489
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,220
it was the first crosswalk you see right
after Manyang Substation.

490
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,460
License plate number 31G 8305.

491
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,200
I saw you.

492
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,790
And I'm sure you saw me crossing the road too.

493
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,800
Should I go find the security footage
from the crosswalk?

494
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,480
Inspector Han.

495
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,340
Be careful.

496
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,510
There are no secrets around here.

497
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,420
Someone is always watching...

498
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,460
from somewhere.

499
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,760
Hello?

500
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,170
Goodness. When?

501
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,650
Okay. I'll be there.

502
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,840
What are you doing in the middle of patrol?

503
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,750
I'm on my way after receiving a report.

504
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,110
Someone called in a report on your personal phone?
No way.

505
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,920
Does the substation have any idea...

506
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,050
that you've been taking reports
on your personal phone?

507
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,050
It's not like I'm going outside our jurisdiction.

508
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,030
If it doesn't feel right,
you can radio back to make a report.

509
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,730
Hold on tight.

510
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,420
Didn't you just say I'm a wild driver?

511
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,880
Bang Wu Cheol, 74 years old,
a patient with advanced dementia.

512
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,150
He should be somewhere
in the middle of the reed field.

513
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,230
But he may have collapsed on his way.

514
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,090
You can begin your search starting here.

515
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,650
I'll go that way.

516
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,070
How do you know he's here?
Let's check the security footage.

517
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,030
It's a redevelopment area.
What security footage?

518
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,090
Darn it.

519
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,670
Mr. Bang Wu Cheol!

520
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,070
Sir!

521
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,050
Mr. Bang Wu Cheol.

522
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,360
Mr. Bang.

523
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,900
Sir.

524
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,460
Mr. Bang!

525
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,030
Is he even here?

526
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,980
He didn't even get the information by radio.

527
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,630
Is he...

528
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,780
Officer Lee, are you playing a game with me?

529
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,460
You should've ducked down.

530
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,130
Why would you just stand
in front of a gust of wind? Gosh.

531
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,070
Do you need to be slapped in the face
to get your act together?

532
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,010
- What did you just say?
- Why are you hesitating?

533
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,900
We should go find the old man.

534
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,550
Is Bang Wu Cheol even a real person?

535
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,590
Mr. Bang.

536
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,860
Dong Sik.

537
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,010
Let's go home.

538
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,340
My youngest daughter, Ju Seon.

539
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,610
My sweetheart hasn't come home yet.
I have to wait for her.

540
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,710
My goodness. Let's go home.

541
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,280
Who's that?

542
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,960
- I'm Inspector Han Ju Won from...
- Don't.

543
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,650
What?

544
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,070
You're police officers? Go away.

545
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,400
Sir, sir.

546
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,860
Sir, it's not true.
You know me. I'm Dong Sik.

547
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,000
Just stay right there.

548
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,130
I'll take you home. All right?

549
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,230
Don't come near me. Go away!

550
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,400
- You little scumbags.
- Sir. Sir!

551
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,940
Sir!

552
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,170
- Don't come near me.
- Sir!

553
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,550
- Don't follow me.
- Sir!

554
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,570
- Don't follow me!
- Sir.

555
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
Let go of me.

556
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,110
- Go away! Leave me alone!
- Just stay still.

557
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,250
My goodness. Please just stay still.

558
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,190
Hold his legs. Come on. Hold his legs!

559
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,230
- Go away!
- My goodness.

560
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,030
Just stay still.
You're going to hurt yourself.

561
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,420
Sir.

562
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,130
Let go of me. Let go!

563
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,840
Sir. Look at me. It's me.

564
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,380
It's okay.

565
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,180
My goodness. This won't do.

566
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,100
The latch is loose.

567
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,450
The old man's so strong.

568
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,350
He shakes the door to open it.

569
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,290
He gets even more aggressive in October.

570
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,160
I'll get a stronger one from the hardware store.

571
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,620
You do that. You should've done that earlier.

572
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,220
What? Do you think I'm shameless?

573
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,790
Ma'am.

574
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,700
Don't make a report on his personal phone
from now on.

575
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,330
- What?
- Hey, you can call me.

576
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,580
Officer Lee.

577
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,100
You should go inside. He must be exhausted.

578
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,350
You're sick of this too, aren't you?

579
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,990
You want him to be sent to a nursing home, don't you?

580
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,180
- I never even thought of that.
- Well, I did.

581
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,260
I think about it
at least a dozen times a day, every day.

582
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,390
What was that?

583
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,790
It seems like she has some dirt on you.

584
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,540
You should go and get cleaned up.

585
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,990
Mr. Bang is really strong you know.

586
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,200
Inspector Han,
you must've gone through a lot on your first day.

587
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,030
You can't call that a lot.

588
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,970
He's working on the frontline of public welfare.

589
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,930
So sometimes, he'll get some mud
or dog poop on his shoes.

590
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,910
Didn't your colleagues
who went through shift rotation tell you?

591
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,040
I don't have any close colleagues.

592
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,600
And you don't need one?

593
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,100
- No.
- Why not?

594
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,970
If we're from the same region
or we went to the same school,

595
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,040
or if they show kindness
even when I don't want it,

596
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,660
they always try to figure out
what I have at team dinners.

597
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,660
They ask questions to find out
what kind of background I have.

598
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,990
Eventually, they ask me to pull some strings for them.

599
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,990
But I don't like that kind of stuff.

600
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,720
Is it that simple?

601
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,830
It's funny how people around you
always want something from you.

602
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,040
It makes me wonder
if people really are after the same thing.

603
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,810
I wonder just how great your connections are...

604
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,600
to make you the most stubborn man in the world.

605
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,040
It's possible that people around him
really ask for lots of favours.

606
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,790
Yes, you all know why.

607
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,120
His father is...

608
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,220
still alive.

609
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,290
You should stop wiping your hands
and have some tea.

610
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,930
Your nails are going to wear out.

611
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,700
No, thanks.

612
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,910
I don't use common supplies.

613
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,100
Do you have mysophobia?

614
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,780
A police officer with mysophobia?
That's ridiculous.

615
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,910
Having mysophobia isn't that bad.

616
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,470
Mysophobia.

617
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,890
I don't have that.

618
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,350
It's just that I don't like unsanitary environments.

619
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,830
My goodness. What a relief.

620
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,530
Because we're having dinner after work.

621
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,220
But I was going to cancel it
if you really have mysophobia.

622
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,640
Jae Yi's restaurant is quite clean.

623
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,370
So you don't have to worry.

624
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,410
(Manyang Butcher Shop)

625
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,490
(Chief Nam Sang Bae)

626
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,030
(Chief,)

627
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,990
(Chief, I don't think I can join today's team dinner.)

628
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,310
(Chief, I don't think I can ever join team dinners.)

629
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,850
Roll down the window.

630
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,220
Are you from Manyang Substation?

631
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,910
What?

632
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,080
I know that security camera is a piece of junk...

633
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,180
but an officer can't park here.

634
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,330
- I'm not parking.
- There's a parking lot in the back.

635
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,100
Park there.

636
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,060
It's in the back.

637
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,910
We need more drinks.

638
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,720
- Hey, Inspector Han.
- Come and have a seat.

639
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,390
He's from Munju Police Station.

640
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,450
He's Park Jeong Je, the chief of general affairs.

641
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,330
His father is a member of the Munju City Council.

642
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,850
Why would you tell him that?

643
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,720
- I'm Inspector Park Jeong Je.
- That's right.

644
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,330
I'm Han Ju Won.

645
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,200
Here's your wet tissue. Take it.

646
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,260
Have a seat, please.

647
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,240
Inspector Han, where is Officer Lee?

648
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,910
How am I supposed to know that?

649
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,350
He went to Mr. Kang's supermarket.

650
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,510
We're out of makgeolli and soju.

651
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,790
My goodness.
You should take your partner with you.

652
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,410
You should stay with your partner
24 hours a day for 365 days a year.

653
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,660
You should even know
the colour of your partner's underwear.

654
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,350
Now you sound like a real police officer.

655
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,220
Did Inspector Oh teach you that?

656
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,220
Why would I teach him that?

657
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,390
You guys don't even change underwear
when you're undercover for days.

658
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,990
So why would I want to know the colour of it?

659
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,010
Maybe he taught him that.

660
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,310
I told him to count his partner's socks.

661
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,310
You understand way beyond what I teach you.

662
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,140
Gosh, Jin Mook is here.

663
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,370
Hello.

664
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,870
Inspector Han.

665
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,680
He is the most important man in Manyang.

666
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,830
Say hello. He's been assigned to our substation.

667
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,790
Inspector Han Ju Won.

668
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,530
And over there,
he's the owner of Manyang Supermarket.

669
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,390
That's the only place
that sells unpasteurized makgeolli in Munju.

670
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,910
Jin Mook, I'm always grateful.

671
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,970
Don't mention it.

672
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,330
Come join us. Have a drink.

673
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,510
No, no one's watching the store.

674
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,310
- Where is Min Jeong?
- She has a lot of assignments,

675
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,120
so she's spending the night in Seoul.

676
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,790
- I see.
- Enjoy your dinner.

677
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,560
She's only a freshman.
She can't have that many assignments.

678
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,530
We haven't met, right?

679
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,740
I'm Detective Oh Ji Hwa of VCU 1
at Munju Police Station.

680
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,470
I'm that punk's sister.

681
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm Han Ju Won.

682
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,200
He doesn't really look like his father.

683
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,850
I've seen Chief Superintendent Han a few times...

684
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,040
when he was stationed at Munju Police station.

685
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,790
What's with this mood? Did I say something wrong?

686
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,260
I guess he doesn't want us to mention his father's name.

687
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,490
Why is that?

688
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,100
Is he Hong Gil Dong or something?
Here, take it.

689
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,660
That's right. I've been meaning to ask you that.

690
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,930
So Chief Han is the chief superintendent general,

691
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,260
and I'm an assistant inspector,

692
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,010
Inspector, senior inspector, superintendent,

693
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,470
senior superintendent, superintendent general,

694
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,970
senior superintendent general,
chief superintendent general.

695
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,930
He's seven ranks above me!

696
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,180
He's the second-in-command of Korea's police agency.

697
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,620
So you can't dare to mention his name.

698
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,350
I just don't like it.

699
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,740
Is that so wrong?

700
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,180
My father's name...

701
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,290
is Lee Han Ok. It's Lee Han Ok.

702
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,830
Mention his name as much as you want.

703
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,990
Lee Han Ok, Lee Han Ok.

704
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,990
- My father's name...
- Nobody asked.

705
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,700
So what's his name?

706
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,640
His name is Cho Young Soo.

707
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,910
- Cho Young Soo, Cho Young Soo.
- That's right! Father!

708
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,870
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers!

709
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,180
You should sing a different song.

710
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,080
- Or memorize the words at least.
- Sing it properly, Oh Ji Hun.

711

(Manyang Butcher Shop)

712
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,790
The chief hates it...

713
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,260
when someone sneaks out.

714
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,680
So what?

715
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,600
Goodbye.

716
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,260
I don't think you answered my question earlier.

717
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,760
What kind of dirt does she have on you...

718
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,740
that you can't say anything to her?

719
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,280
I killed someone.

720
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,620
I killed their youngest daughter.

721
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,720
How...

722
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,100
How did you kill her?

723
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,540
It's just a joke, yet you're so serious.

724
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,220
You're the loner type.

725
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,790
That's good. I like you.

726
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,290
I'm not interested in being liked by you,
Officer Lee.

727
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,720
I'll decide whom to like, okay?

728
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,430
Go home before the chief catches you.

729
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,870
The mighty Han Ju Won...

730
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,770
got himself in a rat hole.

731
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,740
You're having so much fun, aren't you?

732
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,870
"Fun"? No, I'm just so proud of you.

733
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,980
At this rate, you're going to become a real cop.

734
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,720
- Give me the file.
- What file?

735
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,860
Prosecutor Kwon.

736
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,090
They had absolute control over the file.

737
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,730
I went a long way to get this.

738
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,900
Someone must've caused some real trouble, right?

743

Ju Won, I heard the youngest daughter of Soseong Trading...

744
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,420
is visiting from the States.

745
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,290
It's a shame
that it's not one of the top 50 richest companies,

746
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,830
but I hear she's pretty good-looking.

747
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,860
Of course, you'll need to ask your father first, right?

748
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,860
Why are you being so nosy?

749
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,300
Prosecutors these days must be really free.

750
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,940
I'm not interested.

751
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,370
I meant for me, not you.

752
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,240
Then why would you want to know my father's opinion?

753
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,810
You should ask your father.

754
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,380
Chief Superintendent Han... I mean,

755
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,350
I don't want to fall short of Father's expectations.

756
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,850
"Father"?

757
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,150
Are you that desperate to be restricted by family?

758
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,820
It's not that great anyway.

759
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,560
It is great! You can't cut off family ties.

760
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,600
You know, I can't forget the day I became...

761
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,730
your live-in tutor back when you were in high school.

762
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,770
Chief Superintendent Han met me only briefly,

763
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,470
but he sent me 20,000 dollars as a scholarship.

764
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,910
That's when I thought,

765
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:12,580
"I should become his son
who never falls short of his expectations."

766
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,020
This is how I'm paying back...

767
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,920
his grace.

768
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,790

I'll help you.

Stay low until things die down.

Don't bring disgrace to my name.

the body of Bang Ju Seon, who was 22 years old,

was found as well.

It is Inspector Lee Dong Sik.

801
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,330
He was famous for being a nut case.

802
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,800
An inspector from the Regional Investigation Unit?

803
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,940
Then why is he working
as an assistant inspector at a substation?

804
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,370
Well, that's...

805
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,270
He was a total psycho, that's why.

806
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,140
He couldn't explain how his partner died.

807
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,050
So the whole team got dismissed,

808
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,480
and he got demoted.

809
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,020
What a psycho.
Why are you mentioning his name right now?

810
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,050
Lee Dong Sik...

811
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,690
was involved in the murder of Bang Ju Seon...

812
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,960
and the abduction of Lee Yu Yeon.

813
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,460
He was the suspect.

814
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,970
(Please help us find the missing Yu Yeon.)

815
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,590
Ji Hun, it's not straight.

816
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,010
Isn't that Inspector Han's car?

817
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,110
That car is so awesome.

818
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,350
He's indeed from a rich family.

819
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,520
Ji Hun, pull it up. Pull it up some more.

820
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,090
That side is fine. Just tie it.

821
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,690
(Please help us find the missing Yu Yeon.)

822
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,530
Hello?

823
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,730
Again? When?

824
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,200
Okay, I'm on my way now.

825
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,010
Ji Hun, let's go.

826
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,470
- Where?
- Mr. Bang ran away again.

827
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,180
What?

828
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,150
Make sure to check it.

829
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,680
Inspector Han, stop! Don't come in.
Go look for him right away.

830
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,120
- Sorry?
- Mr. Bang ran away again.

831
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,290
Dong Sik and Ji Hun went to look for him also,

832
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,920
so go assist them.
You know where the reed field is, right?

833
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,760
Why are you just standing there?

834
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,470
It rained yesterday,
so it's extra hard to find him today. Go now.

835
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:00,160
Mr. Bang, where are you?

836
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,360
It's cold, Mr. Bang.

837
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,530
Mr. Bang.

838
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,940
I thought you were him.

839
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,740
What are you doing here?

840
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,780
I came to assist.

841
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,710
Don't annoy me again by getting lost.

842
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,080
Follow right behind me.

843
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,500
Mr. Bang, where are you?

844
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,340
Oh Ji Hun.

845
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,440
What is it? What's going on?

846
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,440
It's nothing.

847
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,110
I just fell down and...

848
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,690
Dong Sik...

849
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,190
Hey, Dong Sik!

850
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,890
Dong Sik!

851
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,030
Dong Sik, come quick!

852
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,630
Dong Sik!

853
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,500
Where are you? Your flashlight!

854
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,870
Shine your flashlight toward the sky!

855
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,080
Dong Sik! Dong Sik!

856
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,350
Dong Sik!

857
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,450
What is it? What?

858
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,430
Yu Yeon...

859
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,210
What's going on?

860
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,750
Oh Ji Hun, go stay in the car.

861
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,240
Who is she?

862
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:47,810
Han Ju Won, you know who she is, right?

863
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,020
How do you know?

864
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,460
How do you know it's a woman from a skeleton?

865
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,200
Why don't you let this go and tell me,

866
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,330
Assistant Inspector Lee?

867
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,450
You should report it, Inspector Han.

868
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,820
You need to report
that we found an unidentified body.

869
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,260
Is that all I need to report?

870
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,090
- Then what else is there?
- A suspect...

871
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,600
you're suspicious of.

872
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,930
Go ahead and report it if you have one.

873
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,310
Assistant Inspector Lee, I have something to ask you.

874
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,750
Lee Yu Yeon, your sister.

875
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,450
Are you sure you didn't kill her?

876
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,040
(We'd like to thank Lee Do Hyun
for his special appearance.)

877
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,190
=Beyond Evil=

878
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,460
Why are you going this far?

879
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,370
Because it feels like an officer is suspecting me.

880
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:21,830
You said her fingertips were cut off, didn't you?

881
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,170
So it must've been about 20 years.

882
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,710
I don't know why and how...

883
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,310
you became so interested in the case
to come all the way here.

884
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,810
But just stay quiet.

885
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:35,010
If they find out who she is,
both you and I will be in trouble.

886
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,780
I'm not asking. This is an order, Inspector Han.

887
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,220
It's been a cold case for 20 years.
Don't you know what that means?

888
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,790
That means we don't have any evidence
to identify the killer.

889
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,560
Did you take it?

890
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,030
Which part of me are you so interested in?

891
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,900
I guess it's not Lee Dong Sik,
the police officer.

892
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,270
Is it Lee Dong Sik, the suspect?
