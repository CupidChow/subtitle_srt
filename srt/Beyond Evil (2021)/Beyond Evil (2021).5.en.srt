1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,379
Kang Min Jung.

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:07,349
Lee Geum Hwa, Yeo Chun Ok,
Wi Sun Hee, Jin Hwa Lim,

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,919
and possibly Han Jeong Im.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,020
And there are more missing persons too.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,189
Bang Ju Seon and Lee Yu Yeon.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,329
Who killed them?

7
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:27,740
Who is the person you're covering up for?

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,380
Jin Hwa Lim.

9
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:36,610
Wi Sun Hee.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,149
- What are you...
- Yeo Chun Ok.

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,350
Lee Geum Hwa.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,329
Lee Geum Hwa.

13
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,600
So her name is Lee Geum Hwa.

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,800
Ms. Lee, you are currently an illegal alien.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,770
Are you sure I can report your name to the court?

16
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:05,710
The woman who you sent to be killed.

17
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,979
You knew she could die.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,080
But you put pressure on her.

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,020
You announced there were 7 victims
but you gave me 8 names.

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,960
My goodness.

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,259
It's too bad...

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,100
that I figured it out.

23
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:29,430
You tried to hide it so hard but
you blew it with a single mistake.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,740
You're unbelievable.

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,600
You told the truth with your own mouth...

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,339
even when you had a great future ahead of you.

27
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,710
And now you put yourself in a big mess.

28
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,850
But all you want to know...

29
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,220
is the person I'm protecting?

30
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,850
All I want to know?

31
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,229
You're the one who sacrificed everything...

32
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,959
to protect that sick freak.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,459
The person who showed real sacrifice up until now...

34
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,829
is you.

35
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,870
But pursuing him isn't worth it?

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,440
If you really think he's not worth it.

37
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,370
Just tell me his name.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,320
Park Jeong Je.

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,290
- I knew it.
- Yoo Jae Yi.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,590
Nam Sang Bae.

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,829
What are you...

42
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:32,660
Oh Ji Hwa, Oh Ji Hun,
Cho Gil Gu, Hwang Gwang Yeong.

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,900
Lee Dong Sik!

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,829
The one I'm protecting.

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,239
Who would that be?

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,139
What on earth are you trying to do?

47
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,709
You asked me so I answered.
Didn't you get that?

48
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:44,780
Do you want me to say it again?

49
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,549
Park Jeong Je.

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,049
Yoo Jae Yi.

51
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,820
Nam Sang Bae.

52
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,790
Oh Ji Hwa.

53
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,560
Oh Ji Hun.

54
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,889
Cho Gil Gu.

55
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:04,929
Hwang Gwang Yeong.

56
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:11,699
Which one do you think it is?

57
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,109
Guess who it is.

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,049
You crazy jerk.

59
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,380
Unlike you, I don't give away a name
just because I'm under pressure.

60
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,720
If I give way so easily, it's no fun.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Are you laughing?

62
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,669
You crazy jerk.
Do you think this is funny?

63
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,169
Hello. I’m Han Gi Hwan,

64
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,780
Chief Superintendent of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

65
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,679
- Father.
- My fellow citizens.

66
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,619
Today, around 4pm, Inspector Han Ju Won,

67
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:03,619
a former agent of the Foreign Affairs Division...

68
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:07,059
has given an interview on a case under investigation.

69
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,290
I'm here to share a word on this occasion.

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,200
Inspector Han Ju Won
has thoughtlessly given an interview...

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,669
before the facts were confirmed through investigation.

72
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:19,700
I apologize for causing anxiety and worry...

73
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,010
as the chief superintendent and Inspector Han's father.

74
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,010
I truly apologize to all of our people.

75
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,479
(Emergency Press Conference
with Chief Superintendent Han Gi Hwan)

76
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,070
Inspector Han's assumption
that this serial murder...

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,220
has continued from 20 years ago...
Inspector Han's assumption that this serial murder...

78
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,530
has continued from 20 years ago...

79
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,180
is a personal opinion without any factual ground.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
And among the seven people he has named...

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,710
as victims of this serial murder,

82
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,410
there are people whose deaths have not been confirmed.

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,510
Also, one of the people
whose death was recently confirmed...

84
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,910
had been found to be in some kind of contact...

85
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,580
with Inspector Han during our investigation.

86
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,890
We do not know how or if he's responsible...

87
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,700
for her disappearance,

88
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
so Inspector Han expressed his protest.

89
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,070
However, I gave an order for him to be reprimanded.

90
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,900
Inspector Han has currently been transferred...

91
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
to a police substation in a rural area.

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,750
He gave the order himself to have you transferred.

93
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,970
Your father is...

94
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,120
cutting you off
in case you end up ruining his reputation.

95
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,510
I am a proud police officer of this nation...

96
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,560
before I am Inspector Han's father.

97
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,650
As one of the leaders who are in charge...

98
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,360
of 120,000 police officers,

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,090
I will not condone this irresponsible action...

100
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,390
that Inspector Han has displayed.

101
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,070
We'll also conduct a thorough investigation...

102
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,870
of his coerced investigation technique.

103
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,810
I solemnly promise before our people...

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
to hold him responsible for all of his actions.

105
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,710
Did you punish your son yourself?

106
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,190
So is what Inspector Han said not true?

107
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,780
What are the techniques he uses
for his investigation?

108
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,990
Do you think he made up lies
as a means of rebellion?

(Han Ju Won)

112
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,770
(Han Ju Won)

113
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,140
When you can't argue with the message,

114
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,190
attack the messenger,

115
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,550
even if the messenger is your son.

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,000
You copied what I did to that one
who went missing...

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
and used it on him.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,700
Since I came up with that tactic,

119
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,130
shouldn't you pay me some kind of royalty?

120
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,400
Think about it, right?

121
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,470
When people want to open up a franchise business,

122
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,270
they get to use the know-how someone else came up with.

123
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,550
That's why they pay a fee to join the franchise...

124
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,050
Mr. Lee, your jokes are way too harsh tonight.

125
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,490
You need to stop that and dig in. Okay?

126
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,080
Why would I eat food
when we have such a great topic to chew on?

127
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,220
The liquor tastes so sweet today.

128
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,830
This is our last dinner together.

129
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,160
I can gladly buy you a drink.

130
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,610
Our last dinner?

131
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,700
Goodness. What do you mean?

132
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,820
I don't think there's a need for us
to meet from now on.

133
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,320
Has this jerk gone crazy?

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,080
He's more like a thief than a police officer.

135
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,760
Be it royalty or franchise fee,

136
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm the one who should take it.
Yet I'm the thief?

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,370
What do you mean, a thief?
That's not true.

138
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,720
What Mr. Lee is trying to say is...

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,800
the Munju redevelopment project you promised...

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,070
What more do you want?
Are you beggars or what?

141
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,450
I think I've done enough for the City of Munju...

142
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,450
when I bowed down before the public...

143
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,550
to handle the nonsense Ju Won spilled.

144
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,990
What does that have to do with Munju?

145
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,410
Your son announced a serial murder,
but you showed up and said...

146
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,460
what he said isn't true,
that he's a strange kid.

147
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,590
You countered his announcement in such a way.

148
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,100
And now, people will mostly let it slide.

149
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,000
We don't know
if this is a disappearance or a murder case.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,730
Everything is now a mystery.

151
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,430
Therefore, there won't be any trouble
with the redevelopment.

152
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,640
Let's just say a few old acquaintances...

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,940
got a chance to catch up and end it at that.

154
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,620
You should finish eating.

155
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,490
Tell him to go.
We'll meet again soon anyway.

156
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,520
Thank you!

157
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,300
Father...

158
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,870
You're so high and mighty.

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,970
That's how ambitious the future commissioner general...

160
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,640
of this country is.

161
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,540
He didn't want to ruin his only son's life,

162
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,120
so he borrowed my hands
to drag Kang Min Jung through the ditch.

163
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,220
But now that his son became a threat to him,
he cuts him off like that.

164
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,510
Unlike someone else I know.

165
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,850
- What was that? You shocked me.
- Where's Jeong Je?

166
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,010
He's in there. He's completely wasted.

167
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,760
Where did you drink that much?

168
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,840
At home.

169
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,300
Then you should've gone to bed.
Why are you out here?

170
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,170
I craved some meat.

171
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,580
You should be in bed
instead of eating meat.

172
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,910
Haven't you had dinner?

173
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,480
I can't go...

174
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,780
to sleep.

175
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,360
- Why not?
- Because I get dreams.

176
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,920
What kind of dreams?

177
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,630
They keep calling me.

178
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,330
Who?

179
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,530
Women.

180
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,250
Women are calling you?

181
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,040
Yes.

182
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,120
He keeps talking about his dream, right?

183
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,010
Where did he pick up this nasty drinking habit?

184
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,860
Are you all right?

185
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,420
What about me?

186
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,100
What?

187
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,140
Do you think that nonsense your partner said
can make me flinch?

188
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,250
When I was 18,

189
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,280
someone said, "I saw your mom..."

190
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,120
"coming out arm-in-arm with this man
from a motel near Busan Station."

191
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,230
So I ran over right away.

192
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,150
(Yoo Jae Yi)

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,790
I went there to find my mom,

194
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,470
but it was still very hard for me
to take a step inside.

195
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,890
But you end up getting used to it.

196
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,090
That was the first time I went to a motel.

197
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,920
The first time is the toughest.

198
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,830
You get used to it after then.

199
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,030
I got used to running over to check
and see if it's my mom...

200
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,030
whenever I hear that an unidentifiable body was found.

201
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,430
Even when people say, "That woman..."

202
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,850
"practically killed her husband
and ran off with another man",

203
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,750
you get used to getting that too.

204
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,780
Do you think I'm not used to
how people keep whispering...

205
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,760
that she's a victim of a serial killer?

206
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,550
I have to live like this
until the day she comes back.

207
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,500
You never know.
People will soon forget about it...

208
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,760
and come back to eat here anyway.

209
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,970
So you two need to eat...

210
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,160
all the meat in the fridge until that day.

211
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,340
I'll give you a buy-1-get-1-free deal.

212
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,510
Is that why you cut up this expensive rib eye for us?

213
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,380
Of course, I need to make a living.

214
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,780
Jeong Je, eat up. It's all done.

215
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,630
Anyway, is something going on
between you and Ji Hun?

216
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,870
No, why?

217
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,430
He loves rib eye, but he refused to come
when I said you were here.

218
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,060
Ji Hun said that?

219
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,080
Dong Sik.

220
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,240
Yes.

221
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,620
Did you...

222
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,750
really not kill Min Jung?

223
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,860
It's been seven days
since a college girl went missing in Munju.

224
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,130
And the police have yet
to find any clue to her whereabouts.

225
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,340
This afternoon, a former inspector
of the Foreign Affairs Division...

226
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,140
suggested a possibility
that it's committed by a serial killer.

227
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,430
The first case with the same MO occurred in 2000.

228
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,110
The killings haven't stopped for the last 20 years.

229
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,400
It's highly possible
that they're serial murder cases.

230
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,080
Since Inspector Han stated his opinion,
the police have been...

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,850
working on the investigation unusually quickly.

232
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,410
At 6pm, about two hours after Inspector Han's interview,

233
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,650
the current Chief Superintendent
of the police requested...

234
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,260
a press conference, and it's unprecedented.

235
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,390
Chief Superintendent Han,
who is also the father of Inspector Han...

236
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,600
issued a public apology at the press conference.

237
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,630
Despite the massive search,

238
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,160
the police have missed the window of opportunity...

239
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,760
(Councilwoman Do's Secretary Jang)

240
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm Reporter Yu Ji Seok of JSB.

241
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,550
Hello, it's you.

242
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,920
I guess the passcode has been changed.

243
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,290
I need to take some stuff from my room.
Please open the door.

244
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,220
Well, Mr. Han told me
not to let you come into the house.

245
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,920
Are you Inspector Han Ju Won?

247
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,220
I'm Reporter Im Gyu Seok of JSB.

248
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,350
- I would like to interview you.
- I have nothing to say.

249
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,800
Please say a word.

250
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
Don't touch me.

251
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,640
Many people tipped the audit office off...

252
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
about you, Inspector Han.

253
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,070
So I did some research myself,
but there wasn't anything special.

254
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,880
And it doesn't really make sense that you,

255
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,470
an honour graduate of the National Police University...

256
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,180
and the gem of the Foreign Affairs Division,

257
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,290
were sent to a place like this by your own father.

258
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,760
And what exactly is "a place like this"?

259
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,560
- Pardon?
- What is "a place like this"?

260
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,350
Well, it's just a small-town police substation.

261
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,800
A tiny one-storied building
where many officers are gathered...

262
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,770
and they patrol the neighbourhood...

263
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,860
with just two police cars?
Is that what you mean?

264
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,860
Yes, that's right.

265
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,440
Does that mean we are not cops?

266
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,910
Are we not cops, Inspector Han?

267
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,290
Are we not cops?

268
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,200
Who said we are not cops?

269
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,390
We are not cops?

270
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,860
I took the exam three times to become a cop.

271
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,630
Unbelievable.

272
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,310
I became an officer in 1990
and I'm retiring next year.

273
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:50,070
Someone just turned my glorious 30 years
into nothing so easily.

274
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,490
Well, I mean...

275
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,460
I always appreciate your hard work.

276
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,790
Okay.

277
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,120
What are you doing now?

278
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,820
Why are you all popping out
as if you've been expecting this?

279
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,620
I told you.

280
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,330
Someone is always watching from somewhere.

281
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
That has nothing to do with this...

282
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,130
You said you're a reporter.
May I see your press card?

283
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,240
Sure.

284
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,350
Oh, Reporter Im Gyu Seok of JSB.

285
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,030
You called and asked us questions
on the day Min Jung went missing.

286
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,030
When we were busy and heartbroken to death.

287
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,390
You had no manners whatsoever.

288
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,970
- So you're a flashy journalist.
- It's "trashy journalist".

289
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,100
Who cares? Just stay quiet.

290
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,010
I'm the chief
of the small Manyang Police Substation...

291
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,810
where there are only two police cars,

292
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,250
Nam Sang Bae.

293
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
Nice to meet you, sir.
I'm Reporter Im.

294
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,550
- Do you see the line over there?
- Yes.

295
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,650
From that line to over there...

296
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,580
is the land of Manyang Substation,
under the state's authority.

297
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,790
Which means...

298
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,350
within the land from there to there,
I can do whatever I want.

299
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,230
Therefore, as of now, I forbid you,

300
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,940
Reporter Im, to be in this area.

301
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,060
- Pardon?
- Your entrance is prohibited...

302
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,330
as of this very moment.
Starting right now.

303
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,480
Come on, Chief Nam. This is unfair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

304
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,310
This is a violation of the freedom of the press.

305
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,480
Freedom of the press?

306
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,810
Come on. That's a bit of a stretch.

307
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,190
And what's so wrong with that?

308
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,110
Nothing's wrong.

309
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,760
You guys don't know
how scary Internet comments can be.

310
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,120
We know.

311
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,590
We know, but I'm not scared of you.

312
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,390
- Leave.
- Fine. I'll leave. Gosh.

313
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
There are just a bunch of idiots here.

314
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,980
Perfect.

315
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,210
- That little...
- Stop talking nonsense.

316
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
- That's offensive.
- Let's go.

317
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,610
I mean you must be offended...

318
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,670
to be one of us.

319
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,340
What are you saying? What about us?

320
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,450
Why are you nodding?

321
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,610
Officer Lee, I'm the one who's offended.

322
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,260
Are you offended because you're in this with me?

323
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,960
No way, sir. I'm more than honoured.

324
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,690
What is it that you want from me?

325
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,090
This isn't the first time a reporter came, is it?

326
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,860
I'm sure you got a lot of calls from angry people as well.

327
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,160
All the staff of Manyang Substation...

328
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,310
must have been denunciated
and cursed out because of me.

329
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,830
So why are you doing this to me?

330
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,810
You barely care for me.
You barely know me.

331
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,880
Inspector Han is still young.

332
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,880
He's like a little boy. Right?

333
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,560
Let's go.

334
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,960
We helped him, and he's still upset.

335
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,650
Well, he may be cranky,
but at least he's consistent.

336
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,800
Does he have to be that consistent though?

337
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,060
It's because...

338
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,310
they are Manyang people.

339
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,370
We may be mean to each other when we're alone,

340
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,520
but when our enemy comes,
we stick together...

341
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,750
and attack the enemy.

342
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,150
What happened here must be solved here.

343
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,150
We just can't see others attacking one of us.

344
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,560
We protect each other first.

345

That's what the people of Manyang are like.

346
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,330
So what do you say?

347
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,900
Do you think you will be all right, Inspector Han?

348

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,630
I haven't seen this police officer.

357

I told you already.

He isn't the police officer?

Let me show you some of my dance moves.

Officer Lee.

366
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,290
Officer Lee, we're in a patrol car right now.

367
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,900
Mr. Lee!

368
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,520
My daughter,

to be stopped from developing...

374

I believe that's what she'll think.

375
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,010
That's why I came here...

376

- Have you gone insane?
- You're crazy!

382

- Don't get off.
- What?

383
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,330
You don't have to go down with me
just because your life is a mess.

384

Don't get off, Inspector Han.

- Go!

only to interrupt the project?

So what?

Your son got released
thanks to my son's testimony.

458

My son was held down by those detectives...

just to get...

460
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
your scumbag of a son out.

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,860
Yet you say I'm not allowed to do this?

462
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,230
Do you want me to tell Jeong Je
to take back what he said?

No!

I'm not holding him down.

477
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,520
He's clinging onto me.

478
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,020
It was like that 20 years ago,

479
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,020
and it's like that now.

480
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,630
You already know that.

481
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,100
He'll be over...

482
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,210
once I let him go.

483
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,380
My goodness, come on.

484
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,350
You made such a mess on this great day.

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,390
You should let her go.

486
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,420
Your life will become very tiring
if you hurt an official.

487
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,120
Mr. Lee Dong Sik!

488
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,360
Hey.

489
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,800
Do you know who I am?

490
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,010
I don't know who you are.

491
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,240
That toad face you have
isn't very easy to forget.

492
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,580
A toad face?

493
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,650
Lee Chang Jin of JL Construction.

494
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,990
I've seen your photo on the yearbook...

495
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,620
Ji Hwa brought 20 years ago.

496
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,860
This punk didn't even grow old.

497
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,090
You look much older.

498
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,060
I see. So you're that jerk.

499
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,630
Let me go.

500
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,040
What would we do if you make a scene again?

501
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,140
Please take him to a nice place.

502
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,910
Let me go.

503
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,450
Let go.

504
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,450
I warned you three times.

505
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,390
- Gosh, what was that?
- He just hit him.

506
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,260
Hey! Take this!

507
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,870
You should go. Take her bag.

508
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,210
All right.

509
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,380
Oh and make a report.

510
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Not at the substation,
but with the VCU.

511
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,810
All right, okay.

512
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,680
You don't have to make a report.

513
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,720
I told you not to get off.

514
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,920
(Han Ju Won)

515
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,590
The chief superintendent's son?

516
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,860
Why is he getting into this?

517
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,960
Secretary Jang, get the car. Hurry.

518
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,460
So Han Ju Won makes an entrance.

519
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,530
Very interesting.

520
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,700
Among many legislations regarding acts of violence,

521
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,170
you're arrested for violating the law
against group assault.

522
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,170
Don't you see how people are taking videos?

523
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,210
Your father will get mad again.

524
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,380
Article 261 of the Criminal Code.

525
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,580
"If an organization
or a group assaults another party,"

526
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,250
"they will be imprisoned for up to five years..."

527
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,750
"or be fined up to 10,000 dollars."

528
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,690
I'm on duty, that's all.

529
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,760
I've seen this wacky stunt before.

530
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,310
Stop!

531
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,780
Take them away.

532
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,780
Mr. Lee Chang Jin, not so fast.

533
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,390
You're under arrest...

534
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,660
for instigating an assault.

535
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,880
(Father)

536
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,050
Hyung Soo, you look fine.

537
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,890
How's your wife?

538
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,260
She's fine.

539
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,430
I guess you two know each other.

540
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,360
This won't be a fair investigation.

541
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,830
I should call someone to back me up.

542
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,530
My love.

543
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,170
Please call my Ji Hwa.

544
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,100
"My Ji Hwa"?

545
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,840
Inspector Oh is his ex-wife.

546
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,980
Yes, she's my ex-wife.

547
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,250
But I'm still in love with her.

548
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
What is love to a man?

549
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,020
It is a flame in his heart.

550
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,750
Even if he sacrifices everything
and turns into ashes,

551
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,420
he won't have the slightest regret...

552
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,730
Don't you dare say her name.

553
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,200
I'll tear up your mouth.

554
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,170
Gosh, he's scary.

555
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,030
You all saw how he is, right?

556
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,440
How violent he is, right?

557
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,570
We were in the middle of an event a few hours ago.

558
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,770
This officer just rammed in.

559
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,180
Then he pushed that poor guy off the stage.

560
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,550
He screamed and threatened people.

561
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,050
He even dragged the councilwoman.

562
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,120
My goodness. Like what he just did.

563
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,620
Actually, he was even crazier than he is now.

564
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,850
Gosh.

565
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,360
Hey, have any photos been posted online yet?

566
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,730
They took many pictures.

567
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,030
- Here it is, Boss.
- Okay.

568
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Check this out.

569
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,910
(Unbelievable footage of a gang fight
with 2 cops in Munju)

570
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,150
That crazy brat.

571
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,890
(Han Ju Won)

572
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,290
The person you have reached is not available.
Please leave a message.

573
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,300
Sir, please calm down and stop calling him.

574
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,870
How can I calm down?

575
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,670
Are you out of your mind?

576
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,040
Under these circumstances,
if you leave a phone record,

577
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,470
it could lead to another problem.

578
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,640
You dealt with it by the principles
in front of the whole nation.

579
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,280
So why are you agitated now?

580
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,210
So you want me to be the chief superintendent,
not his father?

581
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,780
I can help.

582
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,750
I can be the bridge for your family.

583
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,090
How is your father?

584
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,360
He's fine thanks to you.

585
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,830
I heard you made purchase orders
for the New Year holidays.

586
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,900
I really appreciate it.

587
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,910
You don't have to thank me.
We're no strangers.

588
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,210
Your father is old now.
So he should quit selling fruit...

589
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,550
and move somewhere with fresh air
to take some rest.

590
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,180
Hold Ju Won back so he can stay out of trouble.

591
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,520
Leave it to me, Father.

592
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,360
- You may leave now.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,410
(JL Construction, Lee Chang Jin)

594
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,150
(JL Construction, Lee Chang Jin)

595
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,490
Hello, Chief Superintendent.

596
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,490
You said we won't be seeing each other again.

597
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,520
But you called me sooner than I expected.

598
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,430
It's an honour.

599
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,930
Well, I told you...

600
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,230
we'll see each other again soon.

601
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,070
I'm good enough to be a fortune-teller, aren't I?

602
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,900
Lee Dong Sik, that nut case.

603
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,270
Why Lee Chang Jin, that dog of all people?

604
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,810
Woof, woof.

605
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,640
Give me a second.

606
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,350
You called because of the mess your son made, right?

607
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,390
Lee Dong Sik, do you want to die?

608
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,330
Do I have to see that jerk,
Lee Chang Jin because of you?

609
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,770
Are you crazy? Why would you see that jerk?

610
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,640
Don't meet him.

611
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,870
Are you jealous?

612
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,340
Inspector Han, are you out of your mind?

613
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,110
What's going on here?

614
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,180
Why do you cause trouble together?
Are you best friends now?

615
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,020
Best friends?

616
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,150
I just witnessed an illegal act.

617
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,750
So I carried out my duties as an officer.

618
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,020
It wasn't carrying out your duties.

619
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,090
She's right. We weren't carrying out our duties.

620
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,660
Inspector Han, we didn't do that as police officers.

621
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,600
Oh, is that so?

622
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,640
I should've let them beat you up.

623
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,470
I told you not to get out of the car.

624
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,840
I am regretting it now.

625
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,040
Oh my.

626
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,780
If this is an assault case,
Criminal Affairs is in charge.

627
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,480
So why is a VCU officer taking a statement?

628
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,610
It's an abuse of authority.

629
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,750
You two are like a cute, funny couple.

630
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,490
You should move in together.

631
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,290
If you don't have anything else to say,
I'll get going.

632
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,390
That jerk wants to settle things.

633
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,830
I say you take the deal.

634
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,960
Dong Sik, you ruined their event.

635
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,000
But he said he'll let it go.

636
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,500
So you should drop the assault charges.

637
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,630
Why does he have to do that?

638
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,040
Because Lee Chang Jin is your ex-husband?

639
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,170
What did you just say?

640
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,010
I guess that's not why.

641
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,440
Then who are you trying to protect?

642
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,110
Is it Lee Dong Sik again?

643
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,520
Or maybe you're protecting yourself.

644
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,290
What on earth are you talking about?

645
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,690
I'll take the deal.

646
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,060
Mr. Lee.

647
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,890
Don't act like you're a man of principle.

648
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,190
Since when did you become one?

649
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,560
Tell him I'll take the deal
if he takes all the videos down.

650
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,380
Dong Sik.

651
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,720
What? Do you have something to say?

652
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,690
- Well, it's...
- Oh, about Ji Hun.

653
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,890
- What?
- Is he okay?

654
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,490
Why wouldn't he be okay?

655
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,000
He looks fine when we're all together.

656
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,470
But it feels like he's avoiding me.

657
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,430
Is he mad at me or something?

658
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,370
Why would he be mad at you?

659
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,970
Yes, you're right.

660
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,140
Is he returning to his old habit?

661
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,350
He used to stay in his room and avoid seeing people.

662
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,150
That's not it. Nothing's going on. He's fine.

663
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,450
Just go.

664
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,560
Get out of here. And get some rest.

665
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,710
Mr. Lee.

666
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,040
What now? I'm tired.

667
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,710
Why did you take the deal?

668
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,510
A joint assault is punishable
even if they settle things.

669
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,920
A joint assault?

670
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,650
But I was assaulted by one guy,
and he's the only one I beat up.

671
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,760
Why are you doing this?

672
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,990
There's no reason.

673
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,160
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

674
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,040
What you did today.

675
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,440
You didn't do that in the heat of the moment.

676
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,340
And I think you got what you wanted.

677
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,040
That's why you took the deal.

678
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,950
Get what I want? I'm just a crazy guy.

679
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,550
I went crazy so I got into a fight. That's all.

680
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,790
Did you go crazy
because they messed with Kang Jin Mook?

681
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,990
Did you say that to Councilwoman Do...

682
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,760
so they won't do that to him again?

683
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,070
"Listen up, Jeong Je's mother."

684
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,410
"Your precious son, Park Jeong Je?"

685
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,180
"I'm not holding him down."

686
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,650
"He's clinging onto me."

687
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,250
"It was like that 20 years ago,"

688
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,390
"and it's like that now."

689
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,160
It worked well.

690
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,060
What's the story behind it?

691
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,130
So you're saying...

692
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,340
Park Jeong Je and I have a big story behind us?

693
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,740
I killed my sister
and I've been working with him for 20 years.

694
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,310
We've killed people together.

695
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,850
And ended up killing Min Jung too.
Is that it?

696
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,550
Okay.

697
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,750
Let's say it's true.

698
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,560
We've killed people together
and he is my accomplice.

699
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,860
So how far can you take this, Inspector Han?

700
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,260
How far?

701
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,960
To get the guys who killed people
and got away with it for 20 years.

702
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,470
How far will you go? How determined are you to get us?

703
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,270
You love to abide by the rules and principles.

704
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,010
Can you throw it all away?

705
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,110
Why would I throw it all away?

706
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,850
That will never happen.

707
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,520
You used that woman even when you knew she could die.

708
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,520
But now you want to abide by the rules and principles?

709
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,660
That must be why you keep
coming to me to ask the reason,

710
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,090
why I said such things and the story behind it.

711
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,100
You keep asking questions only.

712
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,770
You live such a comfortable life.

713
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,140
See you later, Inspector Han.

714
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,650
Mr. Lee.

715
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,750
Mr. Lee!

716
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,390
I'm not done yet.

717
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,990
Remember what I told you what partners are?

718
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,020
They need to do anything for each other.

719
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,790
Okay, Dong Sik.

720
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,230
I'll do anything you tell me.

721
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,630
So please, Dong Sik.

722
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,030
Sang Yeob.

723
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,670
How far...

724
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,110
do you think he can make it?

725
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,420
Didn't he throw me out first?

726
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,190
(Kwon Hyeok)

727
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,270
Are you going through puberty or something?

728
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,370
You were a quiet kid growing up,

729
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:06,080
so why do you keep
causing trouble after trouble now?

730
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,410
What's wrong with that? Isn't it nice?

731
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,650
He told me not to come near him nor to the house.

732
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,890
But he called me right away when I caused trouble.

733
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,390
And he sent me his errand boy too.

734
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,660
You know Father doesn't let anyone
take care of the family matter.

735
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,870
Senior Inspector Han of the audit office will call you.

736
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,940
Fix a date, go to the office,
and cooperate with him.

737
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,810
Tell him that she seems like...

738
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,510
one of the people you met during the investigation.

739
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,880
Tell him that you think she sent you the text...

740
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,050
because you gave her your name card,
but you're not sure why.

741
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,420
He said that's all you need to say.

742
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,460
If you stay low for a while,
you'll be cleared of all suspicion.

743
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,390
Sounds like a well-written scenario.

744
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,460
Giving them vague answers.
That's all I need to do.

745
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,400
Did Father...

746
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,940
Did Chief Superintendent Han really tell you that?

747
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,570
What? Well, yes.

748
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,980
You said that's what happened. You told him that.

749
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,710
What's with that look? Isn't that what happened?

750
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,120
Did something happen with the woman you found dead?

751
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,120
So how far can you take this, Inspector Han?

752
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,820
You love to abide by the rules and principles.

753
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,490
Can you throw it all away?

754
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,460
Ju Won. You're cranky and strict,

755
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,270
so you're annoying sometimes.

756
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,170
But I like that about you.

757
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,170
I know how hard it is to live as a man of principle.

758
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,870
You've lived your whole life that way.

759
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:45,740
And I know you will live the rest of your life
following the principles.

760
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,820
I know that you're not the type to lie,

761
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,820
so if the story you told Father isn't true,
tell me now.

762
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,220
No, it is true.

763
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,990
There is no other reason...

764
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,130
why she knew my number.

765
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,800
Then you don't have to worry about the audit office.

766
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,910
Don't cause any more trouble.

767
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,680
If you stay put, everything will be sorted out.

768
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,510
Just do the six-month mandatory duty assignment,

769
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,510
and you'll return to Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

770
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:24,380
Don't mention anything about serial murders
and stay low!

771
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,090
Otherwise, Father...

772
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,450
will give up on you.

773
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,360
My father will give up on me?

774
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,990
How do you know that?

775
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:38,960
Because Father shares everything with me.

776
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,140
Now I feel like we've finally become a real family.

777
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,640
Then you must be willing
to do anything for your family.

778
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,670
Please look into someone for me.

779
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,210
Find out which school he went to,

780
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,640
and how he's lived his life.
Look into him thoroughly.

781
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,410
Why should I?

782
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,810
You said we're family.

783
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,650
You're still a child, aren't you?

784
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,450
Even though we're family,

785
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,420
you can't just have everything you want by whining.

786
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,430
Please do me a favour.

787
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,760
What?

788
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,070
I think I just heard a sentence
that'd never come out of...

789
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,210
Han Ju Won's mouth.
Or did I hear it wrong?

790
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,040
Do me a favour. Help me out.

791
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,750
Who is this person?

792
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,050
Inspector Park Jeong Je
of the investigation assistance team...

793
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,620
at Munju Police Station.

794
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,260
You're the cop who was arrested
and released last week, right?

795
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,960
I hear the same thing happened 20 years ago.

796
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,830
The suspect of your sister's murder,
Officer Lee Dong Sik.

797
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,370
Come on, Officer Lee.
Why don't you give an interview?

798
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,040
I won't mention your name.
Maybe just your surname.

799
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,140
It's only a matter of time
before articles about you get published.

800
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,480
What a strange twist of fate, right?

801
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,350
20 years ago, it was your sister.

802
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,750
And 20 years later,

803
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,420
you were arrested without a warrant
for murdering a girl...

804
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,920
whom you thought of as your niece.

805
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,020
They're not dead.

806
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,860
What?

807
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,030
Their bodies haven't been found.

808
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:17,200
You can't consider them dead
just because you're a reporter.

809
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,560
Well, that's...

810
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,370
Fine. If you're offended by that,

811
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,500
let's say you were arrested
for abducting and wounding a girl.

812
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,810
Let's see.

813
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,670
Here.

814
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,750
You're barking up the wrong tree.
It's not me.

815
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
What do you mean it's not you?

816
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,750
I saw you getting off a car with a cap
on at the station.

817
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,550
You're the same guy.

818
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,660
I'm sure of it. I saw you.

819
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,760
- Who tipped you off?
- What?

820
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,630
You said you saw me getting off a car.

821
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,740
That means you were waiting for me to get there.

822
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,310
Will you do the interview then?

823
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,310
Mr. Im.

824
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,290
From there to that side over there,

825
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,190
there's no security camera in this area.
Not even one.

826
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,490
Who is it?

827
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,530
Who tipped you off?

828
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,200
(No subject)

829
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,950
Dong Sik.

830
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,090
Why did you ask to see me
in the basement this early?

831
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,320
Did something happen?

832
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,430
- Come take a seat.
- Sorry?

833
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,260
Okay.

834
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,550
What's wrong?

835
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,280
You're being strange.

836
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,410
Why did you do it?

837
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,760
- What do you mean?
- Why did you do that to me?

838
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,550
Why did you tip them off about me?

839
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,660
No, that's...
Well... What happened was...

840
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,200
Why did you sell me out?

841
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,760
That's not true!
No, I did not sell you out.

842
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,570
They took photos of me,
so now everyone knows who I am.

843
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,430
Why on earth did you sell me out?

844
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,700
No... That's not...

845
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,450
That's not what happened.

846
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,410
That's not true.

847
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,180
Why did you sell me out? Why?

848
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,260
- Why?
- Wait!

849
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,860
Because you didn't do it.

850
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,360
You didn't do it.

851
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,090
What did I not do?

852
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,800
What is it?

853
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,800
What did I not do?

854
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,700
What is it?

855
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,510
You're not the one...

856
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,280
who killed Min Jung.

857
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,530
Hold on. I'll call you back.

858
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,780
Jeong Je! What are you doing here?

859
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,530
I came to take you home.

860
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:53,050
I don't think Jeong Je killed Min Jung.

861
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,240
I don't think he did.

862
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:57,820
But you're far from being a suspect too.

863
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,550
So it didn't make any sense that they arrested you.

864
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,450
That's why I tipped them off.

865
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,950
To tell them that the police got the wrong guy.

866
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,160
How can a police officer be a murderer?

867
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,930
But the reporter asked me how I'm sure
that you didn't kill Min Jung.

868
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,840
If I tell him that I saw Jeong Je,

869
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,110
then I'd also need to tell him
that I followed Min Jung.

870
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,780
Dong Sik.

871
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,470
I'm not a stalker. No, I'm not.

872
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,090
Jeong Je didn't do it.
You didn't do it either.

873
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,390
Really, I'm not a stalker.

874
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,890
Dong Sik.

875
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,260
You trust me, right? Right?

876
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,450
Ji Hun.

877
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,130
Don't tell that to anyone.

878
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,590
- Okay.
- Don't do it.

879
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,740
You'll be hurt.

880
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:54,740
I'll...

881
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,780
take care of everything.

882
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,550
I'll do that.

883
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,090
(The 10 fingers as they were found)

884
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,780
You come to my house as if it's your own.

885
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,010
Should I collect rent or something?

886
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,180
What's the reason?

887
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,260
Why would you cover up for someone like him?

888
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,530
Who are you talking about?

889
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,720
Park Jeong Je.

890
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,800
Where did Park Jeong Je go
after Lee Yu Yeon went missing?

891
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,260
He went to the States to study.

892
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,010
That's what he was planning to do anyway.

893
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,720
254-1, Obun-Ri, Gangeul-myeon, Hansong,
North Chungcheong Province.

894
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,180
Hansong Mental Hospital.

895
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,720
(Park Jeong Je, alcohol-induced mental disorder)

896
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,030
He was involuntarily hospitalized for four years.

897
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,590
During all those years, he caused a ruckus,

898
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:54,160
saying he had killed a doe,
and he even had seizures.

899
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:55,630
To be precise,

900
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,140
he said he killed a person who looked like a doe.

901
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,340
Why are you covering up for a jerk like him?

902
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,910
You're his accomplice, aren't you?

903
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,240
You found just one piece of information,

904
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,280
and yet, you're looking all triumphant.

905
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,010
You stopped me to ask questions...

906
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,910
with glistening eyes.

907
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,530
And this is the only thing you found out?

908
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,130
Park Jeong Je did not go to the States to study.

909
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,090
He was in a mental hospital.

910
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,220
What about it?

911
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,390
That's just academic background forgery.

912
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,860
Just academic background forgery?

913
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,610
"Don't tell that to anyone."

914
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,970
"I'll take care of everything."

915
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,880
"Don't tell anyone that it's Park Jeong Je..."

916
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,910
"whom Min Jung met last."

917
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:58,090
How will you explain this?

918
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,470
Gosh, darn it.

919
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:12,610
I was going to go easy on you for being cute,
but I can't anymore.

920
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,740
Yes, your effort is commendable.

921
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,320
I guess you chose an illegal way...

922
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,490
to do a little digging on Park Jeong Je.

923
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,260
It doesn't make any sense.

924
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,720
Park Jeong Je lied about going to the States...

925
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,030
and was hospitalized in a mental hospital
after Lee Yu Yeon died.

926
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,320
It's because he had hallucinations
about killing a person...

927
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,970
who looks like a doe.

928
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,470
He's the last person Min Jung met.

929
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,570
And it seems like Lee Dong Sik
is covering up for Park Jeong Je.

930
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,910
That's all there is.
Are you being serious?

931
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,950
You came running, looking all triumphant,

932
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:51,340
after only finding that out?

933
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,910
Hey, Inspector Han.

934
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,550
Will you come to your senses?

935
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,680
Where is the evidence
that proves Park Jeong Je killed Lee Yu Yeon?

936
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:03,990
Where is the evidence
that proves Park Jeong Je killed Kang Min Jung?

937
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,820
And where is the evidence
that proves I'm his accomplice?

938
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,860
Do you have it? Tell me!

939
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,880
I guess I put too much hope on you.

940
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,200
Why don't you point your gun at me again
and make me confess?

941
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,280
Or go disclose everything to the reporters.

942
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,910
Actually, that'd be better.
You're good at such things.

943
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,050
I see.

944
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,890
I get it now.

945
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,430
The person I had to cover up for was Park Jeong Je.

946
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,260
You jerk!

947
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,200
Why are you doing this to me?

948
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,110
Why are you doing this to me, Inspector Han?

949
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,340
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

950
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,280
Did you think I would tell you?

951
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:01,840
Why should I? Why should I tell you?

952
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,160
You want to catch the culprit...

953
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,410
because we have duties as a police officer?

954
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,720
Are you going to tell me to put trust in you?

955
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,700
Cut the nonsense, Inspector Han.
You're not that type of guy.

956
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,930
Have you already forgotten Lee Geum Hwa?

957
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,030
You of all people shouldn't forget her.

958
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,780
You're the one who...

959
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,140
forced her into a corner and killed her.

960
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:32,240
I hear no one came to collect her body.

961
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,950
You're only doing this...

962
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,180
to cover up her death.

963
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,930
You're going to deal with this case
and return to Seoul in glory.

964
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,950
I'll be fine with it if you admit that.

965
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,070
Isn't that what you want, Inspector Han?

966
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,470
You're right. Is that so wrong?

967
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,050
Is it so wrong to try and catch that jerk to do that?

968
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,640
It's true that I carried out a sting operation.

969
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,320
It's true that I forced her into a corner.

970
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,320
It's true that I did all that.
That's why I'm going to catch him!

971
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,220
Even if everyone forgets
and no one comes to claim her body,

972
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,860
I remember her, so I'll catch him!

973
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,990
Before...

974
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,140
someone like me...

975
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,680
kills another person,

976
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,570
I will make sure...

977
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,110
to catch that jerk!

978
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,050
So tell me.

979
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,890
Whether you believe me or not,

980
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,320
just tell me, Lee Dong Sik!

981
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,970
Who is that jerk?

982
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,760
Hold on. I'll call you back.

983
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,800
Jeong Je! What are you doing here?

984
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,110
I came to take you home.

985
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:49,640
(We'd like to thank Lee Do Hyun
for his special appearance.)

986
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:07,860
=Beyond Evil=

987
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,110
That is...

988
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,410
In our country,

989
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,010
is it possible to get an indictment for murder
in the absence of a body?

990
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:18,640
Of all people, Kang Min Jung is the one
who's missing here.

991
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,510
So who are you suspecting now?

992
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,220
Is it wrong to suspect someone?

993
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,660
I should suspect everyone.

994
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,890
I heard a voice.

995
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,280
The voice of a woman.

996
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,200
You have the footage from the dashcam, don't you?

997
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,660
Is your son the killer?

998
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,930
Are you saying Kang Min Jung's cell phone is on?
