1
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:14,359
(All characters, organizations, locations, )

2
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,029
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:19,628
(December 2020, Busan)

4
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:14,748
I guess a rich kid
has a luxurious way of skipping work,

5
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:18,459
drinking champagne
that costs hundreds of dollars this early.

6
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:23,659
Why is this drunk's face so serene?
This is annoying.

7
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,198
- Who are you?
- It's me.

8
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:31,099
I thought you'd want to know
what happened in Munju.

9
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:33,198
That's why I came here myself.

10
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:34,608
I don't care.

11
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,349
Kang Jin Mook.

12
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:47,388
The culprit died, so naturally,
the case wasn't indicted.

13
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:48,819
No one knows...

14
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,758
who gave him the fishing line.

15
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:53,758
On the day he killed himself,

16
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:56,728
the security cameras at Munju Station
all went down or something.

17
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,398
Everything is over.

18
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:01,069
It feels odd like I didn't clean my behind
after doing my business.

19
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,539
- Go.
- You don't want to share?

20
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,268
Just go.

21
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,178
After all, I'm a prosecutor.

22
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,548
I was wondering if I should just sit around...

23
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,319
and watch this awkward case unravel.

24
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,888
Did you fight with that girl?

25
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:29,428
Yoo Jae Yi, the owner of that butcher shop?

26
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,629
She disappeared as soon as Kang Jin Mook died,
just like you.

27
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:36,469
I heard she's in Busan.

28
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,268
I thought you two eloped or something.

29
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,638
That illegal masseuse and sex worker.

30
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,879
It's nothing, Ju Won.

31
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:55,048
- What?
- I was really shocked.

32
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:56,749
I couldn't believe a neat freak like you...

33
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,589
let something like that hold you back.

34
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:02,289
Your father and I said
we had everything under control.

35
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,999
So why did Han Ju Won
make that useless confession...

36
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:07,298
which nobody wanted?

37
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,029
A person died.

38
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,899
- And I'll be punished for what...
- Forget it, kid.

39
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:15,768
You finally carried out a sting operation,

40
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:17,608
so I thought you finally got a sense of reality.

41
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:20,039
But it sounds like
you're still stuck in your bubble.

42
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,888
Stop putting on a show.

43
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:30,789
I know what happened with Kang Jin Mook.

44
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,089
You didn't arrest him by the law.

45
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,298
You and Lee Dong Sik were already hiding at his place...

46
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:40,399
before he took out Kang Min Jung's dead body.

47
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:43,168
Two detectives carried out the operation,

48
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,698
but one confidently accepted the promotion...

49
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,768
whereas the other turned it down
and went off the grid.

50
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,008
Accepted the promotion?
Who did? Lee Dong Sik?

51
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,078
Why not? Can't he be promoted?

52
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:55,879
He caught a serial killer.

53
00:03:56,749 --> 00:04:00,078
What did he say to you? You can tell me.

54
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,159
Stop making up stories and get lost.

55
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,888
- I'll help you.
- I said get lost.

56
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,159
Ju Won, a good boy like you
who learned everything from books...

57
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,328
and believes the world is just and fair,

58
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:18,298
shouldn't get involved with a nut case
like Lee Dong Sik.

59
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,469
Because I think
you'll go back to where you belong.

60
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:25,779
He'll make use of you...

61
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,779
in every single way.

62
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,279
Why can't you cut anyone off?

63
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,519
You must be wondering
why you're feeling so uncomfortable.

64
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,519
And nothing will go your way.

65
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:40,019
If I make it out alive,

66
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,289
you're going to ruin your life and your father's,

67
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:47,029
who was going to
become the next Commissioner General.

68
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,269
You struggle.

69
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,469
I'll catch you.

70
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:53,339
I'll catch you no matter what.

71
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,469
And you put up a fight.

72
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:56,668
Turning myself in?

73
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,779
Why would I? What did I do wrong?

74
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:03,478
Then he ends up devouring you.

75
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:06,818
And like that, the end.

76
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,789
It's okay, Ju Won. We can't help it.

77
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,918
It's just the hard truth.

78
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,459
How can you,
who had a privileged life of protection,

79
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,959
win against a guy
who had to tough it out on the streets?

80
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,529
You could never win unless you were reborn.

81
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,668
That's why...

82
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,298
I, who also lived a tough life,

83
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,509
will do everything I can to...

84
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,709
You're right. You're right about everything.

85
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:34,279
Right? You're finally getting honest.

86
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,579
You can leave everything to me.

87
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,418
All I have to do is be reborn.

88
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:38,978
What?

89
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,449
Thanks, Hyeok.

90
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:49,159
You don't get to end this.

91
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,329
- Goodness, you're here early.
- Hello.

92
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,938
- Hello, you're here.
- You're here.

93
00:05:57,938 --> 00:06:01,808
Hey, you're looking pretty in that makeup.
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,608
I don't have any friends to hang out with.

95
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,539
- Goodness.
- You have no friends...

96
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,048
because you're stuck here
gutting fish with these old ladies.

97
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:10,779
There are lots of great places downtown.

98
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,618
And I hear there are plenty of stylish guys too.

99
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,349
I've been there, but it wasn't that great.

100
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,988
I didn't like anyone there,

101
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,988
and I don't think I could get along with them.

102
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:21,259
It's odd, but I feel more at ease
when I'm with married women.

103
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,628
What good is that for?
How will you get married?

104
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,699
I'll stay single and live here with you.

105
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,699
- Goodness.
- You're out of your mind.

106
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,699
Why would you live here with us?

107
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,709
She's trying to ruin her life.

108
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,378
Look at how she's using that knife.
Look at her.

109
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:40,548
Where did this young girl learn how to do that?

110
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,079
Hey, you're done for the day.
Go out and have fun.

111
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,779
It's all right. This one.
Let's dry this one first.

112
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,289
- You can dry this one first.
- Now you're ordering me around.

113
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,959
- My goodness.
- If you like to work so much,

114
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,159
- you can do everything.
- That's right.

115
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,858
Hurry up and come here.

116
00:06:57,858 --> 00:07:00,969
- We'll make delicious coffee.
- Sounds great.

117
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:26,589
- So who are you looking for?
- A young woman?

118
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:30,058
She must've shown up about two weeks ago.

119
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,199
This is her. Please take a look.

120
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,868
- No, we've never seen her.
- Goodness.

121
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,039
Why? Have you seen her?

122
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,438
- I haven't seen her here.
- What about you?

123
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,738
I haven't seen her either.

124
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,878
Really? That's odd.

125
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:54,248
Her phone signal was caught around here.

126
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,849
Her, her phone signal?

127
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,928
I'm with the police.
You've seen her, right?

128
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,558
- No.
- Really?

129
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:06,428
Then may I check back there?

130
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:08,868
- No.
- Wait, she's not here.

131
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:11,269
- Where are you going?
- You can't go in there.

132
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:30,149
Why do you keep running away, Jae Yi?

133
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,058
My gosh.

134
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,568
The person you have reached is not available.
Please leave...

135
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,620
(Private detective service, "Quick".
We found one at a repair shop.)

136
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:12,159

(Please help us find the missing Yu Yeon.)

141
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,450
What are you laughing about?

142
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,020
Are you going to leave him like that?

143
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,690
You should interrogate him.

144
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,620
How can I interrogate Chief Nam?

145
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,860
Chief Nam? He's been arrested as a suspect.

146
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,490
Get out. Get out of here!

147
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,300
We are doing our best too.

148
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
You haven't gotten a word out of him
and you call that doing your best?

149
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,870
How many officers from Manyang Substation
have been arrested?

150
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,300
What would the reporters say if they find out?

151
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,010
Things are barely settled around here.

152
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,810
That's why I told you
not to arrest him without a warrant.

153
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,740
And we're not talking about any suspect.
It's Sang Bae.

154
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,750
Sang Bae?

155
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,280
If you're that close with him,
go get a confession out of him.

156
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,820
He said he would only talk to
Oh Ji Hwa or Lee Dong Sik.

157
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,090
You know how stubborn he is.

158
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,220
How would Dong Sik even come here?

159
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,490
He's going through a lot too.

160
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,480
You've been here?

161
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,820
Here?

162
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,460
You've been here...

163
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,790
all this time.

164
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,930
Jeong Je.

165
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,070
What's wrong?

166
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,600
- Hey, Ji Hwa.
- Are you all right?

167
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
It's just that...

168
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,610
I'm so shocked.

169
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,210
I asked you here so you can comfort Dong Sik.

170
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,780
You should get it together.

171
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,190
I know. I'm sorry.

172
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,360
Where's Dong Sik? Is he upstairs?

173
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,560
Boss.

174
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,590
Did Dong Sik tell you he was leaving?

175
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,660
No. Why?

176
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,270
I can't find him.
He's not upstairs or down here.

177
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,470
- Dong Sik.
- Who are you talking to?

178
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,710
- Oh, you came.
- Yes.

179
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,680
Hey, where have you been?

180
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,390
It seemed like forever waiting for you here.

181
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,260
I found Yu Yeon's body.

182
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,930
Good.

183
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,330
Good for you.

184
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,570
Get going then. You should be with her.

185
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,940
It's not like I found her alive.

186
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,410
So what's the point of being with her?

187
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,740
What are you talking about?

188
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,150
You've waited for this moment for the last 21 years.

189
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Yes, I have.

190
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,090
I've imagined things for the last 21 years.

191
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,930
I've imagined her alive...

192
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,830
in a small town in the country.

193
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,100
I've imagined bumping into her there.

194
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,510
Then...

195
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,650
I've imagined finding her bloated body...

196
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
floating down the stream.

197
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,260
Then I imagined her buried in a mountain valley...

198
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,700
that is half-rotten...

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,630
and unrecognisable.

200
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,240
"Is this really my sister?"

201
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,840
I've imagined myself saying that.

202
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,610
From several years ago,

203
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,820
I've imagined finding her...

204
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,290
in a small pot at a charnel house
for those who died...

205
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,490
without family or friends.

206
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,160
I thought, "Maybe she's dead."

207
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,030
"I'm sure she's dead."

208
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,500
I've always known.

209
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,610
But I couldn't give up.

210
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,820
So I start over...

211
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
from the part where I bump into her.

212
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,130
It goes over and over again.

213
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
But Chief.

214
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,710
I've never imagined this.

215
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,310
Finding her in my basement.

216
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,020
In the house where I eat and sleep.

217
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,100
You don't know
how many times I've looked at that wall.

218
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,580
I thought it would end if I found her.

219
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,860
But it didn't.

220
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,900
Mr. Nam Sang Bae.

221
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,940
Did you kill Kang Jin Mook?

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,270
- No.
- The same brand of fishing line...

223
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,210
that Kang Jin Mook used to hang himself...

224
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,380
and Yoon Mi Hye's autopsy report
that Kang Jin Mook swallowed...

225
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,850
were found in the safe in your office.

226
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,450
Did you hand the fishing line
and the autopsy report...

227
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,950
to Kang Jin Mook?

228
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,720
- No.
- The morning of November 10, 2020.

229
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,330
Did you visit the VCU's holding cell
at Munju Police Station?

230
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,730
- No, I didn't.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

231
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,070
Dong Sik.

232
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,610
21 years ago, I should've...

234
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,420
I'm sorry. I'm the guilty one.

235
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,390
If you are sorry, why are you sitting in here?

236
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,630
I told you not to do anything.

237
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,670
I didn't do anything.

238
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,130
Do I...

239
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,600
have to watch you ruining your life?

240
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,310
I won't ruin my life.

241
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,310
Don't you worry about me.

242
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,410
After I'm done with it,
I'm going to leave Munju.

243
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,580
I'm going to live somewhere
with clean air and water...

244
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,520
for the rest of my life.

245
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,660
What do you mean,
after you're done with it?

246
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,030
You have to stay here...

247
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
for 72 hours. Then you're free to go.

248
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,860
Don't you two have anything to say?

249
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,300
- About what?
- Detective Nam wasn't the only one.

250
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,270
- Jung Cheol Mun.
- How dare you!

251
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,440
Kwak Oh Seob.

252
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,310
All three of you investigated
Lee Yu Yeon's case 21 years ago.

253
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,440
Good job.

254
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,780
Does he really have to stay
in the holding cell for 72 hours?

255
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,820
Yes, he has to.

256
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,490
Are you all right?

257
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,430
Why wouldn't I be?

258
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,130
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart.

259
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
Congratulations on finding Yu Yeon.

260
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,980
You went through a lot, Dong Sik.

261
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,680
Everyone hasn't eaten yet, right?

262
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,920
I'm hungry. Let's have dinner.

263
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,550
Chief is in the holding cell.
How can we eat something?

264
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,660
Aren't you worried about him?

265
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,290
I'm sure he'll be all right.

266
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,190
He'll be out soon.

267
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,160
He's not the kind of man who will hurt someone.

268
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Right?

269
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,700
Of course not. He would never.

270
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,010
So let's stop worrying about him and have dinner.

271
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,710
Let me help you, Jae Yi.

272
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,690
I heard officers at the station
were free to enter Chief's office...

273
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,330
after he left work.

274
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,930
Don't they have to lock the door at night?

275
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,500
Yes, but he said it's okay to go in...

276
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,900
if we need anything from his office.

277
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,100
That means any officer could've...

278
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,910
touched his safe at night.

279
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,710
Then won't the evidence lose admissibility?

280
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,310
We won't get a warrant out of it.

281
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,950
Then he'll be out soon.

282
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,150
Unless we find another evidence or witness.

283
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,450
Couldn't you specify the time?

284
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,590
The last time he checked the safe
was four days ago.

285
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,360
He said neither the fishing line
nor the postmortem result wasn't there.

286
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,360
If it was 4 days ago, Unit 3, then us,

287
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,730
and Unit Two took turns on the night duty.

288
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,340
That means everyone at Manyang Substation is a suspect.

289
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,370
That means all of them are police officers.

290
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,210
Then why did an officer...

291
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,980
stash fake evidence in the safe of the chief's office?

292
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,880
Because they wanted the chief to take the blame...

293
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,250
Exactly. Why would a police officer do that?

294
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,990
An officer would already know
those couldn't be used as evidence.

295
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,560
- Yes.
- And they did this...

296
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,190
to a police chief
who has been in this career for decades.

297
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,360
So why?

298
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,170
In order to catch the police's attention,

299
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,710
this person fabricated the evidence...

300
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,040
in the safe of the chief's office?

301
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,850
Who would do something like that?

302
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,620
What? Why?

303
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,240
I thought I made a little too much.
This is great. Please sit.

304
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,120
I heard Ms. Lee Yu Yeon was found.

305
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,590
I'm glad. I mean it.

306
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,060
May the deceased rest in peace.

307
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,260
Thank you.

308
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,800
We're both off. Do you want a glass of wine?

309
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,140
Why did you leave the fishing line
and the postmortem report there?

310
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,410
Are you talking to me?

311
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,710
Do you have evidence?

312
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,350
You were caught on camera.

313
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,680
You were caught with a smile.

314
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,220
The security camera?

315
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,960
Oh, the security camera
in front of the chief's office?

316
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,430
You're right. I was probably caught there.

317
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,400
But was I the only one who was caught
on that security camera?

318
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,900
No.

319
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,300
A lot of other people who work at Manyang Substation.

320
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,740
Then why did you single me out as the culprit?

321
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,480
You're the only one who could've done that.

322
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,550
Are you saying I could frame Chief Nam...

323
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,720
for aiding and abetting Kang Jin Mook's suicide?

324
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,790
Why did you do that?

325
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,590
My dear Mr. Lee,

326
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,360
you don't seem as smart as I thought.

327
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,360
Is the reason that important?

328
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,640
If you came all the way here to ask me that...

329
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,640
I, Han Ju Won,

330
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,380
did not put the fishing line
and the postmortem report...

331
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,650
for Yoon Mi Hye in the safe...

332
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,220
located in the chief's office
of Manyang Police Substation.

333
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,360
- Really?
- Why do you think it was me?

334
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,090
Just because I was caught...

335
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,660
on the security footage in front of his office,

336
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,300
where anyone could've come and gone?

337
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,240
I remember something that somebody once said.

338
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,140
Is that all?

339
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,640
You ran all the way here with that little evidence?

340
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,010
I knew my first impression of you was correct.

341
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,820
My first impression?
How did I come off?

342
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,420
That you're one cute rich kid.

343
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,330
Thank you.

344
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,660
Inspector Han, do your best
no matter what you're up to.

345
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,830
I look forward to it.

346
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,040
You should do your best, Mr. Lee.

347
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,110
The people of Manyang...

348
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,920
always go after one another,

349
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,150
but once they see an outside intruder,

350
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,320
they suddenly work together as one
and take down the enemy first.

351
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,660
Be careful, Mr. Lee.

352
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,490
I should be careful of the people of Manyang?

353
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,600
Wait, do you consider yourself
a part of the community?

354
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,430
You returned to Manyang in 2018.

355
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,070
And the people of Manyang...

356
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,340
didn't forget
that you were the suspect for the last 20 years.

357
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,070
I have no idea...

358
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,110
why you consider yourself
a member of that community.

359
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,550
Yoo Jae Yi...

360
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,220
visited Munju Station
on the day Kang Jin Mook died.

361
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,060
But she didn't tell you anything,
went out of touch for three months,

362
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,100
then only showed up again
after she received a threat...

363
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,970
that someone will disclose the security footage.

364
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,300
What do you think she's hiding?

365
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,500
What about Constable Oh Ji Hun?

366
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,570
He went after Kang Min Jung...

367
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,710
and was the last witness who saw her.

368
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:24,440
And he also told reporters
that you were arrested without a warrant.

369
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,080
And that security footage you found me in?

370
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,850
(Chief's Office)

371
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,160
Wasn't Constable Oh also caught on camera?

372
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,200
I think the one who fabricated evidence
to frame Chief Nam is...

373
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,470
standing right in front of me.

374
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,440
Hwang Gwang Yeong. Cho Gil Gu.

375
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,450
Oh Ji Hwa. Park Jeong Je.

376
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,520
And Nam Sang Bae.

377
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,320
Do you think those people are...

378
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,660
hiding nothing from you?

379
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,800
I didn't do anything.

380
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,630
After I'm done with it,

381
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,430
I'm going to leave Munju.

382
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,570
I'm going to live somewhere
with clean air and water...

383
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,540
for the rest of my life.

384
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,080
You really lack a creative touch.

385
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,950
If you listed those names and copied me,

386
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,450
did you think I'd be shaken like you were?

387
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,950
No.

388
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,690
I just wish you'd be different
from what I was like three months ago.

389
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,630
Putting blind trust in something you deem as the truth...

390
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,900
and taking off with that idea.

391
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
I thought you wouldn't be like that.

392
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,570
I guess my expectations were a bit too high.

393
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,110
Goodness.

394
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,480
You're dying to shake me around.

395
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,450
I wonder what I'll find by making these moves.

396
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,790
Are you sure it's not that
there are cracks in your trust?

397
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,890
No, I owe you one, Inspector Han.

398
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,360
I was too desperate back then.

399
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,170
Turn myself in?

400
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,330
Why should I do that?

401
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,900
What did I do wrong?

402
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,740
You promised me.

403
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,810
You made that promise.

404
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,580
That's not what you owe me.

405
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,150
That's called justice.

406
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,150
All right, I will have fun
on this playground called...

407
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,720
Inspector Han's justice.

408
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,010
(Seoul RIU Kim Chan Gyeong)

409
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Hello?

410
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,490
Thank you for your hard work
by day and night.

411
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,750
Man, Dong Sik. You nut case.

412
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,020
My dear Detective Kim,
I'll send you an email.

413
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,590
Please find the physical location of the IP address...

414
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,990
as well as a forensic investigation on the attachment.

415
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,330
What's this nonsense?

416
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,430
I might get to considering this
even if you sent an official letter.

417
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,730
Thank you always.

418
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,470
Thank me for what? Hey!

419
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,840
(Compose Email)

420
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,340
(You have sent your email successfully.)

421
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,880
I'm going to go now. Don't follow me.

422
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,920
No.

423
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
Hey!

424
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Stop her.

425
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm not going to follow you.

426
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,130
Don't go.

427
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,530
Yu Yeon, I'm serious.

428
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,470
I swear I'm not going to follow you.

429
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,340
Please stop her.

430
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,570
Stop her.

431
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,010
Stop her, Jeong Je.

432
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,670
Why don't you call your son?

433
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,500
I called him 52 times over the last 3 days.

434
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,410
I'm sure something happened.

435
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,570
Let me say something out of concern.

436
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,580
Senior Inspector Park is...

437
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,010
the section chief of the community safety division.

438
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,280
And he's 41 years old.

439
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,080
I don't think it'd do him any good
to seem like a mama's boy.

440
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,520
Secretary Jang, do you have children?

441
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,650
I'm not interested in getting married.

442
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,820
Then keep your mouth shut.

443
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,790
Goodness, I saw a ray of light
coming from the corridor.

444
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,900
I guess it was because of you, Councilwoman Do.

445
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,230
My goodness, Chief Jung.

446
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,740
It's been so long.

447
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,070
Now that you've become the chief,

448
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,240
you look more handsome than ever.

449
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,010
Is that so?

450
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,050
- Ma'am.
- What?

451
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,920
Oh, goodness. Senior Inspector Park.

452
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,860
Please stop.

453
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,490
(Email information)

454
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,530
(Request: Locate IP address
and restore dashcam footage)

455
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
(Acquired data from evidence analysis)

456

(Dashcam footage partially deleted,
Cannot be restored)

457
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,700
Han Ju Won threatened me?

458
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,610
The IP address is from the café
on the first floor of his apartment.

459
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,880
I didn't check the security camera though.

460
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,150
- Then why don't you check?
- It's definitely Han Ju Won.

461
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,810
But why?

462
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,150
He probably wanted to know...

463
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,850
what it was that you saw...

464
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,520
at the back door of Munju Police Station...

465
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,930
the day Kang Jin Mook died.

466
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,500
What do you mean? What would I have seen?

467
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,810
Based on the analysis of the dashcam footage,

468
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:31,510
it says the second half
of the footage was deleted,

469
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,110
and it can't be restored.

470
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,990
Jae Yi.

471
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,260
Who was it?

472
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,930
Who killed Kang Jin Mook?

473
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,860
That person might not have killed him.

474
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,960
You know what?
Even if that person did kill him,

475
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,830
that jerk killed my mom,
so I'd be grateful.

476
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,670
Then why can't you tell me?

477
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,640
No.

478
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,050
He'd never.

479
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,280
It's absurd.

480
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,150
It's not possible.

481
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,120
Nam Sang Bae?

482
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,020
Did he kill...

483
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,260
Kang Jin Mook?

484
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,580
You look comfortable, sir.

485
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,480
Hey, Inspector Han.

486
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,880
It's time for you to get released,
but Dong Sik isn't here.

487
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,720
He always tends to be late.

488
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,290
It's actually better that you're here.
Thank you.

489
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,960
I came because I got curious.

490
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,290
You put me in here then came to greet me.

491
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,730
Superintendent Han must've taught you well.

492
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,100
"Superintendent Han"?

493
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,100
Oh, right. He's the chief superintendent now.

494
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,670
I was thinking of the past. I'm sorry.

495
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,740
Hey, it's time! Let me out already!

496
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,040
My gosh, you're so impatient.

497
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,610
The superintendent told me to hurry up and let you out.

498
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,250
I guess he still likes you.

499
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,450
What's the section chief doing here?

500
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,760
I couldn't let you leave
without seeing you here.

501
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,130
I guess you easily become close with people
when you're in Manyang.

502
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,230
I'm surprised you came all the way here.

503
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,800
Go ahead and open the lock.
I'll hold that for you.

504
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,570
We'll be saying our last goodbye here,

505
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,410
so why don't we take a photo?

506
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,670
Why is this our last goodbye?

507
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,780
It'll be the last time
we say goodbye in a holding cell.

508
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,710
- Here.
- You nag too much.

509
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,250
1, 2, 3.

510
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,390
Goodness, I can't believe you posed in there.

511
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,190
Let me out already.

512
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,660
You used to be a troublemaker back in Munju too.

513
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,430
Whose bad side did you get on?

514
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,770
Open up.

515
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,370
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,340
Get out of there already.

517
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,540
- Thank you, Oh Seob.
- Go on.

518
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,110
I hope we never meet here again.

519
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,410
Okay, I get it. My gosh.

520
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,020
Here you go.

521
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,720
I'm grateful that you came all the way here.

522
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,390
Would you like to eat with me?

523
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,290
No, I'm busy.

524
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,900
I thought you came to talk to me.

525
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,300
My business here is done.
I'll be off now.

526
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,030
Okay, go on.

527
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,340
(Dong Sik)

528
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,000
Thank you. Goodbye.

530

531
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,470
(Police Agency)

532
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,880
Inspector Han?

533
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,780
Gosh, it must be some day today.

534
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,920
Fancy meeting you here.
Officer Cho too.

535
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,290
Tell me about it.

536
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,290
What brings you by the main office, then?

537
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,660
I'm here to see a friend.

538
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,530
One works at the Office of the Spokesperson here.

539
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,630
Same here. I came to meet a friend.

540
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,170
You have a friend here at the main office...

541
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,710
when you spent your entire career at substations?

542
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,440
Of course, I have a friend here!

543
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,880
You have a funny way...

544
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,950
of looking down on people, you know.

545
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,150
When did I ever do that?
Gosh, there's no need to get upset.

546
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,120
You must be here to see your father.

547
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,760
Could you perhaps introduce him to us?

548
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,190
What?

549
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,460
The doors are closing.

550
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,400
Ju Won.

551
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,340
I'll get going, then.

552
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,470
Han Ju Won.

553
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,110
Are you his colleagues on the force?

554
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,780
- Yes, sir.
- I heard a lot about you.

555
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,920
I'm Han Gi Hwan, Ju Won's father.

556
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,790
It's an honour to meet you,
Chief Superintendent Han.

557
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,560
I'm Inspector Hwang Gwang Yeong.

558
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,300
It's a pleasure.

559
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,800
- I'm Officer Cho Gil Gu.
- I see.

560
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,370
Could you spare some time?

561
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,370
- I can't right now...
- It won't take long.

562
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,280
Can you keep it short?

563
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,350
- I really am quite busy.
- With what?

564
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,650
Poking around a case that's over?

565
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,220
- I'll get going, then.
- That's enough.

566
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Please, Ju Won. It's what I wish.

567
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,830
It's what your dad wishes.

568
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,340
Your wish?

569
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,410
I understand since everyone on the job...

570
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,740
gets caught up in a case
that they feel destined to solve.

571
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,980
You can't end it though or move on from it.

572
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,050
I get that, Ju Won.

573
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,990
It's true...

574
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,360
that I've been a strict father.

575
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,060
It's just that always see you
as a young kid who needs help.

576
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,330
- I'm sorry...
- Don't.

577
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,160
- Ju Won.
- I've lived as your son...

578
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,560
for 28 years.

579
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,630
But throughout those 28 years,

580
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
the time I've actually been able to see your face...

581
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,970
only adds up to about a year.

582
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,310
You sent me to England at eight...

583
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,740
and never came to visit.

584
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,680
So what gives you the right
to act like a father?

585
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:34,890
Get out.

586
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,890
Don't you ever do it again.

587
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,860
I'm...

588
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,160
not like the woman who fell for your lies...

589
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,730
and had your child just to die in the end.

590
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,540
I'm different.

591
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,580
Darn brat.

592
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,330
(Location)

593
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,020
It must be your son.

594
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,290
This is why one shouldn't have kids.

595
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,360
What did you just say?

596
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,020
What? Oh, it's nothing.

597
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,200
Do you still carry two phones these days?

598
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,570
I receive a lot of calls from local residents.

599
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,740
You should get that.

600
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,640
Don't be ridiculous.

601
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,310
It's been a while
since we got together for dinner.

602
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,210
But I'm the only one eating.

603
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,380
What is it? Go ahead and tell me.

604
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,920
Gosh, there's no agenda.

605
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,720
All I wanted was to have dinner with you.

606
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,260
The yellowtail would laugh at that.

607
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,030
You asked me to meet you tonight...

608
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,270
and ordered a plate of this fatty yellowtail.

609
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,410
Just tell me what this is about.

610
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,080
Mr. Lee,

611
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,580
could I obtain an antidepressant
without a prescription?

612
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,020
- Something strong?
- No, that would be too addictive.

613
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,720
Hasn't it gotten worse...

614
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,190
than him just hearing a woman's voice?

615
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,620
He'll need something stronger then.

616
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:55,160
Gosh, I never said it was for my son.

617
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,560
My gosh.
For someone who's been a councilwoman for years,

618
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,730
your acting is truly embarrassing.

619
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,700
How long have I known your son?

620
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,910
For about 21 years.

621
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,610
Has it been that long?

622
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,710
I hear that Lee Yu Yeon was found.

623
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,680
In the basement wall of her own home.

624
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,850
- So it seems.
- I wonder how that happened.

625
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,660
Well, the psychopath must've killed her...

626
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,560
and stashed her in there.

627
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,070
Why? Does that worry you?

628
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,300
In what way, I wonder.

629
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,180
The development, my land, and my money.

630
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,410
Also, the possibility
of becoming the Mayor of Munju...

631
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,480
as well as your son.

632
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,580
I said it wasn't for my son!

633
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,480
Fine.

634
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,490
Tuck your worries away and trust me.

635
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,520
I've put everything I have into this city...

636
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,390
which means I'll fight with my life.

637
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,360
I'll get you the antidepressant,

638
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,930
so get your precious son...

639
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,770
away from that nut case Lee Dong Sik.

640
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,700
If our work gets scrapped
because he pokes around,

641
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,510
I'll see to it...

642
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,380
that we all burn.

643
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,240
Darn.

644
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,790
Just take the darn call, will you?

645
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,360
Gosh.

00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,380
Ji Hwa, Dong Sik lost it and took off.

650
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,750
Exactly. What is the report saying?

651
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,220
The collar bone hasn't been broken.

652
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,360
Kang Jin Mook kills his victims by strangling them.

653
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,190
So the collar bone should have been broken.

654
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,210
Dong Sik. About Yu Yeon...

655
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,040
I didn't kill Yu Yeon.

656
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,080
I'm serious.

657
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,920
I told you I didn't kill her.

658
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,890
Wait. You can't just barge in here.

659
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,860
(Lee Dong Sik)

660
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,200
Where's Lee Yu Yeon's body?
My sister...

661
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm her family.

662
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,440
In unit number two.

663
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,400
The scapula, the fibula,

664
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,230
the ilium, the ribs, and the lumbar.

665
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,370
Multiple fractures were detected.

666
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,140
You see this in bodies that fell from high ground.

667
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,410
More often in car accidents.

668
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,570
Multiple fractures of this severity...

669
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,080
mean that some nut job...

670
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,410
ran her over again and again
to make sure she never survives.

671
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,690
What on earth happened to Lee Yu Yeon back in 2000?

672
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,060
(Chief Nam Sang Bae)

673
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,540
(Chief Nam Sang Bae)

674
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:50,810
Hey.

675
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,880
Mr. Nam. So...

676
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,350
Where are you right now?

677
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,630
There's so much I want to ask you.

678
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,800
But I just...

679
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,470
I mean...

680
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,670
What did you do back then?

681
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,310
What?

682
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,280
And what happened to Yu Yeon?

683
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,390
What are you hiding, for goodness' sake?

684
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,130
Were you really the one...

685
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,100
to murder Kang Jin Mook?

686
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,480
(Dong Sik)

687
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,320
(Dong Sik)

688
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,200
The person you have reached is not available.
Please leave a message...

689
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:47,520
I feel lonely to leave without you.

690
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:52,760
I feel so lonely.

691
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,670
Don't cry.

692
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,300
Don't cry tonight

693
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,790
I'll track the chief's phone.

694
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,260
Are you sure about this?

695
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,300
I'm sure. I heard it.

696
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:32,830
All right.

697
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,250
(Han Ju Won)

698
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,190
Yes?

699
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,890
Mr. Lee.

700
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,630
Something has happened to Chief Nam Sang Bae.

701
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,030
I saw it.

702
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,200
No, I didn't see it, but I heard it.

703
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,370
There was a recording device on the ground,

704
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,300
and I found a pool of blood.

705
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,010
I think Chief Nam was beaten,
and then kidnapped.

706
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,480
He was taken in a Gray SUV.

707
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,580
What did you say? Kidnapped?

708
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,080
I think the license plate had an "H" in it.

709
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,720
but I couldn't see the numbers.

710
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,950
I'm in pursuit now.

711
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,520
- Where are you now?
- Local Highway 77.

712
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,360
Which direction?

713
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,600
I'm continuing
straight in the direction of Tongmoon.

714
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,670
Tongmoon is downstream of the Han River.

715
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,300
And...

716
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,200
The sea is nearby.

717
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,410
The sea could be their destination.

718
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,980
I put a tracking device on the Chief.

719
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,250
I'm following the signal.

720
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,980
I'll make I don't lose them.

721
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,420
I'll make sure I don't lose them.

722
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,620
I'll catch this guy no matter what.

723
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,290
I'll stop him no matter what.

724
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,160
I'm going to rescue Chief Nam,

725
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,690
and catch the culprit,
no matter who it is.

726
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,400
I'm going to catch this jerk.

727
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,870
No matter what.

728
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,910
I will catch him, for sure.

729
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,540
I'm on my way.

730
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,450
I'll hurry.

731
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,750
Be careful until I arrive.

732
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,760
Inspector Han, do you hear me?

733
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,790
Respond.

734
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,960
You need to be careful.

735
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,000
All right. I'll be waiting.

736
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,710
Nam Sang Bae, 60 years old,
Chief of Manyang Substation,

737
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,080
currently suspected to be kidnapped.

738
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,480
The kidnapper's vehicle is a silver SUV
with plates containing "H".

739
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:01,120
In pursuit on Local Highway 77,
heading towards Tongmoon.

740
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,350
Requesting backup.

741
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,290
And...

742
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,290
please track a cell phone for me.

743
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,190
010-0421-1001.

744
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,630
The phone's owner is Han Ju Won,

745
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,030
of the Manyang Police Substation.

746
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,300
My partner.

748
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,090
(Speed)

749
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,600
Shoot.

750
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,090
(Lee Dong Sik)

751
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,960
Where are you?

752
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,600
I'm about 500m in from the sign for Sammihang.

753
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,140
The signal just stopped.

754
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,370
I'm about 100m away from them in my car.

755
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,710
They're on the move again.

756
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,920
They're moving slowly, probably on foot.

757
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,850
But it's so dark I can't see.

758
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,690
Since the tracking device is not that accurate,

759
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,890
I need to get out and find him on foot.

760
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,320
You're going to go alone?

761
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,600
I'll be careful. Don't worry.
Just come here quick.

762
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,940
No... No.

763
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,640
What? What is it?

764
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,840
Darn it.

765
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,840
(911 Rescue Team)

766
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,710
(911 Rescue Team)

767
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,480
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

768
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,320
I'm so...

769
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,030
He's... He's dead.

770
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,490
Chief.

771
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,500
Wake up, Chief.

772
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:49,110
- Wake up. Wake up!
- You can't do this here.

773
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,710
- Chief!
- Stop.

774
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,350
Wake up!

775
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,650
Chief!

776
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:05,190
Mr. Nam! Mr. Nam...

777
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:12,170
I feel lonely to leave without you.

778
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:17,940
I feel so lonely.

779
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,710
Don't cry.

780
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,450
Don't cry tonight.

781

=Beyond Evil=

782
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,510
Do you feel guilty that you're alive?

783
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,380
You're wrong.
Life in itself is misery.

784
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,680
The fact that I'm breathing and still alive...

785
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,890
feels like a nightmare.

786
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,160
Who are the two unsuspected people?

787
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,160
The report from 21 years ago.

788
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,700
The report is the only thing
that's missing?

789
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,240
I will kill too.

790
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,000
You know, don't you?

791
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,610
You know who killed her.
