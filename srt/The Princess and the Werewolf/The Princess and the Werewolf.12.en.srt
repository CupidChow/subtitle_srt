Zimei has been in Daxia Palace all the time.

He's been in Daxia Palace all the time?

Yeah.

When you were missing last time,

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,910
someone attacked Zimei

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,630
and he even lost his badge.

He lost his badge?

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,830
Your Grace,

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,080
you can call me Li Xiong here.

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,470
You're just in time.

33
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,000
I was wondering who could
contact Ma Yingxiong for me.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,240
I can't contact General Ma now.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,830
You know, he's straightforward

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,910
and not discreet.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,550
I'm worried that he may expose my identity

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,440
and make Kui Mulang suspect me.

39
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,000
Your Grace, I also advise you

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
not to mention my name to him

41
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,440

you said you would take someone back.

So, it's Zimei.

47
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,910
But did you get the wrong person?

48
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,720
No wonder he didn't want to see Ma Yingxiong

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,440

Every time I did something,

92

Kui Mulang could deal with it.

93
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,880
And every time I planned to escape,

104
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,390
I trusted you!

Really strange.

191
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,710
I've never seen this pulse before.

192
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,110
Never.

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,150
How's the baby?

194
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,470
Sorry, but I can't feel

195
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,030
whether the baby is all right.

196
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
Quite different, right?

197
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,470
Looks like I can't keep it anymore.

198
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,710
Actually, I was lucky enough

199
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,200
to have had a dream of beast ancestors.

200
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,880
They said the baby I was carrying

201
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,590
was the once-in-a-century royal heir.

202
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,280
In case I give away this secret,

203
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't dare to have a doctor feel my pulse.

204
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,230
Now that you knew it,

205
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,150
I had to tell you the truth.

206
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,350
Is that so?

207
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,640
Yes.

208
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,960
Oh, I see.

209
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,910
I was too ignorant to know that.

210
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,110
Your Grace, the baby you're carrying

211
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,470
is the future King.

212
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,760
The wedding can't be delayed anymore.

213
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,760
El... Elder,

214
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,230
there's no need to rush.

215
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,080
There is.

216
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,840
You're pregnant,

217
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,230
but you haven't married His Majesty yet.

218
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,110
If people know it, that'd be embarrassing.

219
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,790
But Elder, I...

220
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,960
That's settled, then.

221
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,320
I will not

222
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,790
let this baby suffer.

223
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,550
He will grow up

224
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,880
in love and care.

225
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,470
Give the order.

226
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,670
The wedding will be held in three days.

227
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,640
Three days, exactly.

228
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,030
Aye.

229
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,880
If the wedding goes smoothly,

230
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,840
your family can be mitigated, too.

231
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,960
All right.

232
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,670
As you please, Elder Qi.

233
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,880
So, Ma Yingxiong and his men...

234
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,520
Can they be released in advance?

235
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,590
They can't be released

236
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,760
until they're vindicated.

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,840
Don't worry.

238
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
We just need to find Chun'er.

239
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,960
Ma Yingxiong purposely poisoned His Majesty

240
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,350
and he has to be punished.

241
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,790
Elders decide

242
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,030
that working in the city will be his punishment.

243
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,670
After he's released,

244
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
he'll have to plant 100 trees.

245
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,000
Your Grace, your chamber

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,200
should be heavily guarded, too.

247
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,030
Actually, I don't need

248
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,320
to stay in the chamber all day long.

249
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
I should often take a walk

250
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,320
and have more fresh air.

251
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,080
He's the once-in-a-century royal heir, after all.

252
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,790
He needs to absorb something from nature.

253
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,790
In this case, you don't need to be guarded.

254
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,550
But you mustn't behave as wildly as before.

255
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
Sure, sure.

256
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,000
How many more lies to tell

257
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,280
and how much more to suffer?

258
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,230
Let's ask people separately.

259
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,280
- Aye.
- Aye.

260
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,200
Aye.

261
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,910
No.

262
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,440
Madam,

263
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,320
did you see a lady in green?

264
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,470
Like this tall.

265
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,550
Did you see a lady in green?

266
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,030
Have you ever seen a lady in green?

267
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,880
She's fair-skinned.

268
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,350
No, no.

269
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
Chun'er is nowhere to be found.

270
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,840
Can she be...

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,640
His Majesty ordered us to search hard.

272
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,230
We have to find her, however long it takes.

273
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,760
Madam,

274
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,440
may I ask you something?

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,030
What madam?

276
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,200
Call her Miss.

277
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,400
Miss,

278
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
did you see the lady in this portrait?

279
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes.

280
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,960
- Yes?
- You did?

281
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,200
Of course.

282
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,910
Some days ago, she nearly

283
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,470
pissed me off.

284
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,400
Stealing away my business, huh?

285
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,440
We're doing business fairly.

286
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,710
Miss,

287
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,710
I keep the good sachets at home.

288
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,320
Would you like to go home with me?

289
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,470
Do you remember what that woman looks like?

290
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,880
She wore a curtained hat

291
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,590
as if she was too ashamed to be seen.

292
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,000
She looked wicked.

293
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,590
Do you know where she was heading?

294
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,280
That way.

295
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,910
Haonan, Dayu!

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Go check that lane with me.

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,520
Aye.

298
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,200
Go.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,230
Let's check from door to door.

300
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,280
- Aye.
- Aye.

301
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,110
Here.

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,520
Go.

303
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,110
Haonan, you go ahead.

304
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,080
Yes.

305
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,550
Did you see a woman?

306
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,910
Like this tall.

307
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,470
No.

308
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Commander Bai,

309
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,350
Chun'er is here.

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,840
Chun'er.

311
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,200
She's alive.

312
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,590
Take her back first.

313
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,200
Yes.

314
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,550
Commander Bai,

315
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,960
the residual poison is gone.

316
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,670
After a few days' regular diets,

317
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,960
she'll recover.

318
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,470
We found Chun'er,

319
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,400
so she would live.

320
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,280
Doctor,

321
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,030
are you sure

322
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,350
she didn't have other wounds?

323
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,350
Some internal wounds from a recent fight,

324
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,400
for example.

325
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,320
No.

326
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,440
She was poisoned with the Debilitating Powder

327
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,400
and she's weak for having nothing to eat for days.

328
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,200
Thank you, doctor.

329
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,190
Chun'er.

330
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,710
Chun'er, you're awake.

331
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,680
Deputy Commander Hu Die.

332
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,710
Commander Bai.

333
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,590
Water for her.

334
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
Here. Have some water.

335
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,190
Slow, slow.

336
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,190
I'm hungry.

337
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,230
Here.

338
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,040
Have something to eat.

339
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,230
Slowly. Don't get choked.

340
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,430
Take some rest for recuperation these days.

341
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,310
Don't think about anything.

342
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,070
Doctor confirmed Chun'er had no internal wound.

343
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,160
It indicates

344
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,880
that she wasn't the one who fought His Majesty.

345
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,560
That day, His Majesty did a powerful attack.

346
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
The one who fought him

347
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
would definitely be wounded.

348
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,160
If you were also this calm and careful

349
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,920
when you talked to Her Grace,

350
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
that would be great.

351
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,590
Why did you bring her up?

352
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,070
Because I cared about you.

353
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,920
Look.

354
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,230
His Majesty is marrying Her Grace soon.

355
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,430
As a minister,

356
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,160
you mustn't mess with her.

357
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,470
Who messes with her?

358
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
She isn't good enough for His Majesty.

359
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,110
Come on, don't push it.

360
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,400
It's your fault.

361
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,160
You were being insensitive.

362
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,760
Fine, fine.

363
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,310
I'll say no more, then.

364
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,800
No more.

365
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,950
I heard you found Chun'er.

366
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,190
What have you got?

367
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,470
Now, we've confirmed

368
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,870
that Chun'er didn't fight His Majesty.

369
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,840
She's very weak now

370
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,750
and will be further interrogated later.

371
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,200
Now, we can't rule out

372
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,350
whether she's a confederate.

373
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,600
Please have your men guard over her.

374
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,990
I'll go report to His Majesty.

375
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,040
Let's go.

376
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,080
That's basically the case.

377
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,270
Your Majesty, when will we interrogate Chun'er?

378
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,920
Let her rest for today.

379
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,350
Tomorrow, make Ma Yingxiong confront her.

380
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,080
Aye.

381
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,320
It's...

382
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,800
Your Majesty, are you going to see Her Grace?

383
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,270
Yes.

384
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,320
She's very concerned.

385
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm going to tell her what happened.

386
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,040
Hope this roast chicken

387
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,230
will make Her Grace understand you.

388
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,440
I should go.

389
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,470
Come on, Your Grace.

390
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,350
He's such a great king

391
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,110
that you can't get a second one.

392
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,150
Your Grace, what's wrong?

393
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,800
You look quite spiritless.

394
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
If someone you trusted deceived you,

395
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,560
you would feel the same.

396
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,270
Deceived?

397
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
Who dared to deceive you, Your Grace?

398
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,800
Go tell His Majesty

399
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,350
and he will punish that man.

400
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,230
Without your king,

401
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,920
this might not even happen.

402
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,510
Oh, no, Your Grace.

403
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,230
Elder Qi asked me

404
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,720
to prepare some decoction
for miscarriage prevention.

405
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,990
I nearly forgot that.

406
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,270
I'm on it right now.

407
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,080
Come on, what did I do wrong?

408
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,390
Roast chicken?

409
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,870
Check what this is.

410
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,920
Roast chicken?

411
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,960
But people here don't eat meat.

412
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,990
How did you get it?

413
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,230
I especially bribed someone

414
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,680
and got it for you, Your Grace.

415
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,230
This great thing should be shared.

416
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,390
So... Sorry.

417
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,150
Who's there?

418
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,080
Li Xiong?

419
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,680
Did Kui Mulang send you?

420
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,750
You're no longer my guard.

421
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,440
You don't need to do this.

422
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,230
Kui Mulang didn't send me.

423
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,200
I wanted to come.

424
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,510
And I'm here to tell you

425
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
that Chun'er is found.

426
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,470
Where is she?

427
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,750
I'm going to see her now.

428
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,920
Be patient.

429
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,870
Chun'er is very weak now.

430
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,600
Kui Mulang said,

431
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,390
tomorrow,

432
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,600
when she recovered a little,

433
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,960
she would confront Ma Yingxiong

434
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
and be interrogated together.

435
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
So,

436
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,080
the missing maid isn't dead.

437
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,720
I heard she would be interrogated tomorrow.

438
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,750
Kui Mulang is having me spied on.

439
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,840
We can't try to kill that maid again.

440
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,080
And that man...

441
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,680
We can't contact him anymore.

442
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,270
Let's bide our time.

443
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,990
And, don't contact Xiniang for the moment

444
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,270
in case you're exposed.

445
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,080
Thank you for your concern, Your Royal Highness.

446
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm not concerned,

447
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,680
but reminding you.

448
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,040
If you're exposed,

449
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,440
I'll be caught, too.

450
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,840
Yes.

451
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,390
I understand.

452
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,560
Any more dishes? Get them to me.

453
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,230
Your Grace,

454
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,200
why did you eat so many vegetables today?

455
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,040
No more meat will be available.

456
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,110
I must get used to that.

457
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,110
I know you're sad,

458
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,320
but you can't eat that much at one time.

459
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,440
It's bad for your health.

460
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,200
Who says I'm sad?

461
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,800
You're not?

462
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,080
I...

463
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,680
You love to eat meat.

464
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,040
When you force yourself not to eat any,

465
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,270
you'll certainly feel unaccustomed.

466
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,510
I just don't want to feel like that.

467
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,440
It takes only three days to get rid of a habit.,

468
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
And every habit can be kicked.

469
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,720
Miss Chun'er?

470
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,470
Miss Chun'er,

471
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,270
what a surprise to meet you here!

472
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,040
What do you want? Don't come over.

473
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,920
You... You can't recognize me?

474
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,350
I'm Yingxiong.

475
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,390
Oh, come on.

476
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,510
We're not that close.

477
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,270
Why not?

478
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,470
You delivered food to me.

479
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,110
At the door, you were tripped

480
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,200
and you fell into my arms.

481
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,720
I even smelt your hair.

482
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,800
You... Shut up!

483
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,350
You're a general

484
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
and how could you talk nonsense

485
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,870
to defame me?

486
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,320
But...

487
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,390
Her Grace told me

488
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,990
you were poisoned by some bad guy.

489
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,560
So, it wasn't you

490
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,150
who delivered food to me.

491
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
It wasn't me, of course.

492
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,990
The woman who sold sachets

493
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,390
tricked me into that lane.

494
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,150
Come on. Get in, please.

495
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,870
This is where you live?

496
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,270
Yes.

497
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,870
Come on, Miss. Smell it.

498
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,470
Is this the balm you want?

499
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,870
The Debilitating Powder works so perfectly.

500
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,870
With this,

501
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,320
you'll sleep for a few days.

502
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,040
Then...

503
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,080
You praised me for being loyal

504
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,350
and handsome...

505
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,150
It wasn't you, huh?

506
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,630
How... How would I say something like that?

507
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,800
Then your feelings for me...

508
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,110
I have no feelings for you.

509
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,990
I'm an innocent single girl.

510
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,840
Stop saying that!

511
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,440
Miss Chun'er,

512
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
I was tricked by a wicked woman

513
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,510
and I betrayed you!

514
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,720
Miss Chun'er,

515
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,390
that wicked woman fooled me.

516
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,040
How awful!

517
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,990
Your Majesty,

518
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,750
Chun'er and Ma Yingxiong seem to be innocent.

519
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,870
Summon the three Elders

520
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,990
for a discussion in the hall.

521
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,080
And...

522
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Summon Princess Qi Pa, too.

523
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,200
Aye.

524
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,080
[Boyue Hall]

525
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,270
Bring them up.

526
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,510
Aye.

527
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,440
Elders,

528
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,320
according to Ma Yingxiong,

529
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,230
this maid gave him the Debilitating Powder.

530
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,750
But the maid who fought me

531
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,200
in the forest

532
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,510
was wounded by me.

533
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,630
And this maid

534
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,600
has no wounds.

535
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,800
When Ma Yingxiong confronted her,

536
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,560
they gave totally different testimonies.

537
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,230
So, I guess

538
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,800
someone impersonated Chun'er

539
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,630
to seduce Ma Yingxiong

540
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,720
so that Princess Qi Pa and I would be hurt.

541
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,200
Is that so?

542
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,270
But you give no evidence of that, Your Majesty.

543
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,630
Elders, have you heard

544
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,200
about Stewardess Qing, a palace maid

545
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,350
who is good at impersonation?

546
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,440
She even impersonated Princess Qi Pa.

547
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,630
I guess it was her again.

548
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,510
We've heard about Stewardess Qing.

549
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,320
But she died, didn't she?

550
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,150
In the fire, the body was burned

551
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,320
beyond recognition.

552
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,870
Now, I realize

553
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,320
it was the escape plan of Stewardess Qing.

554
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,870
She's good at impersonation,

555
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,630
but she doesn't dare to assassinate me,

556
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,920
by disguising as someone close to me.

557
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,040
In case I recognize her, I guess.

558
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,800
So, she could only do such dirty tricks.

559
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,870
It's wise of you, Your Majesty.

560
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,920
Then Your Majesty,

561
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,750
who do you think is behind Stewardess Qing?

562
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,920
Elders,

563
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,960
do you remember the revolt five years ago?

564
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Your Majesty, you think this female assassin

565
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,720
has something to do with that?

566
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,040
Exactly.

567
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,510
We get it.

568
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,200
What happened five years ago

569
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,150
has nothing to do with Her Grace's men.

570
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Ma Yingxiong is a mere general,

571
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,630
but he's very loyal to Her Grace.

572
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,840
I think he must have been a tool.

573
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,350
Then this case...

574
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,750
It must be someone else

575
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,560
who hurt His Majesty

576
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,510
and assassinated Her Grace.

577
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,560
I'm declaring

578
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,870
Her Grace's men are innocent.

579
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,110
As for Chun'er...

580
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,270
Whether she colluded with the assassin from inside

581
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,630
hasn't been verified.

582
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,470
Somebody.

583
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,270
Take Chun'er away, watch for her,

584
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,470
and interrogate her seriously.

585
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,510
- Aye.
- Elders,

586
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,150
I'm innocent!

587
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,270
I... I really didn't do that.

588
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,510
How could I ever do that?

589
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,230
I...

590
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,800
Elders,

591
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,230
Your Majesty,

592
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,390
Chun'er has a naturally kind heart.

593
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,390
I can assure you with my life

594
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,560
that she wouldn't do that thing.

595
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,510
Chun'er is a wonderful girl.

596
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,840
Enlightened by Her Grace,

597
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,920
I thought about it carefully.

598
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,470
Chun'er would never do anything

599
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,840
to seduce me.

600
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,870
And now, she flatly denies it.

601
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,320
The result of the investigation
proves something, too.

602
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,800
So, I'm very sure

603
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,990
that I was being silly!

604
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,440
It's all my fault!

605
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,870
Kill me as you wish!

606
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,990
But please don't get Chun'er involved!

607
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,150
Ma Yingxiong, calm down.

608
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,350
Who would kill you?

609
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,990
Your Grace,

610
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,150
you're pregnant.

611
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,990
You should calm down.

612
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,200
Rest assured, Elder.

613
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,470
The baby is safe with me.

614
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,320
Your Majesty,

615
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,150
I think Chun'er is just a victim.

616
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,040
Think about it.

617
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,150
If Chun'er was the traitor,

618
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,110
why did she come back here

619
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,440
instead of running away?

620
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,630
After the investigations,

621
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,600
she's now the one to watch for.

622
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,150
How can she still be the mole?

623
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,270
Madam Xiong.

624
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,350
The baby needs some rest.

625
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,720
Her Grace must be tired, too.

626
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,440
Take Her Grace back to her chamber.

627
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,920
Who are you? What are you doing?

628
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,320
I'm not finished yet.

629
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,920
Wait.

630
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,110
Elders,

631
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,800
she's one of the most important victims.

632
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,200
Let her share her concerns.

633
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,600
Your Grace,

634
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,800
thank you for defending me.

635
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,870
Come on, girl,

636
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,470
I'm not the only one who helps you.

637
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,320
Your Majesty,

638
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,950
Chun'er did something wrong.

639
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,670
She shouldn't have trusted someone that easily.

640
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,040
So, she was fooled.

641
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,710
But a victim like her isn't guilty.

642
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,670
Our top priority is

643
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,470
to catch the real mole.

644
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,880
We can't accuse an innocent girl.

645
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,470
Your Majesty and Elders,

646
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,800
I've investigated quite a lot of cases.

647
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,640
As far as I see,

648
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,190
Chun'er must have been a tool.

649
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,800
Cuties,

650
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,840
this is unbelievable.

651
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,080
Are you speaking for me?

652
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm not.

653
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,040
I just made my own point.

654
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,040
I quite agree.

655
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,160
Elders, what do you think?

656
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,230
How about this, Your Majesty?

657
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,430
Chun'er must be punished.

658
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,160
No interrogation, though.

659
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,910
Planting 100 trees behind the hill

660
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,400
just like Ma Yingxiong

661
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,600
will be her punishment.

662
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,160
Thank you, Elders. Thank you, Your Majesty.

663
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,080
Thank you, Elders.

664
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,230
Thank you, Your Grace.

665
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,080
Thank you, Deputy Commander.

666
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,800
And...

667
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,160
Bai Ke and Hu Die,

668
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,840
I'll leave the rest to you.

669
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,160
You must figure out who's behind this.

670
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

671
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,470
Elders,

672
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,670
let's call it a day.

673
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,640
Madam Xiong,

674
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,320
walk Her Grace back to her chamber

675
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,990
and let her rest.

676
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,040
Also, inform everyone in the Palace

677
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,510
to prepare the best for His Majesty's wedding.

678
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,470
Without fail!

679
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,430
Yes.

680
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,910
No way. Objection!

681
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,470
You...

682
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,710
Objection!

683
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,670
This is the palace business

684
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,270
and you have no right to object.

685
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,430
Overruled.

686
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,880
Get back to business, everyone.

687
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,430
But...

688
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,710
Thank you, Deputy Commander.

689
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,270
Thank you, Deputy Commander.

690
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,800
What is it?

691
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,750
Invitation.

692
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
[Kui Mulang's Wedding Invitation]

693
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,430
To His Majesty's wedding?

694
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,950
Your Royal Highness,

695
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,320
during today's interrogation,

696
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,840
His Majesty suspected that man.

697
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,230
Only suspicion, though.

698
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,950
Well, that's good.

699
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,080
And,

700
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,710
His Majesty is having
his wedding invitations handed out.

701
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,430
Everyone has it, as I'm told.

702
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,430
That man meditated a big plan,

703
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,190
but instead of being hurt,

704
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,320
Kui Mulang is even getting married.

705
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,080
Exactly.

706
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,840
Now, the Palace is blowing up.

707
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,160
Qi Pa, Qi Pa!

708
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,080
What makes this woman special?

709
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,600
Sometimes, love is just like the wind.

710
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,080
It blows so...

711
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,640
Shut up.

712
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,750
Kui Mulang hasn't got

713
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,160
any hard evidence.

714
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,470
Go contact Xiniang

715
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,430
and tell her I want to see that man.

716
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,600
I can't just wait like this.

717
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,230
I have to do something.

718
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,160
Aye.

719
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,160
Your Royal Highness,

720
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,800
the wedding will be held

721
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,040
and will you go?

722
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,840
Yes.

723
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,400
Why would I not?

724
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,470
I'd like to witness

725
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,120
my brother's grand wedding.

726
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Put it here.

727
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,600
All right.

728
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,910
Come on.

729
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,360
Water it.

730
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,670
All right. Here it goes.

731
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,190
And here.

732
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,840
Miss Chun'er, there you are.

733
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,160
General Ma,

734
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,040
thank you for defending me that hard.

735
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,880
Before...

736
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,470
Before, I misunderstood you.

737
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,950
I'm so...

738
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,800
Please forgive me, General.

739
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,910
Don't say that.

740
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,670
I did something wrong, indeed.

741
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,750
And I truly wanted to defend you.

742
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,400
I'll do this hard work for you.

743
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,990
You just sit aside and rest.

744
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,670
I can't do that. I...

745
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,120
Why can't you?

746
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,270
How about this?

747
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,560
If you feel sorry,

748
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,510
make me something to eat.

749
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,270
Something to eat?

750
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm very good at that.

751
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,560
General,

752
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,120
if you have some favorite dishes,

753
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,160
don't hesitate to tell me.

754
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,710
Let me go get you some water.

755
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,840
Sorry.

756
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,840
General,

757
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,710
you haven't told me

758
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,510
what food you love most.

759
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,880
I grew up in the army

760
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,710
and I've lived a rough life.

761
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,670
I just like steamed buns with pickles.

762
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,190
Then wait, General.

763
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm going back to the Imperial Kitchen
and make some for you.

764
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,320
Your Royal Highness.

765
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,880
My invitation is here?

766
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
[Invitation]

767
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,880
No.

768
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,880
It's for me.

769
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,750
What?

770
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,750
Even you're invited,

771
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,950
but I'm not?

772
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,800
Darn it, Kui Mulang!

773
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,880
You've pushed me too far!
