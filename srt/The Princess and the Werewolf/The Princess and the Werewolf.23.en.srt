00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,240
[Episode 23]

18
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,830
My Lord.

19
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,480
I saw Eunuch Ruo on the street just now.

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,160
He was being watched.

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,440
Although that person was disguised,

22
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,950
judging from his strength in walking,

23
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,400
he must have extraordinary skills.

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,080
I guess he's from the palace.

25
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,080
What this jerk Jing Muhan did

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,190
behind our backs

27
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,190
must have aroused the attention and suspicion
of Kui Mulang.

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,520
That's why he sent people to watch them

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,750
just out of fear of alerting them.

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,800
Xiniang.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
If Eunuch Ruo appears again,

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,630
keep an eye on him at all times.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,750
Don't let Kui Mulang's men

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,960
notice you.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,190
It's okay for him to fool around.

36
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,720
But we have to keep our noses clean.

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,910
Don't worry, My Lord.

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,190
I will never allow anyone

39
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,550
to spoil my plans.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,270
Here, Your Highness.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,910
Your Highness.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,190
The imperial doctor said that

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,720
as long as you take the medicine on time,

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,360
your eyesight will definitely recover.

45
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,830
Really? How long will it take?

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,030
Your Highness, Liu Jun is asking to see you.

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,470
Your Highness.

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,630
His Majesty asked me to take you
to his chamber.

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,880
For what?

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,910
I am not going.

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Hongxiu.

52
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,240
Your Highness, here I am.

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,630
Mr. Liu Jun.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,270
May I go with Her Highness?

55
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
His Majesty asked her

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,160
to go alone.

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,750
Your Highness.

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,880
Please.

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,550
Be careful.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,190
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,880
I have removed all guards.

62
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,030
In recent days,

63
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,640
I will personally guard your chamber.

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Okay.

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,920
I'll take my leave.

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,270
Kui Mulang.

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
It's me.

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,880
From today on,

69
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,830
stay in my chamber.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,640
I will take care of you myself.

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,160
Why?

72
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,510
I have Hongxiu with me.

73
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,070
You don't need to worry about me.

74
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,920
I don't trust anyone else

75
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,440
to take care of you.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,160
But it's inconvenient

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,000
for you to do this.

78
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,200
I will never cross the line.

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,110
If you have any need,

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,070
just let me know.

81
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,110
I will do it for you.

82
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,950
You don't have to do this.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,950
How is Mr. Li?

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
I sent him to heal.

85
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,320
Don't worry.

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,230
He only suffered skin trauma.

87
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,110
As long as you are well,

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,720
he will be fine.

89
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,880
He...

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Really?

91
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,830
Yes.

92
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,390
When your eyes recovered,

93
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,800
you will see him.

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,110
Come.

95
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,480
I'll take you to sit down.

96
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,870
No need.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,590
Wait for me.

98
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,830
Give me your hand.

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,830
Hold this rope.

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll lead you.

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,710
Okay?

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,360
Okay.

103
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,080

What's going on out there?

120
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,200
His Majesty brought Her Highness
into the chamber

121
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,270
and stayed with her day and night.

122
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,550
Liu Jun just asked the imperial guards

123
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,870
to strengthen the guard in the palace.

124
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,110
That's all.

125
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,480
Did no one interrogate you

126
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,480
when you left the palace today?

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,360
No.

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,710
It's the same as usual.

129
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,990
Good.

130
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,760
It seems that they haven't suspected me yet.

131
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,550
I'll stay home for a few more days.

132
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,480
And I will leave the palace

133
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,390
after they completely dispel their doubts.

134
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,480
Yes.

135
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,640
I just happen to

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,080
have one more important thing to do.

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,240
What?

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,360
Of course I have to share

139
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,800
such an important matter

140
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,040

142
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,920
Have you heard of

143
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,390
what Commander Bai is up to recently?

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,550
Why is he not around all the time?

145
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,270
Commander Bai took a leave of absence.

146
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,960
He did?

147
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,310
Could it be that
he went back for blind dates again?

148
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,960
All men are jerks.

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240

Father.

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,000
Just stay.

154
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
How are you feeling?

155
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,360
My martial arts have recovered more than 60%.

156
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,510
After it is all restored,

157
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,240
I will find a way

158
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
to send you back to the palace.

159
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,680
I knew that

160
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,240
you still didn't give up on Kui Mulang.

161
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,480
It's not like that, Father.

162
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,270
It was all my fault five years ago.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,040
I will try my best to make up
for my previous mistakes.

164

He.

165
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,000
I won't force you.

166
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
You don't have to rush to promise me.

167
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,950
After I send you to the palace,

168
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,270
take a look at Kui Mulang
and his Queen with your own eyes,

169
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,040
and then you can make a decision.

170
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,440
It's being late.

171
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,710
Go to bed.

172
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,950
Here.

173
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,750
Take the medicine.

174
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,390
Kui Mulang.

175
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,440
Have you ever had the feeling that

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
everything is dark
when you close your eyes,

177
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,390
and it is also dark
when you open your eyes?

178
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,710
Don't think too much.

179
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,830
You are only temporarily blind.

180
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,950
You will soon be able
to regain your vision.

181
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,040
How long will it take?

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,360
Take the medicine now, okay?

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,040
Open your mouth.

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

185
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,750
Trust me.

186
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,710
Everything will be fine.

187
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,920
Kui Mulang, where are you going?

188
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,710
I'm right here.

189
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,920
But now I'm a little scared

190
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120
if no one is around.

191
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm right here with you all the time.

192
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,590
Are you tired?

193
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,830
Do you want me to help you lie down and rest?

194
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm afraid I'm even more afraid
when I fall asleep.

195
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,240
Kui Mulang.

196
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,120
Could you tell stories?

197
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,750
Tell stories?

198
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm just saying.

199
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,270
You are a king. How could you do this?

200
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
It's just that I thought that

201
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,270
when I was afraid in childhood,

202
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
my mother would tell me stories

203
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,120
so that I would not be afraid anymore.

204
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,510
Of course I can do this.

205
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,390
Let me tell you a story

206
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,950
about a little boy.

207
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,750
There was a little boy

208
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,360
who was told to bear the fate
of the entire clan

209
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,590
from the very beginning.

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,270
So since he was a child,

211
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,950
he didn't dare to show emotional ups
and downs,

212
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,360
because he had to maintain the majesty
of a king.

213
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,190
He couldn't indulge in fun

214
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,750
because he had

215
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,390
so many things to deal with every day.

216
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,590
He didn't dare to stop for a moment,

217
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,560
and he didn't dare to slack off.

218
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,590
Why does he remind me of Li Xiong?

219
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
My father has been very strict with me

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
since I was a child.

221
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,270
It may be because he hoped that

222
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,950
I would be a role model for my younger brother

223
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,880
and inherit his family business in the future.

224
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,000
So I didn't dare to make a little mistake
since I was little,

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,830
and I didn't even dare to say no.

226
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,120
Are you telling your own story?

227
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,750
His life is so boring that

228
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,440
he never thought about the future.

229
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,830
But until one day

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,590
he met a woman.

231
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,440
She is

232
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,440
out of the ordinary.

233
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,950
She has a cheerful and sunny personality.

234
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,270
What she does

235
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,150
is always beyond your imagination.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,510
But somehow,

237
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,830
he began to think of her

238
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,590
involuntarily every day.

239
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,480
Sometimes it was when he was on business,

240
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,950
or when he woke up in the middle of the night.

241
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,390
The figure of the girl

242
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,240
always appeared

243
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
in his mind unconsciously.

244
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,120
He wanted to bring the girl

245
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,920
all the delicious and fun things.

246
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,950
Seeing this girl happy

247
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,630
makes him happy too.

248
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Seeing this girl unhappy

249
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,240
or sad

250
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,390
makes him feel uncomfortable.

251
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,950
Gradually,

252
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,510
he began to have an unrealistic idea.

253
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,240
He wanted to leave everything behind

254
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,440
and go far away with her.

255
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,880
Kui Mulang.

256
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm kind of tired.

257
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,750
I want to sleep.

258
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,320
Let me take off your tiara

259
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,830
so you can sleep more comfortably.

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay.

261
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,510
Take a good rest.

262
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm leaving.

263
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,830
No need.

264
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,360
I mean...

265
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,000
You can stay here.

266
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,240
Just don't get too close.

267
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,070
Okay.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,920
Kui Mulang.

269
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,000
Where are you?

270
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,830
I can't feel you.

271
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,040
Kui Mulang.

272
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,630
Don't lie to me. Are you there?

273
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,070
Yes.

274
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
Grab my hair,

275
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,360
and you know I'm there.

276
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
Are you feeling at ease now?

277
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,120
Yes.

278
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,070
Thank you.

279
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,120
You never have to say thank you to me.

280
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,880
Your Majesty.

281
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,750
Is Her Highness asleep?

282
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,590
Is Jing Muhan doing anything?

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
Bai Ke saw that Eunuch Ruo
went out of the palace for purchase,

284
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,510
and there were wound medicines
in the medicines he bought.

285
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,680
Wound medicines?

286
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,040
I didn't hear that he was injured.

287
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,270
Why did he buy this?

288
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,440
And if Jing Muhan was injured himself,

289
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,920
he could go to the imperial doctor.

290
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,240
Why did he buy wound medicines?

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,040
Something's wrong.

292
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Ask Bai Ke

293
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,710
to keep an eye on him.

294
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,440
If they take any actions,

295
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
deal with them directly.

296
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,390
Yes.

297
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,040
Kui Mulang.

298
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,630
I am here.

299
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,440
Are you okay?

300
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,150
Yes.

301
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Are you injured?

302
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,630
No.

303
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,800
I just got bruised.

304
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,470
Why are you

305
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,840
so careless?

306
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,840
I'm fine.

307
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,960
Take a seat.

308
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,230
Did you call me looking for something?

309
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,600
Let me help you.

310
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,750
This...

311
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,270
Why is there a bell on my wrist?

312
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,510
You made it?

313
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,960
Yes.

314
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,870
I tied a bell on your wrist.

315
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,560
If you need me,

316
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,230
just shake it.

317
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,390
I'll be there in time.

318
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,270
Here I am.

319
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,750
By the way,

320
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,040
everything in this chamber

321
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,960
that hinders your walking

322
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,110
has been cleaned up.

323
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,440
From now on,

324
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,230
you can walk freely and confidently
in this space.

325
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,630
Don't be afraid to get hurt.

326
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,040
Thank you.

327
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
I said don't say that to me.

328
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,110
It only took me an hour.

I'll get them to prepare them.

343

I have no appetite.

344

Would you like to go for a walk?

345
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,270
I can go with you.

346
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm not in the mood.

347
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,960
I look terrible now, do I?

348
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,840
I can't see now.

349
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,840
I must be very scruffy.

350
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,440
Not at all.

351
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,270
And you are the most beautiful one

352
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,350
no matter when.

353
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,630
You are lying to me again.

354
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,560
I haven't seriously groomed myself

355
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,560
since I was injured

356
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,870
and lost my eyesight.

357
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,920
I must look ugly.

358
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,230
Well.

359
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,750
If you don't mind,

360
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I can help.

361
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,920
How?

362
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,630
I remember my mother

363
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,840
often combing my hair like this
when I was a child.

364
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,920
At that time, I always liked to close my eyes,

365
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,470
because she was very gentle

366
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,470
when combing my hair.

367
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,230
Now you are doing this for me.

368
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,960
But I can't see anything.

369
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,470
Then act as if you were still a child.

370
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,870
Close your eyes.

371
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,120
♪You and the sun both shined♪

372
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,720

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,800
♪As I played dumb♪

379
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,040
♪Tick tock, wet my struggle♪

380
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,080
♪I wish I could♪

381
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,720
♪Be with you till the end of the night♪

382
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,400
♪I wish I could♪

383
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,510
Alright.

384
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,920
It doesn't seem to be

385
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,670
the same as usual.

386
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
This is a new look,

387
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,680
which is different from usual.

388
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,550
You look much better than usual.

389
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,600
Really?

390
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,990
Of course.

391
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,160
But I feel that something is wrong.

392
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,480
I made it myself.

393
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,280
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

394
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,070
Here is today's medicine.

395
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,480
I'll take my leave.

396
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,120
Hold on, Liu Jun.

397
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,790
Do you find anything different
about me today?

398
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,550
You don't seem to be...

399
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,790
What?

400
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,830
The same.

401
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,830
You are glowing today

402
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,910
and your style is amazing.

403
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,880
What happened to you?

404
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,430
Maybe it's because of the new style.

405
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,360
That's it.

406
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,280
Okay, leave us alone.

407
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,790
See?

408
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,160
I didn't lie to you.

409
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,520
You look really gorgeous.

410
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,160
I didn't expect
you could really do hairstyles.

411
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,710
What Liu Jun said

412
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,590
makes me anxious to see how I am.

413
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,360
When you recover,

414
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,830
I will do this again for you,

415
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,550
Okay?

416
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,910
You like to hang out, right?

417
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,070
Well.

418
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,670
Take the medicine.

419
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,430
And I will take you out for a walk.

420
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,480
It doesn't make sense.

421
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
I can't see anything.

422
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,240
That's not for sure.

423
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,790
I guarantee you will see,

424
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,950
no,

425
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,640
feel a different world this time.

426
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,790
Really?

427
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,640
Take the medicine.

428
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,790
Bai Ke

429
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,430
has been on leave for so long.

430
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,590
Where has he been?

431
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,280
Hu Die.

432
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,480
Didn't you go home on leave?

433
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,480
Why are you here?

434
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,550
Who told you that?

435
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
So what have you been busy with?

436
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You left for so long

437
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,190
without saying anything.

438
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,360
I mean...

439
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,480
Do you know

440
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,120
how tired I am

441
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,430
when you leave all the work to me?

442
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,070
Sorry.

443
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,670
Are you angry with me?

444
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,070
But didn't you say

445
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,950
you love the work?

446
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,400
Why are you tired of it?

447
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,590
Are you sick?

448
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,670
You are!

449
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,880
How come you never get the point?

450
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,360
I got the point.

451
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,280
His Majesty has given me a secret mission.

452
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm back to get something.

453
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,880
Let's talk later.

454
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,760
A secret mission?

455
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,550
Bai Ke.

456
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
Be careful.

457
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,480
Don't worry.

458
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,240
Here we are.

459
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,400
Where are we now?

460
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,550
This is the cliff I brought you to last time.

461
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,480
I remembered.

462
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,520
The scenery here is beautiful.

463
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,790
Too bad I can't see it.

464
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,710
Although you can't see it,

465
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
you can feel it.

466
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,670
How to feel it?

467
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,360
Let's do this.

468
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,120
Let's close our eyes.

469
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,640
When you can't see,

470
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,670
your other senses

471
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,280
are sharpened.

472
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,310
Maybe we can feel things

473
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,640
that we couldn't feel before.

474
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,880
Listen.

475
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,520
There is a waterfall behind us.

476
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,790
I hear it.

477
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,190
There is a bird singing

478
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,590
overhead on our upper right.

479
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,760
Did you hear that?

480
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,400
It was the first time

481
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,790
I listened so attentively
to the chirping of a bird.

482
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,830
It sounds so good.

483
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,400
Did you feel the wind?

484
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,790
Feel the wind gently caress your palm.

485
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,670
Take a try.

486
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,640
Feel the wind caress your palm.

487
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,880
♪The day the sunlight touched your face♪

488
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,880

I didn't know the wind

491
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,710
could be touched before.

492
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,440

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,240

502
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,830
I seem to hear your heartbeat.

503
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,280
I heard it too.

504
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,120
What's this?

505
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,430
Peach blossom.

506
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,830
The flowers on the mountain are blooming.

507
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,830
I feel it.

508
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you

509
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,280
looking at me?

510
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,550
No.

511
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,790
I am not.

512
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,880
Why do I suddenly

513
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,550
have a crush on Kui Mulang?

514
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,430
No way.

515
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,120
I have Li Xiong.

516
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,310
How did I become the bad girl
that my mother said?

517
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,120
No.

518
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,830
I am just grateful to Kui Mulang.

519
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,190
I still like Li Xiong.

520
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,590
But his heartbeat

521
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,520
gave me a sense of deja vu.

522
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,920
Are you tired?

523
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,750
Shall we go back for a rest?

524
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,750
Let's stay here a little longer, shall we?

525
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,950
I may have been in the palace for too long,

526
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,320
and I like this feeling very much.

527
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,160
Okay.

528
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,470
You can stay as long as you want.

529
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,470
The stars are so bright tonight.

530
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,440
Venus is shining.

531
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,830
I know.

532
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,990
My mother told me that

533
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,990
Venus is also called Phosphorus.

534
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,830
When I was a child,

535
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,920
my father often took me here
to watch the stars.

536
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,750
This is what he told me.

537
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,080
And the Big Dipper is also shining.

538
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,200
So many stars.

539
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,200
Great.

540
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,800
Hearing you say that,

541
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,080
I seem to have seen it.

542
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,080
If only

543
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,750
you could actually see it.

544
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,110
The one over there is Kui Mulang Star.

545
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I showed you before.

546
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
You are awake.

547
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,520
Day breaks.

548
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,710
Shall we go back?

549
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,560
Isn't Kui Mulang's hands
different from ordinary people?

550
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,710
Something's wrong

551
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,950
with the touch just now.

552
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,520
Am I thinking too much?

553
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,280
What's wrong?

554
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,880
Are your eyes uncomfortable?

555
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,080
A little bit.

556
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,640
Don't worry.

557
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
Your toxins have been cleared a lot.

558
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,080
After returning to the palace,

559
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,470
I will ask the imperial doctor to check.

560
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,880
Okay.

561
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,950
Let's go.

562
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,640
Congratulations to Your Highness.

563
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,320
I just took your pulse.

564
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,080
Toxins have been removed.

565
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,360
With a few simple exercises,

566
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,950
you can see as before.

567
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,430
Okay.

568
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,470
Qi Pa.

569
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Can you see anything now?

570
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,880
Not yet.

571
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,080
It may take several hours.

572
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,320
Your Highness, no worries.

573
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,560
Order someone to prepare some candles

574
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,840
and practice light sensitivity.

575
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,560
You will recover soon.

576
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,390
Okay.

577
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Great, Your Highness.

578
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,230
You will soon regain your vision.

579
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,910
Hongxiu.

580
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,230
Let's see the doctor off.

581
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,560
Thank you

582
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,120
for your care during this time.

583
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,360
I told you

584
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,950
not to be so polite to me.

585
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,800
Don't worry.

586
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,520
Your eyes will heal in no time.

587
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,710
One more thing.

588
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,560
The three-month deadline
is approaching.

589
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,640
I haven't taken good care of you

590
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,390
in these three months.

591
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,230
But my heart to you

592
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,520
never changed.

593
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,390
I hope that...

594
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,840
If you insist on leaving,

595
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,640
I won't stop you.

596
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,080
But I hope you can

597
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
think it over

598
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,750
and give me another chance.

599
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
No worries.

600
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,880
Tell me when you've made up your mind.

601
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,990
By then,

602
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,320
I have another important thing

603
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,390
to tell you.

604
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,390
Take a good rest.

605
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,950
Your Majesty, anything on your mind?

606
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,600
I've decided it.

607
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,080
A lie will be exposed one day.

608
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,150
I don't want to lie to Qi Pa any longer.

609
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,990
The three-month deadline is approaching.

610
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,670
Regardless of whether
she is willing to stay or not by then,

611
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,230
I will tell her the whole truth.

612
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,150
Your Majesty, think twice.

613
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,190
Enough.

614
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,990
I've made up my mind.

615
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,880
Your Highness.

616
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,600
There is a stool in front.

617
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,320
Why don't we go to rest for a while?

618
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,910
Okay.

619
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,840
Be careful.

620
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,040
Your Highness.

621
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,390
The doctor said that

622
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,470
it is good for your eyes
if you go out for a walk more often.

623
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,150
Can you see

624
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,040
a little light now?

625
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
Vaguely.

626
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,190
But I can feel some.

627
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,910
Your Highness.

628
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,520
This is the honeysuckle medicine bag
that I made.

629
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,950
Let me apply it on you.

630
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,990
It does good for your eyes.

631
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,430
Close your eyes.

632
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,320
Never mind. I can do it myself.

633
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,950
Kui Mulang asked me

634
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,800
to think about the three-month period.

635
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,950
Of course I have to reject him.

636
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,750
The wolves only love one person in their life.

637
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,360
So there is only one necklace.

638
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,080
Today I will give it to you.

639
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,600
But why do I feel sad

640
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,750
at the thought of rejecting him?

641
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,190
No way.

642
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,840
I am really a bad girl now.

643
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,320
I can't do this.

644
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,520
Your Royal Highness.

645
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,990
Her Highness went out the chamber.

646
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,080
Her eyesight doesn't seem to be back.

647
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,320
Now she is in the imperial garden
with only Hongxiu around.

648
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,040
Great.

649
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,280
I'll take this good chance

650
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,390
to let Qi Pa get to know Kui Mulang well.

651
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,190
Your Highness.

652
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,670
Are you feeling better?

653
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,520
Yes.

654
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,080
What a coincidence, Sister-in-law.

655
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,950
Jing Muhan.

656
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,430
Quite a coincidence indeed.

657
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,560
Sister-in-law.

658
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,670
Long time no see.

659
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,950
I wonder if you are free

660
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,390
to catch up with me?

661
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,390
