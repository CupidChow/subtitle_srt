[Episode 26]

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,550
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,910
The three elders are here.

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,160
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,310
No need for that.

22
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,360
It's the middle of the night.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,630
What's the emergency, Your Majesty?

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,190
I will

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,080
abdicate.

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,590
Well...

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
Where does that come from?

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,160
Your Majesty, you're in your prime,

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,830
a period to accomplish something.

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,470
No more persuasion.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,600
As a werewolf.

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,190
I love only one person in my life.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,670
Now that

34
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,630
my queen is gone,

35
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,390
I will not have any kids.

36
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,270
Why not pick a qualified heir

37
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,440
in the clan now

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,520
before it's too late?

39
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,880
For the Beast Clan,

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,750
it does no harm but much good.

41
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,830
Please think twice before you act.

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,800
Elder Qi.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,110
I know

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,030
I can count on you

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,800
to pick an heir as you're wise and loyal.

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,600
You have my full trust.

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,080
Please do it as quickly as you can.

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,080
The earlier,

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,390
The earlier,

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,670
the more I can teach him.

51
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,320
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,390
His Majesty

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,270
has made up his mind on this matter.

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,270
You'd better give consent to it, Elders.

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,320
Since you're determined to do so,

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,440
we'll

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,750
respect your decision.

58
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,270
Please excuse us.

59
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,830
Your Majesty,

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,440
how about getting the imperial doctor

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,470
to get you treated?

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,470
Not necessary.

63
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,670
I'm leaving for Daxia

64
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,080
to see Qi Pa tonight.

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,080
Your Majesty.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
Let's go visit Her Highness

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,190
when you get better.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,030
I know how I'm doing.

69
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,080
And it will only get worse.

70
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,910
Liu Jun.

71
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,880
Go get some rest now.

72
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,360
Yes.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,960
Qi Pa.

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,190
You kept saying that you wanted to go back.

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,880
Now you're finally back to Daxia.

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,880
You must be very happy.

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,320
I wonder if you ever

78
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,880
think of Li Xiong

79
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
or

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
Kui Mulang.

81
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,600
I just want to take a look at you

82
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,950
and make sure that you're having a good life.

83
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Grace.

84
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Guess who's coming to see you.

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Aunt Qi.

86
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,830
I missed you so much.

87
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,640
I missed you, too.

88
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,510
A bag.

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,720
And a fairy wand.

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
Newly got?

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Cute.

92
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,230
You went to that fun place

93
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,230
without me.

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
What fun place?

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Grandma said it's called Beast City.

96
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,640
I've never heard of it.

97
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,510
I asked my tutor.

98
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,070
She hasn't, either.

99
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,760
That place is far, far away.

100
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,640
I'll take you there

101
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
after you grow up, okay?

102
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,880
Okay. Pinky swear?

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,640
Sure.

104
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,000
Pinky, pinky swear.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,760
Promise, promise, you and I.

106
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,510
I've no idea how to get there.

107
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,160
I gave you a key chain.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
Do you still have it?

109
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,350
This key chain is for you.

110
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,040
What's so special about it?

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,230
Grandma said

112
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,510
it can lock up your sweetheart.

113
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,000
I accidentally left it in Beast City.

114
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,760
Really?

115
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,920
Have you found your sweetheart?

116
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,270

117
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,790

00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,160
My Lady.

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,160
We've met Aunt Qi.

120
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,270
Let's go back and sleep.

121
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,230
Okay.

122
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,670

128

It's a gift for my aunt.

129
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,040
What for?

130
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,670
For locking up her sweetheart.

132
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760

133
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,230
Of course I do.

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,920
It's someone you like very, very much

135
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,600
and want to be with forever.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,790

143

Ma Yingxiong.

206
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,760
Wake up.

207
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,350
Wake up.

208
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,320
I have something important to tell you.

209
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,840
Your Grace.

210
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,760
I think Kui Mulang was here last night.

211
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,590
Your Grace.

212
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,790
What about Chun'er?

213
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,840
Any news of her?

214
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,230
I didn't

215
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,150
see him.

216
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,350
Then what are you so excited about?

217
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,030
Oh, it's my fault now?

218
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,200
Your Grace.

219
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,550
You said it was something important.

221
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,830
What is it?

222
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Since he has come here once,

223
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,950
I'm sure he's gonna do it again.

224
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,440
Ma Yingxiong.

225
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,950
You sit around and wait for him.

226
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,320
When he comes here next time,

227
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,360
we catch him.

228
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,830
What do you say?

229
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,510
Your Grace, are you suggesting...

230
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,320
Do you want to see Chun'er again?

231
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,240
Yes, I do.

232
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,920
Do you want to go to Beast City again?

233
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,440
Yes, I do.

234
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,150
But Kui Mulang is not an ordinary guy.

235
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,750
Though I'm an accomplished martial artist,

236
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,680
it's not gonna be that easy

237
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,390
for me

238
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,830
to catch him.

239
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,880
Fair enough.

240
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
If he doesn't show up,

241
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,120
we can do nothing about it.

242
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,710
What is it?

243
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,240
I got it.

244
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,360
Are you sure?

245
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,880
Absolutely.

246
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,190
I'll take a gamble.

247
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,880
Kui Mulang.

248
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,920
I bet that

249
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
you will show up.

250
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,710
You finally showed up, Kui Mulang.

251
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,280
You...

252
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,840
You did it on purpose.

253
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,520
If I hadn't done that,

254
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,640
would you have come out?

255
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,880
It was you

256
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,760
last night, right?

257
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,640
I just thought I'd come here
and check on you.

258
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,710
Now I've seen you

259
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,790
and you're fine,

260
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,520
I'll leave.

261
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,710
So you did show up.

262
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,790
Assassin!

263
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,030
He's not.

264
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,840
He's

265
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,550
a friend.

266
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
Auntie, who is he?

267
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,230
Did you meet him

268
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,710
at that fun place?

269
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,470
Yeah.

270
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,880
He must really like you.

271
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,280
Why did you say that?

272
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
You told me that place was far, far away.

273
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,520
But he came to see you anyway.

274
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
And he only has eyes for you.

275
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,590
He's also cute.

276
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,280
I think he's your type, Auntie.

277
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,030
Just give it a shot.

278
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,440
Uncle.

279
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,520
Nice to meet you, I'm Xing Ping.

280
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,790
Uncle?

281
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,280
Nice to meet you, Xing Ping.

282
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,440
Uncle, could you get down?

283
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,960
Okay, but why?

284
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Do you have my key chain

285
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,590
with a durian doll?

286
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,440
Yep.

287
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
Aunt Qi likes you

288
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,760
I like you, too

289
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,150
Xing Ping!

290
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,320
A gift to you.

291
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This is for me?

292
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,150
E'huang.

293
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,710
Take Xing Ping Princess to play.

294
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,760
I have something to deal with.

295
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,440
My Lady.

296
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,590
Let's go back.

297
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,000
Well,

298
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,710
don't mind her. She's just a child.

299
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,080
I know

300
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,320
I know.

301
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,470
I will treasure this gift

302
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,070
as I do to the one you gave me.

303
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,680
I'm leaving then.

304
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:14,710
Wait a minute.

305
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,160
Who said you could leave?

306
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,310
Kui Mulang.

307
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not doing well.

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,950
I'm unhappy here.

309
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,680
I want to go back to Beast City.

310
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,920
You want to

311
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,310
go back to Beast City?

312
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,470
Yeah.

313
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,070
Because.

314
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,710
I miss Hongxiu,

315
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,400
Liu Jun,

316
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,430
Hu Die,

317
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,230
Bai Ke,

318
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,280
Chun'er,

319
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,560
Haonan,

320
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,880
Elder Qi,

321
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,310
and Mammy Xiong.

322
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,350
I want to go back.

323
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,710
Good.

324
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,760
If that's what you want,

325
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,590
I will take you to Beast City.

326
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,920
When you miss Daxia,

327
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,350
I'll take you back here.

328
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,520
Okay.

329
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,590
Wait a moment.

330
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,710
I'll go pack.

331
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,560
Be right back.

332
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,310
Okay.

333
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,430
And me.

334
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,230
Oh, right.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,640
And take him with us.

336
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,880
Your Grace, I'll go with you.

337
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,710
You've already packed your things?

338
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
And that's a lot.

339
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,520
Stay out of this.

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,590
I prepared gifts for everyone.

341
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm also ready.

342
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,470
Let's hit the road.

343
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,040
Prince Consort.

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,640
Ma Yingxiong.

345
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,640
Xingping is a little girl.

346
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,350
But you're not.

347
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,070
As a subject of Daxia State,

348
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,880
I'll address him by the rules of our state.

349
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,590
What else should I call him?

350
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,230
- Just call him...
- It's all right.

351
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,560
Just call me Prince Consort.

352
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,470
Yes, Prince Consort.

353
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,800
Let's

354
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,710
set off.

355
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,640
Okay.

356
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,880
I've been here before.

357
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,520
Last time I took some people here

358
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
and looked for the way to Beast City.

359
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,640
We searched for a long time
but couldn't find it.

360
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
I'd be impressed

361
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,230
if you can find it.

362
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,880
I...

363
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,830
General Ma.

364
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,400
The approach to Beast City

365
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,590
is a secret.

366
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,640
Only Liu Jun and I

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,110
know about it.

368
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,310
Oh, right.

369
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,950
Keep it from Chun'er.

370
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,760
Or she'll tell everyone in Beast City.

371
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,350
Don't worry, Your Grace.

372
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,640
If I let out this secret,

373
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,920
I'll kill myself immediately.

374
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,470
Let's go.

375
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,520
Just... just like that?

376
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,040
That's amazing.

377
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,710
No wonder I couldn't find it.

378
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,680
You will see Chun'er soon,

379
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,430
who you keep thinking about.

380
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,430
Your Grace.

381
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,560
Look at me.

382
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,110
How do I look?

383
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,760
What's the matter?

384
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,640
You look fantastic.

385
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,710
Thank you, Your Grace.

386
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,710
All right.

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,710
Let's go.

388
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,470
Okay.

389
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,230
Let's go, Your Grace.

390
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,430
So pretentious.

391
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I'm not pretending.

392
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,160
I just want to look neat.

393
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,880
How is that pretentious?

394
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,520
Wait for me.

This nerd.

411
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm a girl. I can't start this.

412
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,830
Just say something nice.

413
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,190
Do you have to play cool?

414
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,590
Your Highness.

415
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,400
Your Highness, you're back!

416
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,710
I'm back.

417
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,950
You're finally back.

418
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,470
I missed you so much.

419
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,470
I missed you, too.

420
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,350
Wait.

421
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,190
I brought you a gift from Daxia.

422
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,110
Gift?

423
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,800
What gift?

424
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,560
Here.

425
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,400
They are

426
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,230
called high heels,

427
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,560
shoes from my mother's hometown.

428
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,520
My mother drew the design
and had the palace craftsmen make them.

429
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
My mother said that

430
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
the high heels

431
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,350
could help you win a man's heart.

432
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,430
Wear high heels

433
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,880
and you'll have a strong aura.

434
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,680
No matter it's Liu Jun

435
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,800
or some other man,

436
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,000
they will be captivated by you.

437
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,640
Really?

438
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,760
You may not believe me.

439
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,400
But you cannot doubt

440
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,070
my mother's ability to get a man.

441
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,640
I'll try it on later.

442
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,470
By the way,

443
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,000
where are Bai Ke and Hu Die?

444
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,920
Commander Bai is on duty today.

445
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,310
Deputy Commander Hu must be in her room.

446
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,920
Okay.

447
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
You put them on and practice walking.

448
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll go send the gifts to them.

449
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,760
Qi...

450
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,160
Why did you come back?

451
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,160
Are you happy,

452
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,230
very happy,

453
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,560
or super happy to see me?

454
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,710
Get to the point.

455
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm busy.

456
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,680
All right.

457
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,560
Check this out.

458
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,950
A luminous pearl from Daxia.

459
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,040
There are only three of them in the state.

460
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,230
And this one.

461
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,040
A silk scarf that took one year

462
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,880
for 300 Persian workers to weave.

463
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,310
Oh, boy.

464
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,280
And this one.

465
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,230
This is

466
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,590
a gift from my uncle

467
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,350
at my coming-of-age ceremony.

468
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,430
It's also yours.

469
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,190
As for the rest,

470
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,680
this, this, and this

471
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
are all yours.

472
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,680
Remember, they're all limited designs.

473
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,680
You are going to give

474
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,400
all of them to me?

475
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,110
I don't want your stuff.

476
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,640
There is no such thing

477
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,800
as a free lunch.

478
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,430
Got it.

479
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,640
I'll take them away.

480
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,230
All yours.

481
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,710
They should stay
with the biggest clotheshorse

482
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,920
of Beast Royal Palace.

483
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,760
Why are you so nice to me suddenly?

484
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,230
Although you have a quick temper

485
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,520
and love dressing yourself up,

486
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,350
you do look prettier than me and that's rare.

487
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,760
Everyone loves beautiful things.

488
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,950
Anyway, I hope

489
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,190
you could treat these babies well.

490
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,070
Incidentally,

491
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
as a person who cares about you,

492
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,470
I'd like to give you one last piece
of advice.

493
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,350
Look at the people around you.

494
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,680
Happiness is within reach.

495
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,400
Goodbye.

496
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,710
Hey.

497
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,430
What do you mean?

498
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,520
Your Highness.

499
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,190
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

500
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,960
Welcome back.

501
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,270
Well,

502
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,040
I have a gift for you.

503
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,390
Your future happiness

504
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,350
is pinned on it.

505
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,630
Make good use of it.

506
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,800
What's that?

507
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,630
Here.

508
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,960
Rouge from Xianbei Kingdom.

509
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,350
No woman can refuse it.

510
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,510
Its scent

511
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,870
is known as the smile of the goddess,

512
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,200
making every man being captivated.

513
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,680
Even my mother

514
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
goes quite easy on it.

515
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,470
This one is yours.

516
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,200
No, I can't. Your Highness, I...

517
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,350
Take it.

518
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,990
It's such a good thing.

519
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,320
But I don't need it. I'm a man.

520
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,390
Bai Ke.

521
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,350
Intelligence quotient is a good thing.

522
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I hope you can have some apace.

523
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,750
The rogue is yours, anyway.

524
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,920
Think about it.

525
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,390
You can decide how to use it.

526
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,990
Remember.

527
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,750
Use it on the right occasion.

528
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,150

529
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,110

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,200
Liu Jun.

573
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Mr. Liu Jun.

574
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,390
What are these?

575
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,750
Shoes.

576
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,320
A gift Her Highness

577
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,990
brought from Daxia.

578
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,110
They're called high heels.

579
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,150
Do they look beautiful?

580
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,630
Beautiful.

581
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,440
But how are you gonna walk on them?

582
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,800
If you're not used to them,

583
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,750
why not take them off?

584
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,800
Fair enough.

585
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,510
They're a gift from Her Highness.

586
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,440
I don't want to break them.

587
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,390
Let me help you.

588
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,390
If you don't mind.

589
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,320
Where are you going?

590
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,350
I'll carry you there.

591
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,470
I... Her Highness's chamber.

592
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,990
Okay.

593
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,920
Get up here.

594
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,230
Are you afraid of being poisoned by me?

595
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,080
I didn't mean that.

596
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,750
Be careful.

597
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,440
Don't touch my skin.

598
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,000
[Yaohua Palace]

599
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,320
Mr. Liu Jun.

600
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,840
Thank you for carrying me back.

601
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,150
You're welcome.

602
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,750
Come on.

603
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,750
You are being too courteous.

604
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,870
I still want to thank you, anyway.

605
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,320
As for the gloves,

606
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,870
I hope you could have them.

607
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,040
Thanks.

608
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,320
Your Majesty,

609
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,950
Her Highness is back now.

610
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,750
You should be happy.

611
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,640
What are you lost in thought here all alone?

612
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,950
Qi Pa came back

613
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
because she missed the people here.

614
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,270
She mentioned everyone

615
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,750
but me.

616
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,270
I see.

617
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,270
There's one thing

618
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,600
that might be a comfort.

619
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,840
Do you want to know?

620
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,160
What is it?

621
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,800
Her Highness

622
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,160
brought gifts from Daxia

623
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,560
for everyone but me.

624
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,040
Among so many gifts,

625
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,600
none of them was for me!

626
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,750
So I also didn't get one

627
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,120
because I'm your right-hand man

628
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,840
and she dislikes me for your sake.

629
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,800
Right?

630
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,710
Anything else you want to tell me?

631
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,950
Get out if nothing else.

632
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,040
Now that Her Highness has returned,

633
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,880
it means you still have chances to save this.

634
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
Why not swallow your pride
and apologize to her?

635
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,710
Maybe things will turn around.

636
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,430
But I don't want to push her now.

637
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,640
I hope that she can follow her heart.

638
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,470
As I see it,

639
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,950
Her Highness just used others as an excuse.

640
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,120
She came back for you.

641
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,160
Your Majesty.

642
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,160
Are you sure you're gonna give up?

643
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,040
You mean

644
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,160
sweet talk?

645
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,040
Of course.

646
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,670
Your Highness.

647
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,880
You're back.

648
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,560
What's wrong?

649
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,400
The high heels don't fit?

650
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,990
I really don't know how to wear them.

651
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,600
Yet when I was practicing walking on them,

652
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,800
I ran into Mr. Liu Jun.

653
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,800
He worried that I might trip and fall.

654
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,470
So he carried me on his back

655
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,640
and sent me here.

656
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,320
You're good.

657
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,710
I didn't know

658
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,120
the high heels could work that way.

659
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,080
It's not exactly what I imagined,

660
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,190
but it did help you to attract Liu Jun.

661
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,910
Your Highness.

662
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,190
I just can't wear them properly.

663
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,990
And I hate to get them ruined.

664
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,560
So I'd better return them to you.

665
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,360
No worries.

666
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,510
It's just a pair of shoes.

667
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,710
I'll get something new for you
next time I go back to Daxia.

668
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,160
That's not okay.

669
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,270
You can't go back to Daxia again.

670
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,430
I missed you so much

671
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,670
while you were gone.

672
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,910
I hope you could stay in Beast City forever.

673
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,510
I don't need any shoes.

674
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,880
Cutie.

675
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,840
The shoes are yours already.

676
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,560
By the way,

677
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,160
Haonan and I will go purchase things later.

678
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,560
Do you need anything?

679
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,470
I'll bring it back for you.

680
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,560
I don't need anything.

681
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,670
Have a good shopping with Haonan.

682
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,510
On your way out,

683
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,560
ask Kui Mulang to come here.

684
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,600
Your Highness.

685
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,600
You're willing to see His Majesty?

686
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,560
That's great.

687
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,400
Go ahead.

688
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,880
Yes, Your Highness.

689
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,750
Hu Die. Hu Die.

690
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,320
Hu Die.

691
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,880
Hu Die.

692
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,470
Are you sick?

693
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,800
I'm just not feeling very well.

694
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,430
Oh.

695
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,270
Tell me what is ailing you.

696
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
I'll take you to the drill ground

697
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
and have an army doctor check on you.

698
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,360
You're making a fuss over it.

699
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm not that delicate, am I?

700
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,670
That's a relief.

701
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,880
But you never missed the drill

702
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,430
for illness before.

703
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,600
No.

704
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,990
You're hiding something from me.

705
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
I've told you I'm fine.

706
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
No, I'll take you to the doctor.

707
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,800
I'm not going.

708
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,990
What's this?

709
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,160
What are all these?

710
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,750
These are

711
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,120
some local specialties Her Highness
brought me from Daxia.

712
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,230
I've no room for them,
so they end up on the bed.

713
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,840
Her Highness is such a nice person.

714
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,320
She went back home

715
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,470
and returned with gifts

716
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,400
for everyone.

717
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,040
Everyone?

718
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,160
What did she get you?

719
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,800
The thing she gave me is very useful.

720
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,640
But she's a little stingy.

721
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,950
She only gave me

722
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,950
a small package of it.

723
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,670
I don't know where to buy it.

724
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,950
If it is easy to buy,

725
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,320
I plan to purchase it in bulk

726
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,800
for the soldiers.

727
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,670
What did she give you?

728
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
This.

729
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,320
The soldiers sweat a lot

730
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,640
and get smelly

731
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,670
after our daily training.

732
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,430
But this powder

733
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,910
keeps us dry and stops the itch.

734
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,880
So I don't know

735
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,400
Is it easily available?

736
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,840
If it is,

737
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,160
I'll definitely recommend it

738
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,750
to everyone in the army.

739
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,560
That's what

740
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,800
Her Highness told you?

741
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,230
Well, not in exact words.

742
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,640
But she told me

743
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,190
to think about its utility

744
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,470
and stressed that girls loved it.

745
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,560
Girls love it.

746
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,880
But I'm a man.

747
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,510
I couldn't figure it out myself.

748
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,510
So I asked Haonan about it.

749
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,470
Haonan told me how to use it.

750
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,320
I tried

751
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,640
and found it amazing.

752
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,840
Haonan?

753
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,510
You really asked the right girl.

754
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,990
Take your powder.

755
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,710
Get lost!

756
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,230
Hu Die, why are you mad at me again?

757
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,910
So I can't even talk to Haonan?

758
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,800
I don't want to see you again.

759
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,230
Out. Get out.

760
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,800
