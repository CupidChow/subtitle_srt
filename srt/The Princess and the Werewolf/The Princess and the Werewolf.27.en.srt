[Episode 27]

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,830
May I come in?

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,270
Come on in.

20
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,550
Qi Pa.

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,230
You're good.

22
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,590
A fan of cosplay?

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,030
Cosplay? What's that?

24
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,470
Cosplay means that

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,270
one minute you're Li Xiong,

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
and the next minute you're Kui Mulang.

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,670
I shouldn't have deceived you.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,360
Nothing else to say?

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,360
I'm tired.

30
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,880
I wanna take a nap
but I just can't fall asleep.

31
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,520
Why don't you tell me a bedtime story?

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,030
When I was blind before,

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,550
you told me a lot.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,000
That was because...

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,880
No need to explain.

36
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,830
You used to tell me a story

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
but I cut you off.

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,160
How about that one?

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,830
The one where you want

40
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,240
to travel the world with me.

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,320
Oh, I remember that one.

42
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,550
But I finished

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,800
telling that story.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,360
Um...

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,470
Then tell me a story

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,600
from your childhood.

47
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,360
Happy ones or unhappy ones?

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,390
Both okay.

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
My childhood.

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,160
But my childhood

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,550
wasn't happy at all.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,190
I didn't understand

53
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,080
why Jing Muhan could act as he pleased.

54
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,470
But I was

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,800
forced to study every day

56
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,320
and learn how to be a good king.

57
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,670
I remember one thing.

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,270
On my 16th birthday,

59
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,160
I went out of the palace without a disguise.

60
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,550
I never thought

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,550
that you could be so childish.

62
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,880
That was the first time I left the palace.

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
That day,

64
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,270
standing on the walls of Beast City,

65
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,080
I overlooked the entire city

66
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,600
and heard the laughter of my people
who live and work in peace and contentment.

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,760
At that moment,

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,830
I understood everything.

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,550
As long as I can

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,790
protect everything I love,

71
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
to be honest,

72
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm okay with my fate.

73
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,440
That has made me who I am.

74
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,480
I did all the happy things

75
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
with you.

76
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,830
I'll always be at your side.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,230
Great.

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,640
We can mass-produce the pills.

79
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,640
As long as the effect can last,

80
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,480
we can go ahead with our plan.

81
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,790
Now we can conduct tests on people.

82
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,270
Don't capture some villagers this time.

83
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,070
Get me some people from the palace.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,790
Yes.

85
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,390
Haonan.

86
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,920
Let's go buy some

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,350
Eight-treasure Cake.

88
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,320
It's delicious and sweet.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,160
Sure.

90
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,670
What's wrong, Haonan?

91
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,390
I feel that someone is stalking us.

92
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you getting too tense

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,390
from all the patrol recently?

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,160
Why would anyone stalk us?

95
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,390
Fair enough.

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,720
Let's go.

97
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,230
Haonan.

98
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,950
The Eight-treasure Cake is incredibly tasty.

99
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,950
I didn't get you to try it last time.

100
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,510
Just eat it to your heart's content today.

101
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,040
Okay.

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,790
That candy.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,830
It's super sweet.

104
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,790
What would you like?

105
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,070
How do you sell this?

106
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
Four bronze coins.

107
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,670
Four?

108
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,950
That's expensive.

109
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,440
What about this one?

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,830
Could you...

111
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,320
Hongxiu.

112
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,350
Wait for me here.

113
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,110
Be quick.

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Why hasn't she come back yet?

115
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
Xiniang, feed the pills to them.

116
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,840
Kneel down.

118
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,670
I'm your master now.

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Yes, Master.

120
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,550
Congratulations on the success, Master.

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,110
Xiniang.

122
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
This is just the beginning.

123
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,760
The interesting part is yet to come.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,670
You.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Go to the market

126
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,230
and buy a box of rouge.

127
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,110
Yes.

128
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,030
You go buy a good sword.

129
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,840
Yes.

130
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,080
Go ahead.

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,440
Xiniang.

132
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,110
Follow them

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,230
and see if they'll do what I asked.

134
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,910
Yes.

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
No need for etiquette.

136
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,350
How's the preparation going?

137
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,030
It's done.

138
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,150
Your Majesty, please make peace

139
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,400
with Her Highness as soon as possible

140
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,080
so that you can get the Holy Pearl back.

141
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,670
Kui Mulang.

142
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,550
How did I fall asleep?

143
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,200
What a good man!

144
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,440
I told you to put me to sleep.

145
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
And you put me to sleep.

146
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,000
Hongxiu, is that you?

147
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,470
It's me.

148
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,550
Are you awake?

149
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,910
May I come in?

150
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,150
Yes, I am.

151
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,200
But not fully awake.

152
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,320
Did he just leave?

153
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,760
Why did you leave

154
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,840
while I was asleep?

155
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,910
I...

156
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,470
You were sleeping soundly.

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,960
I didn't want to disturb you.

158
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
Then why are you back?

159
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,790
I know you're still mad at me.

160
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,520
But I will never cheat you again.

161
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,150
I swear to God.

162
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,960
If I lie to you again

163
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,790
in the future,

164
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,760
may I be punished by...

165
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,960
All right. That's it.

166
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,840
Do you think God would concern himself
with this?

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,440
Actually, I came to ask

168
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,880
if you're free today.

169
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,110
Let me check my schedule.

170
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,150
Let's see.

171
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,320
Tonight,

172
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,390
I'll have dinner with Hongxiu

173
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,320
and gossip with Chun'er

174
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,360
and Ma Yingxiong.

175
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,360
I see.

176
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Let's take a rain check.

177
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,190
Wait a minute.

178
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
But I can still spare some time

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,190
if I try.

180
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,630
What.

181
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
You wanna

182
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,240
ask me out?

183
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,750
Today is River Lantern Festival.

184
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,240
Every family in town

185
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,750
will get out and float lanterns on the river.

186
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,950
If you're free tonight,

187
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,390
we can go have a look together.

188
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,560
I'll think about it.

189
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,320
That doesn't sound very alluring.

190
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,240
But since you insist,

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,630
I'll go with you.

192
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,680
Good then.

193
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,590
I'll pick you up later.

194
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,920
Let's have a good chat tonight.

195
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,480
Master.

196
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,560
They're just like normal people.

197
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
They talked with the sellers,

198
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,880
bought the items you wanted,

199
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,630
and double backed.

200
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
That's great!

201
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,830
Five years of hard work

202
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,270
to make the Soul-driving Pill.

203
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,630
Now it finally starts paying off.

204
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,360
Congratulations, Master.

205
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,630
So what is the next step?

206
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,590
Send them both

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,510
back to Beast Royal Palace.

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,950
Let them find a way

209
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,920
to make everyone there eat the pill.

210
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,480
But according to what you said,

211
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
the effect only lasts for one day.

212
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,270
Once the effect wears off,

213
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,510
we'll be unable to control them.

214
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,920
Don't worry.

215
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,800
As long as they take the pills on time,

216
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,320
the effect will continue.

217
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,950
and so does our control.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,590
Okay.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,390
Take a pill at dinner time on a daily basis.

220
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,590
Understand?

221
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,830
Yes.

222
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,950
One more thing.

223
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,560
Add the pills to the food
of the Imperial Kitchen

224
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,750
and tell everyone in the palace

225
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
to take orders from Su Daqiang.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,590
Yes.

227
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,000
That's it.

228
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,040
Go back to the palace.

229
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,040
Master.

230
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,560
I have a question.

231
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,750
Why don't we put these pills

232
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,440
into the wells all over the city?

233
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,710
That way, we can control

234
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,040
all the people in Beast City.

235
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
That's too many people to control.

236
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,830
Besides, the pills must be taken every day.

237
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Now I just need to control people
in the palace,

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,830
where the king of the Beast Clan lives.

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,750
Then I can control the entire Beast Clan.

240
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,710
That's wise of you, Master.

241
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,120
It's time to send He to the palace.

242
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,240
Just do as I told you.

243
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,920
Remember,

244
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,440
Jing Muhan and Haitang

245
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,360
can't know anything about it.

246
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,590
Yes.

247
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,750
I still have something

248
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,560
to say to He.

249
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,120
You stay here.

250
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
Give us some privacy.

251
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,360
Father.

252
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,950
I'm ready.

253
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,950
No rush.

254
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,440
He.

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,000
I have some questions for you.

256
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,800
Do you still

257
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,590
have an affection for Kui Mulang?

258
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,590
Father.

259
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,800
From now on,

260
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,320
I will never betray you again.

261
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,120
But I've thought it over.

262
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,040
If I could let Kui Mulang listen to me,

263
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,120
would you spare his life?

264
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,360
What if you fail?

265
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,320
I believe that

266
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,240
he isn't an ungrateful man.

267
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,360
He owes me.

268
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,270
But he already has a queen.

269
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,560
You told me that the queen

270
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,360
isn't a member of the Beast Clan.

271
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,240
I've accompanied Kui Mulang for years.

272
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
But she's only here for several months.

273
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,440
Fine.

274
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,440
I'll give you some time.

275
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,680
But if you fail again...

276
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,120
If I fail again,

277
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,360
I'll make a clean break with him.

278
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,360
Good.

279
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll wait for your good news.

280
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,590
Yes.

281
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,920
Kui Mulang.

282
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,480
Don't expect me to go soft on you

283
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,830
just because you're sick.

284
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
This time

285
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,950
you must try your best to win me back.

286
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,590
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

287
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,190
Are the river lanterns

288
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,590
of the Beast Clan good?

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,040
If your apology

290
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,070
is sincere enough

291
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
and the lanterns are beautiful,

292
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,560
I'll show some mercy

293
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,350
and give you a kiss

294
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,510
to save your life.

295
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,800
If you want more,

296
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,920
you'd better try harder.

297
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,680
He'll get smug about it

298
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,750
if he finds me wearing this.

299
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,040
Qi Pa.

300
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,110
What happened before was my fault.

301
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,600
I know

302
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,470
it was unforgivable

303
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,110
no matter how I put it.

304
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,600
That's why I...

305
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,470
Oh, not right.

306
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,270
One more time.

307
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,390
Qi Pa.

308
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,840
What happened in the past stays in the past.

309
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,750
Let's start over.

310
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,270
Still not right.

311
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,920
What should I do

312
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,230
to make it right?

313
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,600
Smell good?

314
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,600
Yeah, you do.

315
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,110
Hongxiu.

316
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,510
What are you doing here?

317
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,720
I made Her Highness some dessert.

318
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,960
Try some.

319
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Date paste cake?

320
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,960
I'm allergic to red dates.

321
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,990
General Ma?

322
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,600
Her Grace doesn't care for date paste.

323
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,080
She prefers food like durian

324
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,680
with a pungent smell.

325
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,870
As for me,

326
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,750
Chun'er and I are one.

327
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,680
If Chun'er is allergic to it,

328
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,750
so am I.

329
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,150
Sorry about that.

330
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,560
What's wrong with Hongxiu?

331
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,750
Ignore her.

332
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
We're not married yet.

333
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,920
I... I got excited.

334
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,350
Too excited.

335
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,150
How about this?

336
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,560
I'll ask Her Grace and Prince Consort
for the hand of you tomorrow.

337
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,920
Tomorrow?

338
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,960
That's hasty.

339
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,040
No.

340
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
You must pick an auspicious day to do it.

341
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,110
In fact, I've checked

342
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,510
all the auspicious dates

343
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,200
when I was in Daxia.

344
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,840
The 15th of this month

345
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,320
is the best date of the year.

346
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,470
Chun'er

347
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,350
I like you.

348
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,320
Will you marry me?

349
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,320
Yes, I will.

350
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
Every year at this time,

351
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,990
I come here to float lanterns and make wishes.

352
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,870
What's your wish?

353
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,350
I wish Father, Mother,

354
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,200
Uncle, Aunt Lyu, Xingping,

355
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,600
Daxia people,

356
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,560
as well as

357
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,470
everyone I love

358
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,470
peace and joy.

359
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,470
Your wish will come true,

360
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,960
♪I gave you my hand♪

361
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,200
♪And we ran to chase the sunset♪

362
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,280
♪We made a wish♪

363
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,720
♪That's just between you and me♪

364
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,520
♪Firefly on your fingertip♪

365
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,520
♪The gaze you fixed on me♪

366
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,360
♪Was the eternity I dreamed of♪

367
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,040
Su He?

368
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,270
You're alive.

369
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,230
Your Majesty.

370
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,870
Su He.

371
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,750
I never thought

372
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,960
you'd still be alive.

373
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,390
Five years ago, you fell off the cliff.

374
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,600
I sent my men searching for you around.

375
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
But you were nowhere to find.

376
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,080
Where have you been all these years?

377
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,200
I got injured after falling off.

378
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,320
A granny in the countryside saved me.

379
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,720
But I lost my memory

380
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,920
until these two days.

381
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,990
I know that for every River Lantern Festival,

382
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,870
you go to that place

383
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,350
to pray for all the subjects.

384
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,390
So I went there to see you again.

385
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,680
Ex-girlfriend?

386
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,800
You've suffered a lot in the past five years.

387
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,270
Just say it if you want anything.

388
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,080
I'll give you double.

389
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,470
I did everything five years ago

390
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,870
because I was willing to

391
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,600
and I should.

392
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,470
I don't want anything in return.

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,040
I never thought

394
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,470
I would see you

395
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,510
and get in the palace again.

396
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,150
Your Majesty, I only hope

397
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,630
that I could stay by your side

398
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,750
and do something for you.

399
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,630
Miss Su.

400
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,470
How's your recovery from the injury?

401
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,390
Almost fully recovered.

402
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,560
You must be the new queen.

403
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,680
I've heard a lot that

404
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,870
the new queen is stunningly beautiful

405
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,990
and extraordinary.

406
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Well, you're worthy of the reputation.

407
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,470
Full of pretense.

408
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,720
She must have come with evil intent.

409
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,040
I'm flattered.

410
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,720
You're also a pretty girl.

411
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,150
I'm always kind to beauties.

412
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,600
Su He.

413
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm indebted to you
for what you did five years ago.

414
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,920
As a grateful man,

415
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,800
I will reward you to return the favor.

416
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Go get some rest now.

417
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,840
I'll make arrangements for you.

418
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
As a matter of fact,

419
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,750
I have something

420
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,990
to say to you in private.

421
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,150
Miss Su He.

422
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,440
There's no one else but my queen and Liu Jun.

423
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,920
Please feel free to say anything.

424
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,840
It's okay.

425
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,800
You guys catch up.

426
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,440
I feel sleepy, anyway.

427
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,750
I'm leaving.

428
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,110
Your Majesty.

429
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,390
You must be clear that five years ago,

430
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,630
I took the palm hit for you

431
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,750
not just because of your identity

432
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,150
but because of

433
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,840
my feelings for you.

434
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,920
Su He.

435
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,320
I also told you five years ago

436
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,920
that I only see you as a subject,

437
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,920
not a potential lover at all.

438
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,040
Your Majesty.

439
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,720
Liu Jun.

440
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,560
Take Miss Su He to her room and rest.

441
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,080
Yes.

442
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,510
Miss Su.

443
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,470
Please.

444
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,270
Kui Mulang.

445
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,750
I will get you, I swear.

446
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,870
Your Highness.

447
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,200
What brings you here?

448
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,200
I...

449
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,800
I came to ask you something.

450
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,200
It's about His Majesty and Su He.

451
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,150
Oh, that.

452
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,470
I'll have to relate in details

453
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,600
from five years ago.

454
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,270
Back then, many things happened

455
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,870
between Su He and His Majesty.

456
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,320
How's it going on your end?

457
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,560
I failed.

458
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,600
Her Highness and Chun'er
are still in the kitchen.

459
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,270
What about Bai Ke and Hu Die?

460
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,840
I didn't succeed, either.

461
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,270
We'll find some other chances.

462
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,230
I got it.

463
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,350
Su He followed Kui Mulang for years

464
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,040
as his right-hand woman

465
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,750
and even saved his life once.

466
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,320
Yeah, right.

467
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,510
At that time,

468
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,840
rumor had it

469
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,990
that His Majesty and Su He
were a perfect match.

470
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,750
We thought Su He would be the queen.

471
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,230
Never mind.

472
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,680
I don't care

473
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,560
what other people think.

474
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,840
Did Kui Mulang...

475
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,960
His Majesty seemed

476
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,960
not to have special feelings for her.

477
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,560
The Elders suggested that Su He be the queen.

478
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,230
But His Majesty rejected it.

479
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,350
Yet Su He was really into His Majesty.

480
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,680
She always gazed at His Majesty

481
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,470
with those big, bright eyes.

482
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,990
Su Daqiang.

483
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,230
I've told you

484
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,320
all my secrets.

485
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
It's your turn.

486
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,680
What magic weapon

487
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,440
do you have to bring Kui Mulang down?

488
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,200
This is the Soul-driving Pill.

489
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,870
Except for Kui Mulang

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,230
with a powerful inner strength,

491
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,390
I can control anyone

492
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,630
and let them listen to me

493
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,990
by feeding them this pill.

494
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,870
What an evil thing!

495
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,800
I've planted two moles in the palace.

496
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,680
Wait and be patient.

497
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,960
The entire Beast Royal Palace

498
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,600
will be under my control in the end.

499
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,320
Now you get it.

500
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,440
What will you do to Kui Mulang?

501
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,200
Kill him.

502
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,390
What about me?

503
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,350
I will help you

504
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,800
to become the king.

505
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,960
At that time,

506
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,200
the whole palace will be yours.

507
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,390
Kui Mulang has issued a wanted circular

508
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,040
to arrest you across Beast City.

509
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,960
You're in a dangerous situation.

510
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,080
There's no turning back indeed.

511
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,440
Fine.

512
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,200
I'll trust you this once.

513
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,960
I've left the palace for too long.

514
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,630
I remember a maid

515
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,150
whose name is Chun'er

516
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,200
She talks about the news in the palace.

517
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,200
Is she serving in the palace?

518
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,680
I'd like to talk to her

519
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,440
to know the current situation of the palace.

520
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,990
Chun'er is working on a gossip list

521
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,630
to summarize the hottest topics

522
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,440
in the palace for us.

523
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,470
I prepared

524
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,990
the latest one.

525
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Her Highness made a big comeback

526
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,390
and is getting back together
with His Majesty.

527
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,320
Su He, who disappeared five years ago,
showed up suddenly.

528
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,470
Where is this love triangle going?

529
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Miss Su.

530
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,320
It's just gossip from these young girls.

531
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,680
Please don't take it personally.

532
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,470
I won't.

533
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,230
I'm tired. I want some rest.

534
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,440
Then we'll be excused.

535
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,320
I won't let you get back together.

536
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,720
Come in.

537
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:37,870
Deputy Commander...

538
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,990
What brings you here?

539
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,040
Oh, right.

540
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,630
I'm no longer deputy commander.

541
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,470
Sorry, that was uncalled for.

542
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,470
Don't mind me.

543
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,080
Let's not stand on ceremony.

544
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,470
Just see me as your sister.

545
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,510
Sister Su.

546
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,560
Hu Die.

547
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,750
Back then, I thought you would

548
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,080
make a better deputy commander than me.

549
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
You must be pretty good at it.

550
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,750
I'm flattered.

551
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,040
But I know you have a secret

552
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
that's always been bothering you.

553
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,960
Sister Su.

554
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,920
What do you want from me?

555
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,750
These are deodorant pills.

556
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,390
I made them myself.

557
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,510
Take one and you'll smell good.

558
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,800
It can cover even that smell of yours.

559
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

560
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
I prepared this for you.

561
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,840
After all, you used to be my subordinate.

562
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,110
Sister Su.

563
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,840
Yeah, I was your sidekick before.

564
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,080
It's also true that

565
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,230
I became deputy commander

566
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,840
after you left.

567
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,840
But if you want this position back,

568
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,960
we can have a fair competition.

569
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,680
Hey, what are you saying?

570
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,990
We're sisters, come on.

571
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,150
How could I let your efforts

572
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,630
of all these years go to waste?

573
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,230
Just hear me out

574
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,320
and make your own decision.

575
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,270
You can pick any side.

576
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
But I promise you that

577
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,750
if you help me get rid of Qi Pa,

578
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,320
deodorant pills are available
for the rest of your life.

579
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Get rid of Qi Pa?

580
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,080
In the words of my mother,

581
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,470
when a woman pretends to be pitiful,

582
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,680
she's up to something big.

583
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,230
Let's see what your plot is

584
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,440
behind that pretty face.

585
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,200
Your Majesty.

586
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,840
Her Highness is back.

587
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,560
You must have shared your mutual love.

588
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
Why not take the Holy Pearl back?

589
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,040
You're crossing a line here, Liu Jun.

590
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,870
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

591
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,560
You think I don't want that?

592
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,040
But I've made a decision.

593
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,630
I'll have the Holy Pearl.

594
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,230
I also want a pure love

595
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,200
with Qi Pa.

596
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,720
No ulterior motives involved at all.

597
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,920
That has always confused me, Your Majesty.

598
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,600
Is there really such a clear demarcation

599
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,270
between the Holy Pearl
and your love for Her Highness?

600
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm not entitled to ask this question.

601
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,920
But I'm just wondering

602
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,750
which came first, the desire to utilize her

603
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,440
or your love for her?

604
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,510
As you know,

605
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,680
ever since I became the heir,

606
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,800
I've been wearing a hood and a mask.

607
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,630
I never show people my true face.

608
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,430
For many years,

609
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,710
I was on my own.

610
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,430
Five years ago,

611
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,430
I lost the Holy Pearl

612
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,560
and my face started to transform
day and night.

613
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,040
Do you still remember

614
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,270
that to save your life

615
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,910
I showed you my true face by accident?

616
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,360
Yes, I do.

617
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,910
That was my first time

618
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,910
knowing this secret of the Beast Clan.

619
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,430
Your Majesty, you suffered a lot alone.

620
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,910
When I saw your face,

621
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,910
you should have killed me.

622
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,160
But you didn't.

623
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,560
You mean I should save you

624
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,910
and then kill you?

625
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,560
Over the years,

626
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,190
you've done your job well.

627
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,600
You never let me down.

628
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,600
That's what I should do.

629
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,400
Qi Pa also means a lot to me.

630
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,800
I got to know her because of the Holy Pearl.

631
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,750
But our relationship is now beyond that.

632
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,750
Even if she doesn't have the pearl,

633
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,400
I still want to be her only beloved.

634
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,840
And I couldn't bear the thought

635
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,950
of having anything else

636
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,510
standing between our relationship.

637
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,670
Now I understand.

638
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,800
Ms. Haonan.

639
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,160
Are you hungry?

640
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,120
Deputy Commander Hu asked me

641
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,080
to get some sweep soup for the soldiers.

642
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,470
But they didn't make sweet soup today.

643
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,160
What about some other day?

644
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,400
Okay.

645
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,400
Don't you find

646
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,160
the way Miss Su walks so elegant?

647
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Yeah, very charming.

648
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,670
I want to be friends with her.

649
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,080
She's pretty and kind.

650
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,040
Let's go make friends with her.

651
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,670
Come on.

652
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,600
She must be willing to befriend us.

653
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,360
Right?

654
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,840
I think so.

655
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,080
Let's go.

656
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,910
Go.

657
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,360
What is that supposed to mean?

658
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,670
Not good.

659
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,840
I need to talk to Chun'er about it.

660
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,160
Chun'er.

661
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Leave us alone.

662
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,470
Yes.

663
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
What do you need, Your Highness?

664
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,600
Just some gossip.

665
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,840
What's going on here?

666
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,880
How come Su He

667
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,160
is their role model overnight?

668
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:12,950
Yeah.

669
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
It's said that since she came here,

670
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,990
Su He has met many soldiers and maids.

671
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,670
She talked to them

672
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,990
and gave them gifts.

673
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,400
Now everyone loves her.

674
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,880
Is that so?

675
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,320
Yeah.

676
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,400
It has made the top of the gossip list.

677
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,840
[Fairy Su He is kind to everyone]
It has made the top of the gossip list.

678
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,120
[His Majesty's old lover is back]
Besides, they also say that she's

679
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Besides, they also say that she's

680
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,910
the ideal queen everyone wants.

681
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,950
Then what am I?

682
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,320
Unlike you, Su He is just a commoner.

683
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,910
But you have a solid background.

684
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,880
Now many court maids

685
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,510
are dreamed of being her.

686
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,400
Oh, geez. How did it happen?

687
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,080
Su He is not a simple woman.

688
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,230
Have you heard about it?

689
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,190
Her Highness is the third person.

690
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,430
The third person?

691
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,270
Miss Su He and His Majesty

692
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,640
had feelings for each other.

693
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,600
But later Su He

694
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,360
went missing to save His Majesty.

695
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,120
Then Her Highness came.

696
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,750
She's the wedge

697
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,510
between Su He and His Majesty.

698
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,360
- Really?
- I...

699
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,910
Yep.

700
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,750
Don't tell anyone about this.

701
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,510
Okay.

702
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,750
Your Highness.

703
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
I don't buy it.

704
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,430
I don't produce gossip.

705
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,040
I'm just a gossip carrier.

706
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,840
However,

707
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,880
the topic of your being the third person

708
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,230
[Her Highness is the third person]
has ranked first on the gossip list.

709
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,800
I...

710
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,320
But don't worry.

711
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,510
Gossip is ever-changing.

712
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,080
Maybe in a few days,

713
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,560
this one will be replaced by another.

714
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,670
I'm sure I'm framed.

715
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,560
Su He beguiled them into believing it.

716
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,560
Don't worry about that.

717
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,600
It can't be her.

718
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,560
Though Su He did visit Commander Bai

719
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,800
a couple of days ago,

720
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,560
Commander Bai just ignored her,

721
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,510
not to mention listening to her nonsense.

722
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,880
Forget it.

723
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,750
It's not important.

724
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,160
Hu Die the Beauty.

725
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,160
I'm on duty today.

726
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,840
You're despicable.

727
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
Where does that come from?

728
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,880
You know perfectly

729
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,950
what you've done.

730
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,880
Su He already told me.

731
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,710
I knew it!

732
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,400
The game is on.

733
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,750
It's okay.

734
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,510
I'll show you

735
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,320
how to deal with

736
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,360
an angelic bitch.

737
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,880
