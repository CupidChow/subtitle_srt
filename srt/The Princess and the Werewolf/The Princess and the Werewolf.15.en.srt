194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,150
Of course I have to do something.

195
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,470
Mr. Li, let me help you.

196
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,030
Muhan, come on.

197
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,710
Muhan, come on.

198
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,000
- Come on.
- Come on.

199
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,470
What are they doing?

200
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,520
Bravo!

201
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,200
Bravo!

202
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,000
Victory belongs to Beast!

203
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,760
One point for Beast.

204
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,790
- Bravo!
- Great!

205
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,910
Ma Yingxiong, come on.

206
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,150
Another point for Beast.

207
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,080
General, what to do?

208
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,590
Right.

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,350
Easy.

210
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,110
Keep going.

211
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,280
Show them what we can do.

212
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,320
Pass it to me.

213
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,840
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

214
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,350
- Bravo!
- Great!

215
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,080
Victory belongs to Beast!

216
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

217
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,470
- Victory!
- Bravo!

218
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,110
Time's up.

219
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,710
The game is over.

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,960
The winner is

221
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,910
Daxia.

222
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,400
We won!

223
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,350
Great!

224
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,030
Amazing!

225
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,080
We won!

226
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,350
- We won!
- We won!

227
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,000
- Victory belongs to Xia!
- Victory belongs to Xia!

228
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,150
We won!

229
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,150
Daxia won!

230
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,280
Pass it to me.

231
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,110
Pass it to me.

232
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,710
Your Royal Highness.

233
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,200
It's okay

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,880
to lose the game.

235
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,640
Why does Mr. Li

236
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,710
look so much like him

237
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,550
when he asked me
to pass the ball to him today?

238
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
No way.

239
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,670
That's not how

240
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,400
he looks like now.

241
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,280
And today he was sitting on the throne.

242
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,150
I might have thought too much.

243
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,910
Your Royal Highness.

244
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,440
Your Royal Highness.

245
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,470
What?

246
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,110
It's time to go to Elder Lu
and copy scriptures.

247
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,350
I got it.

248
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,080
Her Grace is pregnant

249
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,280
and shouldn't travel far.

250
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,640
Let's stop here.

251
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,000
Your Grace.

252
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,400
Take good care of yourself.

253
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,880
After you give birth,

254
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,880
Kui Mulang will definitely

255
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,880
promise to take you back
to visit your relatives.

256
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,710
I will definitely be leaving in three months.

257
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,550
You should go.

258
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,790
Your Grace.

259
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,400
Take care.

260
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,840
General Ma.

261
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,230
Are you reluctant to part with the princess?

262
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,430
Nothing.

263
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,950
Let's go.

264
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,950
Ma Yingxiong.

265
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,640
Chun'er. Chun'er.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,040
Chun'er.

267
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,040
This is

268
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,830
what I just took the time to make.

269
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,280
Take it back to eat.

270
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,520
I won't eat this steamed bun.

271
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
I'm going to dry it out.

272
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,320
I'll look at it

273
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,510
whenever I think of you.

274
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,040
You fool.

275
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,680
I would like to be your hero,

276
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,750
and I would also like to be your fool.

277
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,560
General Ma.

278
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,800
It's being late.

279
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,840
Time to go.

280
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,040
Chun'er.

281
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,390
Her Grace said that

282
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,680
long-distance relationship also counts.

283
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,200
Ma Yingxiong left safely.

284
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
It's time to have a miscarriage now.

285
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,840
I have to think of a plan

286
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,720
and make it naturally and smoothly...

287
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,750
Your Highness.

288
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,110
You have watched the game.

289
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,800
Now, could you finally rest and
take care of yourself during pregnancy?

290
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,680
Mammy Xiong.

291
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,470
Today I haven't absorbed the essence of the nature.

292
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,750
You have already done this during the game.

293
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,040
Maybe I just yelled too hard.

294
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,320
It lost a lot now.

295
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,680
Let's go to the Imperial Garden in a while.

296
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,960
You must be tired.

297
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,110
Let's take a rest.

298
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,800
Not at all.

299
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,870
Let's continue.

300
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,630
Isn't this just an ordinary forest?

301
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,270
How can we go back to Daxia?

302
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,270
The forest looks ordinary,

303
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,990
but it is actually vast.

304
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,560
You have to walk for a long time.

305
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,680
A long time?

306
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,110
How long is it?

307
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,230
It's like

308
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,270
a long dream.

309
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,040
Haonan.

310
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,990
Why has the patrol been stepped up recently?

311
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,510
Elder Qi asked so.

312
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,600
Your Highness likes to watch the fun.

313
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,800
In order to avoid collisions,

314
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,080
we will strengthen patrols
starting today.

315
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
And no mistake is allowed.

316
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,800
Protect Her Highness.

317
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,920
Yes.

318
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,080
Haonan.

319
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,440
Just a banana peel.

320
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,270
Easy.

321
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,870
Haonan, Dayu.

322
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,630
It's fine here.

323
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Go on patrol.

324
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

325
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,510
Ma Yingxiong and the others went back?

326
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

327
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
They have left the Beast Clan.

328
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,390
Your Highness.

329
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,350
I don't want to talk to you apart from work.

330
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,470
What?

331
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,630
You want to keep an eye on me?

332
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,750
Don't I even have any freedom?

333
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,870
Your Highness, slow down.

334
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,800
Be careful with the baby.

335
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
[Yaohua Palace]

336
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:31,870
Your Highness.

337
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,390
Time for decoction.

338
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,200
Again?

339
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,840
Breakfast, lunch, dinner

340
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,990
and supper.

341
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,470
As Elder Qi asked,

342
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,320
Decoction is needed with every meal.

343
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,960
If I kept taking it like this,

344
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,390
I would have a nosebleed.

345
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,470
I don't think so.

346
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,040
Your Highness.

347
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,510
You are pregnant now.

348
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,510
And you are weak.

349
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,800
You need nutrition.

350
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,270
Yes.

351
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,680
Hongxiu.

352
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,390
Go get me some plums.

353
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,040
I am feeling sick.

354
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,510
Yes.

355
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,750
Mammy Xiong.

356
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,040
Close the door for me.

357
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,230
The wind made me a little dizzy.

358
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,720
Yes.

359
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,320
Her Highness still refuses to forgive you?

360
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,630
Isn't there three months left?

361
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,270
What's more, Her Highness is pregnant now.

362
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,870
The elders have issued an order that

363
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,600
she can't go anywhere for now.

364
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,870
That's what I am worried about.

365
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,870
I'm afraid that

366
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,510
Qi Pa will resent me even more
because of this.

367
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,150
Go and ask Elder Qi

368
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,110
to remove Mammy Xiong.

369
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,720
After all, guards have been strengthened

370
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,080
everywhere in the palace.

371
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,800
It is enough for Qi Pa to have Hongxiu with her.

372
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,600
Yes.

373
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,720
I'm on it.

374
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,440
The patrols in the palace
have been stepped up,

375
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,960
the Elders' Court has dispatched all its troops

376
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,110
to protect the Queen,

377
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,160
and the Imperial Kitchen
Is preparing meals for her.

378
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,560
[Death]
and the Imperial Kitchen is preparing meals for her.

379
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
[Death]

380
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,080
Your Royal Highness.

381
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,200
Copying scriptures is to purify the soul.

382
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,230
[Death]
Copying scriptures is to purify the soul.

383
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
Don't let anyone find out.

384
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,720
Your...

385
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,600
Royal heir again.

386
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Royal heir all the time.

387
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,870
I won't let him get what he wants.

388
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,920
Your Royal Highness.

389
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,200
I will definitely find a chance.

390
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,510
In addition to this backing,

391
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,510
I have to cultivate a person of my own

392
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,560
as soon as possible

393
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,230
A person of your own?

394
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,350
Here I am.

395
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,320
You are

396
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,200
not good enough.

397
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,920
That female killer good at disguise

398
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,960
is called Haitang, right?

399
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,750
Yes.

400
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,630
I heard Xiniang mention it before.

401
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,320
Are you interested in her?

402
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,110
Haitang's

403
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,510
repeated assassinations all failed.

404
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,440
I believe the mysterious man

405
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,440
has lost faith in her.

406
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,110
Wouldn't it be great

407
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,680
if I poach her

408
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,110
for my own use

409
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,560
at this moment?

410
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,150
Poaching?

411
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,150
I am best at it.

412
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,600
But, Your Royal Highness,

413
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,350
she has failed several times.

414
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,510
Why do you still want her?

415
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,440
You fool.

416
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,630
Failure is the mother of success.

417
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,680
I believe she's most experienced

418
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,510
in dealing with Kui Mulang.

419
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,200
And talent scout is a must.

420
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,080
Just because the mysterious man
failed to make good use of her,

421
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,270
doesn't mean I can't do it either.

422
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Your Royal Highness, you are so wise.

423
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,150
Tomorrow,

424
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,230
deliver a false message to the mysterious man.

425
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,320
Yes.

426
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
[Yaohua Palace]

427
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,150
Your Highness.

428
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,470
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

429
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,560
Why are you still here?

430
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,270
Elder Qi told me that

431
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,680
after Mammy Xiong left,

432
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,920
I have to always be vigilant

433
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,080
and pay more attention to your every move.

434
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,270
Then you can't sleep well every night.

435
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,470
Never mind.

436
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,750
Your Highness, I am willing to take care of you.

437
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,270
You are

438
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,470
now pregnant.

439
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,600
I am so happy.

440
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,870
By the way,

441
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,800
Your Highness, what do you need at this late hour?

442
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,560
Anything to eat or drink?

443
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,110
I'd like to go for a walk.

444
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,800
It's good for the baby.

445
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,150
Here, be careful.

446
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,920
It's late at night.

447
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,800
Why are there still so many soldiers patrolling?

448
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,270
It's all for you and the royal heir.

449
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,440
They work shifts day and night,

450
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,470
without a moment's rest.

451
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,320
Hongxiu.

452
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,750
Do you know someplace around here

453
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,870
that is not too low, nor too high,

454
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,800
but without

455
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,510
soldiers patrolling nearby?

456
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,200
You Highness, why are you asking this?

457
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,230
Do you know about prenatal depression?

458
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,230
Pregnant women may be
in a bad mood before delivery.

459
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,320
I need a place to hang out.

460
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,390
I have got an idea.

461
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,870
I know

462
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,080
you will never let me down.

463
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,470
Your Highness, this way.

464
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,440
Let's go.

465
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,110
Not bad.

466
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,840
It's just right.

467
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,350
Right for what?

468
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm talking about the view here.

469
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,510
Your Grace, take your time.

470
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,840
Come here.

471
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,630
Push me.

472
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,800
Your Highness.

473
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,840
In order to protect the baby,

474
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,630
I dare not push you hard.

475
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,840
I will do it gently.

476
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,510
Okay.

477
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,080
Okay?

478
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,350
Higher.

479
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,840
No way.

480
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,600
It's okay. Higher.

481
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,110
It can't be any higher.

482
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,840
Higher, please.

483
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,350
You will be in danger.

484
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,800
Why are you here?

485
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,270
What do you want to do to my child?

486
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,440
I promised you three months as the deadline.

487
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,990
But I didn't promise you

488
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,510
to keep false pregnancy during this time.

489
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,840
You are pregnant.

490
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,080
You'd better be careful.

491
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,840
If Hongxiu can't take good care of you,

492
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,750
I can ask Elder Qi

493
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,040
to arrange for Mammy Xiong to come back
and continue to take care of you.

494
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,040
No need, thank you.

495
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,960
What do you mean?

496
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,390
You won't break your promise, will you?

497
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,110
Of course I will do what I promised you.

498
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,720
But you also have to remember what you said.

499
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,990
It was you who pretended to be pregnant.

500
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm just acting with you.

501
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,560
I will send you back to rest.

502
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,390
No need.

503
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,390
I have Hongxiu with me.

504
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,600
Your Majesty, you are really nice to Her Highness.

505
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,080
Hongxiu.

506
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,840
Send my queen back to rest.

507
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,750
Yes.

508
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,150
Your Highness.

509
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,990
His Majesty is so nice to you.

510
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,390
You are right. "So nice".

511
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,510
How about

512
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,390
we keep on swinging?

513
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,110
No.

514
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,270
Let's go back.

515
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,350
Wake up.

516
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,110
Wake up.

517
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,990
Wake up. Wake up.

518
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,750
General.

519
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,630
What happened?

520
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,200
Where is Kui Mulang?

521
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,390
Where is Liu Jun?

522
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,150
Why were we all asleep?

523
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,750
General.

524
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,390
It seems to be Daxia here.

525
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,150
We're back.

526
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,270
Daxia?

527
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,510
How did we get back?

528
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,870
Do you still remember?

529
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,230
After I said goodbye to Chun'er,

530
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,720
I walked forward sadly.

531
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,600
I felt dizzy

532
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,870
and remembered nothing then.

533
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,680
General.

534
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,510
Could it be that we had a dream?

535
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,560
No way.

536
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,390
How can everyone
have the same dream?

537
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,080
But it's so weird.

538
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,040
We were in Daxia before.

539
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,040
How did we go there

540
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,720
and get back again?

541
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,390
Forget it.

542
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,510
Her Grace is still there.

543
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,230
Let's go back and report first,

544
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,840
and then come back to
find the way to the Beast Clan.

545
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

546
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,390
His Royal Highness has something to tell your Master.

547
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,870
Didn't I tell you that

548
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,680
the Master doesn't want to meet you now?

549
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
It's of great importance.

550
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,040
He said that I have to tell your Master in person.

551
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,630
Stop.

552
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,560
Master.

553
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,720
This is Eunuch Ruo who works for Jing Muhan.

554
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
He said he has something to tell you personally.

555
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,040
Eunuch Ruo.

556
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,720
Master is right in front of you.

557
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Just get to the point.

558
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,800
His Royal Highness asked me to tell you that

559
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,720
Kui Mulang has already
found out Haitang's identity.

560
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,200
You'd better expel Haitang as soon as possible

561
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,840
and discard her.

562
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,390
That's it?

563
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,960
I wanted to have that trash fend for herself.

564
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,680
Just get rid of her soon.

565
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,800
Master.

566
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,320
The Prince also wants you to know that

567
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,750
there is a way to destroy the body and traces,

568
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,680
making your subordinate disappear completely,

569
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,510
and the King will never find you.

570
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,150
