Be careful, you two.

Nothing can go wrong.

But remember, be very careful with everything.

I just didn't want to talk to you.

What's wrong?

37
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,550
You've been distracted since this morning.

38

Is His Majesty...

39
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,000
No!

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,190
How can you tell I'm distracted?

41
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't care when His Majesty gets married.

Hu Die,

43
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,910
ministers like us must do our duties.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Besides,

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,160
why do you only care about His Majesty?

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm just being unconvinced.

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm so loyal to His Majesty

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
but he never notices that.

49
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,270
All he cares about is Qi Pa
who never does anything.

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,910
Why would you care about this?

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,270
His Majesty

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,000
usually has the best poker face.

53
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,600
And when he doesn't criticize you,

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,270
it means he approves of you.

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,440
You're quite optimistic.

56
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,190
I am, of course. I...

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,320
I...

Nothing. I just can't help.

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,550
If you want someone to approve of you,

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
I'll do that.

the Imperial Jewelry Department

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
made you these new jewels at His Majesty's orders.

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
Some references were taken

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,510
from fashions in your hometown.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Look. Each piece looks wonderful.

74
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,440
Your Grace,

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,390
His Majesty is so great with you.

76
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,350
Umm, well.

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,670
I knew you would love them, Your Grace.

78
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,720
By the way,

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,000
the decoction isn't hot now.

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,760
Drink it.

81
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,070
Can I not drink it?

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,720
The baby is great now.

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,550
I don't need such a decoction.

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,230
But Elder Qi urged me

85
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,070
quite repeatedly.

86
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,640
If you don't drink it,

87
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,920
I can't account for it

88
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,880
and Elder Qi will blame me.

89
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,350
Fine, fine. I'll drink it.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,790
Look, what's that?

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,670
What?

92
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,510
That.

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh, this.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,270
It's Honk & Double Phoenix Pot.

95
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,350
His Majesty had it customized for you, Your Grace.

96
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,270
So bitter.

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,760
Your Grace,

98
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,950
according to Elder Qi,

99
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,440
this is good for the baby.

100
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,510
So, you have to bear it.

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,440
Oh.

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,550
I'm going to the Imperial Costume Department

103
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,230
and check your wedding dresses.

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,350
Your Grace, don't go anywhere.

105
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,230
Wait here for me.

106
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,790
I will.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,600
I didn't expect to get married like this.

108
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,480
Come on, Qi Pa.

109
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,670
You're getting more experience

110
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,350
in love and marriage.

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,070
Master,

112
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,070
Kui Mulang and Qi Pa are getting married.

113
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,760
The whole city is celebrating it.

114
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,640
If Haitang hadn't failed repeatedly,

115
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,110
Kui Mulang wouldn't be this smug now.

116
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,830
Eunuch Ruo contacted me,

117
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
asking to meet you.

118
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,440
Shall we ask Jing Muhan to...

119
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Let him stay put for now.

120
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,920
We failed several times.

121
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,600
Our next move has to be successful.

122
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,110
We can't rush.

123
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,230
Got it.

124
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,000
Master, what will you do with Haitang?

125
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,790
I gave her three poison needles

126
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,390
and I'll just leave her with her own.

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,480
Stewardess Hong,

128
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm here to check Her Grace's wedding dresses.

129
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,920
Stewardess Lan is working on that.

130
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,600
There she is.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Mr... Mr. Liu Jun.

132
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,670
Are you all right?

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,830
Yes.

134
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Why is Hongxiu suddenly blushing?

135
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,350
And Mr. Liu.

136
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,440
He looks a little bit weird, too.

137
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Mr. Liu,

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,880
Hongxiu is an adorable girl.

139
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,480
If you have feelings for her,

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
just hustle up.

141
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,350
I'm here to check

142
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,280
Her Grace's wedding dresses.

143
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm also here to check His Majesty's wedding robes.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,520
Some decorations aren't finished yet.

145
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,670
Mr. Liu Jun and Hongxiu,

146
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,200
you can get in and check the patterns first.

147
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,000
His Majesty's robes are in Section 1.

148
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,760
Her Grace's dresses are in Section 2.

149
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Mr. Liu Jun,

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,230
I'm done.

151
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
I should go.

152
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,590
Your Grace, what's bothering you?

153
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,200
How can you tell

154
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm bothered?

155
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,470
With my eyes.

156
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
Your Grace, I've never seen

157
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,110
such a sad look on your face.

158
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,110
Is it because you have to marry Kui Mulang?

159
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't be so gossipy.

160
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,320
What? If I don't want to marry him,

161
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,840
what tricks can you offer?

162
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,230
I'm here

163
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,550
just to discuss this with you.

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
There's a rumor going

165
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,910
that you're pregnant.

166
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
Is that true?

167
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,910
Or did Kui Mulang lie just to marry you?

168
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,550
You know.

169
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,350
I mean everything good for you.

170
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,590
So, you can tell me the truth.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
A prince like you

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,350
really wants to give your king a hard time.

173
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,400
You take every chance to play dirty.

174
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,470
That's not true, Your Grace.

175
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,470
I'm thinking for your benefit.

176
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,110
And I don't want my brother

177
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,030
to make mistakes over and over again.

178
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,520
I don't know what you're up to.

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,030
But anyway, don't try to help this time.

180
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,960
I have to

181
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
marry him.

182
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,280
Your Grace,

183
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,910
I know you don't want to marry him.

184
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,590
I can help you contact Ma Yingxiong.

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,440
Then we can...

186
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,200
Forget it.

187
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,550
We once worked together.

188
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,550
But we can't outfox Kui Mulang.

189
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,710
Giving up already?

190
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm not giving up.

191
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,640
I never mean to run away from the wedding.

192
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,880
I know exactly

193
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,710
that I can't go home on my own.

194
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,110
And this time,

195
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,200
instead of protecting myself,

196
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm trying to protect Ma Yingxiong and his men.

197
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,150
But Your Grace, listen.

198
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,790
We can...

199
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,550
Come on. Stop trying to persuade me.

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,710
Jing Muhan,

201
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,790
let me give you some sincere advice.

202
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,960
Five years ago, you made a big scene

203
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,400
but you failed.

204
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,150
So, I advise you

205
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,080
to let go of your hatred.

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,550
He's your elder brother, after all.

207
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,000
And you are

208
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
far inferior to him.

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,910
Why?

210
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,200
Even Qi Pa despises me!

211
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,200
Why?

212
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,230
Calm down, Your Royal Highness.

213
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,960
The mysterious man contacted me.

214
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,280
He asked me to bring you a message.

215
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,760
What message?

216
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,000
He said,

217
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,910
Kui Mulang is looking into this deeply

218
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,080
and you should stay put.

219
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,320
When the time is right,

220
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,400
we can take action.

221
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,790
Stay put. Stay put!

222
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,640
Everyone wants to manipulate me.

223
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,320
Why must I be manipulated?

224
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,710
I used to be thinking about revenge.

225
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,590
The mysterious man helped me out

226
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,440
and I thought he would assist me.

227
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,230
But turns out

228
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,790
I'm only a tool of his!

229
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,470
Kui Mulang, Qi Pa, and the mysterious man...

230
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,320
You all think I'm useless, huh?

231
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,590
I'll prove it to you.

232
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,030
Have you found the woman who impersonated Chun'er?

233
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,880
We sent more men for the search

234
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,960
but haven't found her yet.

235
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Qi Pa is from another state

236
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,550
and she has no enemy here.

237
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,110
But that woman assassinated her several times.

238
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,590
She was coming after me.

239
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,710
And she must be

240
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,350
very familiar with Qi Pa,

241
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,350
so that she knew Qi Pa and Ma Yingxiong

242
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,910
were planning to escape.

243
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,590
The one behind her

244
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,550
knows a lot about the Palace

245
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
and colludes with some outsiders.

246
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,470
Liu Jun, who do you think he is?

247
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,470
This man is rather ambitious

248
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,590
and he knows so much about the Palace.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
Can it be...

250
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,110
Brother!

251
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,790
I'm here to see you.

252
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,470
There he comes.

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,550
Please come in, Your Royal Highness.

254
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,590
I have something to tell my brother.

255
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,910
I'll leave you alone, Your Majesty.

256
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,590
And I'll be waiting out there,

257
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,200
at your service.

258
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,150
What did you come for?

259
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,590
Why am I not invited to your wedding?

260
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,350
You're a sinner.

261
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,230
At such a grand royal ceremony,

262
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,880
you shouldn't be present.

263
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,470
Why not?

264
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm your brother of the same mother

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,670
and the prince of our clan!

266
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,590
You still know you're the prince?

267
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,200
Think about what you've done lately.

268
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,200
Do you deserve this title?

269
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
What did I do?

270
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,110
What did you do?

271
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,670
Someone in the Palace tipped off the assassin.

272
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,230
Or how could she know Qi Pa's whereabouts?

273
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,400
Five years ago, you colluded
with that mysterious man.

274
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,670
And now, his lackeys

275
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,440
are messing in the Palace.

276
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,790
You know what you exactly did.

277
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,520
Kui Mulang,

278
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,760
you just don't trust me.

279
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,000
Indeed, five years ago, I lost my mind

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,230
and made that huge mistake.

281
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,000
But now, I've lost my martial arts

282
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,590
and I have no power at all.

283
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,440
Every day, I live a secluded life in the Palace.

284
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
You can't blame me

285
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,710
for what has happened lately

286
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,880
just because I made a mistake before!

287
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,790
Still denying?

288
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,790
I didn't do that! Why would I not deny it?

289
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,640
But you, my brother,

290
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,470
what you're doing makes no sense at all.

291
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,880
Qi Pa struggled several times.

292
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,350
Obviously, she doesn't want to marry you.

293
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,430
Why are you so obsessed with her

294
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,950
instead of letting her go?

295
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,110
There must be some dark secret, I'm afraid.

296
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,070
Do you know what you're talking about?

297
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,520
If you dare to be offensive again,

298
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,190
get back to the Forbidden Area!

299
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,880
Look at you, all mighty and powerful, Brother!

300
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,470
I'm your younger brother

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,830
but you keep me like a prisoner.

302
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm a prince.

303
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,190
Yet no one respects me.

304
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,070
Jing Muhan,

305
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,310
why do you still not understand?

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,680
You created this situation on your own.

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,280
I don't want to see you anymore.

308
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Out you go.

309
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,680
You!

310
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,560
Brother, I beg you.

311
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,190
Spare my life, please.

312
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,520
I don't think I can still keep you alive.

313
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,280
Brother, I...

314
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,430
I won't tell anyone about this.

315
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,280
Brother...

316
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,070
Brother...

317
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,470
Your Majesty!

318
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,560
He...

319
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,950
Your Majesty,

320
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,350
your mask...

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,830
You know what you should do.

322
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,590
Next time, I won't show any mercy.

323
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,350
You can't let him go, Your Majesty.

324
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,590
Liu Jun,

325
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,070
take him back to his chamber.

326
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,950
Have his chamber heavily guarded

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,640
and no one can get in or out.

328
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,280
Aye.

329
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,190
What...

330
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,950
Lu!

331
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,080
Liu Jun,

332
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,320
how daring you are!

333
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,560
How could you march His Royal Highness?

334
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,800
Elder Lu,

335
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,440
His Royal Highness made a wild claim

336
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,040
and slandered His Majesty in his chamber.

337
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,080
That's why His Majesty ordered me to march him.

338
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,870
Muhan,

339
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,560
what on earth happened?

340
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,840
Why did you always make trouble?

341
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,560
Lu,

342
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,870
help me!

343
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,680
- But...
- Elder,

344
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,630
I'm ordered to march His Royal Highness.

345
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,800
Lu,

346
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
my brother is getting married.

347
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,270
He invited everyone in the Palace

348
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,320
except me.

349
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,150
I was so angry that I argued with him.

350
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,630
Unexpectedly, he tortured me like this.

351
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,440
Is that so?

352
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,270
Don't march him, then.

353
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,990
Go to the Elders' Court with me.

354
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,350
When I'm around,

355
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,350
no one dares to march you.

356
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,350
Let him go!

357
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Go.

358
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,350
That's what happened.

359
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,270
I agree with His Majesty on this matter.

360
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,080
But I think

361
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,920
Muhan has the right
to attend His Majesty's wedding.

362
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,600
It's also an opportunity

363
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,600
for them to thaw relations.

364
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,200
Your attitude will count,

365
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,270
Elder Qin.

366
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,470
I'll...

367
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,990
- You can't abstain.
- You can't abstain.

368
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,470
Then let's do it the same old way.

369
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,080
All right.

370
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,600
Done. Two to one.

371
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,440
Jing Muhan can't attend His Majesty's wedding.

372
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,750
Jing Muhan,

373
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,920
you're so incorrigible.

374
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,750
Grounding you seems to be not enough.

375
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,270
Thank you for understanding, Elders.

376
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm taking His Royal Highness back.

377
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,600
Take him away.

378
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,600
Aye.

379
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,990
But...

380
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,680
- Get up.
- Lu!

381
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,990
Lu, help me! Lu!

382
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,080
Help me, Lu!

383
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,630
Go.

384
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
Lu!

385
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,150
- Help me!
- You...

386
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,470
Mr. Liu Jun ordered

387
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
that this chamber should be heavily guarded

388
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,870
and nothing should go wrong.

389
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,720
Aye.

390
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,560
How's this different from being imprisoned?

391
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,960
His Majesty is so ruthless.

392
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,040
He strangled you that hard.

393
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,350
This is just a small punishment.

394
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,320
Kui Mulang,

395
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,800
you didn't invite me

396
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,350
to your wedding, huh?

397
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,470
Even if you did now, I wouldn't go.

398
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,870
I promise your wedding will be a disaster.

399
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,320
Your Royal Highness, now that you know

400
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,800
what His Majesty really is,

401
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,350
why didn't you expose him in front of the Elders?

402
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,150
Don't be silly.

403
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,110
When Elders know,

404
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,040
even for the sake of our clan,

405
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,800
they would help Kui Mulang.

406
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,600
That's not what I expect.

407
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,630
What are you gonna do, then?

408
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,150
At this wedding, I'm gonna

409
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,960
reveal what he really is.

410
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,320
By then,

411
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,200
everyone will know

412
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
that he's a monster.

413
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,920
Guess how he'll end up.

414
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,920
But Your Royal Highness,

415
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,150
you can't even leave your chamber now.

416
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
How could you do that?

417
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,560
I've got a plan.

418
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,750
What plan?

419
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,750
You have the earthworm bloodline

420
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,630
and you can go anywhere, right?

421
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,110
Don't worry, Your Royal Highness.

422
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,080
If you give me a chance,

423
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,680
I'll tunnel a way

424
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,040
out of the Palace.

425
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,110
The city walls are as hard as rock.

426
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,110
I don't think you can easily make it.

427
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,350
Your Royal Highness,

428
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,870
trust me for this once.

429
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,600
Speaking of tunneling,

430
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
no one in our clan

431
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,840
can be superior to me.

432
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,200
Rest assured.

433
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,390
Your Royal Highness,

434
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,230
apply the ointment

435
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,630
and leave the rest to me.

436
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,600
It's finally done.

437
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
[Beast City]

438
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,390
Take the dishes away.

439
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,270
I don't have an appetite.

440
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,440
Your Grace,

441
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,560
have something to eat, more or less.

442
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,230
The wedding will be held tonight.

443
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,800
And that requires strength.

444
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,470
If you don't eat, you can't keep it up.

445
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,150
Come on, Cutie.

446
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,390
I just want some peace.

447
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,630
The wedding will be tonight and I'm nervous.

448
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,750
But...

449
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
Fine, then.

450
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,470
Your Grace, after you chill out,

451
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,350
do eat something.

452
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,630
I will. Out you go.

453
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,110
Mother said,

454
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,630
the most difficult thing to accept

455
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,990
is the reality.

456
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,150
Qi Pa,

457
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,560
accept that.

458
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,270
Your Grace.

459
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,510
Your Grace.

460
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,630
What are you doing here?

461
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,960
Your wedding will be tonight.

462
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,510
I'm here to check on you.

463
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,720
What?

464
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,750
Feeling happy for your king?

465
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,560
You're such a good tool for him.

466
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,560
And now, I have to marry him.

467
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,750
I know you're still angry with me.

468
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,230
I'm just here to tell you

469
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,350
that after His Majesty marries you,

470
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,470
he'll give you everything he has.

471
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,470
Why can you give this promise for him?

472
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,150
Because I've known him for many years.

473
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,680
I know

474
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,200
you haven't fully accepted him.

475
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,750
But he will give you

476
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,680
all that he has.

477
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,630
Sorry, but I don't care.

478
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,600
Time will prove everything.

479
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,270
Your Grace,

480
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,470
actually,

481
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,390
you can rely on His Majesty in this city.

482
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,230
My mother has told me

483
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,990
that I could only rely on myself.

484
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,800
No other people

485
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,510
can be trusted or relied on.

486
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,870
No matter who they are

487
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,630
or what they promise me.

488
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,630
However hard you try to convince me,

489
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,200
I won't think I can

490
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,390
rely on Kui Mulang.

491
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,600
Li,

492
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,110
I know you want to be his lobbyist.

493
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,200
But from this day on,

494
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,680
I don't want to hear even a single word from you.

495
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,320
Out you go.

496
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,870
Your Royal Highness.

497
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,870
What were you doing?

498
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,200
I've tunneled out.

499
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,510
You can leave the Palace now.

500
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Done already?

501
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Did you not sleep last night?

502
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,630
In case your plan is held up,

503
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,110
I didn't sleep last night.

504
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,680
I kept digging and digging.

505
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Now, I've tunneled out.

506
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,800
You're loyal to me.

507
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,200
Did you just get that?

508
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,200
If I manage to supplant Kui Mulang,

509
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
you'll be the most meritorious guy.

510
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,200
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

511
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,440
Will Ma Yingxiong

512
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,470
also attend the wedding?

513
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,080
Yes.

514
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,200
Punished by Elder Qi,

515
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,150
he's planting trees behind the hill.

516
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,870
He's a mindless soldier

517
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,440
and I can meet him.

518
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,960
Your Royal Highness,

519
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,510
come, please.

520
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,920
You have really hard work, General.

521
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,390
Not at all.

522
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,920
As long as I can always taste
the steamed buns you make,

523
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,230
even planting a thousand trees

524
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,800
wouldn't be a problem.

525
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,800
This is just an ordinary steamed bun.

526
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,320
You flattered me.

527
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,600
It isn't just a steamed bun.

528
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,150
It's the best steamed bun

529
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,920
I've ever had in my life.

530
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,470
I wish I could eat it all my life!

531
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,870
What... What are you talking about?

532
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,320
Some porridge is being boiled in the cooker.

533
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,470
I should go check it.

534
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,870
You quite enjoy planting trees, Ma Yingxiong.

535
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,350
What a beggar!

536
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,920
You!

537
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,150
Don't try to butter me up.

538
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,630
I really can't give you this steamed bun.

539
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,470
Who's a beggar?

540
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,840
I'm the prince of the Beast Clan.

541
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,440
Prince?

542
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,270
Exactly.

543
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm Kui Mulang's own brother,

544
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,870
Jing Muhan.

545
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,440
What do you want me for?

546
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,750
To save your life,

547
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,200
Qi Pa will marry Kui Mulang.

548
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,270
Can you just leave without feeling guilty?

549
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,510
Stop this sarcasm!

550
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,350
I definitely want to take Her Grace back home!

551
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,470
But I'm afraid you can't

552
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,350
take her away on your own.

553
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,200
You!

554
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,800
Be patient, General Ma.

555
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,750
I'm here

556
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,200
just to help you.

557
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,920
But you're Kui Mulang's brother.

558
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,470
How would you help me?

559
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,750
Then why do you think

560
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,960
you came to this place

561
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
for no reason?

562
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
It's me

563
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,200
who advised your princess
in the most difficult of times.

564
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,680
That's why Kui Mulang brought you here.

565
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,750
So,

566
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,560
you're our savior, huh?

567
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,080
Not at all, General.

568
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,750
I just helped in the case of injustice.

569
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,870
I didn't want your princess to risk her life

570
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,440
just for my brother's poor behavior.

571
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,920
How are you going to help Her Grace, then?

572
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,630
Kui Mulang wears a cloak
and a mask in front of everyone

573
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,200
instead of showing his face.

574
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,440
Do you know why?

575
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,470
Because it's your tradition, isn't it?

576
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,200
No.

577
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,110
There's something else.

578
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,200
Because Kui Mulang is

579
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,320
too disgusting to be seen.

580
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,510
Before you can take away Qi Pa,

581
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,800
you have to bring him under control.

582
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,600
How can I?

583
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,040
By revealing his true face to my clansmen.

584
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,080
Are you saying...

585
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,720
Yes.

586
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,990
As long as you bring him under control,

587
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,230
I can take you out of this kingdom.

588
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,320
At tonight's wedding,

589
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,960
you and I will play the ruse of self-injury.

590
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,990
Then Kui Mulang can be attacked from both sides.

591
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,350
That's the opportune moment.

592
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,840
Your Majesty,

593
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,080
it is time.

594
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,560
There you go, Your Majesty.

595
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,600
It's your wedding night.

596
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,390
Smile, Your Highness.

597
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,720
What did you just call me?

598
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,840
Your Grace for the moment.

599
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,230
After the wedding, it'll be "Your Highness".

600
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,800
Your Grace,

601
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,160
it's almost time. We should go.

602
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,400

Elder Qi, look.

623
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,120
Oh, Muhan.

624
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,040
My sweetheart.

you can't marry him!

627
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,470
Ma Yingxiong, what are you doing?

628
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,800
Brother, help me!

629
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,230
Put your dagger down!

630
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Let go of Her Grace!

631
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,950
Or I would kill your prince!

632
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,840
Kill him if you can.

633
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,910
Chill out.

634
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,880
This is your prince.

Liu Jun?

638
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,950
Look. Isn't it Liu Jun?

639
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,190
How come it's Liu Jun?

640
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,120
Jing Muhan,

641
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,640
His Majesty knew you would do something.

642
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,470
So, he prepared this.

643
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,950
Take Jing Muhan away.

644
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,990
Ma Yingxiong will also be jailed for the moment.

645
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,750
Aye.

646
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,750
Muhan!

647
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,120
Go away!

648
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,470
Muhan...

649
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,600
Sorry to have scared you, Your Highness.

650
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,230
His Majesty knew

651
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,400
Jing Muhan would rip off his cloak at the wedding.

652
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,470
But our clan has some traditions.

653
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,950
If the king's face is seen by his clansmen,

654
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,120
bad luck will be brought to all of them.

655
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,320
To prevent this misfortune

656
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,470
from happening at the wedding,

657
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,470
His Majesty used this plan.

658
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,990
He didn't have another choice.

659
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,800
Please understand, Your Highness.

660
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,560
