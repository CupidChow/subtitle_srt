[Episode 24]

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,310
Sister-in-law.

19
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,440
Long time no see.

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,720
I wonder if you are free

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,160
to catch up with me?

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,680
Maybe I have some special news to tell you.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
Hongxiu.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,550
Are you going to decoct medicine?

25
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,950
Your Highness...

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,040
Never mind.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,440
Go.

28
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,680
What's the news?

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
I have a message

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,830
about Kui Mulang and Mr. Li.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,030
Have you always believed that

32
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,360
they are two different people?

33
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,520
What do you mean?

34
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,080
They are the same person.

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,630
Jing Muhan.

36
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,000
I know you and Kui Mulang
have always been at odds.

37
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,830
But you don't need to make up

38
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,520
such a lie to fool me.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,320
I won't believe you.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,030
Whether this is a lie or not,

41
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,360
please let me continue,

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
and you can judge.

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Think about it.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,910
Have you ever seen these two
appear at the same time?

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Bai Ke, Hu Die and others

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,910
have been in the palace for so many years.

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,630
Ask them

48
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,600
when the King is looking for guards.

49
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,960
Li Xiong suddenly appeared out of thin air.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,160
Kui Mulang is always so cautious.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,550
How could he trust

52
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,000
this confidant so easily?

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Kui Mulang usually

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,190
wears a cloak and mask.

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
But I know

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,960
it's because his looks change.

57
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,320
Sometimes he's Li Xiong,

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,360
and sometimes he looks different
from ordinary people.

59
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:26,470
So Kui Mulang has two faces.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,550
How do you

61
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,000
know this?

62
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,630
I have my way.

63
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,550
If you don't believe me,

64
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,800
verify it yourself.

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,270
Isn't Li Xiong seriously injured?

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,830
Kui Mulang has been lying to you,

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,240
and has completely kept you in the dark.

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,350
Kui Mulang and Li Xiong

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,040
are the same person.

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,390
It's because his looks change.

71
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,760
Sometimes he's Li Xiong,

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
and sometimes he looks different
from ordinary people.

73
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,320
Your Highness.

74
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,200
Your Highness.

75
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,670
What did His Royal Highness tell you?

76
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,000
You've been out of your mind since you came back.

77
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,270
Nothing.

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,110
Your Highness.

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,920
Your eyes...

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,070
I can see now.

81
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,880
Really?

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,950
Great!

83
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm going to tell His Majesty now.

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,510
Wait.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
I want to tell him myself

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,270
to surprise him.

87
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,670
Also,

88
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,510
don't tell anyone

89
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,920
about my recovery.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,440
Yes.

91
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,720
Send me back to Kui Mulang's chamber first.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,670
Time for medicine.

93
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Open your mouth.

94
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,920
How is it?

95
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,040
Are your eyes feeling better?

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,110
I've taken so many medicines
and still didn't get better.

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,320
Don't worry.

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,950
Take your time.

99
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,920
Now that the toxin has been cleared,

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,390
you will recover your eyesight
sooner or later.

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,880
Kui Mulang.

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,270
Forgive me for pretending to be blind
and lying to you now.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,790
If I verify that

104
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,670
what Jing Muhan said is a lie,

105
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,110
I will apologize to you.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,390
Are you tired?

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,110
Would you like to go to bed

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,830
or listen to stories?

109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,480
No need.

110
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,480
I want to go to bed early.

111
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,480
Okay.

112
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,070
Thank you.

113
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,790
I told you that

114
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,000
never say thank you to me.

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,350
Let me help you.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Okay.

117
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,510
Since Jing Muhan said that

118
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,000
Kui Mulang looks different day and night,

119
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
I will stay up all night

120
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,720
to see if he will change.

121
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,670
I have prepared some medicine and food for you.

122
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,040
Rest here for a few days to recuperate.

123
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,830
If the medicine is bitter,

124
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,390
eat a candied fruit first.

125
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,720
You brought me pills,

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,790
so how could it be bitter?

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,280
Then eat it as a snack.

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,710
If you don't like it, just throw it away.

129
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
I'll remember

130
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,230
all your kindness to me.

131
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,400
It's not kindness at all.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
We are partners.

133
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,440
But I will never

134
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,710
leave you alone.

135
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,670
This time Qi Pa and Kui Mulang escaped,

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,910
and we fell short.

137
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
They didn't suspect you, did they?

138
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,470
Alright.

139
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,150
Now is not the time to talk about this.

140
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,640
Rest at ease.

141
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,110
And let's talk about it later.

142
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,520
Stop here.

143
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,440
Haitang.

144
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,230
I didn't expect you to be so lucky.

145
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,280
You are the subordinate
of the mysterious man.

146
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,520
You are Jing Muhan.

147
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
My master is right to be worried.

148
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,830
If you fools

149
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,320
are captured alive by Kui Mulang's man,

150
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,920
he will be implicated.

151
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,950
I was abandoned by him.

152
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,000
Now that I survived,

153
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,750
it's none of his business what I do.

154
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,630
Haitang.

155
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,560
Let's not talk about this.

156
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
I want to see your Lord.

157
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,560
You?

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,950
For what?

159
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,560
I know a secret about Kui Mulang.

160
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
And I'm sure

161
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,920
he's interested.

162
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,950
Okay.

163
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,630
But remember,

164
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,000
no tricks.

165
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,320
Otherwise...

166
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,950
Don't worry.

167
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,320
Now Haitang and I have been exposed,

168
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,950
and we are completely passive.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
And I'm not that stupid.

170
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Good.

171
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,320
How is it?

172
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,830
Your Majesty.

173
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,710
I followed Jing Muhan and Eunuch Ruo

174
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,040
to a remote small house

175
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,240
outside the city,

176
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,680
where Haitang

177
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,710
was hiding.

178
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,070
Haitang and Jing Muhan
are indeed working together.

179
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,480
But unfortunately,

180
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,510
I was found out.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,510
When we were fighting, there was a rescuer.

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,320
I...

183
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,710
I failed to catch them.

184
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,800
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,270
It's my fault.

186
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,270
Please punish me.

187
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,150
Get up.

188
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,070
Here.

189
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,560
You are injured?

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
I was hit by a poisonous needle.

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,150
But Liu Jun has helped me

192
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,360
remove the toxins from my body.

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,750
I am fine now.

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,190
That's good.

195
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,560
You were all alone.

196
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,070
I will never blame you.

197
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,750
Anyway, we didn't

198
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,440
get nothing this time.

199
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,800
At least Jing Muhan

200
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
has no way to return to the palace now.

201
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,750
The enemies in the palace have been wiped out.

202
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,750
Have you seen the appearance

203
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,480
of the person who rescued Jing Muhan?

204
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,560
Yes.

205
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,800
You know what to do next.

206
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,070
Understood.

207
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,320
Go.

208
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,070
It seems that the person who helped Jing Muhan

210
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,710
and used him five years ago

211
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,440
has made another move.

212
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,510
Your Majesty.

213
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,800
No worries.

214
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,800
I let him escape five years ago.

215
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,830
This time

216
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,390
I will definitely catch them all.

217
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,190
I don't worry about

218
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,560
anything else

219
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,950
but your health.

220
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,510
No worries.

221
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,000
I will never fall

222
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,750
before the villains are completely eradicated,

223
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,190
absolutely not.

224
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,830
Bai Ke.

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,070
Hu Die.

226
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,800
What happened?

227
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,480
I am on duty.

228
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,830
I have to go.

229
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,440
Stop.

230
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
You won't get away with this.

231
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,120
Don't you even have time

232
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,070
to talk to me?

233
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,320
I do.

234
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,950
But His Majesty asked me to...

235
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,440
What are you hiding?

236
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,040
Nothing.

237
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,560
Take it out. I've seen it.

238
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,750
Are you injured?

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
No.

240
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,920
It's the medicine to reduce internal heat.

241
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,480
[External application]

242
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,240
Do you think everyone is as illiterate as you?

243
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,440
Where did you get hurt?

244
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,320
Say it.

245
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,560
What happened?

246
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,440
Enough.

247
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,040
You've known it.

248
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,150
Why are you still pushing me?

249
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,800
I...

250
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,630
I didn't tell you just to save face.

251
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,680
I didn't complete the task assigned by His Majesty,

252
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
I didn't catch them,

253
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,510
and even my leg was injured.

254
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,040
What a fool.

255
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,560
Yes, I am a fool.

256
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,510
No...

257
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,320
You don't need to remind me.

258
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,270
This is the best trauma medicine I've ever used.

259
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,070
Take good use of it.

260
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,360
Don's waste it.

261
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,120
Someone you can't even catch

262
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,830
must be extremely difficult to deal with.

263
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,880
There won't be another person

264
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,710
in the entire Beast Clan

265
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,040
who can catch him.

266
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,480
You fool.

267
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,360
[Trauma Medicine]

268
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,880
He's still Kui Mulang,

269
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,630
and nothing has changed.

270
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,070
Could it be that...?

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
What Jing Muhan said turned out to be true.

272
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,510
Kui Mulang and Li Xiong are the same person.

273
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,710
No wonder...

274
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,560
No wonder I always feel

275
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,480
many similarities between the two.

276
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,880
Come have breakfast.

277
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,880
I asked Chun'er to make steamed buns for you.

278
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,960
Qi Pa...

279
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,470
Why are you lying to me?

280
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,150
Kui Mulang.

281
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,440
As expected...

282
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,150
Can you see now?

283
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,320
Who exactly are you?

284
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,270
Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,990
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

286
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,630
would you continue lying to me?

287
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,840
Qi Pa.

288
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,390
Let me explain.

289
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,750
Are you still trying to lie to me?

290
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,470
I just want to know

291
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,040
what all this is about.

292
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,350
Okay.

293
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,870
I will tell you everything.

294
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,270
Beast Clan has a Holy Spring.

295
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,990
I need to keep transfusing internal force into it

296
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,920
to ensure the health of my people.

297
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,440
But my internal force will also be depleted.

298
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,230
Just a few years ago,

299
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,870
due to excessive depletion of my internal force,

300
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,680
I became

301
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,750
the way you saw me

302
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,230
at night.

303
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
This is the case with
all the kings of the Beast Clan.

304
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,720
We can only hide our appearance

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,750
with hoods and masks.

306
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
This is the top secret in our clan.

307
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,110
Only Liu Jun by my side

308
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,600
knew about it by chance.

309
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,470
Now you know it too.

310
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,150
So you look like Li Xiong

311
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,800
during the day,

312
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,680
and become Kui Mulang at night.

313
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,630
I wanted to face you

314
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,600
with my true face.

315
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,510
But that day you suddenly rushed into my palace

316
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,080
and saw my appearance at night.

317
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,840
Monster!

318
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
I had no choice

319
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,200
but to

320
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,800
face you with two appearances and two identities

321
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,680
during the day and night.

322
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,920
I should have thought of that.

323
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,270
You and Kui Mulang have never
appeared at the same time.

324
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,440
I once felt that

325
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,600
at some point

326
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,870
you were somewhat similar to Kui Mulang.

327
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,110
I always thought it was my imagination.

328
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,470
I forgave you

329
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,320
when you lied to me that

330
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,510
you were the Shadow Guard of Daxia.

331
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,390
I trust you so much.

332
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,230
But you take me for a fool.

333
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,350
No, Qi Pa.

334
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,920
Don't touch me.

335
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,990
Why did you try so hard

336
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,800
to bring me here

337
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,990
from Daxia?

338
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,470
Why me?

339
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,560
Five years ago,

340
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,230
I was looking for

341
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,920
an arcana called the Holy Pearl.

342
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
But when I just found it,

343
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
my own brother

344
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,150
ambushed me with hidden troops,
dealing a heavy blow to me.

345
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
I was then injured too badly,

346
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,920
and unexpectedly came

347
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,040
to your hometown Daxia.

348
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,110
It was there that I first met you.

349
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,920
I see.

350
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,230
You told me such a big lie

351
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,960
just for the Holy Pearl, right?

352
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,390
At first, yes.

353
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,750
Then why don't you just kill me

354
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,840
and take away the Holy Pearl?

355
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,800
According to the "Ancient History of the Beast",

356
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,320
in order to obtain the Holy Pearl,

357
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
one must be deep in love with the beloved one

358
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,600
and get her true love's kiss.

359
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,390
I see.

360
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,350
I finally understand that

361
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,800
both Li Xiong and Kui Mulang's efforts

362
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,510
to please me and treat me well

363
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,990
are all fake.

364
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,150
It's all because of my self-approbation.

365
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,510
I think about you day and night.

366
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,920
What a joke.

367
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,920
It's not like this, Qi Pa.

368
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,110
I really adore you.

369
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,920
You adore me?

370
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,630
It's just for the Holy Pearl.

371
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,840
I love you

372
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,800
not because of the Holy Pearl.

373
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,750
Then prove me.

374
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,630
I want to go back to Daxia.

375
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,150
I want to go home.

376
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,720
Let's never see each other again.

377
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,680
You really don't want to see me again?

378
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,270
No.

379
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,080
Never.

380
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,320
Never again.

381
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,600
Okay.

382
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,080
I will take you back to Daxia
early tomorrow morning.

383
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,150
Just tonight.

♪I don't deserve to be forgiven♪ ♪Forgiven you♪

395
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,350
Did I crush him to death?

396
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,630
Why so heavy?

397
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,920
Right!

398
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,390
Where is he?

399
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,470
Your Highness.

400
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,630
What's wrong with you?

401
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,510
Why are you crying?

402
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,920
What happened?

403
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,800
You've never been like this

404
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,470
since you came to Beast Clan.

405
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,110
Tell me

406
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,270
what happened.

407
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,080
Have you ever been cheated

408
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,390
by the beloved one?

409
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,870
Did His Majesty lie to you?

410
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,270
Not him.

411
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,080
Yes...

412
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,200
It's him.

413
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,960
How come?

414
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,990
It is impossible for His Majesty to lie to you.

415
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,600
Everyone in the palace

416
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,990
knows how much he loves you.

417
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,040
He doesn't love me at all.

418
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,680
He's just using me.

419
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,390
Your Highness.

420
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,320
Although I don't know

421
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,600
what happened

422
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,150
between you and His Majesty,

423
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,270
you still have me.

424
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,560
I will always support you.

425
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,750
Hongxiu.

426
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,470
You're the first person I met in the Beast Clan.

427
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,990
I admit that at first I always wanted to leave,

428
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,150
and to get rid of you.

429
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,350
But unconsciously,

430
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,350
I have regarded you as my closest friend.

431
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,110
I hope you can take good care of yourself.

432
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,350
Your Highness.

433
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,720
Why did you say that?

434
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,110
I don't belong here.

435
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,720
I thought I found true love.

436
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,680
I was even starting to like this place.

437
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,110
But I didn't expect that

438
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,800
all this was just a scam.

439
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,470
It's time for me to go back

440
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,840
to where I belong.

441
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,390
Where are you going?

442
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,960
Don't leave.

443
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,680
I don't want you to go.

444
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,150
Hongxiu.

445
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,840
I'll only suffer more if I stay here.

446
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,470
Well...

447
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,270
Will I

448
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,470
never see you again?

449
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,630
Perhaps.

450
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,560
Your Highness.

451
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,510
Can you promise me

452
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,150
not to forget me?

453
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,960
You may be so busy when you go back that

454
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
you don't have time to think about me.

455
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,920
But if you see a kitten on the street

456
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,750
and think of me once in a while,

457
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,680
that's enough for me.

458
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,200
Silly girl.

459
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,320
I will never forget you.

460
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,110
Your Majesty.

461
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,560
What happened?

462
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,470
Qi Pa knew everything.

463
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,920
I shouldn't have brought her here by force.

464
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,600
I shouldn't have lied to her,

465
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,680
and I shouldn't have escaped again and again.

466
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,960
But, Your Majesty,

467
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,560
you have your own reasons.

468
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,350
Reasons?

469
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,840
That's just an excuse.

470
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,600
I don't want to lie to Qi Pa anymore.

471
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,800
I want to set her free.

472
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,440
Your Majesty,

473
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,750
Are you going to send Her Highness back?

474
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,630
Tonight,

475
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,560
I will send Qi Pa back to Daxia.

476
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,390
Your Majesty.

477
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,840
Think carefully about this.

478
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,080
So you are the mysterious man?

479
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,680
It's been five years.

480
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,870
You never show your true colors

481
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,840
in front of me.

482
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,080
I didn't expect that

483
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,350
we would meet here today.

484
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,560
Haitang.

485
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,750
You are so lucky.

486
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,800
Now you've got a new master.

487
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,630
Jing Muhan and I

488
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,560
are just partners.

489
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,870
He is not my master.

490
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,920
Your Royal Highness.

491
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,560
Now you are desperate and come to me.

492
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,080
How about using Haitang's life

493
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,840
as a bargaining chip

494
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,080
to show your sincerity?

495
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,800
Your Royal Highness.

496
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,630
Your Royal Highness, what do you think?

497
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,350
I don't agree.

498
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,560
At present, the strength of Kui Mulang

499
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,630
is obviously higher than ours.

500
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,390
So internal friction doesn't make any sense.

501
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,270
It was because of Haitang

502
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
that I learned

503
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,510
a shocking secret about Kui Mulang.

504
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:30,920
Of course.

505
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,320
If you think

506
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,440
it is a good deal,

507
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,350
I can use this secret

508
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,080
as a bargaining chip.

509
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
And I have learned

510
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,560
how to use this secret

511
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,320
to take down Kui Mulang
in one fell swoop.

512
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,800
Then show me

513
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,080
if it's a good deal.

514
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,080
Your Majesty.

515
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,040
Now that you are so weak,

516
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,510
you really can't take it anymore.

517
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,040
And you are even sending Her Highness back.

518
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,270
Without the Holy Pearl,

519
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
I'm worried that your days are numbered.

520
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,560
Does Her Highness know this?

521
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,960
If she knows,

522
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,960
would she still insist on leaving you?

523
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,720
Without the Holy Pearl,

524
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,270
Kui Mulang will die?

525
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,960
I will not make any unreasonable demands

526
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,470
on Qi Pa again.

527
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,080
Never mention the Holy Pearl to me.

528
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,270
Your Majesty.

529
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,080
Liu Jun.

530
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,800
Do me a favor.

531
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,470
If I really leave unfortunately,

532
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,440
urge those elders

533
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,560
to choose a wise person

534
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,270
to take up the burden of Beast Clan.

535
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,440
I will only follow you

536
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,390
in my life,

537
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
and I will never betray you.

538
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,990
I know.

539
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,960
Go get prepared.

540
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,720
Leave me alone.

541
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,350
Yes.

542
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,870
Kui Mulang.

543
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
You lied to me again.

544
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,320
Your Highness.

545
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,630
Why are you here?

546
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,270
Are you really going to leave?

547
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,630
Tell me the truth.

548
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,840
Kui Mulang will die without the Holy Pearl, right?

549
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,080
You just heard it?

550
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,470
So it's true.

551
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,840
His Majesty doesn't want to tell you this.

552
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,230
But since you've known it,

553
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,200
I will not hide it anymore.

554
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,080
His Majesty is getting weaker and weaker.

555
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,150
I'm afraid that without the Holy Pearl,

556
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
he will die soon.

557
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,720
I know him well.

558
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,920
He understands that if you know about this,

559
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,750
you will definitely choose to stay.

560
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,150
He doesn't want to force you,

561
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,560
or to let you sacrifice for him,

562
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,920
so he agreed to send you back.

563
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,150
After you leave,

564
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,680
all his previous efforts will be in vain.

565
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,200
I'm afraid that

566
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,080
both he and the Beast Clan will...

567
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,960
Your Highness.

568
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,990
I wonder if I should tell you one thing.

569
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,870
Say it.

570
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,470
I have been with His Majesty since I was a child.

571
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,470
He's sincere to everyone

572
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
and does everything with principles.

573
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
If it weren't for the fact that the Holy Pearl

574
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
is related to the entire Beast Clan,

575
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,230
he wouldn't have used this method

576
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,320
to force you.

577
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,350
He has been tormented

578
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,150
since he took you here.

579
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,200
He feels indebted to you

580
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
and wants to make it up to you.

581
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,560
But then

582
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,190
he really fell in love with you.

583
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,560
If I hadn't been around to remind him often,

584
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,880
he would have even forgotten
about the Holy Pearl.

585
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
His Majesty has never loved anyone in his life.

586
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,600
This is the first time
he has fallen in love with someone.

587
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,160
Maybe he's a little clumsy,

588
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,910
but because of that,

589
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,040
what he does is all genuine.

590
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,430
I swear it's true.

591
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,950
The only way to give him the Holy Pearl

592
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,600
is the kiss of true love?

593
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,160
Yes.

594
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,080

603

604
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,800
I am giving it to you now.

What are you doing?

606
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,710
Didn't you say that a true love kiss with me

607
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,560
can get you the Holy Pearl?

608
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,840
The Holy Pearl belongs to you.

609
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,670

610

Have you ever loved

632
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,230

No.

635
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,560
You did it for the Holy Pearl.

636
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,990
And I want to go back to Daxia.

637
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,270

Are you willing to die like this?

642
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,640
What's more, didn't you marry me

643
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,320
just because of the Holy Pearl?

644
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,710
It was my fault to lie to you.

Now I just want to end this error.

646
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
No need for that.

I don't need your pity.

651
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,710
Since you don't love me,

652
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,510
this kiss doesn't make sense.

653
