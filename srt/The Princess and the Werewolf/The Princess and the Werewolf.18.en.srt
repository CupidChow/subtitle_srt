Holy Pearl is a big deal.

Since you and Her Highness have... you know,

34
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,960
you must get the Holy Pearl matter done quickly.

35
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,600
According to the ancient record,

we must become soul mates

192
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,430
But Mother says

193
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,480
girls should be demure and reserved in love.

194
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,550
Qi Pa.

195
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
You've been bold for 20 years.

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,840
Why do you have to be reserved now?

197
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,840
Li Xiong.

198
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,480
I'll give you one last chance.

199
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,550
Go to sleep.

200
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,360
Li Xiong, you're good.

201
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,960
How dare you go missing

202
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,310
right after we're in a relationship?

203
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,310
No.

204
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,840
I'll go find him.

205
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,670
Your Highness.

206
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,280
Come in.

207
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,720
Your Highness, His Majesty invites you to the hall.

208
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,600
I'm not going.

209
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,800
I have some real business to do.

210
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,800
His Majesty says

211
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,720
he wants you there

212
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,600
for a matter of significance.

213
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
You must go.

214
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,430
Or he'll come to invite you in person.

215
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,110
All right, I'll go now.

216
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,600
Yes.

217
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,720
[Boyue Hall]

218
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,550
Anyone?

219
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,800
Weird.

220
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,750
What are you doing?

221
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,110
Happy Birthday.

222
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,630
Your Highness.

223
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,750
Happy Birthday, Your Highness.

224
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,600
Wish you youth

225
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,720
and happiness forever.

226
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,990
Thank you all.

227
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,550
Today is your birthday.

228
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,800
His Majesty let us
prepare you a birthday surprise.

229
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,550
Qi Pa.

230
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,240
This is the birthday cake

231
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,960
I asked Chun'er to make.

232
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
I did it by His Majesty's instructions.

233
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,990
He said the cake should be big,

234
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,920
white,

235
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,510
and sweet.

236
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,280
It is quite big.

237
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,520
I've never seen such a big steamed bun before.

238
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,670
What's this?

239
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,910
A flower.

240
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,550
His Majesty told me that "Qi Pa"

241
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,960
means "beautiful and unique flower".

242
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,550
So this flower is you, Your Highness.

243
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,000
Thank you.

244
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,880
Good.

245
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,840
Let's move on to the next part.

246
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,110
Qi Pa.

247
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,710
Each of us

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
has a birthday present for you.

249
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,080
Presents?

250
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,030
Your Highness.

251
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,640
I embroidered a sachet for you.

252
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,760
I hope you like it.

253
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
It's cute.

254
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,470
Thank you.

255
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,550
I hope Her Highness and His Majesty live a happy life

256
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,880
and have a little prince soon.

257
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,470
So it's for the baby.

258
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,710
Hongxiu.

259
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,590
Are you eager to be the Godmother

260
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,110
of the little prince?

261
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,470
I'm not eligible for that.

262
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,830
Of course you are.

263
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,040
All right.

264
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,950
Let's see what the Godfather

265
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,830
gets me for my birthday.

266
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,470
Your Highness.

267
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,040
What's this?

268
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,160
Lose the cover.

269
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,760
Your Highness, this is my present for you.

270
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
A statue.

271
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,400
Please stay away from David

272
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,000
and get close to His Majesty.

273
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,190
Liu Jun.

274
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,400
Good. Very good.

275
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,560
What a sexy belly!

276
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,880
I have three presents for you.

277
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,950
Wow, you're rich.

278
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,350
Present yourself as grateful.

279
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,680
Present yourself as humble.

280
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,560
Present yourself as discreet.

281
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,190
Me. And me.

282
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,430
Your Highness.

283
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,430
Give me a second.

284
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,360
[Your Highness, wish you a safe life]

285
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,400
Your Highness.

286
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,640
I wish you a safe life.

287
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,230
- Good.
- Good.

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,280
Thank you.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,760
Qi Pa.

290
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,830
I also have a present for you.

291
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,830
This is the best thing

292
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,520
a werewolf can give to his beloved.

293
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,400
A werewolf loves one girl in his life.

294
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,190
So I have only one fang necklace.

295
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,880
And I'm giving it to you now.

296
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,400
This is important for you.

297
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,520
I can't take it.

298
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,520
Take it.

299
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,160
Think of it as an amulet

300
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,590
and take it with you.

301
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,830
Thank you.

302
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,830
All right.

303
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,830
That's the part of giving presents.

304
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,920
We'd better leave

305
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,470
and give His Majesty and Her Highness some privacy.

306
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,560
Zha.

307
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,950
Don't you want to drink?

308
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,760
Your Majesty.

309
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,800
May I have a few drinks with Zha?

310
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,160
Go ahead.

311
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

312
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,160
Let's go.

313
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,230
Go. Let's go.

314
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,070
Good luck, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

315
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,640
Go.

316
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,000
I...

317
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,590
Since everyone has left,

318
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,350
I'll go back to my chamber, too.

319
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,430
Okay.

320
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,350
You go back to get some rest.

321
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,830
As for these presents,

322
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,070
I'll have the guards send them to your place.

323
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,880
Good.

324
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,590
I'll go back then.

325
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,830
Where's Li Xiong?

326
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,830
Everyone was there celebrating my birthday,

327
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,800
except for him.

328
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

329
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
Mr. Li has a letter for you.

330
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,920
You may leave.

331
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,590
Yes, Your Highness.

332
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,110
Meet me outside the city gate.

333
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,190
Li Xiong.

334
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,590

It's a constellation.

From today on,

359
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,350

It's an easy thing

364
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,350
to just say it.

365
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,040
Well,

366
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,350
you don't like it?

367
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,950
I'm just messing with you.

Okay.

373
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,520
What's... what's this?

374
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,590
It's a beauty mark from Qi Pa.

386
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,000
You didn't transform tonight.

387
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,680
It would be great

388
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,000
if this went on.

389
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,830
But I'm not sure how long it will last.

390
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,830
If only I could be like this forever.

391
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,160
Time's up.

392
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,280
I'm gonna transfuse power into the Holy Spring.

393
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,430
I'll go with you.

394
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,000
Your Majesty.

395
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,710
Your Majesty.

396
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,920
I knew it was a luxury.

397
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,350
It only lasts for a short period.

398
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,470
No matter if it's for the sake

399
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,190
of the Beast Clan or yourself,

400
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,800
you should get the Holy Pearl as soon as you can.

401
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm also worried about the Beast Clan.

402
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,880
It's okay for me to suffer.

403
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,280
But our people are innocent.

404
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,800
It's not your fault, Your Majesty.

405
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
Please don't beat yourself up.

406
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,920
The pressing matter

407
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,430
is to make Her Highness love the real you.

408
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,190
How I wish I could

409
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,590
be with Li Xiong all the time!

410
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,310
Your Highness.

411
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,830
The presents from other chambers

412
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,000
are put over there.

413
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,280
They're really thoughtful.

414
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,000
That's because everybody likes you, Your Highness.

415
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,760
Oh, by the way,

416
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,590
you should take good care

417
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,230
of His Majesty's fang necklace.

418
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,350
It's said that His Majesty never took it off

419
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,000
and allowed no one to touch it.

420
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
Is it that precious?

421
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,040
Because it's not only a gift from the late king

422
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,990
but also related to His Majesty's mother.

423
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,750
His Majesty gave it to you.

424
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,510
It suggests that you mean a lot to him,

425
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,510
Your Highness.

426
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,440
Cutie.

427
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,870
It's getting late.

428
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,870
You can go back and rest.

429
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,390
Then I'll take my leave.

430
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,440
Is my behavior

431
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
kind of cruel to Kui Mulang?

432
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,680
It's not three months yet.

433
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,870
Nominally, I'm still his queen.

434
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
I should figure out something.

435
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,800
Hey, girl.

436
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,990
You're just too attractive.

437
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,600
Kui Mulang is obsessed with me

438
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,350
because he hasn't seen many women.

439
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
With more choices,

440
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,470
he would not go for me only.

441
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,040
For the happiness of Li Xiong and me,

442
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm going to find more women for Kui Mulang.

443
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,510
Cheers.

444
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,630
One more.

445
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,230
Come on, Liu Jun.

446
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,270
Go easy.

447
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,320
Come on.

448
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,230
One more.

449
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
I'm intoxicated.

450
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,630
I said, go easy.

451
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,680
One cup and you're drunk. How embarrassing!

452
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,110
It's not embarrassing.

453
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,680
Not at all.

454
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,320
We're family.

455
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,600
Right?

456
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,230
As long as you don't mind.

457
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,200
What are you talking about?

458
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,040
Why should I mind?

459
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,630
I like you.

460
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,680
I like you.

461
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,350
I like you very much.

462
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,630
I like you. I like you.

463
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,470
I like you.

464
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,040
I like you so much.

465
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
Don't talk nonsense.

466
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,150
Bai Ke, you do this again

467
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,870
and I'll never see you.

468
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,680
Oh, geez.

469
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,390
I was pretty manly, right?

470
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,470
Sorry for that.

471
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,750
Well,

472
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,630
I'll drink to apologize for Hu Die.

473
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,630
Bai Ke was quite a man.

474
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,600
You want to kill Kui Mulang?

475
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,160
I used to take orders from that man.

476
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,360
But he kept everything from me.

477
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,670
He asked me to get close to Qi Pa only to use me.

478
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,670
Now I don't want to be his pawn.

479
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,360
My target

480
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,430
has always been Kui Mulang.

481
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,040
I want to kill him.

482
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,320
So you already have a plan?

483
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,190
Aren't you a master of disguise?

484
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Disguise yourself as Liu Jun

485
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,640
and get close to Kui Mulang

486
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,990
Then you can kill him at one go.

487
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,080
What.

488
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,320
Are you intimidated by my wisdom?

489
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,040
I told you

490
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,160
that your old master didn't see your value.

491
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,990
So do you think

492
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
I didn't disguise as Liu Jun

493
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,430
to assassinate Kui Mulang

494
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,640
because my old master didn't think of it?

495
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,670
Did he?

496
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,430
Liu Jun

497
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,800
is the closest subordinate to Kui Mulang.

498
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,470
Kui is familiar with Liu's manners,

499
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,120
habits of speech, and behavior.

500
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,190
You want me to disguise as Liu Jun?

501
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,880
It's like putting my head in a noose.

502
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,470
It's suicide.

503
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,710
Of course I know that.

504
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,560
It's an intelligence test.

505
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,880
All right.

506
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,880
You passed it.

507
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,430
I do have an idea.

508
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,040
My former master thought it was too risky.

509
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,470
If you think it's a good idea,

510
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,510
I'm willing to give it a try.

511
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,880
What is it?

512
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,510
Now that our target

513
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,120
has shifted from Qi Pa to Kui Mulang.

514
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,910
we might as well get him killed

515
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,910
as soon as we can

516
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,320
in a simple way.

517
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,230
Your Majesty.

518
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,320
You've worked hard.

519
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,080
Let me get you undressed.

520
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,950
You are pretty.

521
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,230
Don't make fun of me.

522
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,670
Are you sure that will work?

523
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,670
It's our best choice.

524
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,840
It won't work on Kui Mulang.

525
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,670
He's not like Don Juan.

526
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,880
Beauty is not a temptation for him.

527
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,840
I've studied the art of seduction.

528
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,320
It sounds unreliable.

529
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,360
I think

530
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,360
sex-trap is the least viable.

531
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,990
You can question me,

532
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,670
but not my expertise.

533
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,160
You don't trust me, do you?

534
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,400
How about this?

535
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,190
I'll use it on you first.

536
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,430
If I succeed in seducing you,

537
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,160
it proves that this trick works.

538
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,190
Then I'll go seduce Kui Mulang.

539
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,470
No need.

540
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,560
I'm sure I won't

541
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,190
be tempted by your beauty.

542
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,080
Are you sure?

543
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,190
Your Royal Highness.

544
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,990
Your Royal Highness.

00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,190
What do you think?

546
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,510
Beautiful.

547
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,750
Beautiful but useless.

548
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,040
That's it.

549
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,950
You failed.

550
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,880
We'll talk about this later.

551
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,710
What's wrong?

552
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,230
My seduction has never failed.

553
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,800
Your Royal Highness.

554
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,750
What happened?

555
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm good.

556
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,640
It's too hot.

557
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,190
Wait for me, Your Royal Highness.

Come in.

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,750
What do you want?

562
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,800
Here's the thing.

563
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm planning to have a performance class

[Performance Class]
in the court.

565
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,270
I want your permission, Your Majesty.

566

I've been here for quite a while.

569
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
And I found a big problem.

570
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,800
The palace is seriously

571
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,040
short of entertainment.

572
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,040
You're always busy with political affairs.

573
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
There's no place for recreation.

574
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,230
You work too much.

575
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,040
But there's new work forever.

576
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,600
You need a balance between work and rest.

577
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,990
Are you saying

578
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,560
that the class is for me?

579
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,800
Right.

580
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,640
Your Majesty.

581
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,750
Think about it.

582
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,990
This class is full of pretty girls.

583
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,200
All excellent dancers and singers.

584
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,680
Just imagine that.

585
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,630
It helps to cultivate your taste.

586
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,230
Your Majesty.

587
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,870
You want that, don't you?

588
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,390
So you are suggesting

589
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,870
that I watch a bunch of beauties

590
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,080
dancing and singing all day long?

591
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,670
That's smart of you.

592
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,520
Your Majesty.

593
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,080
Isn't that charming?

594
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,520
Are you in?

595
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm not.

596
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,470
Good.

597
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,230
Sure enough.

598
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,630
You're not interested in these things.

599
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,390
It doesn't matter.

600
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,520
It's all right once we set up the class.

601
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,670
I don't agree.

602
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,360
But don't you find your harem empty?

603
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,520
You have no concubines.

604
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,870
You alone

605
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,120
is enough for my harem.

606
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,120
I can't handle it all by myself.

607
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,230
Period.

608
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,470
Take your leave.

609
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,760
Yes.
