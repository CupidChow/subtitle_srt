[The Princess and the Werewolf]
[Adapted from Orange's novel of the same name]

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,240
[Episode 7]

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,830
Really?

19
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,630
She's really vigorously preparing for this?

20
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,360
Yes.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,950
People in the Imperial Kitchen are discussing

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,800
how the queen-to-be cares about you.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,800
Everyone changed his mind about her.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,680
So, I needn't have worried that much.

25
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,590
The novels are right.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,950
When a lady says no, she means yes.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,160
When she rejects something, she wants more.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,360
But Chun'er of the Imperial Kitchen said

29
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,870
dishes Her Grace makes don't look very good.

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,830
Qi Pa is a princess.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,910
It's hard enough for her to cook.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
And the dishes just don't look very good.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,520
Maybe they taste great.

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
Your Majesty, after tonight's banquet,

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,880
you can keep Her Grace for a private talk.

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,240
Then you grab the chance to...

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,320
I can't.

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,630
According to the novels,

39
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,320
it takes a very long time to get someone's heart.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,520
I have to move her

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,080
and get her very slowly

42
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,030
instead of being impatient.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,440
I've done something, but nowhere near enough.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,390
I should do more.

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,320
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,440
may I give you some advice?

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,110
Spend less time on the novels.

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,270
I'll go tell everyone

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,110
to be prepared for tonight's banquet.

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,080
I'll take my leave, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,030
Wait.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Do something else for me.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Everybody,

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,000
every dish you're going to taste

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,630
was made by Princess Qi Pa.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,080
Your Grace,

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,830
you had a really hard day.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,720
It's my pleasure.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,030
No trouble at all.

60
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,360
And I hope you'll like the dishes.

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,110
What a poser!

62
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,750
The Queen's Private Banquet now starts.

63
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,160
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
I knew it.

65
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,720
How would this bad-looking food taste good?

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,960
Good.

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,160
The dishes look fantastic

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,750
of the same color.

69
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,750
It's really sweet of you.

70
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,720
Your Majesty, check the dishes.

71
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,440
Greenish, aren't they?

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,800
This is the Fully Nutritious Banquet.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,320
Help yourselves.

74
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,110
I heard

75
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,390
some queens-to-be were disqualified

76
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,640
because they cooked terribly.

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,070
So, everyone,

78
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,200
after you taste the dishes I made,

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,350
please comment impartially.

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,720
Do not play favoritism

81
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,720
in case you get the wrong woman for your king.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
This is so good.

83
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,390
Bravo, Your Grace.

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,830
Have some self-esteem, will you?

85
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,950
How could this bad-looking food taste good?

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,110
Hu Die,

87
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,830
I know you're the most sensible.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,070
Stop eating and say something fair.

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,920
Criticize me as hard as you can.

90
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,920
Tastes great.

91
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,950
How come you can even cook so well?

92
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,830
I'm so pissed off.

93
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,600
Hu Die!

94
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,390
Your Majesty and Your Grace,

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,600
please don't blame her.

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,950
I'll talk to her.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,160
This doesn't make any sense.

98
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,230
Liu Jun,

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,670
taste the dishes

100
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,270
and say how they really taste.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,350
Tastes great.

102
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,510
You...

103
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,790
How come

104
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,510
you guys are so bad?

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,390
No one talks honestly.

106
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,510
Your Majesty, I know
you have something to tell Her Grace.

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,230
And we'll take our leave.

108
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,200
- See you, Your Majesty.
- See you, Your Majesty.

109
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,000
These are not the dishes I made.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Kui Mulang,

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,070
you tricked me.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,670
For the sake that you tried hard to cook,

113
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,070
I had some cooks help you a little bit.

114
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,670
Here are your dishes.

115
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm going to taste some.

116
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,070
Good.

117
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,550
I know you care about me.

118
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,950
Enjoy the dishes, then.

119
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,040
Sure.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,110
What? How does it taste?

121
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,920
According to the novels,

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,510
it takes a very long time to get someone's heart.

123
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,230
I have to move her

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,070
and get her very slowly

125
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,670
instead of being impatient.

126
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,550
Tastes great.

127
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,880
Fine.

128
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,480
Actually, in my state,

129
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,680
there's a rule for weddings.

130
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,270
That is, before a wedding,

131
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,240
the groom has to eat up

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,590
all the dishes the bride made.

133
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,680
Eat up?

134
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,830
Exactly.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,590
Or the groom would be disrespectful

136
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,590
and would not get married.

137
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,310
Fine.

138
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,390
That's exactly a strange rule.

139
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,080
Your Majesty,

140
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,680
enjoy the food.

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,960
How's your sense of taste now?

142
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,320
These dishes...

143
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,390
Are great.

144
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,750
You can cook very well, indeed.

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,800
Your Grace,

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,440
how about you taste some, too?

147
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,440
No, thanks.

148
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,830
I made these dishes specially for you.

149
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,320
I not only cooked before the wedding.

150
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
After that, I still want my husband

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,320
to taste the dishes I make every day.

152
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,750
Will you?

153
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,950
I will.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,880
I made terrible dishes.

155
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,830
Why must you force yourself?

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,150
And I'm not a good wife for you.

157
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,240
Why do you not give up?

158
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,950
Kui Mulang, what's wrong with you?

159
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,560
What on earth did you feed me?

160
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,510
Are the dishes too nutritious?

161
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Are... Are you all right?

162
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,440
Kui Mulang.

163
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,240
Kui Mulang.

164
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,630
Kui Mulang!

165
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,830
What are you doing?

166
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,320
Wake up, Kui Mulang!

167
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,000
Kui Mulang, what do you think you're doing?

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,510
Leave!

169
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,880
Your Grace, you're back.

170
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,000
Easy, easy.

171
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,440
Your Grace,

172
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,320
I heard His Majesty loved the dishes you made.

173
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,950
Instead of sharing them with the ministers,

174
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,680
he kept them to himself.

175
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,040
His Majesty has

176
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,560
aggressive and romantic love for you.

177
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,680
Does His Majesty love the dishes?

178
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,920
Dishes?

179
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,800
What he wanted is me!

180
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,590
But His Majesty never eats meat.

181
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,360
Your Grace, what's wrong?

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,950
Hongxiu,

183
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,560
I gave you that prescription.

184
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,150
Did you fill it exactly?

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Yes.

186
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
I bought everything according to it.

187
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,830
Your Majesty.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,120
What's happening, Your Majesty?

189
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,590
Why... Why are you so clammy?

190
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,320
Last night, you stayed with Her Grace

191
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,920
and now you're clammy.

192
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,830
Did you get the Holy Pearl?

193
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,000
Do you need me to get you a doctor?

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,390
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

195
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll take my leave.

196
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,240
What was wrong with those dishes?

197
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,150
Did Kui Mulang intentionally want to...

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Your Grace,

199
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
a director of the Imperial Health Institute
asked to see you.

200
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,920
Get him in.

201
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,190
No need of that.

202
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,630
I have something urgent to ask you.

203
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
Last night, I made
some medicated food for His Majesty,

204
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,750
but he seemed to be disliking it.

205
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,070
So, I want you to check

206
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,750
if some ingredients should be replaced.

207
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,520
[Prescription]

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,150
Did His Majesty eat it last night?

209
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,880
Yes,

210
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,360
but very little.

211
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,630
Lucky him.

212
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,150
What do you mean?

213
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,360
I haven't felt the pulse
of His Majesty for a long time

214
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,750
and I didn't know he needed that.

215
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,680
Your Grace, you used Viagra in the food

216
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,680
and that was too much.

217
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,590
I'm afraid you both couldn't hold it.

218
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,440
What Viagra? Make it clear.

219
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,830
How come you don't know?

220
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
The boon for physical relationships,

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Viagra.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,510
Boon for physical relationships?

223
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,270
Is it...

224
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,510
It can't be.

225
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,830
I just used a casual prescription.

226
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,630
It's so modest of you, Your Grace.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,390
I witnessed

228
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,040
how you brought Chun'er back to life.

229
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,150
I greatly admire your medical skills.

230
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,120
Viagra must be familiar to you.

231
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,800
But you used too much.

232
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,070
His Majesty is in the prime of life

233
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
and this would be too intense.

234
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,680
How about I give you some mild medicine?

235
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,880
No, no. You may leave.

236
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,360
You're back?

237
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,070
Yes.

238
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,070
What have you got?

239
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,150
Don't worry.

240
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,440
I've figured it out.

241
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,360
That man is heavily guarded in the Forbidden Area.

242
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,240
But we can get in touch with him.

243
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,150
Your Majesty,

244
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,070
may I get in?

245
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,680
Come in.

246
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,390
You're just in time.

247
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,120
Last night, I offended you

248
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
and scared you.

249
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,150
No, no, no. It's my fault.

250
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,750
Now, I came to apologize to you.

251
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,240
I didn't mean that.

252
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,440
I didn't know it had...

253
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,070
Never mind.

254
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,240
What's gone is gone.

255
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,120
I was too impulsive last time.

256
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,880
Now,

257
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,440
how about we get rid of prejudice

258
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,880
and talk to each other honestly?

259
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,440
All right. What shall we talk about?

260
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm really not fit to be your wife.

261
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,680
You've never tried.

262
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,750
How do you know you're not fit?

263
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,240
Listen. And think.

264
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,510
First,

265
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,120
I don't want to obey

266
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,560
your palace rules.

267
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,560
Second,

268
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,150
I can't cook.

269
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,630
How could I be the queen?

270
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,590
Third,

271
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,000
I often hurt you even without knowing that.

272
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,040
It's intolerable, isn't it?

273
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,510
Fourth, I have a quick temper

274
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,920
and I often argue with you.

275
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,510
Fifth,

276
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,240
you're bad-looking

277
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,270
and it scares me.

278
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,000
Most importantly,

279
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,320
we don't belong in the same world.

280
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,750
I'm going back home, sooner or later.

281
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
I know it's hard for you to meet

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,510
someone like me.

283
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,270
But your clan is a great place, too.

284
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,920
There are many good ladies.

285
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,800
You don't need to be that stubborn.

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,390
What if I want you only?

287
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,080
But you can't force me in love.

288
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,040
Why not?

289
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,440
The novels...

290
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,920
The books say,

291
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,560
a couple can slowly get close.

292
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,350
But I don't want to do that.

293
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,560
All I want is to go home.

294
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,270
How about you do me the favor

295
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,110
and send me back home?

296
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,510
I never owe anyone, you know.

297
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,270
I will pay you back, all right?

298
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,320
What exactly can I do

299
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,270
to keep you in my clan?

300
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,750
What exactly can I do

301
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,870
to make you get my point?

302
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,510
If you expect anything

303
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,320
or want to do anything,

304
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,870
you can tell me.

305
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,150
I'll do everything for you.

306
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,470
Just stay here.

307
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,840
I want to go home!

308
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,630
Then how about...

309
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,270
If you miss something in Daxia State

310
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,200
or if you want something from it,

311
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
I can fetch it for you.

312
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,560
To relieve your homesickness, anyway.

313
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,230
Are you sure?

314
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,390
Yes.

Are you Eunuch Ruo?

317
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,680
[Eunuch Ruo, bloodline: earthworm, timid and gossipy]
How do you know me?

318
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,040
Who are you?

319
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,720
I know your master,

320
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,800
Jing Muhan.

321
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,110
Your Royal Highness, time for dinner.

322
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,350
Such a poor dinner again.

323

[Jing Muhan, bloodline: moose, greedy and resentful]

324
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,630
I don't want it.

325
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,960
Don't be angry, Your Royal Highness.

326
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,320
He and I have the same mother.

327
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,470
Why can he be the great king out there

328
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,990
while I can only stay here?

329
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,680
Calm down, Your Royal Highness.

330
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,510
The Freezing Chain not only
freezes my internal force

331
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,150
but my bones will also be eroded.

332
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,510
Kui Mulang,

333
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,080
do people know

334
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,720
how you're treating your own brother?

335
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,390
A lady gave me the chopsticks,

336
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,800
saying the mysterious man
sent her to help you out.

338
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,040
What does this mean?

339
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,560
Oh, I know.

340
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,800
The new queen-to-be.

341
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,200
Queen-to-be?

342
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,200
Kui Mulang is getting a queen?

343
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,750
I'll go ask about it for you.

344
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,390
Go figure out what's happening.

345
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
Then don't do anything before I'm out.

[Kuixing Palace]

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Then, I want some durian

and the Statue of David my mother bought me.

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,920
Could you fetch them for me?

What are they?

352
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,040
It's hard to explain.

353
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,800
How about you take me back there?

354
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,560

Draw them and I'll get them back.

358

I really miss my state, actually.

359
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,110
So, how about you go back there with me

360
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,150

No way.

If I can't go back, that's fine.

- No way.

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,630
Get him in.

377
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,110
Your Majesty,

378
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,390
please help His Royal Highness.

379
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,150
No.

380
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,390
I mean Jing Muhan, the sinner.

381
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,920
What's wrong with him again?

382
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,560
He's seriously sick

383
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,390
and nearly dying.

384
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,470
He kept calling your name,

385
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,440
asking to see you for the last time.

386
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,680
How did he suddenly fall sick?

387
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,080
What did the doctor say?

388
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,750
Jing Muhan is a sinner.

389
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
Without your permission...

390
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,320
Ridiculous.

391
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
Get a doctor to him immediately.

392
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,110
Aye.

393
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,920
Your Majesty, could you please
check on His Royal Highness?

394
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,720
He's really pathetic.

395
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,320
I ordered you to take good care of him.

396
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,870
And this is how you took care of him?

397
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
Mercy, Your Majesty.

398
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,150
I was taking care
of His Royal Highness wholeheartedly.

399
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,040
And he was well last night.

400
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,990
This morning, he fell sick for no reason.

401
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,320
What did the doctor say?

402
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,320
He said he didn't know the cause

403
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,600
but His Royal Highness was fatally ill.

404
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,750
Maybe he...

405
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,270
His Royal Highness wants to see you
for the last time, Your Majesty.

406
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,320
Please show some mercy

407
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,350
and talk to him.

408
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,270
Leave us.

409
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,920
Kui... Kui Mulang.

410
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,920
Brother,

411
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,560
still not forgive me even when I'm dying?

412
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,230
Can we get back to the way things were?

413
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,350
Take some good rest here.

414
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,920
Brother!

415
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,230
Somebody.

416
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
Give the order.

417
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
His Royal Highness can go back to the Palace

418
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
for some recuperation.

419
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,920
Thank you, Your Majesty,
on behalf of His Royal Highness.

420
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
[Kuixing Palace]

421
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,480
[Peace in the World]

422
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,840
Brother,

423
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,320
how come you always win?

424
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,270
Can't you make a concession?

425
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,560
I'm your only brother.

426
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,430
You're a little young man.

427
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,310
How could you often cry?

428
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,000
Let me score and I won't cry.

429
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,550
When you want to win, you must do it by yourself

430
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,270
instead of being a spoiled child or cheating.

431
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,480
Come on. Let me teach you to play.

432
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,030
I like you best, Brother.

433
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,390
You're the best man in the world.

434
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,790
His Royal Highness needs to recuperate.

435
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,120
Thank you, doctor.

436
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,480
Your Royal Highness,

437
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,030
aren't you...

438
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,600
What?

439
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,360
[Jing Muhan, bloodline: moose, greedy and resentful]
How was my acting?

440
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,030
How was my acting?

441
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,790
Unbelievable acting, Your Royal Highness.

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,150
I'm not sick, actually.

443
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,480
After taking some Malingering Pills,

444
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,790
I just look sick.

445
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,880
Kui Mulang always thinks he's smart.

446
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,000
Then why can't he see through

447
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
such a small trick?

448
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,960
Your Royal Highness,

449
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,910
I don't understand.

450
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
Do you or do you not want His Majesty

451
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,600
to find out the truth?

452
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,030
Shut up.

453
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,600
Didn't I order you to ask about Qi Pa?

454
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,390
What have you got?

455
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,270
His Majesty announced

456
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,480
that he would marry her in seven days.

457
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,000
Everyone has been preparing for that.

458
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,880
Well,

459
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,760
you do something for me

460
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,120
so that I can meet Qi Pa by chance.

461
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,360
Aye.

462
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,310
Hongxiu.

463
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,600
Here I am.

464
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,840
Your Grace, you're awake.

465
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,390
His Majesty had this sent early this morning.

466
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,240
It stinks.

467
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,430
Oh, smells great.

468
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,880
I smelt it when it was far away.

469
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,390
Oh.

470
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,550
His Majesty said

471
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,120
a man would be delivered later.

472
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,150
And his name is...

473
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,640
Is it David?

474
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,190
Yes, yes. That's him.

475
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
Your Grace, you know him?

476
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,270
He really got David here?

477
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,120
What's that? So strange.

478
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,510
His Majesty's present for the queen-to-be.

479
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,760
So strange. Present?

480
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,120
What a dirty thing!

481
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,030
His Majesty and Her Grace

482
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,150
are quite romantic.

483
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,550
When will His Majesty get his mind back?

484
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,670
Hu Die,

485
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,790
can't you see?

486
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,960
They share a common interest.

487
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,390
And it's quite unique.

488
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,600
Say no more!

489
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,720
Your Grace.

490
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,030
Your Grace.

491
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,790
I heard

492
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,480
His Majesty got you some presents
from your hometown.

493
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,480
Why are you still sulking?

494
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,270
I had meant to ask for something hard to get.

495
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,550
But he got them back for me.

496
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,670
What other excuses can I use

497
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,790
to reject the marriage?

498
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,190
Actually, His Majesty truly cares about you.

499
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,240
I know you're eager to go home.

500
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,190
But under such circumstances,

501
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,190
you can't go back home like this.

502
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,430
And I believe,

503
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,270
when you agree to marry His Majesty,

504
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,270
he will send you back to your state.

505
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,670
That's another thing.

506
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,640
I want him to send me back home.

507
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,670
But I won't exchange my love for that.

508
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,240
Your Grace, why do you never want

509
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,670
to know more about His Majesty?

510
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,430
You're just like Kui Mulang.

511
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,670
You never understand this.

512
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,760
Love can't be forced.

513
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,430
That's a feeling.

514
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,270
What feeling?

515
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,000
Just a feeling.

516
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,720
In some certain instant,

517
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,190
it's like the wind blew into my heart

518
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,720
and I could feel my heart was shot.

519
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,550
It would be gentle, itchy,

520
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,150
sweet,

521
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,760
and even a little bit hot.

522
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,790
I don't have that feeling for Kui Mulang, anyway.

523
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,430
Did you have this feeling before?

524
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,430
Actually, I've never had this feeling before.

525
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,120
My mother told me about this.

526
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
She said,

527
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,480
I could meet that man someday.

528
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,670
And then, I would understand.

529
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,080
I get it.

530
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,960
Forget it.

531
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,240
Let's stop thinking about such unpleasant things.

532
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,880
Durian can remove all sorrow.

533
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,310
Now that it's delivered,

534
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,310
let's enjoy it for the moment.

535
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,360
Come on.

536
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,790
Eat some. Eat some.

No.

538
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,510
No, thanks, Your Grace.

539
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,840
Eat some with me.

540
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,840
- No, no.
- Come on.

541
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,670
Look.

542
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,840
No, no.

I should go.

Liu Jun,

562
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,640
have you ever had that feeling?
