00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,670
- Make haste.
- Go.

192
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,200
Likable?

193
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,150
You go check over there.

194
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,200
- Aye.
- Aye.

195
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,080
[Class of Charm]

196
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,110
Oh, so many auditors.

197
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,280
When you're here, keep quiet.

198
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,710
Don't disturb official students.

199
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,280
- Got it.
- Got it.

200
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,960
Every one of us wants to be more charming

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
and be loved.

202
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,200
Charming people can always

203
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,550
succeed in love.

204
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,320
So, in today's class,

205
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,760
we'll start with behaviors.

206
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
To make the class easier,

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,350
I invited Commander Bai Ke

208
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,520
to be my assistant.

209
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,670
Let's welcome him with applause.

210
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,790
This young man is so handsome.

211
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,760
Ximen,

212
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,790
behave yourself.

213
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,550
Li Xiong, Liu Jun, what are you doing here?

214
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,790
Are you also here for learning?

215
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,230
Why would I learn this?

216
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,910
So many maids are gathering here.

217
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,230
I just dropped by to check.

218
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,520
- Today,
- What's he doing there?

219
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,960
you must be very attentive.

220
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,280
Now, class begins.

221
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,230
You shall say this to Commander Bai

222
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,320
in turn.

223
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
Then, he will judge

224
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,960
how well you've learned today.

225
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,520
All right,

226
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,840
let's start with Youyou.

227
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Come on, Youyou.

228
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,150
Read this note.

229
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,710
When I'm...

230
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,400
You humans are horrible!

231
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
I want to drop out!

232
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,840
Miss, are you all right?

233
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,960
Your Highness,

234
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,550
did I scare her?

235
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,960
Youyou, right?

236
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,670
Hongxiu told me about you.

237
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,230
You only need to be happy.

238
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,640
Be yourself.

239
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,790
Don't mind what others think of you.

240
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,960
Back to your position.

241
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

242
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,520
Next.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,640
Rourou.

244
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,150
Read this.

245
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,150
It's...

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
It's so lonely to practice martial arts!

247
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
You're the commander of the Imperial Guards

248
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,280
and you must be strong!

249
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Shall we fight?

250
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,440
I...

251
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,350
Rourou,

252
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,670
read this.

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Your Highness,

254
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,470
I don't want to be a master of charm,

255
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,880
but a master of martial arts!

256
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,470
You're in the wrong class, then.

257
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,030
Back to your position.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,030
When I'm alone at night, I feel so lonely

259
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,200
and scared.

260
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,960
Young man,

261
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,960
could you keep me company?

262
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,880
No, I can't.

263
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,150
Your Highness,

264
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,550
who is she?

265
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,640
Ximen,

266
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
he's my assistant

267
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,320
and he's a valuable asset.

268
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,910
Do care for him.

269
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,030
Come on.

270
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
Next.

271
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,080
Greetings, Commander Bai.

272
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,760
No... No need for that.

273
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,230
There you go.

274
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,030
When I'm alone at night...

275
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,960
When I'm alone at night,
I feel so lonely and scared.

276
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,230
But I'll try hard to pull it through.

277
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,080
Well done.

278
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,230
You're so talented,

279
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,880
and a self-taught genius.

280
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,960
Very good.

281
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,520
Applaud.

282
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,910
Good. Good.

283
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,910
Well done.

284
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,710
Haitang,

285
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,350
you did a very good job.

286
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

287
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,280
And thank you, Commander Bai.

288
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,320
My pleasure.

289
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,670
All right.

290
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,280
So much for this morning.

291
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,320
Have a free lunch break.

292
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,400
Class is over.

293
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,150
- Thanks for the class, Your Highness.
- Thanks for the class, Your Highness.

294
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,400
Your Highness,

295
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,030
I'll go prepare the lunch.

296
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,280
I'll go, too.

297
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,150
Sure. Go ahead.

298
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,400
Go.

299
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,030
Your Highness,

300
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,400
I have a private affair this afternoon.

301
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,880
So, you have to get another assistant.

302
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,280
Private affair?

303
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,200
Back together with Hu Die?

304
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,880
No, not that.

305
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,550
Then what's it?

306
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,840
Your Highness,

307
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,400
let me tell you the truth.

308
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,790
I don't know why

309
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,880
but many matchmakers visited my parents.

310
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,880
So, they asked me to go back home.

311
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,400
I have to meet the girls.

312
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,080
I didn't know you wanted blind dates.

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,960
I didn't.

314
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,640
My... My parents made me.

315
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,550
So, don't worry, Your Highness.

316
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,880
I'll just go and explain it to the girls.

317
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,840
I won't waste their time.

318
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,080
I didn't expect you to think so positively.

319
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,470
Fine, then.

320
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,840
Get to your business this afternoon.

321
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,590
You don't need to come.

322
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,030
Thank you, Your Highness.

323
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,350
Who did that?

324
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,190
Who?

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
Darn it.

326
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,680
Your Majesty.

327
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,230
Your Majesty.

328
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,280
Your Majesty!

329
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,110
You're awake.

330
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

331
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,160
Still worried about the Performance Class?

332
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,070
Looks like

333
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Qi Pa won't stop until she gets me

334
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,680
some concubines.

335
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,800
When I have such a good wife,

336
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,280
I don't know

337
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,560
how I should feel, happy or sad.

338
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,560
You can just ignore the girls.

339
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,830
How can I?

340
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,190
Qi Pa is quick-tempered.

341
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,080
If I ignore the girls,

342
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,320
she'll get them into my chamber.

343
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,960
No way.

344
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,230
I have to spoil her plan personally.

345
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,990
Shall I go with you?

346
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,840
No need.

347
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,560
I'll go alone.

348
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,800
Yes.

349
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,720
Commander Bai is

350
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,990
rather numb.

351
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,800
He isn't romantic at all.

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,510
Miss Ximen,

353
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,840
it's me, Li Xiong.

354
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,510
Are you available now?

355
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,720
Yes.

356
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,990
What's up?

357
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,990
Oh, my cute brother.

358
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,320
Miss... Miss Ximen,

359
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,040
this is too much.

360
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,390
I'm not your brother.

361
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,920
You can be my sworn brother.

362
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,230
Miss Ximen,

363
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,960
you...

364
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,270
Are you trying to say

365
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,390
that I look like a friend of yours?

366
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,630
No, Miss Ximen.

367
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,110
Your face...

368
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,470
Kill me!

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,510
- So, this one is out.
- I'm disfigured!

370
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,320
Who are you?

371
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,630
Li Xiong.

372
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,110
I heard you wanted to challenge

373
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,230
Bai Ke and Liu Jun, right?

374
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,990
Yes.

375
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,840
So what?

376
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,270
I think you're in over your head, Miss.

377
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,200
What do you mean?

378
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,630
I play tough, you know?

379
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,270
If you don't mind,

380
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,040
you can challenge me first.

381
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,800
The loser must do something for the winner.

382
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,510
Sure. No problem.

383
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,800
But I don't mean

384
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,150
to make you do anything.

385
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,870
I just want to win.

386
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,390
I lost.

387
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,510
Tell me what you want me to do.

388
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,560
All right.

389
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,350
Please leave the Beast Palace.

390
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,750
I will. I'm a good loser, after all.

391
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Ximen

392
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,110
must have been disfigured.

393
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,390
Are you Miss Haitang?

394
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,110
Who are you?

395
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,270
I'm Li Xiong,

396
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,080
His Majesty's bodyguard.

397
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,560
Hi, Mr. Li.

398
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,840
What do you want?

399
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,440
I want to discuss something with you.

400
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,840
I wonder why you entered
the Performance Class.

401
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,720
If you want something,

402
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,720
I can tell His Majesty about it.

403
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,040
But I hope

404
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,600
you can leave the Palace.

405
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,840
Who sent you?

406
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,720
You don't need to know.

407
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,470
I don't care who sent you.

408
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,040
But Her Highness picked me.

409
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,680
If you want me to leave,

410
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,720
ask Her Highness for permission.

411
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,750
How about this?

412
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,800
Here's a jade pendant

413
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,320
worth 1,000 taels of silver.

414
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
If you want some money,

415
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,150
I can offer it.

416
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,750
I don't want that.

417
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,040
Then I can introduce you
to influential young men.

418
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,750
They're handsome and knowledgeable.

419
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,320
I don't need them, either.

420
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,230
So, you just won't leave, huh?

421
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,080
Exactly.

422
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,840
I don't want to leave.

423
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,720
I'm afraid His Majesty

424
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,960
won't pick anyone.

425
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,750
If you stay,

426
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,560
you'll just be wasting your time.

427
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,630
How do you know what His Majesty will do?

428
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,080
I...

429
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,320
Forget it.

430
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,390
Sorry to have bothered you.

431
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,150
What a strange man!

432
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,990
Haitang doesn't want anything

433
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,990
and she won't leave.

434
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
What a hassle!

435
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,750
I'll go talk to Qi Pa first.

436
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,630
Qi Pa.

437
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,990
What brings you here?

438
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,680
Oh, right.

439
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,470
I've been too busy with the Performance Class

440
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,990
to stay with you.

441
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,990
It's broad daylight.

442
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,680
What if people see us?

443
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,470
Don't worry.

444
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,040
No one else is here.

445
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,040
By the way,

446
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,600
did you see the four beautiful girls

447
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,560
I picked out?

448
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
What do you think of Haitang?

449
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,720
I don't look at any other girl.

450
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,320
It's so honey-lipped of you.

451
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,040
I had some tests.

452
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,680
Haitang is really sensible.

453
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,320
But the other three...

454
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,320
Your Highness.

455
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,200
Your Highness,

456
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,800
bad news. Bad news.

457
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,040
What bad news?

458
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,960
Tell me about it.

459
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,990
Your Highness.

460
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,630
Your Highness!

461
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,150
What's going on here?

462
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
- We want to drop out!
- We want to drop out.

463
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
[Dropout Letter]

464
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,320
Haitang seems to be the chosen one.

465
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,320
Who's that?

466
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,350
Why did you come again?

467
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,630
I think I heard you

468
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,800
cry in your room.

469
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,960
Well,

470
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,440
my two classmates left.

471
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,440
I had to cry

472
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,200
in case they suspected me.

473
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,630
And you.

474
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,470
Didn't I tell you not to come again?

475
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,080
After all, I'm your mast...

476
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,800
Your partner.

477
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,270
I have to know how you're doing.

478
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,270
When the moment is right,

479
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,990
I'll report to you.

480
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
You don't need to monitor me.

481
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,270
You have to be very careful

482
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,560
and don't give yourself away.

483
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,110
Kui Mulang and his men know

484
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,040
the woman they're searching for
has the chameleon bloodline.

485
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,150
Stop nagging!

486
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,440
Wait.

487
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,320
Umm...

488
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,600
I have something to remind you.

489
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,600
When you're on your mission,

490
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,600
remember how far to go.

491
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,320
What does it mean?

492
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,750
Stay away from some men

493
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,630
who are inferior to me.

494
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,150
Inferior to you?

495
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,470
Anyone?

496
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,270
You!

497
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,560
Miss Haitang, are you in?

498
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,990
Her Highness wanted to see you.

499
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,800
All right.

500
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,750
I'll get dressed and go.

501
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,800
Your Royal Highness,

502
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,990
from now on,

503
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,040
stop making any more trouble,

504
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,960
got it?

505
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,390
I should go, then.

506
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,080
No one else is here.

507
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,990
You should leave, too.

508
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,680
Your Majesty, you tried personally

509
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,200
but Haitang still wouldn't leave.

510
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,270
Anyway, with only one girl,

511
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,320
I don't think the Performance Class
can continue.

512
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,040
You don't know Qi Pa.

513
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,870
When she wants to do something,

514
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,150
she can always do that.

515
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,920
Even if only one girl stays,

516
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
she will not give up.

517
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,150
Anyway, Her Highness

518
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,150
won't try new things anytime soon.

519
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,150
Your Majesty, you only need to stay alert

520
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,440
against Haitang.

521
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,120
[Yaohua Palace]

522
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,230
Last night, I had a good talk with them three.

523
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,990
But today,

524
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,110
I'm staying all alone.

525
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,870
Your Highness,

526
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,470
she's so sad.

527
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,080
Why are you still laughing?

528
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
Look at this beautiful girl.

529
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,040
She weeps so beautifully with tears
on her face.

530
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,040
Really gorgeous.

531
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,870
Don't be sad.

532
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,470
When your friends are gone,

533
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
you have no more competitors.

534
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,510
Isn't that great?

535
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,440
I never meant to compete with anyone.

536
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,510
I came here,

537
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,110
only because I adored His Majesty

538
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,150
and wanted to get a look at him.

539
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,270
No wonder I think you're a genius.

540
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,150
Every word of yours is perfect.

541
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,110
Your Highness,

542
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,720
rest assured.

543
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,750
I'll learn everything.

544
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,680
Speaking of which,

545
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,110
I want to ask you something.

546
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,870
Can you dance?

547
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,560
I've been dancing since I was very little.

548
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,840
I can dance very well.

549
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,720
Wonderful.

550
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,510
Can you do the tango?

551
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,990
Tanga? What is tanga?

552
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,630
Tanga?

553
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,990
Tango is the most intimate and enthusiastic

554
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,920
among all dances for two.

555
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,960
Think about it.

556
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,440
When the lights are on

557
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,630
and the music rings,

558
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,320
two dancers hold each other

559
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,840
and dally with each other very closely.

560
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,080
Isn't it lovely?

561
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,560
Isn't it riveting?

562
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,750
Quietly seductive.

563
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,270
So,

564
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,200
once I can do this dance,

565
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,390
I can dance with Kui Mu...

566
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,150
I mean,

567
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,270
our heroic king and I

568
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,080
will dance together.

569
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,110
Yes, of course.

570
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,630
On the condition that you can do this dance.

571
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,390
It won't be a problem.

572
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,680
I'm not bragging,

573
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,870
but I do have a talent for dance.

574
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,040
Good.

575
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,470
Start to learn immediately.

576
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,390
All right.

577
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,720
Give me your hand.

578
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,510
Three steps ahead.

579
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,750
One, two, three.

580
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Cha-cha.

581
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Cha-cha.

582
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,560
Three steps back.

583
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,630
Cha-cha.

584
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Cha-cha.

585
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,630
Whirl.

586
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,200
And back.

587
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,230
Can you do a leg lift?

588
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,390
Yes.

589
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,200
Try it.

590
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,040
Good, good.

591
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,320
Bravo!

592
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,350
Then, down.

593
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Next, wiggle three times.

594
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,320
Follow me.

595
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,200
First, left.

596
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,470
Then, right.

597
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,630
Yes, that's right.

598
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,560
One more time.

599
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,600
Be confident.

600
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,040
Wiggle.

601
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,800
Again.

602
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,390
Wiggle.

603
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,920
Then do this.

604
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,200
Let me teach you another move.

605
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,990
Go, go.

606
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,150
Then back.

607
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,440
Come, come.

608
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,200
Your Highness, what's wrong?

609
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,800
Sorry.

610
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,080
How about you practice alone?

611
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,150
I'll be right back.

612
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,840
But Your Highness...

613
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,510
There you are.

614
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,750
Come on.

615
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,680
You peeked when I was dancing.

616
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,040
I was thinking about you,

617
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,920
so I came to check on you.

618
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,510
Surprisingly, you were dancing
with someone else behind my back.

619
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:47,990
What?

620
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,870
You're even jealous of a woman?

621
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,680
Yes, of course.

622
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,680
A jealous young man is so adorable.

623
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,110
I love the way you're possessive.

624
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
Don't tease me.

625
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,880
Something must be wrong with Li Xiong.

626
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,670
Your Highness,
you've been working so hard lately.

627
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,190
No way.

628
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,840
For Li Xiong!

629
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,990
Mr. Li?

630
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,160
What does it have to do with him?

631
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,600
Nothing.

632
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,320
Cutie,

633
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,400
it's an adult thing you don't understand.

634
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,270
Your Highness, you're saying
I'm childish again.

635
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh, Hongxiu,

636
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,040
time to use the money from the auction.

637
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,120
Yes.

638
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,080
But what do you need it for, Your Highness?

639
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,190
The moment we saved it for.

640
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,800
Your Majesty,

641
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,990
I'm so sorry.

642
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,800
I called you many times

643
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,910
but you didn't respond.

644
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,710
Worried about your safety, I broke in.

645
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,910
You should have knocked before coming in.

646
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,270
And what did you come for?

647
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,430
Your Majesty,

648
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,840
I have something important to report.

649
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,270
First, the assassin.

650
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,950
Bai Ke and Hu Die have made strict patrols

651
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,510
in the Palace and the city.

652
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,320
But they've found nothing unusual.

653
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,230
Can they find something unusual even
just once?

654
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,880
Don't report this to me ever again.

655
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,950
The second...

656
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,470
You'd better check it personally.

657
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,840
[Invitation to the Palace Ball]

658
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,160
Palace Ball?

659
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,360
Her Highness spent a lot of money on it

660
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,880
and you're especially invited.

661
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,000
[Your Majesty, you're invited
to the ball in Boyue Hall]

662
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,880
I knew it.

663
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,430
I knew she had a backup plan.

664
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Let's go check it.

665
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,400
Aye.

666
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,360
Master,

667
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,400
the carriage is ready.

668
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,430
Are you sure you'll go personally?

669
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,470
I think it's dangerous for you to show up.

670
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,510
Don't worry.

671
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,510
I used to show up in black.

672
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,190
But now, we'll show our original faces.

673
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,750
No one will suspect us.

674
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,040
I can't feel relieved
unless I see her personally.

675
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,120
Let's go.

676
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,710
Lan'er.

677
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,470
Hi, Miss.

678
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,950
This is my master.

679
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,190
He came to see you.

680
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
Greetings, sir.

681
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,670
To what honor do I owe this?

682
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,950
I can't believe you're still alive.

683
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,600
What... What do you mean?

684
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,160
I don't get it.

685
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,560
Do you really not recognize me, your father?

686
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,360
Lan'er.

687
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,910
Mother.

688
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,270
Hi, Madam.

689
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,080
Oh, Miss, it's you.

690
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,430
When you walked Lan'er back last time,

691
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,400
you kept calling her "My Lady".

692
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Are you her family?

693
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,190
Her original name is Su He.

694
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,360
She's My Lady

695
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,840
and my master is her father.

696
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,800
So, you're really her family.

697
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,510
I got her back five years ago.

698
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,190
She can't remember who she is

699
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,270
or where she used to live.

700
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,190
I'm here

701
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,800
to take her back home.
