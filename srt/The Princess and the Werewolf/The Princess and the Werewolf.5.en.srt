since you came back from visiting Her Grace,

25
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,190
you've been thinking.

What has she told you?

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,550
She said she would solve this case personally,

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
and requested termination of her grounding

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,630

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,520
Pretend I didn't come.

375
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,680
Goodbye.

376
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,590
Goodbye.

377
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,160
Your Majesty,

378
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,000
high five.

379
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,800
[Chun'er, bloodline: sparrow, pretty cook, gossipy]
Chun'er, you were quite lucky.

380
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,470
[Chun'er, bloodline: sparrow, pretty cook, gossipy]
Without Her Grace,

381
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,560
you would have been dead.

382
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,430
And I accused Her Grace wrongly.

383
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,000
But this morning,

384
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,880
I apologized to Her Grace

385
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,680
and she forgave me.

386
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,470
No wonder His Majesty wants her.

387
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,560
That's so big of her.

388
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,950
Compared to Her Grace,

389
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,190
Deputy Commander Hu Die is rather aggressive.

390
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,310
She nearly killed someone innocent.

391
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,830
She's just being jealous.

392
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,430
Before Her Grace came,

393
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,070
Commander Hu Die used to be radiant.

394
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,640
She was even my role model.

395
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,760
I'd just like to say,

396
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,950
Princess Qi Pa will be my only role model.

397
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,400
Deputy Commander Hu Die was jealous

398
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000
and she nearly wronged the queen-to-be.

399
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,830
Chun'er, after you write this down,

400
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,040
everyone in the Palace will know soon.

401
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,360
[Deputy Commander Hu Die was jealous]
[and she nearly wronged the queen-to-be]

402
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,470
You don't understand.

403
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,470
I'm just doing

404
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,640
what a gossipy girl should do.

405
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,640
Deputy Commander,

406
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,000
don't listen to them.

407
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,710
I know you were scrupulously fair

408
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,350
instead of wanting His Majesty.

409
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,230
That's right.

410
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,190
What are you talking about?

411
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,310
Who wants His Majesty?

412
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,710
Your Majesty,

413
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
the roast chicken you asked for.

414
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,760
Are... Are you all right?

415
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm fine.

416
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,070
Weird.

417
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,880
I had a dream about Kui Mulang.

418
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,830
I must have been too tired.

419
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,520
That ancient tree...

420
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,310
Congratulations, Your Grace.

421
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,590
You're no longer grounded, congratulations.

422
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,310
I brought you a roast chicken

423
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,920
for celebration.

424
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,000
I appreciate it.

425
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,310
But it's not a good moment for chicken.

426
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,680
What if Kui Mulang

427
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
loses his mind someday

428
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,280
and grounds me again?

429
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,920
We have to run.

430
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,230
Oh,

431
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,520
I had another idea.

432
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,350
And it's worth a shot.

433
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Your Grace,

434
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,710
I got some peanuts and green soybeans
from the Imperial Kitchen.

435
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,350
Don't you want to try some?

436
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,190
I'm extremely anxious to go home.

437
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,830
And this city is rather dangerous.

438
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,950
I was framed

439
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,430
and I was assassinated.

440
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,800
Kui Mulang even has a propensity for violence.

441
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,160
If I stay longer,

442
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,350
I might even lose my life.

443
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,520
A propensity for violence?

444
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,430
Don't you remember?

445
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,230
Last time, he nearly strangled me.

446
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,160
Oh, that.

447
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,350
Rest assured, Your Grace.

448
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,400
Worried about your safety,

449
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,920
I had that investigated.

450
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,950
That night, Kui Mulang,

451
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,950
after drinking too much,

452
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,560
was stabbed by you,

453
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and then fought the assassin.

454
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,830
So, his internal force vibrated
and he went savage.

455
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,590
Emotionally stable,

456
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,160
His Majesty never does violence.

457
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,070
Is that true?

458
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,350
Very true.

459
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,310
Even still,

460
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,110
he hurt me, didn't he?

461
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,040
He's dangerous, anyway.

462
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,040
We're on a serious time crunch.

463
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,430
Come on.

464
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,560
Check this.

465
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
[Beast City]

466
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,760
Notice anything different?

467
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,000
Please be clear, Your Grace.

468
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm leaving the city for this place.

469
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
[Beast Forest]

470
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,320
I failed to leave this city.

471
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,800
This forest is my only hope of going home.

472
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,990
But it's outside the city.

473
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,230
And the weather isn't good today.

474
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,470
Not a good day for the forest.

475
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,350
Li,

476
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,080
I feel something wrong with you.

477
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,470
What?

478
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,990
You seem to be not interested

479
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,270
in going back to Daxia State.

480
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,390
How's that possible?

481
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,200
We're in this together.

482
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,230
And...

483
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,990
I've been protecting you, haven't I?

484
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,630
You're good.

485
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,320
But when it comes to going home,

486
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,440
you've had

487
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,510
no ideas.

488
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I know it's hard for you

489
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,960
to work for Kui Mulang.

490
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,150
Yet, you've got nothing from him

491
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,560
about going back to Daxia.

492
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,320
Tell me.

493
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,230
Is there something wrong?

494
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,470
And what are you keeping from me?

495
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,440
I...

496
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,920
I promise I keep nothing from you.

497
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,920
It's just silly of me.

498
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,990
I failed to get useful information

499
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,390
for you, Your Grace.

500
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,080
And I'll make amends.

501
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,510
I'll be right back.

502
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,560
Your Majesty?

503
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,960
You were visiting Her Grace, weren't you?

504
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,800
She's doubting whether I'm a real guard.

505
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,150
Your Majesty, what did you do

506
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,270
that made her suspect you?

507
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,110
Just because I did nothing.

508
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,510
Then she suspected me,

509
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,510
thinking I helped with nothing.

510
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,920
Qi Pa searched the Palace inside and outside,

511
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,110
except for the misty forest outside the city.

512
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,870
So, she thinks

513
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,560
that's where she can go back to her state.

514
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,320
And she insists on going there.

515
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,990
It's really wise of Her Grace.

516
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,680
She's right.

517
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,470
Your Majesty, what are you going to do?

518
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm going to take her to the forest.

519
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,320
Anyway, the enchantment to Daxia State

520
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,720
can only be inactivated by me.

521
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,470
When she's there, she can't find a way back home.

522
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,750
Instead, she'll give up trying.

523
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,230
Good point.

524
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,390
Qi Pa is thinking about
how to get out of the city.

525
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,270
Go fetch something for me.

526
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
What is it?

527
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,630
Aye.

528
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,920
Hi, Mr. Liu Jun.

529
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,320
Mr. Liu Jun,

530
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,110
when I got drunk,

531
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
was I delirious?

532
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,870
Hongxiu, wake up.

533
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,750
Hongxiu.

534
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,600
Mr. Liu Jun.

535
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,720
Hongxiu, you're drunk.

536
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,320
No, you weren't.

537
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,080
Are you going to see Her Grace?

538
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,680
I picked some flowers.

539
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,960
Her Grace will love them.

540
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,800
His Majesty is taking Her Grace out.

541
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm afraid Hongxiu will hinder them.

542
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,470
I have something to tell you.

543
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,800
Wait for me here in a quarter.

544
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,350
Something to tell me?

545
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,110
I want... I want to show you something.

546
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,470
Your Grace!

547
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,320
I'm back.

548
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Already?

549
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,510
Yes.

550
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,720
I'm the most efficient guard in Daxia State.

551
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,750
Look.

552
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,560
What's this?

553
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,600
Exit Token.

554
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,630
Exit Token?

555
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,680
How did you get it?

556
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,350
With some small tricks.

557
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,720
For a guard like me from Daxia State,

558
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,840
this is nothing.

559
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,560
So, how?

560
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,840
I stole it.

561
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,720
Well done!

562
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,750
Indeed a great guard my mother nurtured.

563
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,230
Let's go right now.

564
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,110
Sure.

565
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,150
Your Grace,

566
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,080
we're going to the forest
to find a way back to Daxia State.

567
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,200
Why are you taking such heavy things?

568
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
In a forest,

569
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,630
we usually need some necessities for survival,

570
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,080
just in case.

571
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,600
And I came all this way to this city.

572
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,040
I should bring back some souvenirs

573
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,080
for people in my state.

574
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,230
It's wise of you, Your Grace.

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,440

the gate is right there.

582
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,270
Why did you stop?

583
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,680
I once tried to break out of it.

584
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,960
And you stole the Token.

585
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,150
We can't just go like this.

586
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,680
We can't?

587
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,840
Then how shall we go?

Go.

I...

Yes.

615
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
This is the forest.

616
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,160
This is where I woke up

617
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,120
and Hongxiu took me back to the Palace.

618
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,560
Your Grace, before it gets dark,

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,360
how many directions have we tried?

624
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,320
Nearly all directions, Your Grace.

625
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,880
Maybe there's no way back to Daxia State.

626
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,190
Impossible!

627
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,560
Is there really no way back home?

628
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,190
Your Grace,

629
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,880
what are you staring at?

630
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,230
Did you see that tree?

631
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,510
What tree?

632
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,040
That's not a tree.

633
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,040
That one.

634
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,560
The tallest and biggest tree in the middle.

635
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
I think I saw it somewhere before.

636
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,360
It's not special at all.

637
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,800
You can't have seen it before.

638
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,710
Let's keep searching.

639
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,080
I'm serious.

640
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,840
I had a dream of it in my afternoon nap.

641
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,430
Kui Mulang was in that dream, too.

642
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,360
Is that true?

643
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,190
A nightmare, anyway.

644
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,560
It was very ridiculous.

645
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,080
He held me up

646
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,840
and ran out from a tree.

647
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,800
That was a very, very big tree.

648
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,600
Just like this one.

649
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,120
It's just a coincidence.

650
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,670
Your Grace, stop thinking about it.

651
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,990
Let's go on with the search.

652
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,230
No way!

653
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,080
Maybe it's heaven-sent guidance for me.

654
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,710
Li Xiong,

655
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,270
how about we go check that tree?

656
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,230
My intuitive sense tells me

657
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,560
I'll find my way back home there.

658
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,560
- Your Grace!
- Go!

659
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,120
Mr. Liu Jun,

660
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,670
didn't you say

661
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,040
you wanted to show me something?

662
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,670
We've been standing here

663
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,190
for one hour.

664
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,400
What exactly are we looking at?

665
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,190
At...

666
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,600
At...

667
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,640
Umm...

668
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,750
Mr. Liu Jun,

669
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,190
I know it's hard for you to say something.

670
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,470
Actually, you don't have to say that.

671
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,080
Standing here with you

672
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,080
makes me happy enough.

673
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,230
But I have some business. I should go.

674
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,950
Hongxiu, I...

675
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,510
Did I mislead her?

676
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,470
That's it.

677
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,080
Exactly the tree in my dream.

678
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Such a big tree.

679
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,320
Behind this tree are more trees.

680
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,470
What about the way back home?

681
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,910
It must be near.

682
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,710
Let's look around.

683
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,270
This is such a big tree.

684
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,230
It must have some mechanisms.

685
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,190
See if we can find them.

686
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,400
How could this be?

687
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,710
Was that only a dream?

688
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,190
I thought this was the day

689
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,560
we could go back to Daxia State.
