00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,320
It still takes time.

192
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,070
Just now, Jing Muhan's eunuch sent news that

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,240
some people from Daxia came to the palace.

194
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,830
Kui Mulang indulges Qi Pa so much.

195
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,510
He even let her family into the palace.

196
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,070
Daxia again.

197
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,920
It seems that this place really exists.

198
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,830
But I've never heard of it.

199
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,270
The people in Daxia

200
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,680
seem to be reckless,

201
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,240
and they are quite dissatisfied with the Beast Clan.

202
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,390
According to Eunuch Ruo,

203
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Ma Yingxiong has been looking for Qi Pa
for a long time,

204
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,040

Xiniang.

206
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,000
Even if Daxia's people take her away,

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Kui Mulang can bring her back.

208
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
What's more, after Qi Pa leaves,

209
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,480
it will be difficult for us

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,480

to say to me last night.

229
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a pity that Kui Mulang

230
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,510
didn't give me a chance

231
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,830
to meet Her Grace privately.

232
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,390
It seems that Her Grace

233
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,590
didn't stay here voluntarily.

234
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,510
Could it be that Her Grace
wanted to escape but couldn't?

As the princess of Daxia,

238

she was forced to stay here.

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,990
Calm down.

380
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,510
Stop it. It's my fault.

381
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,800
Help!

382
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,630
Help!

383
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,600
Someone is bullying!

384
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,920
Help!

385
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,720
Your Royal Highness.

386
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,200
How is it?

387
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,750
It failed again.

388
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,080
Jerk!

389
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
[Laiqu Inn]

390
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Where has he been?

391
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,870
I can't find him.

392
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,510
No!

393
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,560
It must be that Kui Mulang

394
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,920
knew his identity

395
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,680
and took him away.

396
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,680
Are you going to see Her Grace, Your Majesty?

397
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,390
Yes.

398
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,870
Qi Pa hasn't seen Li Xiong for a long time.

399
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,840
She must be worried about him.

400
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,870
I'm going to comfort her.

401
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,200
What if Her Grace

402
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,920
wants to discuss with you about running away?

403
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,870
I will see.

404
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,440
It would not be feasible

405
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,750
to make her loathe

406
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,680
Kui Mulang even more now.

407
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,230
Also,

408
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,230
you have to send General Ma away immediately.

409
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,680
You have been getting along with Her Grace

410
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,600
as the Shadow Guard of Daxia.

411
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,080
If Her Grace mentioned it to General Ma,

412
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,600
it would be exposed.

413
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,230
Not bad. You got smart.

414
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,870
Report!

415
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,840
Your Majesty, something's up.

416
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,600
Ma Yingxiong is shouting
outside the palace gate for someone.

417
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,990
He must find out that Alai was missing
when he got up,

418
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,870
and came to ask me.

419
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,630
I will meet him in the hall.

420
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,040
Ask Her Grace here.

421
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,840
Yes.

422
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,440
Where is Alai?

423
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,270
Where did you take him to?

424
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,600
General Ma.

425
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,560
As the commander of Daxia,

426
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,630
do you know what evil things

427
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,750
Alai did to Her Grace?

428
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,680
Presumably you already know that

429
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,390
Alai is our Prince Consort.

430
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,720
He has a deep affection
for Her Grace.

431
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,720
Never try to provoke dissension.

432
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,080
Although this is your territory,

433
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,990
don't go too far.

434
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,230
Ma Yingxiong.

435
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,600
Your Grace, you came just in time.

436
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,470
They took Alai away.

437
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,150
Great.

438
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,350
I've wanted to punish this bastard

439
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,750
for a long time.

440
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,080
Noble ladies like you really look down on people.

441
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,390
How dare you hit me?

442
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,390
I will show you how good I am today.

443
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,200
That's it.

444
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,510
I already knew

445
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,630
what he was really like in Daxia.

446
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,870
It's just that

447
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,150
I didn't have time to tell you.

448
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,150
Your Grace.

449
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,630
It was my fault that

450
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,270
I mistrusted the traitor.

451
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,870
I even confided in him.

452
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,350
I am sorry for you.

453
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,720
I will kill myself.

454
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,080
If you really feel sorry for me,

455
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,750
do something to make it up to me.

456
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,680
I got it.

457
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,630
Thank you, Your Grace.

458
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,870
Where is Alai?

459
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,990
Where is he?

460
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,990
General Ma.

461
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,510
General Ma.

462
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,350
General Ma.

463
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,680
General Ma, save me.

464
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,990
General Ma. General Ma.

465
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,470
You brought me here.

466
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,630
By shaming me,

467
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,270
they are shaming you

468
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,200
and Daxia.

469
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,440
General Ma, save me.

470
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,350
No matter in the Beast Clan or Daxia,

471
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,510
the way to treat scum is the same.

472
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,470
You hit me?

473
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,680
Yes.

474
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,800
So what?

475
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,200
Your Grace.

476
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
I avenged you.

477
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,440
Did you kill him?

478
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,600
Death

479
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,040
is a gift to him.

480
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,920
Just putting such a villain in prison

481
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,230
is not enough to vent my anger.

482
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,600
General Ma is on the same page as His Majesty.

483
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,150
The Horse Department in the palace
has a job of dumping horse manure,

484
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,350
which is very suitable for Alai.

485
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,630
Good.

486
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,990
This kind of scum should stay here

487
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,630
to do the hardest and most tiring work.

488
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,510
Kui Mulang.

489
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,840
I am very satisfied with your arrangement.

490
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,870
Hard work for you.

491
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,750
Are your hands sore

492
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,110
after hitting him?

493
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,470
It's okay.

494
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,040
I mostly kicked him with my feet.

495
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,720
Your hands must be hurt.

496
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,470
Let me see.

497
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,080
Hold on.

498
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,600
Is shaking hands also Daxia's etiquette?

499
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,800
General Ma.

500
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,840
It's hard work for you to come a long way.

501
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,800
What are you doing?

502
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,110
Let me shake hands with him.

503
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,350
I have a little

504
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,470
backache today.

505
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,800
General Ma.

506
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,440
I'm going to marry Her Grace soon.

507
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,440
After our wedding,

508
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,560
I will personally send you back to Daxia.

509
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Are you really going to get married?

510
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,080
I did everything I said.

511
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,630
I can't wait any longer.

512
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,510
Liu Jun.

513
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,390
Send General Ma back to rest.

514
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,960
Yes.

515
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,920
There is nothing I can do.

516
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,510
I have no idea.

517
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,230
General Ma.

518
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,560
Please.

519
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,350
Well.

520
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,470
Are we really going to get married?

521
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,390
Yes, we are.

522
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,630
Alright.

523
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,110
It's too hasty.

524
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,750
At least in Daxia,

525
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,270
there will be a marriage proposal ceremony.

526
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,630
Marriage proposal ceremony?

527
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,920
Ma Yingxiong has a simple mind

528
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,040
and full of passion.

529
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,600
He can be a loophole to be penetrated.

530
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,840
Well done.

531
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,390
Keep an eye on him.

532
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,560
Come and report to me and Xiniang anytime.

533
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,230
Yes.

534
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,960
Mr. Liu Jun.

535
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,960
Ms. Hongxiu.

536
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
[Dragon and Phoenix Store]

537
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,720
Dragon and Phoenix Store.

538
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Are you going to marry someone?

539
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,270
You got me wrong.

540
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,920
The toilet paper is not enough.

541
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,470
Does Mr. Liu Jun fall in love?

542
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:46,960
Your Majesty.

543
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,200
This is what the clerk gave me

544
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,230
when I passed by a store called

545
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,630
Dragon and Phoenix Store in Daxia.

546
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,960
I just took it.

547
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,560
I didn't expect it to come in handy.

548
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,800
Give your beloved one

549
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,200
an impressive marriage proposal.

550
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,040
What's this?

551
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,150
It is said that it's called a proposal.

552
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,750
Dragon and Phoenix Store

553
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,440
is a store that specializes

554
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
in weddings for newlyweds.

555
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
They also cover the business of marriage proposals.

556
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
These are the brochures for their promotion.

557
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,390
Daxia is really amazing.

558
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,750
You are watching the scenery,

559
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,750
and I am watching you.

560
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,320
You are the most beautiful scenery in my eyes.

561
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,630
What a poetic sentence.

562
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,600
I almost forgot that

563
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,110
I have to find Qi Pa today.

564
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,150
She hasn't seen Li Xiong for a long time,

565
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,960
so she might have doubted it.

566
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,960
You are right, Your Majesty.

567
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,230
The princess must have been
trying to ask me for help

568
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,470
when she shook hands with me.

569
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,470
How can I get in touch with her?

570
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,080
General Ma.

571
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,870
Time to eat.

572
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,270
Wait.

573
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,080
You feed me these things all day

574
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,440
without any meat dishes.

575
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,270
Are you looking down on me?

576
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,470
Is this edible?

577
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,630
I want to enter the palace.

578
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,270
I'm going to check

579
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,920
if Her Grace is also treated so harshly?

580
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,080
I'm afraid...

581
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,840
I want to enter the palace.

582
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,800
I want to meet Her Grace.

583
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,470
Yes.

584
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,750
I'm going to ask for instructions.

585
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,110
Hope it works.

586
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,150
Your Grace.

587
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
This is the best way I can think of.

588
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,600
Chun'er, where are you going?

589
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,600
Don't mention it.

590
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,720
General Ma from Daxia

591
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,350
thought the food outside the palace was not good.

592
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,440
The superior

593
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,470
asked the Imperial Kitchen

594
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,320
to prepare and send some exquisite dishes for him.

595
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,920
Why is he so picky?

596
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,200
Exactly.

597
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,320
But he is also from Daxia.

598
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,040
For the sake of Her Grace,

599
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,110
I will take it.

600
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,750
Kui Mulang

601
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
is really scheming.

602
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,350
He is preventing me from
delivering messages to Ma Yingxiong,

603
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,960
and preventing Li Xiong from coming to see me.

604
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,870
What should I do?

605
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:43,840
[Yaohua Palace]

606
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,040
The following is
the King's oral instruction.

607
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,630
You two don't have to

608
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,720
guard here from now on.

609
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,720
If something goes wrong, it's on me.

610
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

611
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,960
Li Xiong?

612
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,320
I just missed you.

613
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,630
You missed me?

614
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,720
You took the guards away?

615
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,110
Good for you.

616
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,560
It's nothing.

617
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,080
You came just in time.

618
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,990
I was just worried that

619
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,840
no one could help me contact Ma Yingxiong.

620
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,750
Li Xiong.

621
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,200
We can go home in no time.

622
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,630
Yes.

623
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,040
However, Your Grace,

624
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,150
I can't contact General Ma.

625
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,990
Why not?

626
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,920
Look.

627
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,750
General Ma has a fierce personality

628
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,630
and is not discreet.

629
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm worried that he will expose my identity

630
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
and provoke Kui Mulang's suspicion.

631
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,230
And I also suggest that

632
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,200
you don't mention me to General Ma,

633
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,510
so as not to cause trouble.

634
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,390
You are right.

635
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,560
Although Ma Yingxiong is loyal,

636
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,470
his IQ

637
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,840
is indeed not high.

638
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,680
There's no one here now.

639
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,080
We can just go there.

640
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,870
No!

641
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,600
What's wrong?

642
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,800
Your Grace.

643
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,630
Think about it.

644
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,800
Kui Mulang is worried that
you want to escape all day long,

645
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,350
so he will definitely

646
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,630
set up many checkpoints outside.

647
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm afraid that if you take the risk,
you will be hurt again.

648
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,680
Alright.

649
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,230
I won't force my way.

650
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,680
I'll think about it again.

651
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,600
I'll help you.

652
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,870
Anyway, as soon as I have a solution,

653
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,680
I will let you know as soon as possible.

654
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:47,800
Okay.

655
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,630
Kui Mulang arranged some chores for me.

656
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,040
I am leaving.

657
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,920
Go ahead.

658
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,400
Why does it take so long?

659
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,430
Kui Mulang

660
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,750
doesn't take me seriously at all.

661
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,400
General Ma, you really have a bad temper.

662
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,470
Honey trap?

663
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,710
What honey trap?

664
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,160
Not at all.

665
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Sorry for that.

666
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,990
Miss.

667
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,950
I want to go to the palace to meet Her Grace.

668
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,230
Sorry, General Ma.

669
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm just a maid.

670
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,840
It's useless for you to ask me this.

671
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,800
Well.

672
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,430
Ms. Chun'er

673
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,840
is really special.

674
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,480
[Ma Yingxiong is dissatisfied with Kui Mulang]
[He takes fancy to Chun'er of the Imperial Kitchen]

675
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,470
Ma Yingxiong takes fancy to Chun'er.

676
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,270
Haitang.

677
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,990
Here's your chance to redeem yourself.

678
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,310
Yes.

679
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,750
At your disposal, Master.

680
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,990
What you have to do is to

681
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,840
give this Debilitating Powder to Ma Yingxiong,

682
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,680
and let him find a way to use it on Kui Mulang.

683
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,600
Ma Yingxiong has a deep hostility
towards Kui Mulang.

684
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,950
It would be best if we could

685
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,360
get rid of Kui Mulang
with the help of Ma Yingxiong.

686
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,600
Ask Jing Muhan for news at any time.

687
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,160
I will sync messages with you.

688
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes.

689
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,080
How can I approach Ma Yingxiong?

690
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,950
Ma Yingxiong seems to take fancy

691
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,230
to Chun'er of the Imperial Kitchen.

692
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,640
Got it.

693
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,440
One more important thing.

694
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,600
While in chaos,

695
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,710
kill Qi Pa.

696
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,360
Don't let me down again.

697
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Yes.

698
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,120
You may leave.

699
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,640
Yes.

700
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,750
Xiniang.

701
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,080
Go and tell Jing Muhan

702
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,270
to wait temporarily.

703
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,950
Just let Eunuch Ruo inquire about the news.

704
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:15,840
Yes.

705
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,120
General Ma is so ignorant.

706
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,950
Sachet.

707
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
The sachets used in the palace.

708
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,950
Miss.

709
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,160
People in the palace

710
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,640
only use my sachets.

711
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,950
Smell it.

712
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,710
Does it smell good?

713
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,950
Indeed.

714
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,600
Embroidered sachets. Exclusive secret recipe.

715
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,710
I want this one and this one.

716
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,200
Uniqueness guaranteed.

717
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,880
Miss.

718
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,200
My sachets are all unique.

719
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,230
Just smell it

720
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,880
and you will know its quality.

721
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,640
What do you mean?

722
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,710
Are you stealing away my business?

723
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,310
We each make our own money.

724
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,710
Miss.

725
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,640
I think I have a special affinity with you.

726
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,510
In fact, I have better sachets at home.

727
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,640
I guarantee you will smell better than flowers

728
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,270
after wearing those sachets,

729
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,710
and even butterflies will chase you.

730
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,680
Seriously?

731
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,550
Of course.

732
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,120
But

733
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,440
I generally don't sell

734
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,750
superior sachets to others.

735
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,270
They are all at home.

736
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,710
Would you like to have a look?

737
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,200
Let's go.

738
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,120
Madam.

739
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,440
I'm so sorry.

740
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,030
Miss.

741
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,840
You said you would buy my products.

742
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,470
How could you do this?

743
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,840
Your Majesty.

744
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,200
I am dizzy from reading.

745
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,750
How to propose?

746
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,270
These methods seem to work,

747
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,750
but I don't know if Qi Pa will like them.

748
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,640
Why don't you ask Hongxiu for advice?

749
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,230
She's a girl

750
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,880
and she serves Her Grace.

751
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,030
I...

752
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,510
Isn't it inappropriate for me

753
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,120
to ask Hongxiu this?

754
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,990
Why?

755
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,080
If I took the initiative to ask her
about marriage and the like,

756
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,510

766
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,510
