00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,960
your marriage

192
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,400
has become the biggest concern

193
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
[King Zhao, elder brother of Qi Pa's father Qi Sheng, old acquaintance]
of me and His Majesty.

194
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,310
Think about it.

195
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,920
The girls in Daxia

196
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
all start their families at the age of 15.

197
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,190
You have become

198
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,550
the oldest leftover girl in Daxia.

199
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,600
Listen.

200
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,720
Today I have to...

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,110
[Xing Ping, granddaughter of King Zhao and Lyu Li]
Choose a man for you.

202
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,800
She is indeed your granddaughter.

203
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,360
She imitates well.

204
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,400
Xing Ping did a good job.

205
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,360
[King Zhao, elder brother of Qi Pa's father Qi Sheng, old acquaintance]
Listen, your aunt is right.

206
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,110
Look.

207
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,600
Even Xing Ping knows it,

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,870
why don't you understand?

209
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,600
You will be twenty soon.

210
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,310
Twenty years old!

211
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,510
Twenty!

212
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
When I was twenty,

213
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,750
my child was three.

214
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,160
Don't you envy the relationship

215
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,400
between me and your aunt?

216
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,600
There is nothing comparable to

217
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
your relationship.

218
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,960
Alright, aunt.

219
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,190
No worries.

220
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,510
Since you are here,

221
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,750
let's appreciate the birthday present

222
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,670
my mother sent me

223
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,160
from Europa.

224
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't you understand

225
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,160
why she sent you this?

226
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,070
No.

227
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,800
It means you lack a man.

228
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,400
This...

229
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Aunt.

230
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,310
You think too much.

231
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,160
No way.

232
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,720
I've been with her for a long time.

233
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,510
I know clearly what's on her mind.

234
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,430
Alright.

235
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,920
Let's take a good look

236
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,190
at the high-quality males
I have selected for you.

237
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,400
Come in.

238
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,550
This is Gou Qi,
the Prime Minister's son.

239
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,960
He has outstanding talents

240
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,550
and is known as the prince of Allegro.

241
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,670
Wang Feihu, the son of General Wang.

242
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,070
He is strong enough

243
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
to protect the princess.

244
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,310
Good.

245
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,110
Lieutenant General Alai,

246
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,840
25 years old,

247
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
has a good-looking face

248
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
and professional skill.

249
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,630
Among so many candidates,

250
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,550
he is the best.

251
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,160
Stop.

252
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,310
Why again?

253
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
Aunt.

254
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,550
You made me confused.

255
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,160
Why don't you just pick your favorite one?

256
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,920
They are all excellent.

257
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,310
I'll have a closer look.

258
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,510
Pa.

259
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Pa.

260
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,110
Where is she?

261
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Aunt ran away.

262
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,920
Why didn't you stop her?

263
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,190
Let's go back, Lyu Li.

264
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,800
No way.

265
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,510
Before Pa's marriage is resolved,

266
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,160
I can never feel at ease.

267
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,190
I'm going to marry her today.

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
[Liu Jun, bloodline: snake]
[Naturally toxic, insulated from intimacy]

269
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,920
Your Majesty, for five years,

270
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
you always came to Daxia across the enchantment,

271
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,360
just to find the lost Holy Pearl.

272
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,470
But your current body

273
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,680
can't afford to be tossed around.

274
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Why don't I just stay here this time

275
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,360
and pretend to be a citizen of Daxia

276
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,360
to help you find it?

277
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,390
No.

278
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,830
You have never seen that woman.

279
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,440
And

280
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,560
we only have Daxia's palace
that we haven't looked for yet.

281
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,470
The palace is heavily guarded.

282
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,390
It's safer if I go in person.

283
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,590
What's more, you can't sense
the existence of Holy Pearl.

284
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,070
But I am worried that
if the enchantment is opened frequently,

285
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,800
the existence of Beast Clan
will be discovered by the outside world.

286
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,270
I will be very careful about this.

287
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,680
Don't worry.

288
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,630
Yes.

289
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,390
Zimei.

290
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,630
The Horse Department has a few new horses
from the Western Regions.

291
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,710
Let's go choose some for my uncle.

292
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,630
Ma Yingxiong.

293
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,320
Your Grace.

294
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,510
Zimei.

295
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,830
Nice horse.

296
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,710
This is the ferghana horse
to be used in the army,

297
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,630
and it just arrived today.

298
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,830
Let me try.

299
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,320
Your Grace, be careful.

300
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,630
Protect Her Grace!

301
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,070
This is the power of Holy Pearl.

302
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,390
I finally found you.

303
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,560
Your Majesty.

304
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,880
This is...

305
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,030
It's her.

306
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,320
The Holy Pearl is in her body.

307
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,590
Let's take her back.

308
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,920
Great.

309
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,150
Your Majesty.

310
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,320
It must be because
you just used your power.

311
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,150
Your current body can't stand that.

312
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,840
Your Grace! Your Grace!

313
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,720
Your Grace! Your Grace!

314
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,720
Your Majesty.

315
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,200
Let's go first.

316
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,750
Now that we've met this woman,

317
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,230
we can take the long view.

318
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,480
Your Grace!

319
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,600
Your Grace!

320
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,440
Your Grace!

321
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,720
Your Grace, are you okay?

322
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,200
Your Grace!

323
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,960
Your Grace!

324
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
Your Grace, are you okay?

325
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,320
Where is the horse?

326
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,080
The horse was gone when I came.

327
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,230
Weird.

328
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,990
I just fell off the horse.

329
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,560
Why am I not hurt at all?

330
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,480
I was the one who frightened Your Grace.

331
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
I will kill myself.

332
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,390
Save it.

333
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,270
Let's go.

334
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,600
The man called her Your Grace just now.

335
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,800
Your Majesty.

336
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,390
Let's get ready next time.

337
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,320
We can definitely bring this Daxia princess

338
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,200
back to the Beast Clan.

339
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,440
Your Majesty.

340
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
Your hand.

341
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,230
Come on.

342
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,600
Big news! Big news!

343
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,800
Princess Qi Pa is about to get married.

344
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,110
Her fiancé is the outstanding Alai.

345
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,440
The whole world joins in the jubilation.

346
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,150
Big news! Big news!

Princess Qi Pa is about to get married.

348
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,680
Her fiancé is the outstanding Alai.

349
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,600
The whole world joins in the jubilation.

350

[Jinhua Palace]

351
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,600
You all know what to do?

352
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,270
Yes.

353
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,840
Perform your own duties.

354
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,030
Remember.

355
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,720
Don't bother them with cultivating feelings.

356
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,440
Go.

357
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,920
[Ma Yingxiong, Daxia's general]
Yes, Your Majesty.

358
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,990
Go now.

359
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,150
Luckily, I have you.

360
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,600
Pa's marriage is finally resolved.

361
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,360
[Lyu Li, Queen of Daxia, wife of King Zhao, old Acquaintance]

362
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,480
[King Zhao, elder brother of Qi Pa's father Qi Sheng, old acquaintance]
You are so great.

363
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,230
Alai.

364
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,390
I have something to say to you.

365
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
Your Grace, hold on.

366
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
Recently, due to military training,

367
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,150
my injuries have recurred.

368
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,270
Could you apply medicine for me first?

369
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,630
Can't you do it yourself?

370
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,510
Okay, let me see.

371
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,960
It should be

372
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,760
going smoothly now.

373
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,480
Let's go.

374
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,910
By the way,

375
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
I won't marry you.

376
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,240
So in a while, after applied with medicine,

377
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,070
you should go.

378
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,960
Your Grace.

379
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,720
It was not easy for me to stand out
and be chosen.

380
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,390
Why do you think should I quit?

381
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
What do you mean?

382
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,790
What are you doing?

383
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,520
No one is here.

384
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,360
You jerk!

385
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,600
Your morality is corrupted.

386
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
You are so good at pretending.

387
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,720
My eyes!

388
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
I am done with you.

389
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,120
Goodbye.

390
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240
My eyes!

391
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,720
Where are you going?

392
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,270
We haven't spent the night together yet.

393
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,960
You have to be responsible for me.

394
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,030
Where are you going?

395
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,190
Listen, watch your behavior.

396
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
I will give you one last chance.

397
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,910
Chance?

398
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,270
Who are you?

399
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,070
I'm the princess's fiancé.

400
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,520
How dare you stop me?

401
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
So you are the princess of Daxia.

402
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,720
No wonder I haven't found you
for so many years.

403
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm indeed Princess Qi Pa.

404
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,910
Who are you?

405
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,310
So much nonsense.

406
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,030
Piss off.

407
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,880
Mysterious cool guy.

408
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
There should be no enmity between us.

409
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,480
It's getting late. We...

410
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,240
Your Majesty.

411
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,670
Are you okay?

412
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm fine.

413
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,910
I got her.

414
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,240
Your Majesty.

415
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,430
The pattern of this badge is weird.

416
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,520
[Xia]
It must be a unique symbol of Daxia.

417
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,960
Take it.

418
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,600
Maybe it will be useful in the future.

419
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,390
Yes.

420
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,520
Let's go back.

421
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,190
I finally found you.

422
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,000
Your Majesty, you look concerned.

423
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,640
Do you remember
what happened five years ago?

424
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,190
Back then, I worked so hard

425
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,000
to obtain the Holy Pearl
from the Holy Mountain.

426
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,270
Before I could absorb it,

427
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,550
I was tracked down
by Jing Muhan and the mysterious man.

428
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,120
I wanted to go through the enchantment

429
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,070
to avoid being hunted down.

430
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,390
But I was badly injured and lost the Holy Pearl.

431
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,640
Your Majesty, don't worry.

432
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,880
As long as you retrieve the Holy Pearl
from Daxia's Princess's body,

433
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,910
you can restore your inner force

434
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,910
and you don't have to suffer from
changing appearance day and night.

435
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Hurry up.

436
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,150
Bring the princess back.

437
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,960
Yes.

438
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:06,720
Let's go.

439
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,910
Your Majesty.

441
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm fine.

442
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,310
Your Majesty.

443
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,030
Your physical condition is nowhere near
what it was during the day.

444
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,790
I have advised you to

445
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,670
try not to consume too much at night.

446
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,960
Liu Jun.

447
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,910
Immediately arrange for Hongxiu
to send her back to the palace.

448
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,760
What about you?

449
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,030
I need to meditate right away.

450
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,270
Remember

451
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,150
to keep her safe.

452
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,720
Go.

453
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,030
Yes.

454
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,910
Who's that?

455
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,000
My head...

456
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,150
Where am I?

457
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,310
Where is this place?

458
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,910
Who's that man in black?

459
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,520
Wait.

460
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,120
What is he going to do to me?

461
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,550
Why did he leave me

462
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,790
in this forest?

463
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,550
Qi Pa, calm down.

464
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,880
The forest should be about fifteen miles

465
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,760
southeast of the capital.

466
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,840
As long as I find the right direction,
I can definitely go home.

467
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,120
It's not here anyway.

468
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,430
Someone's there.

469
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,800
Wait.

470
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,920
Miss.

471
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,080
I am Princess Qi Pa of Daxia.

472
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,080
Where are you heading to?

473
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,030
Are you going back to the city?

474
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Could you give me a ride?

475
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,270
So you are the princess.

476
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,150
Greetings to Your Grace.

477
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,230
You know me?

478
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,920
Yes.

479
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,150
I came here specially to take you back
to the palace

480
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,440
[Hongxiu, bloodline: cat, fast, soft and caring]
at the order of King.

481
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,320
Your Grace.

482
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,750
Let's go.

483
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,270
Please get on the carriage.

484
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,320
Which palace are you from?

485
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,720
How come I never saw you before?

486
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,840
Which palace?

487
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,800
I'm from the Royal Palace.

488
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
My name is Hongxiu.

489
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,600
I am here to take you back to the palace
by the King's order.

490
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,510
King?

491
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,630
Daxia has no King.

492
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,350
Your Grace.

493
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,560
What are you talking about?

494
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,440
The King I am talking about

495
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,110
is King of Beast Clan.

496
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,110
Kui Mulang.

497
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,230
Beast?

498
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,150
What?

499
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,270
Kui Mulang.

500
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,560
Your Grace.

501
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,870
Where is the Daxia

502
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,200
you just mentioned?

503
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,840
I'm Daxia's princess Qi...

504
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,560
Stop kidding me.

505
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
How can anyone

506
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,480
not know about Daxia?

507
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,870
Daxia is an amazing place.

508
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,750
Don't you know my father Qi Sheng

509
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,510
and my mother Zhang Pengpeng?

510
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,560
No.

511
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,150
I don't know of

512
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,200
any other places in this world

513
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,440
other than Beast Clan.

514
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,200
Miss.

515
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,390
I'm going to the bathroom.

516
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm going to tackle

517
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,750
a very important matter now.

518
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,870
Key issue.

519
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,720
Wait here for me.

520
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,960
I will go with you.

521
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm going to the lavatory.

522
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,800
What?

523
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
You can't leave.

524
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,150
I'm here to take you back to the palace.

525
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,440
No, it's a bowel movement.

526
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,960
I don't need a company.

527
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,230
Just wait here for me.

528
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,680
I can't stand it any longer.

529
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,990
Your Grace, come back soon.

530
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,870
I see.

531
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,630
Your Grace, slow down.

532
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,320
Your Grace.

533
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,030
You can easily get lost at night.

534
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,630
Don't go too far.

535
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,110
I see.

536
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,320
Wait for me.

537
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,960
How long will it take.

538
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,480
So troublesome.

539
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,150
I got a bad stomach.

540
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,560
Just wait for me.

541
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,560
Your Grace.

542
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,750
Your Grace, are you okay?

543
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,270
Your Grace, are you okay?

544
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,840
Why are you running so fast?

545
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,990
I've always been running fast.

546
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,840
Your Grace.

547
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,030
Have you finished?

548
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,720
Let's go back.

549
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,350
You...

550
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,630
Let me go!

551
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,110
You are kidnapping me.

552
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,440
You know?

553
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,840
Your Grace.

554
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,510
Mr. Liu Jun specially ordered me

555
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,600
to take you back to the palace
from the forest.

556
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,680
- Liu Jun?
- Is it because you don't like me that

557
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,320
you don't want to go with me?

558
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,720
It's not like that.

559
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,480
I want to escape.

560
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,630
But with so many of you,

561
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,480
I can't make it.

562
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,390
So you are willing to go with me?

563
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,630
Are you okay?

564
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,390
I'm fine, Your Grace.

565
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,270
What's this place?

566
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Beast Clan.

567
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,480
How did you run so fast just now?

568
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,680
Because I am a cat.

569
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,320
A cat?

570
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,630
Your Grace.

571
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,990
What kind of animal are you?

572
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,270
Animal? Zodiac?

573
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,870
I am a rabbit.

574
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,750
Mr. Horse, here you are.

575
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,510
Horse?

576
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,030
They are all horses.

577
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,920
Let's go.

578
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,600
Hold on.

579
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,480
Miss.

580
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,870
Is it necessary?

581
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,320
If I don't do this

582
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,920
and you run away like you did just now,

583
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,150
the King will blame me.

584
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,990
Mr. Horse.

585
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,680
Please be faster.

586
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,510
Sure.

587
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,150
They really are as fast as horses.

588
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,600
Your King

589
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,480
is named...

590
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,720
Kui Mulang.

591
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,960
Are all his men so powerful?

592
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,320
This is the swift horses
specially chosen by the King for you.

593
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,750
Even people with martial arts in Daxia

594
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,080
can't run as fast as them.

595
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,150
Are they gifted?

596
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,680
Miss.

597
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,200
Why are you holding me?

598
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,600
Your Grace.

599
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,320
I am not afraid of your escape.

600
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,870
But the carriage is wobbly.

601
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,200
If I don't hold you steady,

602
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,750
I'm afraid you'll fall out.

603
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:24,990
Hongxiu.

604
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,200
Hongxiu.

605
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,720
If you keep holding me this tight,

606
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm really going to throw up.

607
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,990
Throw up?

608
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,560
Your Grace, hold on.

609
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,480
We will be right there.

610
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,840
Mr. Horse, faster.

611
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,080
Seriously?

612
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,960
By the way, Your Grace.

613
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,870
Is Your Grace your name?

614
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,750
Don't you have a princess?

615
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,630
My name is Qi Pa.

616
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,510
Your Grace is my nickname.

617
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,920
That's what everyone calls me.

618
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,600
You can call me the same.

619
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,680
Okay, Your Grace.

620
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,680
You just said you were a cat.

621
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,600
So what is your King?

622
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
Our King is a wolf.

623
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,800
Don't you know this?

624
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,030
There are still people
who don't know our King.

625
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,560
Your Grace, here we are.

626
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,480
Your Grace.

627
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,960
Your Grace, are you okay?

628
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,320
Your Grace.

629
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,750
We are now in the Beast City.

630
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,350
I'll show you around.

631
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,520
[Beast City]

632
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,390
Let's go.

633
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,480
Wait.

634
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,080
- Okay.
- Okay.

635
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,720
Your Grace, look.

636
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,320
The tallest and brightest

637
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,720
is the Beast Royal Palace.

638
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,600
So spectacular.

639
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,600
But why the people here...?

640
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,480
There's more fun inside.

641
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,150
I will show you. Let's go.

642
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,720
Why is this person eating bamboo shoots?

643
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,080
Pandas eat bamboo shoots, of course.

644
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,350
It is raw.

645
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,110
Let's go.

646
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,840
Look at this woman.

647
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,630
She is spinning.

648
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,320
Yes.

649
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,680
Because she is a silkworm.

650
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,440
Silkworm?

651
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,470
Maybe I just passed out

652
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,920
and retched,

653
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,550
so my memory is a little messed up.

654
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,440
Give me some time.

655
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,550
Your Grace.

656
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,160
Why did you forget such an important thing?

657
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,270
The Beast Clan encountered a plague

658
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,750
a hundred years ago.

659
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,920
The King at that time

660
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
found a folk prescription from an ancient book,

661
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,590
and used different animals as medicines

662
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,240
for different people's physiques,

663
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,680
and this cured everyone.

664
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,240
So from then on, we all have

665
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,030
the characteristics of different animals.

666
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,510
There is more fun inside.

667
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,440
Let's go.

668
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,880
[Haitang, bloodline: chameleon, disguise master]

669
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,960
Look, that's delicious.

670
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,350
Take a look.

671
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,350
High-quality rouge.

672
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,920
- No need.
- Pay one for three.

673
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,240
Don't miss it.

674
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,030
Hongxiu.

675
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,400
What's this place?

676
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,510
[Yuyan Shop]
This is a newly opened rouge shop.

677
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,720
Your Grace.

678
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,750
I heard that the proprietress here

679
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,880
is very good at makeup.

680
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,240
And she's very beautiful.

681
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Now this place

682
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,590
has become a place

683
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,960
where women in the clan rush to go.

684
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,030
I haven't been there yet.

685
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,030
Let's go take a look.

686
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,350
We are finally here.

687
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,310
You are curious
and you haven't been there.

688
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,920
I'm also curious. Let's go.

689
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,350
Give us one.

690
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,400
Here you are.

691
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,200
Here.

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,070
Hongxiu.

693
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,550
Look how many colors of rouge are there.

694
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,920
It fits you.

695
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,590
I also think so.

696
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,440
I just got paid.

697
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,790
Should I buy one?

698
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,030
Of course.

699
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,750
But...

700
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,880
Hongxiu,

701
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,960
do you have anyone you like?

702
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,270
Of course not.

703
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,550
I don't care about Mr. Liu Jun at all.

704
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,550
Liu Jun?

705
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,440
Hongxiu, look.

706
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,920
With such a beautiful color

707
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,310
on your face,

708
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,480
you will be much more cute than now.

709
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,030
By then, Liu Jun will be attracted to you.

710
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,440
Take a try.

711
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,310
Your Grace.

712
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,240
Wait here for me.

713
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,070
I'll be right back.

714
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,550
I want one.

715
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,830
Excuse me. Get one for me.

716
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,270
Sorry, sorry.

717
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,790
Madam, what are you doing?

718
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,960
Wait, miss.

719
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you sick?

720
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,200
Why is the aura on your body

721
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,790
completely different from that of our clan?

722
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,880
How come?

723
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,720
I just added extra fragrance

724
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,920
to my shower today.

725
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,550
Madam.

726
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,880
Something's wrong.

727
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,030
It's definitely not fragrance.

728
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,110
Miss.

729
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,160
I have never felt the smell of you.

730
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,030
Mrs. Dog has the sharpest nose.

731
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,550
She's definitely right.

732
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,030
Miss.

733
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,960
Which family are you from?

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,110
If you don't feel well,
see a doctor right away.

735
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,920
Right, we will take you home.

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,310
- Yes.
- Exactly.

737
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,350
Go to see a doctor.

738
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,750
I am not sick.

739
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,680

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,550
Miss.

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What's wrong with her?

742
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,960
The princess is from a different race.

743
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,720
It must be hard for her to stay here.

744
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,270
I've made up my mind.

745
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,440
I will give her an unshakable status,

746
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,750
so that no one dares to despise her.

747
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,720
What's your plan, Your Majesty?

748
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,790
Marry her.
