[Episode 6]

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,720
Your Grace,

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,950
let's find shelter from the rain.

20
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,550
Come on, Your Grace.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,590
Go.

22
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,110
You brought so many useless things for survival,

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,190
but none of them can even make fire.

24
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,520
If you really feel too cold,

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
lean on me.

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,320
I thought

27
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,440
we could return to Daxia State today.

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,630
Who would know...

29
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Even if you can't return, it's fine.

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
You're not alone.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,390
I'll always be there for you.

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Li Xiong,

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,270
why did you become a guard in my palace?

34
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,630
How about your family?

35
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,750
I...

36
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,440
If you find it hard to disclose something,

37
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,630
you can keep it to yourself.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,910
It's not like that.

39
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm the elder son.

40
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,030
My parents have

41
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,470
a second son.

42
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,960
You have a little brother?

43
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,080
My brother was very naughty.

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,030
He had always been making trouble.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,110
But because he was young,

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,550
my parents favored him greatly.

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,110
So, since I was little,

48
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,960
my father had been strict with me.

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
Possibly because

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,440
he wanted me to be my brother's role model

51
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
and take over the family business.

52
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,000
So, since I was a child,

53
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,160
I had never dared to make a mistake.

54
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,200
I didn't even dare to say no.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,760
Hardly had I started my adult life

56
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,760
when my parents passed away.

57
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,070
At that time,

58
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,760
my father handed over our family business

59
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,830
and my brother to me.

60
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,600
But I never expected

61
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,040
this family business

62
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,480
would cause conflicts between my brother and me.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,270
That was really hard for you.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,160
So, to avoid scrambling with your brother,

65
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,720
you gave up your family business

66
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,720
and became a guard, right?

67
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,600
Yes, in some sense.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,350
Compared to you, my life is really great.

69
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,600
My parents never restrain me too much.

70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,640
Whatever I want to do,

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,200
they let me do it.

72
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,830
I can always follow my heart.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,670
All they want is that I can live happily.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,640
Your parents are wonderful.

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,760
Thy is why

you're as ebullient as the sun.

78
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,440
love each other more.

79
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,880
In my life,

80
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,640
if I have to be in a relationship,

81
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,670
I wish I could be like them.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,600
I want a good husband who connects with me

83
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
and we'll be a perfect couple.

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,230
You will.

I'm really worried about Her Grace.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,950

[Liu Jun, bloodline: snake]
[Naturally toxic, insulated from intimacy]

She'll be all right.

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120

That's not true.

You got it wrong, Deputy Commander Hu.

101
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,950
Her Grace went out and caught a cold.

102

His Majesty took her back

103

Even before they get married.

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,480
Shameful.

106

Who do you mean shameful?

107
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
His Majesty or Her Grace?

I heard Her Grace was no longer grounded

112

and she got out of the city with Mr. Li.

113
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,510

we'll be so relieved.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,200
We should go.

116

Bodies of that man and his grandson

were buried in the yard.

124

The document of this place was signed in advance.

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,790
No one would notice it.

126
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,230
They had this place searched

127
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,830
and they wouldn't come again.

He must be thinking that I got out of the city.

131

But Haitang is still in prison.

Oh, yes. Your fever is finally gone.

did the fever confuse you?

You're in your chamber.

150
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
I know.

151
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,760
But why am I here?

152
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,640
Your Majesty carried you back in his arms.

153
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,110
Yesterday, you went out for fun

154
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,670
caught a cold, and fell into a coma.

155

His Majesty carried you back in his arms.

156
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,200
Last night, he stayed here for you

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,910
and fed you some decoction.

158
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,790
He just left this morning.

159
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I've never seen His Majesty look that anxious.

you're the happiest woman in our clan.

Your Grace, what are you thinking?

164

I helped you get changed.

165

You and His Majesty aren't married yet.

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,350
His Majesty wouldn't do that.

167

Why is it Kui Mulang who took me back?

168
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,550
What about Li Xiong? Where's he?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,280
Mr. Li?

170
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,790
Oh, yes.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
I heard you got out of the city with him.

172
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,350
But why isn't he back?

173
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Where's Kui Mulang?

174
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,550
In his chamber, I guess.

Your Grace, where are you going?

177
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,670
You haven't taken the decoction yet.

You seductive woman!

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,880
How could you even sneak out

184

with a guard?

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,110
You don't deserve the care from His Majesty!

Sneak out with a guard?

187
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,910
Where's Li Xiong? Where's he?

188
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,000
How do I know?

189
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,350
So, he's gone.

190
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,440
That's nice.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
His Majesty must have executed him with anger!

192
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
Great for His Majesty.

193
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,790
What did you say?

194
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
I said,

195
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,320
His Majesty should have also punished you

196
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
and expelled you

197
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,550
to defend our principles.

198
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,910
What do you mean by executed?

199
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,230
He did something insubordinate.

200
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,000
According to palace rules,

201
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,110
he was beheaded, I guess.

202
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,080
You!

203
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,670
Her Grace must have given up.

204
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,710
If she doesn't run off again,

205
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,880
I'll be relieved.

206
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,910
Your Majesty,

207
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,550
I have to see you!

208
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,000
Come in.

209
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,350
Your Majesty,

210
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,350
bad news.

211
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,880
Stewardess Qing is dead.

212
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,400
Be specific.

213
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,110
The warden reported

214
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,200
that the prison was on fire.

215
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,350
I took my men to put it out.

216
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,670
But the fire was so big

217
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,440
that two people died.

218
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,790
Judging from the bodies,

219
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,470
one was the prison guard on duty

220
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,230
and the other was Stewardess Qing.

221
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,710
How did the fire start?

222
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,960
We presume

223
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,440
that the oil lamp on the wall fell

224
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,640
and the fire started due to the dry weather.

225
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,440
Are you sure it's Stewardess Qing's body?

226
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,790
That body is burned black

227
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,440
and can hardly be recognized.

228
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,590
You haven't found that mysterious man
outside the city, right?

229
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,200
Right.

230
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,150
Your Majesty,

231
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,280
I failed my mission.

232
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm ready for punishment, Your Majesty!

233
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,030
You're not to blame.

234
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,320
He's way too insidious.

235
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,640
Bai Ke,

236
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,550
you have to figure out how the fire started.

237
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,440
Aye.

238
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,910
You may leave.

239
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,440
Your Grace.

240
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,670
Kui Mulang,

241
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,520
where are you keeping Li Xiong?

242
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,790
I proposed to get out yesterday.

243
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,080
Why did you execute him instead?

244
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Indiscriminately,

245
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,670
you think I executed him?

246
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,880
Give him to me

247
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,230
and I'll believe you.

248
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,280
He's my guard.

249
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,350
How I deal with him has nothing to do with you.

250
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,470
Besides,

251
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,350
he took you out yesterday,

252
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,840
so you caught a cold.

253
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,520
What's the problem if I really executed him?

254
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,350
If you dare to hurt him,

255
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,440
I won't let you go!

256
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,150
Qi Pa,

257
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,400
you're my queen-to-be,

258
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,280
but you keep talking

259
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,400
about another man in front of me.

260
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,710
Do you not respect me at all?

261
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,110
I'm not your queen-to-be.

262
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,550
Let me tell you this.

263
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,440
I am

264
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,080
the princess of Daxia State

265
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,880
and I will not marry you!

266
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,280
Let me tell you something, too.

267
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,910
No one in this clan but me

268
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,230
can get you back to your state.

269
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,200
Liu Jun,

270
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,590
walk her back.

271
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,710
Aye.

272
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,400
Your Grace, go, please.

273
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,800
[Yuyan Shop]

274
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,200
Follow me.

275
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,670
Sorry, Master,

276
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
I ruined your plan.

277
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,880
Glad you know what you did.

278
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,320
Not stupid enough.

279
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Tell me. How did you get out?

280
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,590
Be specific.

281
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,640
When I saw a paper lighter in the pancake,

282
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,440
I knew Master would save me.

283
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,710
I estimated the schedule of the shift change.

284
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,030
When there was only one guard,

285
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,200
I lit the hay in my cell

286
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,960
and yelled for help.

287
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,590
When he opened the door to put out the fire,
I knocked him out.

288
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,840
Then I ran out,

289
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
found a new strange maid,

290
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,400
killed her, and dragged her into the prison.

291
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,880
At last, I crushed the oil lamp on the wall

292
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,910
and intensified the fire.

293
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,150
In the prison,

294
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,350
only two burned bodies could be found.

295
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,470
Sounds like you left no mess.

296
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,280
But you're so badly wounded.

297
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,520
I don't think there's anything you can do.

298
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,840
Master,

299
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,280
please give me a chance to make it up.

300
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,470
I will kill Princess Qi Pa.

301
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,200
You're wounded

302
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,590
and your recovery takes time.

303
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,150
Master's plan waits for none.

304
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,590
I'll recover soon

305
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,320
and assist Master.

306
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,590
Fine.

307
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,790
You get back for recovery.

308
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,280
Yes, Master. I'll take my leave.

309
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,400
Xiniang.

310
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,880
Yes, Master.

311
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,670
That man has been locked up for long enough.

312
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,110
Time to give him a hand.

313
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,960
Yeah.

314
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,590
It's been five years.

315
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,080
He should come out.

316
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,710
What are you going to do, then?

317
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,590
[Malingering Pill]
I'll use this.

318
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,200
Malingering Pill?

319
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,590
Perfect choice.

320
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Liu Jun,

321
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,670
I think I used the wrong method.

322
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,800
I've pushed Qi Pa farther.

323
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,710
And she hates me more now.

324
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,040
She got close to Li Xiong

325
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,590
just because she wanted him to help her

326
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,110
get away from here.

327
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,640
What do we do now?

328
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,190
Do you know

329
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,310
how to make a lady fall in love with a man?

330
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,310
How?

331
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,070
But Your Majesty,

332
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,590
I'm not married.

333
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,190
How do I know this?

334
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
What do you know, then?

335
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,880
I...

336
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,590
Forget it.

337
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,710
I need to learn from the people of her state.

338
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,560
How about this?

339
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,710
Let's go and ask

340
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,190
about what kind of man

341
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,710
ladies in Daxia State love

342
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,640
and how men there

343
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,830
make ladies happy.

344
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,160
Wise move, Your Majesty.

345
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,640
We can't wait. Go right now.

346
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,400
Aye.

347
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,430
I bought one.

348
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,560
Everyone will have it.

349
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,640
Be patient.

350
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,310
I'll take one.

351
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,000
I want the latest "Perfect Husband".

352
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,680
Here it is.

353
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,680
Take it.

354
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,560
Is this it?

355
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,470
Everyone will have it.

356
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,280
Everyone.

357
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,310
All right.

358
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
I want the latest "Perfect Husband".

359
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,350
Sure.

360
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,560
Perfect Husband?

361
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,800
This one?

362
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,280
I hear the hero of this novel is charming.

363
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,040
I love this kind of bossy man.

364
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,710
If anyone can treat me like that,

365
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,040
I'll marry him, regardless of anything.

366
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,070
Not you only.

367
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,470
I'll marry this kind of man, too.

368
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,310
Did you hear them?

369
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,950
No wonder these ladies jockey for these books.

370
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,350
Such simple books

371
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,520
can teach young people to get in love.

372
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,710
Then how about we buy some books

373
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,310
and learn from them?

374
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,560
Maybe we'll get to know

375
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,110

00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,630
relieve her,

565
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,600
and protect her from all trouble.

566
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
I think the novels have got you

567
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,390
a little bit carried away.

568
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,600
What?

569
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,350
Nothing.

570
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,600
As you please, Your Majesty.

571
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,990
The novels also say,

572
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,270
ladies like pretty and expensive things.

573
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,750
Let's do this.

574
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,960
You go collect some priceless treasures

575
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,870
and have them delivered to Qi Pa's chamber.

576
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,270
Novels really cost a lot.

577
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,200
I'm on it.

578
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,200
Your Majesty.

579
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,230
These two should be sent to Qi Pa, too.

580
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,270
Your Majesty,

581
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,630
quite enough.

582
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,110
A lot of treasures here.

583
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,630
And out there are various jewels

584
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,750
you had our men bought.

585
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,750
I don't know what Qi Pa really loves.

586
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:14,870
Well,

587
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,560
you send all these things to her first.

588
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,350
Then ask her what she likes

589
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,350
and what she wants.

590
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,390
Anything.

591
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,800
Aye.

592
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,350
What have you got?

593
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,320
Did Stewardess Bai complain about me?

594
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,560
Is Kui Mulang pissed off?

595
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,600
Will he cancel the wedding?

596
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,990
Instead of getting angry,

597
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,920
His Majesty gave you a lot of presents.

598
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,800
Mr. Liu Jun,

599
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,990
you can come in.

600
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,750
Your Grace,

601
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,600
betrothal presents from His Majesty.

602
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,870
Based on the highest standard of our clan.

603
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,040
10,000 taels of gold and 10,000 taels of silver.

604
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,040
1,000 bolts of silks and brocades each.

605
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,990
A pair of gold bracelets and that of silver.

606
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
Jade vases.

607
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,080
1,000-year-old ganoderma
and 10,000-year-old ginseng.

608
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,920
12 manors.

609
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,230
200 mu of fertile farmlands.
[*133,333 square meters]

610
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,560
60 horses.

611
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,320
Four pairs of tubes for gold bars.

612
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Two gold basins.

613
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,510
- Silver basins...
- Stop, stop.

614
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
Stop. Stop reading it.

615
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,320
I won't take anything.

616
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,440
I won't marry Kui Mulang, either.

617
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,230
Even if he gave me gold and silver hills,

618
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,150
I wouldn't marry him!

619
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,110
I get it.

620
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,600
I'll go tell His Majesty

621
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,560
that you want gold and silver hills.

622
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,110
I...

623
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,320
Come back.

624
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,110
His Majesty mollycoddles the queen-to-be.

625
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,270
I quite agree.

626
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
His Majesty cares so much about Her Grace,

627
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,110
giving her anything she wants.

628
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,270
Her Grace just said

629
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,080
she wanted gold and silver hills.

630
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,110
His Majesty is having them prepared immediately.

631
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,320
Gold and silver hills?

632
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,110
Look, gold and silver hills, indeed.

633
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,510
Gold and silver hills, indeed.

634
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,960
A seductive woman is such trouble!

635
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,390
How could His Majesty be besotted

636
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,560
with a foreign woman?

637
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,920
Hu Die,

638
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,110
are you jealous of the queen-to-be?

639
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,800
Nonsense!

640
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,230
I'll stop His Majesty with my life!

641
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,680
Your Grace,

642
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,720
here are the gold and silver hills.

643
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,920
I want to see Kui Mulang.

644
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,390
Your Majesty,

645
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,040
this woman is unidentified

646
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
and behaves rudely.

647
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,270
All departments complained a lot about her.

648
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,800
Will you really marry her?

649
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,560
Please think again, Your Majesty.

650
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,320
As I said,

651
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,080
you mustn't gossip about Princess Qi Pa.

652
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,750
Your Majesty,

653
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,390
you used to be wise and responsible.

654
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,270
But since that woman came, you...

655
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:55,920
Enough.

656
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,320
You...

657
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,840
Behave yourself.

658
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,870
Kui Mulang!

659
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,470
You...

660
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,680
Kui Mulang.

661
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
Look, Your Majesty.

662
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,960
She called you by your name

663
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,840
and broke in without permission.

664
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,990
She behaves so badly and she's rude!

665
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,680
Hu Die,

666
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,960
you may leave.

667
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:16,960
I...

668
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,600
Hu...

669
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,750
Never mind, my queen-to-be.

670
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,720
Hu Die is just straightforward.

671
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,320
Hu Die is right.

672
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,230
What?

673
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,320
Your Majesty,

674
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,920
you won't really marry me, will you?

675
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,110
Please think again.

676
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
Look.

677
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,150
I don't follow palace rules.

678
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,750
I have no manners and I behave badly.

679
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,080
I even disturbed the order of your palace.

680
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,800
A wife like me will compromise your honor.

681
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,110
No good will come out of that.

682
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,560
[If everyone is against you]
[I'll still marry you and make an enemy of them]

683
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,240
Qi Pa,

684
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,080
if you hold it against everyone,

685
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,360
I'll make an enemy of the world

686
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,430
and still marry you.

687
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,430
He's quite good at that.

688
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,640
I'll take my leave.

689
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,360
The novels can really help.

690
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,360
I'll make you smell like me

691
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,120
and you'll never get out of my sight.

692
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,080
Look.

693
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,030
That's what I've got for you.

694
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,160
Your Majesty,

695
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,920
spend less time on the novels.

696
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,550
Ministers wanted me to ask

697
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,640
when the Queen's Private Banquet would be held.

698
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,990
What banquet?

699
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,550
That's what every lady has to do

700
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,790
before they become the queen.

701
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,160
But I don't think

702
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,950
Her Grace will smoothly obey that rule.

703
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,600
I don't agree.

704
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,790
According to the novels,

705
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,440
cooking can get a couple closer.

706
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,600
Maybe after Qi Pa cooks,

707
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,030
she and I will be on the mend.

708
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,880
Well,

709
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,750
go tell Qi Pa

710
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,950
the Banquet will be held tonight.

711
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,230
Aye.

712
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,840
Make haste.

713
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,270
Your Grace,

714
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,230
have something to eat.

715
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,550
Or you wouldn't be strong enough
to prepare for the wedding.

716
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,270
Don't ever talk about the wedding.

717
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,200
Your Grace,

718
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,310
I request to see you.

719
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,160
Why did you come again?

720
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,160
Your Grace,

721
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,230
His Majesty ordered

722
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,120
the Queen's Private Banquet
should be held tonight.

723
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,030
I'm here to tell you about it.

724
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,600
I'll take my leave.

725
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,200
What banquet?

726
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,230
He's gone.

727
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,310
Tell me.

728
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,120
What banquet is that?

729
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,310
For your information,

730
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,160
it's the Queen's Private Banquet.

731
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,310
The queen-to-be will make a meal

732
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,030
for all the ministers,

733
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,270
to show solicitude for her subordinates

734
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,840
and kindness for her people,

735
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,230
as the future queen of the Beast Clan.

736
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,640
The ministers will judge how the queen cooks.

737
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,510
It's one of our traditions.

738
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,640
In history, someone was disqualified

739
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,160
for her terrible cooking skill.

740
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,680
So, this is a very important test.

741
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,920
But Your Grace, you're capable.

742
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,310
I believe you'll pass the test.

743
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,360
What a brilliant tradition!

744
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,790
I was just wondering what I could do.

745
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,080
Cutie,

746
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,400
do you know anyone in the Imperial Kitchen?

747
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,270
Your Grace, I heard you were preparing
for the Queen's Private Banquet.

748
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,600
[Chun'er, bloodline: sparrow, pretty cook, gossipy]
Your Grace,

749
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,790
[Chun'er, bloodline: sparrow, pretty cook, gossipy]
you're wonderful.

750
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,030
No wonder His Majesty loves you.

751
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,680
Let me know if you need anything.

752
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,790
I'll prepare it for you.

753
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,750
Don't bother.

754
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,880
I'll just make some hometown dishes.

755
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,680
I need some special ingredients, though.

756
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,160
I'll have Hongxiu catch some for me.

757
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,990
You take some rest.

758
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,470
When I need you, I'll call you.

759
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,510
Get the drugs according to the prescription.

760
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,200
Drugs?

761
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,230
I mean ingredients in this recipe

762
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,790
are highly nutritious.

763
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,360
For the health of everyone, you know.

764
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,640
Get going.

765
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Kui Mulang,

766
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:01,310
