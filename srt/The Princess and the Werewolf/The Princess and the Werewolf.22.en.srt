[Episode 22]

18
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,550
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,830
How's it going?

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,950
Is she angry?

21
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,040
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,080
I can't tell if Her Highness is angry.

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,400
But she asked the newly recruited girls

24
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,720
to leave the Palace.

25
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,630
This is good.

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,630
However, Haitang

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,400
played the zither in my chamber all day.

28
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,360
Rumors went all around the Palace.

29
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,550
Did Qi Pa not react at all?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,590
No, I'm afraid.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,680
Didn't you say it would definitely work?

32
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,320
Maybe rumors aren't going widely enough

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,160
to reach Her Highness's ears.

34
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,360
Be patient, Your Majesty.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,470
Let's wait and see.

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,110
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,080
it's getting dark.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,320
In the Royal Palace,

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,440
Liu Jun is subservient to no one,

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,080
but the three Elders,

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,830
and Kui Mulang.

42
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,360
That night, I saw

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,190
Kui Mulang's hooded face.

44
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,110
That wasn't Li Xiong's face.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
But in the ball game,

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
Li Xiong made me

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
feel somehow familiar.

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,360
What's all this about?

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,390
Kui Mulang,

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,630
what other secrets are you keeping?

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,080
What have you got?

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,880
I...

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,960
Say it.

55
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,800
Hongxiu told me

56
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,720
Her Highness was going to sleep.

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,240
Going to sleep?

58
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,910
Did she not feel anxious, make a scene,

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,270
or want to question me?

60
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,670
My plan failed.

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,110
I'm ready for punishment, Your Majesty.

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,720
Forget it.

63
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,320
Go ask Haitang

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,630
to leave my chamber immediately.

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,030
And get my queen here.

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,160
I'll ask her in person

67
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,080
how she feels about this.

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,880
Aye.

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
Miss Haitang,

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,240
His Majesty said you may leave.

71
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,320
But...

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,160
But right here, I've been

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,240
playing the zither the whole day,

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
expecting to see His Majesty.

75
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,800
Where's His Majesty?

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,520
His Majesty is usually busy

77
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,800
with political affairs.

78
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,240
You can't see him just as you wish.

79
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,390
But I've stayed here,

80
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,080
playing the zither the whole day.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,600
Say no more.

82
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,110
This is an order from His Majesty

83
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
and you mustn't disobey it.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,750
Leave, please.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,350
Your Highness.

86
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,920
Your...

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,200
Your Highness,

88
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,790
His Majesty asked to see you.

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm not going. I'm not.

90
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,390
Where's Kui Mulang?

91
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,070
In his chamber.

92
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,480
His Majesty is waiting for you.

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Shouldn't he be enjoying the music

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,720
Haitang is playing?

95
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920
This is awful.

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,160
I could have got some good sleep.

97
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,270
Why does he need me now?

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,270
No sound of music can be heard anymore.

99
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,350
Why do I have a bad feeling?

100
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,830
Your Majesty,

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,720
Her Highness is here.

102
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,640
Don't you have anything to ask me?

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,160
Where is Miss Haitang?

104
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,440
I heard she hit it off

105
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,950
with you, Your Majesty.

106
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,440
She was played the zither day and night

107
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,200
and you two had a great time together.

108
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,230
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,760
Congratulations?

110
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,070
Is this how you feel?

111
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,070
Your Majesty, you and Haitang like each other

112
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,440
and that's good.

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,390
I don't like her!

114
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,600
Rumors can't come out of nowhere.

115
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,790
Your Majesty, you can't just deny it?

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,550
Now that you're in love with Haitang,

117
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,950
you no longer need me, do you?

118
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,070
Are you so eager to leave me?

119
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,670
We're just friends.

120
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,950
Now that you get intimate with Haitang,

121
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,830
you should give her something.

122
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,790
Stop being entangled with me.

123
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,830
After all, I've...

124
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,600
Enough!

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
Stop doing anything ridiculous.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
Before the three months is over,

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,880
I will not let you go.

128
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,480
But... Fine.

129
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,480
Your...

130
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,200
Your Highness,

131
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,950
why are you sulking?

132
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Did you quarrel with His Majesty?

133
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
Only he's sulking.

134
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,920
Now, he has Haitang.

135
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
But he's still that bossy.

136
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,830
Your Highness,

137
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,880
this is what I think.

138
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,320
You forced His Majesty to have Haitang.

139
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,880
Then, you shouldn't say,

140
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,920
"Now, he has Haitang."

141
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,670
His Majesty loves you.

142
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,110
How could he fall in love

143
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,160
with someone else?

144
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,510
You're so young

145
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,830
that you can't understand many things.

146
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,070
I'm getting some sleep.

147
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,880
Your Highness,

148
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,920
His Majesty really cares about you.

149
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,760
Why can you always

150
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
read our minds,

151
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,510
but misunderstand His Majesty,

152
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,320
instead of seeing his true heart?

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,110
This ointment works wonders.

154
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,470
Your hands won't be defunct.

155
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,230
He made me play the zither the whole day!

156
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,760
Kui Mulang is

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,150
even crueler than ladies
in the illegal music house.

158
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,960
When I recover, I...

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,670
I won't let him...

160
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,550
I told you.

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,230
You can't seduce Kui Mulang with charm.

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,230
He's stone-hearted.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He's so loyal

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
to Qi Pa.

165
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,200
I can't approach him at all.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,760
Looks like Qi Pa is the weak link.

167
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,880
Actually, I've been confused

168
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,000
about something.

169
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,440
Do you think

170
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
Li Xiong is very weird?

171
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,590
You also felt that, huh?

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,670
He's very close to Qi Pa, I think.

173
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you think they're...?

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
No.

175
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,710
I think they have something

176
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,150
more than an affair.

177
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,760
I've been observing Li Xiong for a long time.

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,520
In some cases,
he looks a lot like Kui Mulang.

179
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,960
But of course,

180
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,150
I was only guessing.

181
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,150
So, I need to confirm something.

182
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,230
I went through all books of our clan.

183
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,910
He's sometimes half human and half beast

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,230
because his internal force declines.

185
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,470
So, I think

186
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,960
I have to badly hurt him again.

187
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,520
When he's losing too much internal force,

188
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,320
he will show himself.

189
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
I have an idea.

190
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,790
Why is it you again?

191
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
What do you want?

192
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,670
Lan'er.

193
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,280
Lan'er.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,910
Lan'er, Lan'er!

195
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,470
Mother.

196
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,110
Lan'er!

197
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,150
Mother!

198
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,670
- Lan'er!
- Mother!

199
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,350
Mother!

200
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
What are you doing?

201
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,470
Let go of my mother!

202
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,440
- Lan'er!
- Mother!

203
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,710
Leave with me and I'll let her go.

204
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,910
We have our own life to live.

205
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm begging you.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,520
Let go of us. Please.

207
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,200
You think after you dumped this,

208
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,000
you could escape from the past?

209
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,960
I beg you. Let us go!

211
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm begging you.

212
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,960
Let go of us.

213
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,440
He,

214
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,520
when you grew up,

215
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,670
I gave you this sword as a present.

216
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,710
You loved it.

217
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,350
Later, you killed many people with it.

218
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,280
Among all the killers,

219
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,000
you were the best.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,590
I didn't! Nonsense!

221
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,590
However...

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,520
He was strong.

223
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,670
You couldn't kill him.

224
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,590
So, with the best you could do,

225
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,230
you became the Deputy Commander
and stayed by his side under cover.

226
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,150
I didn't.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,520
Five years ago, you got to know

228
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,080
he took back the Holy Pearl alone.

229
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,230
Then we decided to ambush him.

230
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,110
We almost won.

231
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,000
No, no!

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,960
But at the critical moment,
you lost your mind

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,470
and all our effort was wasted.

234
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,150
No. I didn't!

235
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,520
He,

236
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,000
I can give you a chance

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,960
to do the right thing.

238
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,080
But for you, I need to clear

239
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,840
some unnecessary obstacles.

240
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,710
Don't!

241
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,080
I'm begging you!

242
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,280
Please let go of my mother!

243
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm begging you!

244
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,640
I won't kill her.

245
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
You will.

246
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,150
- Lan'er!
- Mother!

247
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,110
He,

248
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,470
based on the intel you offered,

249
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,000
Jing Muhan and I arranged the ambush.

250
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Remember your mission.

251
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,880
If Jing Muhan fails,

252
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
you should rush out

253
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,150
and attack him, unprepared.

254
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,640
Try to kill him within one move.

255
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,440
You have to succeed, anyway.

256
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,320
Did you hear me?

257
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,590
Yes, Father.

258
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,320
Kill him!

259
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
Just because you showed some mercy,

260
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,670
my effort over so many years was wasted.

261
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,710
You know what?

262
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,000
I've been suffering from

263
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
the internal injuries caused
by his wolf howl.

264
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,670
I had to lie low for five years!

265
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,790
Your Majesty!

266
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,440
Your Majesty!

267
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,470
Your Majesty!

268
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,470
Back then,

269
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,710
I could see that you flipped over Kui Mulang.

270
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,880
But luckily, he was indifferent to you.

271
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
So, I thought you wouldn't be silly.

272
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,590
I didn't expect you to be that insane!

273
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,790
Right before we could succeed!

274
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,470
Will you make a dumb mistake again?

275
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,910
Father, I'm sorry

276
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,110
that I ruined your great plan.

277
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,040
[Su He, bloodline: scorpion,
willing to be used, lovesick]

278
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,760
I won't make a mistake again.

279
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,830
What do you think?

280
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,710
I look exactly like him, don't I?

281
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,590
You're really good at impersonation.

282
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,590
When I see this face,

283
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,280
I hate you already.

284
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,230
I love you that much.

285
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,230
My queen,

286
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,630
you can't hate me.

287
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,320
Good.

288
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,870
Your Highness.

289
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,680
Li Xiong, what are you doing here?

290
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,750
In two hours, I'll see you in the Forest.

291
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,990
What for? Sounds mysterious.

292
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,040
Be there and you'll know.

293
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,230
I should go.

294
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,390
Can it be another surprise?

295
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,870
Your Highness,

296
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,600
why did Mr. Li leave so soon?

297
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,510
Nothing.

298
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,470
By the way,

299
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,270
I'm going out in two hours.

300
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,510
Where are you going?

301
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,510
Let me go with you.

302
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,560
Don't bother.

303
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,440
When I leave,

304
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,560
you don't need to follow.

305
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,040
Mr. Li must have

306
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,350
asked Her Highness out again.

307
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,560
[Yaohua Palace]

308
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,040
Your Highness.

309
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,870
Mr. Li?

310
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,150
Why are you here?

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,080
Hongxiu,

312
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,200
did you see Her Highness?

313
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,750
Her Highness went out to see you.

314
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,230
Wh... When?

315
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,960
A few moments ago, you visited Her Highness.

316
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,630
Then, she went out.

317
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,150
Oh, no.

318
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,510
What's going on here?

319
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,750
Come take a look.

320
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
Li Xiong?

321
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,990
Li Xiong!

322
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,920
Why did you suddenly get me here?

323
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,230
To surprise me?

324
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,470
Guess.

325
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,150
Li Xiong, why?

326
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,800
Your Highness, you're so devoted to Mr. Li.

327
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,510
When "he" asked you to come, you came.

328
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,150
So, you're the assassin
who can do impersonation.

329
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,350
Yes, it's me.

330
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,470
But too bad, Your Highness.

331
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,150
It's too late.

332
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,840
Now that you're here,

333
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
you can no longer serve

334
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,320
as the bait.

335
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,960
Don't move!

336
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,920
Li Xiong, Li Xiong...

337
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,110
Mr. Li, there you are, at last.

338
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,870
It's you.

339
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,990
Who's behind you?

340
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,840
I should ask the same thing.

341
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,680
You're a mere guard,

342
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,600
but you have such great martial arts.

343
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,720
Since when did Kui Mulang

344
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,320
have this powerful guard?

345
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,680
Let go of her first.

346
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,750
You do great martial arts, Mr. Li.

347
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,350
If I let her go,

348
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll be in danger.

349
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,270
Want me to kill her, huh?

350
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
Then come over.

351
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,630
Don't hurt her.

352
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,470
Keep her alive

353
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,560
and I can do anything for you.

354
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,040
Good.

355
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,800
I'd like to see

356
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,630
how much you can do for her.

357
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,150
No!

358
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,200
Li Xiong!

359
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,350
No!

360
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
Li Xiong, don't.

361
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,680
Are you all right?

362
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,040
Qi Pa.

363
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,080
Qi Pa.

364
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, I see.

365
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,990
Silly girl,

366
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,510
why did you protect me?

367
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,230
Haitang, hang in there.

368
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,390
I failed again.

369
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
Stop. Stop saying anything.

370
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
Let me treat your wound first.

371
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,270
Haitang.

372
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,350
Haitang! Haitang!

373
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,720
Doctor, how's Her Highness?

374
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,630
Her Highness is lucky.

375
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,390
The needle is poisonous,

376
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,750
but the poison didn't get

377
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,440
into her bones or organs.

378
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,390
So, it's not life-threatening.

379
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,230
When will Her Highness wake up?

380
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,270
The poison in her meridians

381
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,040
may lead to other problems.

382
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,150
It's hard to tell when Her Highness
can wake up.

383
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,630
I'll give you some prescriptions.

384
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,960
Feed Her Highness regularly

385
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,390
and we'll see.

386
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,270
I'll take my leave.

387
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,800
How did this happen?

388
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,960
Where's Mr. Li?

389
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,270
He was with Her Highness, wasn't he?

390
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,990
He was also badly wounded.

391
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,750
With his last bit of strength,

392
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,440
he sent Her Highness to His Majesty's chamber

393
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
before he passed out.

394
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,800
Is Mr. Li all right, then?

395
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
Hope he'll be all right.

396
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,110
I'll go check on him.

397
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,200
You take care of Her Highness.

398
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,440
All right. Off you go.

399
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,990
I'll take good care of Her Highness.

400
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,870
Li Xiong.

401
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,920
Your Highness, you're awake.

402
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,350
Come on. Get up.

403
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,630
Careful.

404
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,600
This is great.

405
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Where's Li Xiong?

406
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,350
Mr. Liu Jun is taking care of him.

407
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,870
Don't worry too much, Your Highness.

408
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,720
What on earth happened to you?

409
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,040
Hongxiu,

410
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,920
why is the light off?

411
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,200
So dark.

412
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,390
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

413
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,040
The light is on.

414
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,150
Hongxiu.

415
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,470
Your Highness,

416
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,750
your eyes...

417
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,920
Relax, Your Highness.

418
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,720
And don't go anywhere.

419
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,230
I'll go get the doctor immediately.

420
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,840
Your Royal Highness.

421
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,960
I've got the medicine back.

422
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,630
Decoct it.

423
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,230
Aye.

424
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,720
Don't worry.

425
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,960
Your vitals are good.

426
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,560
In the Forest, I kind of saw

427
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,720
Li Xiong turned into another man.

428
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,760
Did I see it wrong?

429
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,270
No.

430
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
Right in front of us,

431
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,480
Li Xiong transformed into Kui Mulang.

432
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,240
So,

433
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,080
that's what Kui Mulang really is.

434
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,480
My injury is worth it, then.

435
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,190
What are you gonna do?

436
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,790
I've been resting in the past five years.

437
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,550
And I finally worked out

438
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,270
a more powerful drug.

439
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,790
I planned to take action in person

440
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,720
after I recovered.

441
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,480
But thank goodness,

442
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,430
you survived.

443
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,150
He,

444
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
I'll get you back to Kui Mulang.

445
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,270
You must hold firm control of him

446
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,670
and help me take over this kingdom.

447
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,960
But Father, I...

448
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,310
You can't be still loving him, can you?

449
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,790
For him, you betrayed me

450
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,790
and fell off the cliff.

451
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,550
And now,

452
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,550
he has a queen.

453
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,880
He completely forgot

454
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,390
how you helped him!

455
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,600
He has a queen?

456
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,390
When we ambushed him,

457
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,190
he defeated us.

458
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,430
But he was badly wounded, too.

459
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,240
If he had the Holy Pearl,

460
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,790
no one could hurt him, I'm afraid.

461
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,480
So, I guess

462
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,550
he hadn't got the Holy Pearl at that time.

463
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,880
But out of nowhere,

464
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,390
he got a queen.

465
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
She must have something to do
with the Holy Pearl.

466
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,390
He doted on this woman.

467
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,000
He even offended all the Elders

468
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
and gave her everything she wanted
with a national effort.

469
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,760
Stop!

470
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,790
He,

471
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,640
this kind of man doesn't deserve your love.

472
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,240
You should take advantage of his gratitude

473
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,240
to take his wife's place.

474
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,910
It's time

475
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,960
to get back what he owes you.

476
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,720
He,

477
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,240
I'll let go of your old mistakes.

478
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,550
Do as you're told

479
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,760
and we'll stand a chance to succeed.

480
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,190
I'll give you what you want, Father.

481
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,790
Qi Pa.

482
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,080
Your Majesty,

483
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,790
be careful.

484
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,310
The poisons were just removed.

485
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
You're too weak to struggle.

486
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,790
What about Qi Pa?

487
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,550
How's she now?

488
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,270
Say something.

489
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,150
Her Highness woke up.

490
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,790
But the doctor just reported

491
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,270
that Her Highness

492
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,960
couldn't see anything.

493
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,840
Your Majesty.

494
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,600
Your Majesty!

495
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,120
Your Highness.

496
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,310
Your Highness, you're awake.

497
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,840
Get up.

498
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,160
Why?

499
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,200
Why am I still blind?

500
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,790
How come?

501
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,680
Your Highness.

502
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,600
Li Xiong.

503
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,360
Where is he?

504
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,790
Be patient, Your Highness.

505
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm here for you.

506
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,440
The doctor has gone to inform His Majesty.

507
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,950
I don't want Kui Mulang!

508
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,400
I want Li Xiong!

509
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,990
Your Highness, be careful.

510
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,030
Your Highness.

511
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,990
Who's that?

512
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,600
Qi Pa.

513
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,550
It's me, Li Xiong.

514
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,440
Hongxiu,

515
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,120
the doctor wanted to see you

516
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,360
and give you some instructions.

517
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,230
But Her Highness...

518
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,400
Don't worry. I'll be guarding here.

519
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,230
Li Xiong, are you all right?

520
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,950
Yes.

521
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,120
I'm fine.

522
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,120
I'm good and I'm not hurt.

523
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,550
But I...

524
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,510
I'm blind.

525
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,510
I'm a little bit scared.

526
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,400
Don't be scared, Qi Pa.

527
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
I'll find a way to cure you.

528
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,440
Do not fear.

529
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,640
But what if...

530
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
What if

531
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,400
I can never be cured?

532
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,750
That's not gonna happen.

533
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,680
Qi Pa,

534
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,640
trust me.

535
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,550
I'll have your eyes cured.

536
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,510
You're wounded

537
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,270
and the toxins were just removed.

538
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,080
You have to take care of your health.

539
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,680
Just some flesh wounds.

540
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,470
But you're losing your internal force.

541
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,880
You'll fail to cover it sooner or later.

542
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
What did the doctor say

543
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,160
about Qi Pa's eyes?

544
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,840
She said Her Highness's neck
was pierced by a poisonous needle

545
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,160
and the poison pricked the meridians
of her eyes.

546
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,160
The doctor would make prescriptions

547
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,920
for Her Highness's regular treatment.

548
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,230
Her Highness would recover in a few days.

549
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,440
Can she be sure?

550
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,080
Yes.

551
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,030
Liu Jun,

552
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,880
go give the order.

553
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,080
Haitang is wanted throughout the city.

554
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,200
Whoever catches her will get a big reward.

555
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,440
Your Majesty, did she...

556
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,950
Yes.

557
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,200
She's the assassin

558
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
who has the chameleon bloodline.

559
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,030
Stewardess Qing, Qi Pa, and Chun'er

560
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,950
were all impersonated by her.

561
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,880
This time, she even dared to impersonate me

562
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,640
and hurt Qi Pa that badly.

563
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,200
I won't let her go!

564
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,750
In this case,

565
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,030
she tried hard to get
into the Performance Class

566
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,310
and she must be up to something.

567
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,750
Yes, of course.

568
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,790
What's more,

569
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,360
when Bai Ke was investigating the case,

570
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,270
he found that Jing Muhan wasn't
in his chamber.

571
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,840
This can't be a coincidence.

572
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,230
Haitang lay low in the Palace for many years.

573
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,080
She's very likely to be
the mysterious man's minion.

574
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,120
The mysterious man and Jing Muhan

575
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,790
can be inseparable.

576
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,200
As far as I see,

577
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,120
Jing Muhan must be involved in this case.

578
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,200
Your Majesty,

579
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,160
shall we take him down now?

580
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,200
No.

581
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,550
We don't have hard evidence, after all.

582
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,750
If anything goes wrong,

583
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,470
he can't get away with it.

584
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Give me the orders, Your Majesty.

585
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,270
Send Bai Ke to keep a close eye on Jing Muhan

586
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,750
and people in his chamber.

587
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,310
If they leave the Palace,

588
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,790
follow them closely

589
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,550
and see if they meet anyone secretly.

590
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,510
Aye.

591
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,710
And Liu Jun...

592
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,360
Get Qi Pa to my chamber.

593
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,750
I'll take care of her personally.

594
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,030
I wonder

595
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,080
if I can ask you something.

596
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,400
Go ahead.

597
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,880
During this period,

598
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,470
how will you get along with Her Highness?

599
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,990
If you take care of her as the king...

600
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,510
It's not time to think about this.

601
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,880
Now, I only expect

602
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,640
that Qi Pa can recover soon.

603
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,160
Go buy everything

604
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
on this list.

605
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,790
[Prescription]
When the time is right,

606
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,640
I'll check on Miss Haitang personally.

607
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,510
Aye.

608
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,710
Your Royal Highness,

609
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,160
I think

610
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,840
if you check on her now,

611
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,270
she'll recover sooner.

612
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,840
You think I don't want to go?

613
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,600
The Palace is heavily guarded

614
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,950
and I can't just go out like that.

615
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,470
Buy everything back first.

616
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,550
I'll think about what to do next.

617
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,600
Aye.

618
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,560
[Luhua Gate]

619
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,230

I'm going shopping for His Royal Highness.

622
