00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,310
Didn't I ask you to go back to your chamber?

192
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,110
What are you doing here?

193
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,040
I want some fresh air, what's the problem?

194
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,190
Who knew this palace could be so dangerous

195
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,550
and an assassin popped out?

196
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,040
I'll walk you back to your chamber

197
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,550
and have you watched.

198
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,990
Leave.

199
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,480
Hurry.

200
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,550
Kui Mulang.

201
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,400
What's... What's wrong?

202
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,070
Kui...

203
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,630
Kui... Kui...

204
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,720
Anybody here?

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,870
Anybody?

206
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,800
Your Majesty.

207
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,510
You're just in time.

208
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,630
Get him back.

209
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,520
[Liu Jun, bloodline: snake]
[Naturally toxic, insulated from intimacy]

210
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,400
Enough.

211
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,240
Your Majesty,

212
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,190
your current condition

213
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,280
allows no room for more injury.

214
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,670
Even such a little wound

215
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,750
disturbed your internal force
on this full-moon night.

216
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,990
We'll talk about this later.

217
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,870
Just now in the Imperial Garden,

218
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,990
someone assassinated Qi Pa.

219
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,720
Really?

220
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,280
I didn't hear that.

221
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,550
The Imperial Garden is empty and remote.

222
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
I understand that you didn't hear.

223
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,960
Sit.

224
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,160
Qi Pa is new in town.

225
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,480
She can't have an enemy.

226
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,920
Who wants to kill her?

227
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,280
Liu Jun.

228
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,670
Can it be that mysterious man?

229
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,990
Are you saying

230
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,280
the man behind Jing Muhan five years ago?

231
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,230
I didn't see that assassin's face.

232
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,200
But it's a woman, according to the figure.

233
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,230
Whether she was sent by that man...

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,280
We don't know yet.

235
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,790
But now Jing Muhan is imprisoned
in the Forbidden Area,

236
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,960
isolated from the world.

237
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,550
Except for him, no one hates me

238
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,670
but that mysterious man.

239
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,440
After that fight,

240
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,320
Bai Ke and I led our men to search our clan

241
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,030
for one year but didn't find him.

242
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,320
We speculated

243
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,710
that he died from his injuries.

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,440
His body hasn't been found, anyway.

245
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,550
This man is rather scheming.

246
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,280
If he survived,

247
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,640
he must have been hiding somewhere.

248
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,800
He could make people manic

249
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,000
and multiply their power.

250
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,680
If he's really behind this assassin,

251
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,110
we'll have a big problem.

252
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
What's your plan, Your Majesty?

253
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,800
Track down the assassin first.

254
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,560
I hit her on the shoulder

255
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
and she must be wounded.

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,880
But if we want to find her with this,

257
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,560
we'll have to take a lot of trouble

258
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,310
and even alert her.

259
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,470
Liu Jun,

260
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,160
let's just keep this between us

261
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,800
before we have a careful plan.

262
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,710
Shall I send someone to guard Her Grace?

263
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,640
No.

264
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,760
I'll protect her in person.

265
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Go announce this.

266
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
From this day on,

267
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,040
Qi Pa isn't allowed to leave the Palace.

268
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,280
Your Majesty, since you worry about her,

269
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,640
why don't you just

270
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,800
ground her in her chamber?

271
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,880
Qi Pa is outgoing.

272
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,160
Grounding her in her chamber would be too cruel.

273
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
Anyway, unless she's out of the Palace,

274
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,280
I can keep her safe.

275
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,710
Then when will she not be grounded?

276
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,800
Not until the assassin is caught.

277
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,280
I failed my mission.

278
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm ready for my punishment, My Lord.

279
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,310
Did anyone see you?

280
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,310
I assassinated her in the Imperial Garden.

281
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,520
Except for Kui Mulang,

282
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,040
no one was disturbed.

283
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,040
Did you leave anything there?

284
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,880
No.

285
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,560
But Kui Mulang hit my shoulder.

286
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,310
That's not hard evidence.

287
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,950
But Kui Mulang will track down you,

288
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,310
sooner or later.

289
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,920
I guess we should think of another plan.

290
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,920
[Yaohua Palace]

291
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,950
Your Grace?

292
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,710
Who's there?

293
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,880
Your Grace,

294
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,590
it's me, Li Xiong.

295
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,470
Why aren't you properly dressed in your sleep?

296
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,950
You may catch a cold.

297
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh, Li Xiong.

298
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,400
All right.

299
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,520
You can turn around.

300
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,110
You're just in time.

301
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,640
I have something to tell you.

302
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,400
You know what?

303
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,710
Someone here tried to kill me.

304
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,070
What?

305
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,110
Your Grace, are you all right?

306
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,800
Yes, I am.

307
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,520
Kui Mulang saved my life.

308
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,710
He said he would track down that assassin.

309
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,350
But I don't care, actually.

310
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,560
All I want is to go home.

311
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,280
But we can't just do nothing.

312
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,160
I want to run away but always fail.

313
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,040
I hate Kui Mulang.

314
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,280
He's even grounding me.

315
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,760
His Majesty just

316
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,160
worried about your safety.

317
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,070
But if that assassin comes again,

318
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,470
I'll have to die.

319
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,430
You won't.

320
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,880
I'm your guard

321
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,470
and I'll protect you.

322
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,710
Your Grace, your neck...

323
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,920
It's all right.

324
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,190
How about I apply some ointment to it?

325
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,950
Sure.

326
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,950
Does it hurt?

327
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,430
If it hurts, let me know.

328
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,280
I will.

329
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,040
From this angle,

330
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,280
Li Xiong looks handsome.

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,160
Qi Pa, you murderer!

332
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,310
Come out!

333
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,760
Qi Pa, you murderer!

334
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Come out!

335
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
Go and be on trial!

336
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,560
Deputy Commander Hu,

337
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,920
[Hongxiu, bloodline: cat, fast, soft and caring]
that's nonsense.

338
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,190
Nonsense?

339
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,000
[Hu Die, bloodline: weasel, farting, competitive]

340
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,070
Qi Pa,

341
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,830
since you came here,

342
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,190
you've been stirring up troubles several times.

343
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,710
Now, someone's dying.

344
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,830
Even His Majesty

345
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,350
can't screen you anymore!

346
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,920
Yeah, His Majesty can't shield her.

347
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,590
A life for a life.

348
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,760
You're a murderer.

349
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,950
Stop the noises!

350
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,000
Hu Die,

351
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,560
you're the deputy commander of Imperial Guards.

352
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,400
When someone's dying, it's your responsibility.

353
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,070
You first failed your duty

354
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,430
and then led them here for trouble.

355
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,640
You were grounded for introspection

356
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,110
and I suppose that's not enough.

357
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,920
Your...

358
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,070
Who are you?

359
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,110
In this palace, no one but His Majesty

360
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
dares to talk like that!

361
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,280
He's Li Xiong,

362
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,430
His Majesty's new personal bodyguard.

363
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,640
I think he made sense

364
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,680
and nothing is amiss.

365
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,190
Oh, Mister Li.

366
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,040
Such panache.

367
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,110
I'm the deputy commander.

368
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,760
How would I arrest someone without evidence?

369
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,590
All right, are you done with it?

370
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,470
Hu Die,

371
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,230
tell me what exactly happened.

372
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,430
Who's dying?

373
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
Still playing innocent?

374
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,680
I had my guards bring the evidence.

375
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,310
I sent for His Majesty, too.

376
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,880
Now, you need to see His Majesty

377
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
and explain everything.

378
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,160
Go, then. I'm not scared.

379
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,280
Li Xiong,

380
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,280
let's go.

381
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,590
Li...

382
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,680
I saw Mr. Li run that way.

383
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,160
Run?

384
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,590
But I...

385
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,640
Why are you still procrastinating?

386
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,230
I'm not.

387
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,280
Go.

388
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,950
Go.

389
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
Go, let's go have a look.

390
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,760
- Let's follow them.
- Go.

391
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,590
Your Majesty,

392
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,000
Qi Pa, the queen-to-be, murdered someone

393
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,350
and should be executed according to the law.

394
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,280
Murdered someone?

395
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,560
Who?

396
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,280
Qi Pa,

397
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,680
why do you not refute her?

398
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,710
Because I didn't murder anyone.

399
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,830
Hu Die, Sweetie,

400
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,040
I understand

401
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,950
that jealousy makes you insane.

402
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,680
But you need evidence, anyway.

403
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,760
Who's jealous of you?

404
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,830
You just won't confess until the last minute, huh?

405
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,110
Show her the evidence!

406
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,310
Your Majesty,

407
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,350
this is Chun'er, maid of the Imperial Kitchen.

408
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,920
Just now, someone pushed her into the well.

409
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,470
[Bai Ke, bloodline: hedgehog, thorny and upright]
Just now, someone pushed her into the well.

410
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,470
And that was murder.

411
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,040
Your Majesty,

412
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,880
she fell into the well a quarter ago and fainted.

413
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
Now her pulse is so weak

414
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,950
that I can't keep her alive.

415
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,710
A quarter ago?

416
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,590
Exactly.

417
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,070
Doctor,

418
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,640
are you sure you can't save her?

419
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,400
Sorry, there's nothing I can do.

420
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,160
There's something you can do.

421
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,520
You're just not skilled enough to do that.

422
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,520
Let me try.

423
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,470
Stop.

424
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,350
Are you trying to kill her?

425
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,230
Hu Die,

426
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,350
you have a beautiful face. Please have some brains, too.

427
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,920
She's dying.

428
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,110
I don't need to push it.

429
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,430
Get out of the way.

430
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,190
Or she would really die.

431
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,710
You!

432
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,350
Hu Die,

433
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,280
let her save Chun'er.

434
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,800
What's she doing?

435
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,640
Will this work?

436
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
No idea.

437
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,110
Your Grace,

438
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,280
what are you doing?

439
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,830
This is a back-to-life skill,

440
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,430
to save people's life urgently.

441
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,430
Chun'er.

442
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,950
Chun'er.

443
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,190
She's alive. Alive.

444
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,950
Your Grace, you have great medical skills.

445
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,710
I am no compare.

446
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,640
Your Grace, you're brilliant.

447
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
I admire you.

448
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,310
Chun'er, you're fine.

449
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,590
It's a first aid skill from my mother's homeland.

450
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,520
It saves life urgently.

451
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,830
[Chun'er, bloodline: sparrow, pretty cook, gossipy]
What's going on?

452
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,760
How come so many people are here?

453
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,560
Chun'er,

454
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,070
Her Grace just saved your life.

455
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,400
Say thank you to her.

456
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,400
Her Grace?

457
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,880
It's you?

458
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,110
Why did you murder me?

459
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,000
Why would I murder you?

460
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Come on.

461
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,950
I just saved your life, sweetie.

462
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,430
Chun'er,

463
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,800
did you see clearly?

464
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,280
Are you sure Her Grace tried to murder you?

465
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,160
I'm sure.

466
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,590
It's her.

467
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,190
It's really Her Grace?

468
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,280
All right.

469
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,680
If you're sure I tried to murder you,

470
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,400
tell me what happened just now.

471
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,400
Don't be scared, Chun'er.

472
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,310
I washed the clothes and was about to dry them.

473
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,590
Then...

474
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,310
It's you, Your Grace.

475
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,800
What are you doing here so early?

476
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,950
Somebody! Somebody come!

477
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,230
Somebody's in the well! Help!

478
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,070
Chun'er, don't talk nonsense.

479
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,470
Her Grace would never

480
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,950
hurt people like that.

481
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,000
- Yeah.
- Chun'er,

482
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,560
you can't talk irresponsibly.

483
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,190
Are you sure it was me?

484
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,040
Murderer!

485
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,760
Hu Die,

486
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,830
don't push it.

487
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,680
Now, I'm accused of murder.

488
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,950
I have to get this straight.

489
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,470
You don't actually think I accused you

490
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,640
because I'm jealous, do you?

491
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,590
Before coming to arrest you, I investigated it.

492
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,680
Everyone, look at this.

493
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,160
The maid who found Chun'er

494
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,590
picked this up around the well.

495
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,470
Your Grace, don't you find it familiar?

496
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,000
I saw Her Grace wear this hairpin.

497
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,800
It's her.

498
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,430
It's not me, seriously.

499
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,000
I lost this hairpin by accident.

500
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,400
Someone must have taken it.

501
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,110
And I don't hate her.

502
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,310
Why would I murder her?

503
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,880
You don't hate me, either.

504
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Why did you hurt me?

505
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,950
That's because...

506
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,470
Because I caught you leaving the town in disguise

507
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,280
and I was trying to stop you.

508
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,110
Then you hurt me.

509
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,920
Maybe Chun'er accidentally caught you

510
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,560
doing something dirty

511
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,230
and you wanted to kill her desperately.

512
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,400
I didn't.

513
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,710
Your Majesty,

514
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,640
we have testimony and evidence.

515
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,350
Please decide

516
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,590
what you'll do for Chun'er.

517
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,830
I...

518
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,040
This case has many doubts.

519
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,400
Why was Qi Pa's hairpin

520
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
found around the crime scene?

521
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It needs to be further investigated.

522
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,950
Your Majesty,

523
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,760
obviously, when she was murdering Chun'er,

524
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,680
her hairpin dropped.

525
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
If such evidence isn't convincing enough,

526
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,920
how can Chun'er get her justice?

527
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,350
It wasn't me!

528
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,000
A quarter ago, I was in my own chamber.

529
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,830
Minutes later, Mr. Li, His Majesty's bodyguard

530
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,000
came to me.

531
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,430
He can be my witness.

532
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,760
All right.

533
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,590
Get Mr. Li here

534
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,640
and let's confront him.

535
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,640
That's true.

536
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,310
His Majesty sent Mr. Li to Her Grace.

537
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,680
Yes.

538
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Mr. Li works for His Majesty.

539
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,400
And His Majesty shields Her Grace.

540
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,470
Sorry, but I'm skeptical about the testimony

541
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,520
Mr. Li will give.

542
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,400
And in terms of evidence,

543
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,110
which is more convincing,

544
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,310
the hairpin or his testimony?

545
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,040
Hu Die,

546
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,520
you're being unreasonable.

547
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm defending Chun'er's justice!

548
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,190
All right.

549
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,920
You can defend her justice.

550
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,350
But you have to find out the truth first.

551
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,950
Even if I have to,

552
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,830
the suspect should be put in prison.

553
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,830
No way.

554
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,950
Qi Pa is my queen-to-be.

555
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,400
If she's in prison before the truth is clear,

556
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,680
that'll be disgraceful.

557
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,190
You're the King we all trust.

558
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,190
Your calmness, decisiveness, and wisdom

559
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,400
are all gone in front of her, why?

560
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,520
Are you still the King we've been admiring?

561
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,070
You're losing your mind for a woman!

562
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,830
How daring!

563
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,350
Your Majesty,

564
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,590
Hu Die was tactless.

565
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,110
Please forgive her.

566
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,710
I wasn't tactless!

567
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,680
Your Majesty, if you don't put her in prison,

568
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,640
I'll ask Elders to come out in advance

569
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,470
and get justice.

570
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Hu Die,

571
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,680
stop pushing it.

572
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,800
You're pushing it, Your Majesty.

573
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,590
Stop.

574
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,760
Put me in prison.

575
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,560
I'm true to myself.

576
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,760
When I said I didn't do that, I just didn't.

577
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,590
Things will become clear.

578
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,110
Put me in prison.

579
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,000
Hu Die,

580
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,760
you must be pleased now.

581
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
All right.

582
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,950
I trust my queen-to-be.

583
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,470
Put her in prison

584
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,830
until things become clear.

585
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,000
Aye.

586
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,000
It's wise of you, Your Majesty.

587
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,110
But this case has an ironclad evidence

588
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,880
and should be solved quickly.

589
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,710
Otherwise, let's stick to the law.

590
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,230
Let me out!

591
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,280
Let me out!

592
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,230
Let me out!

593
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,280
I'm innocent.

594
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm innocent.

595
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,520
I'm innocent, My Lord.

596
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,880
Let me out.

597
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,280
- My Lord...
- Let me out.

598
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Let me out.

599
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,350
- Let me out.
- Let me out.

600
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
My Lord.

601
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,830
Let me out.

602
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,110
Don't go.

603
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,920
Let me out.

604
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,430
- Let me out, please.
- Let me out!

605
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,640
- Let me out, please.
- Let me out.

606
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,880
- Let me out, please.
- Get in.

607
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,400
Get in there.

608
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,280
Hurry.

609
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,950
- Shut up!
- Silence!

610
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,710
Cockroach?

611
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't mean to disturb you.

612
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,310
Let's try to get along.

613
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,830
In this case,

614
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,800
I'll... I'll fight it out with you!

615
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Don't come over!

616
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,560
I warn you!

617
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,880
How did you

618
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,280
offend Her Grace

619
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,640
and why did she try to murder you?

620
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
I don't know.

621
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,470
I haven't figured it out, either.

622
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,590
That day,

623
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,830
Her Grace was very weird,

624
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
as if she was someone else.

625
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,040
Mr. Li?

626
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
I'm here to see Miss Chun'er.

627
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,560
All right.

628
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,870
And you are...?

629
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,520
Miss Chun'er,

630
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,870
I'm Li, His Majesty's new bodyguard.

631
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,230
I'm sure Her Grace didn't hurt you.

632
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,760
Could you tell me what exactly happened?

633
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,040
Sure. Be seated, please.

634
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,760
Actually, I didn't understand

635
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,760
why that happened.

636
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,760
Her Grace can't do martial arts.

637
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,280
But that princess seemed
to have great martial arts.

638
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,630
I've never seen Her Grace behave like that.

639
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,000
The well is out there.

640
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,390
How about I take you for a look?

641
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,000
All right.

642
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,520
It was here.

643
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,120
I got some water from the well.

644
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
I lifted the bucket and turned around.

645
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,630
Right.

646
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Her Grace was standing where you're now.

647
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,760
I wondered

648
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,000
why Her Grace came here.

649
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,630
It's you, Your Grace.

650
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,910
What are you doing here so early?

651
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,560
But instead of replying,

652
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,120
Her Grace punched me on the chest

653
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,430
and then I fell into the well.

654
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,910
You petty insects,

655
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,280
I'm not scared of you.

656
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,760
I'll kill you all,

657
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,190
however many there are.

658
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,390
Don't come over! Don't!

659
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,710
Stay... Stay away.

660
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,280
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

661
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,000
Insects, please, stay right there.

662
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
Go somewhere else, will you?

663
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,150
I'm begging you.

664
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,040
Stay away.

665
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,520
Your Grace, what's wrong?

666
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,600
Is everything all right?

667
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,630
Li Xiong?

668
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,950
Where have you been?

669
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,520
I had a tummy ache

670
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,800
and I went to the toilet.

671
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,280
Don't blame me, Your Grace.

672
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,040
You just disappeared when I needed you.

673
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,280
You never did that back in Daxia State.

674
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,800
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

675
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,840
But nature calls me.

676
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,320
I failed my job

677
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,880
and made you suffer.

678
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,670
Forget it.

679
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,230
Now that you're here,

680
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,320
you must know what happened.

681
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,510
Your Grace,

682
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,400
you shouldn't have requested to come here.

683
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,270
You didn't know what happened.

684
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,640
Kui Mulang quite defended me today.

685
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,360
I grew up in the royal family

686
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,320
and I know a king

687
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,470
has to do many things he doesn't want.

688
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,600
He helped me that much

689
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,800
and I shouldn't let him disappoint his people.

690
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,190
But I never know

691
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,880
the prison could be this horrible.

692
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,400
I wish I didn't come.

693
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,320
Don't worry, Your Grace.

694
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,190
I will get you out.

695
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm here to tell you a clue.

696
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,400
What clue?

697
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,990
Kui Mulang found it, actually.

698
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,950
But in case he may annoy his people again,

699
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,510
he sent me to tell you about it.

700
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,640
He suspects the one who tried to murder Chun'er

701
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,640
is the woman who assassinated you.

702
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,560
Kui Mulang is investigating it?

703
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,750
Some of his people have the chameleon's bloodline

704
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
and they're good at disguising.

705
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
His Majesty suspects

706
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,990
that's how the woman impersonated you.

707
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,400
Well,

708
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,950
go tell Kui Mulang

709
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,910
that I'll vindicate myself.

710
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
And tell him this.

711
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,600
Here in his kingdom,

712
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,190
I'm in prison for something I didn't do.

713
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,880
After I'm vindicated,

714
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,560
he must promise me something

715
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,320
as compensation.

716
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,840
What do you want him to promise you?

717
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,910
To let me go home.

718
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,270
Do you think that's possible?

719
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,880
Then, make me no longer grounded.

720
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,600
Look where you are, Your Grace.

721
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,910
Why are you still thinking about this?

722
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,230
I have to.

723
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,470
Every day, I think about how to get back home.

724
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,160
But when I'm grounded,

725
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,600
I can't even leave the Palace.

726
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,600
You come over.

727
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,120
Come, come.

728
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,880
You go tell Kui Mulang

729
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,120
that we have to do this.
