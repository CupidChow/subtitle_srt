I was an idiot to believe you.

192
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
I won't fall for your trick again.

193
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
There's nothing wrong with my farting.

194
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,350
Someone finds it charming.

195
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,150
By the way,

196
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
[The Princess and the Werewolf]
I brought this for you.

197
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,710
I brought this for you.

198
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,400
Sister Su.

199
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,760
Read the book carefully

200
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,080
and turn over a new leaf.

201
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,280
[Chapter One]

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:04,840
[The Princess and the Werewolf]

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
Elders.

204
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,470
Former Deputy Commander Su He came to visit.

205
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,710
What's coming will come.

206
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,790
Bring her in.

207
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,960
Yes.

208
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,710
Elders, greetings.

209
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,470
His Majesty has rewarded you

210
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,880
for you saved him five years ago.

211
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
What else do you still want?

212
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,280
It's my duty to put His Majesty first.

213
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
I don't need any reward.

214
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,960
But there's one thing

215
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,910
that I need your help with.

216
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,440
The new queen made up a story

217
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,960
[The Princess and the Werewolf]
The new queen made up a story

218
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,200
to throw dirt on me.

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,280
and mislead everyone in the palace.

220
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,840
Elders, please see it for what it is.

221
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,000
It concerns the privacy of His Majesty.

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,230
We have no right to inquire about it.

223
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,960
Elders, please make it right for me.

224
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,670
In this world,

225
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,230
there's nothing more worthy of celebration

226
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,030
than finding someone who you truly love

227
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,110
and loves you back.

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,590
His Majesty found the one.

229
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,110
And that person is our queen.

230
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,760
How could we do anything to break them up?

231
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,070
That's right.

232
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,150
True love comes first.

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,750
As for those didactic rules and etiquette,

234
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,150
they can be ignored.

235
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
I also want His Majesty
and Her Highness together.

236
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,150
Right.

237
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,830
Elders, please think it through.

238
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,190
I know you made contributions.

239
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,480
We will not forget about that.

240
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,950
But one-sided love will not work.

241
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,800
I hope you can move on soon.

242
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,880
I'm devoted to His Majesty, too.

243
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,390
Well, that's the point.

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,560
Love is mutual in a relationship.

245
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,040
His Majesty doesn't like you.

246
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,070
Miss Su He.

247
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,800
You're still young.

248
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,150
I'm sure you'll find

249
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,680
your true love.

250
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,710
And that story will also be a much-told tale.

251
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,120
What an old pickup routine!

252
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,320
I've heard all

253
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,150
about the story script.

254
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,920
How's my story telling?

255
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,750
It turns out that

256
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,630
you do care about me.

257
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,240
Don't get me wrong.

258
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,630
I just hate to lose.

259
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,880
Qi Pa.

260
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,390
In fact, at the River Lantern Festival,

261
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,880
I wanted to get things straight with you.

262
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,150
I did lie to you.

263
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,480
I don't expect you to understand.

264
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,560
But you must know

265
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,480
that my love for you will never change.

266
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,750
I hope that you could

267
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
give me a second chance.

268
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,190
It's not about the Holy Pearl.

269
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,920
It's just you and me.

270
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,680
Will you give me this chance?

271
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,950
What about Miss Su He?

272
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,120
She saved me and I'm grateful for it.

273
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,510
But I made it clear to her five years ago

274
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,240
that I had no feelings for her.

275
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,830
Not five years ago.

276
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,560
Not now.

277
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,120
In my life, you're the only person

278
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,750
I've loved and will love.

279
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,880
Okay.

280
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,480
So you're willing to give me a chance?

♪Be with you till the end of the night♪

282
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,000

Come on in.

289
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,040
Your Majesty.

290
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,920
You...

291
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,560
Su He.

292
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,480
I will repay you as much as I can

293
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,270
for what you did five years ago.

294
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,320
I hope you could stop your madness.

295
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,920
I like you. That's all.

296
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,320
How is that madness?

297
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,680
Kui Mulang.

298
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,000
You're so heartless.

299
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,190
Is this what I get

300
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,880
for sacrificing my life to save you?

301
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,560
Why can't you understand

302
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
the difference between love and gratitude?

303
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,120
Don't waste your time on me.

304
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:36,950
I...

305
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,070
If you can figure this out,

306
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,590
I'll make other arrangements for you.

307
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,150
Okay.

308
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,000
Remember your words.

309
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,390
You will be sorry.

310
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,750
Now you give up?

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,880
I give up.

312
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,120
Are you sure?

313
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,480
I told you so.

314
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,360
He.

315
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,800
This is the Blood Scorpion I feed.

316
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,590
Blood Scorpion?

317
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,120
You never mentioned it before.

318
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,920
After you fell off the cliff,

319
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I kept this.

320
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
During the big fight,

321
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
Kui Mulang lost the Holy Pearl.

322
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,150
After that, I pondered

323
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,710
what I should do

324
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,190
to defeat him

325
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,360
if he got the Holy Pearl back

326
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,590
by any chance.

327
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,630
The Holy Pearl?

328
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,950
Where is it now?

329
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,830
Oh, no way.

330
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,630
Qi Pa?

331
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,720
Exactly.

332
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,560
It took me much effort

333
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,320
to find this scorpion.

334
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,150
Once it touches human skin,

335
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,680
it makes a tear

336
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,960
and enters the body through it.

337
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,470
From then on,

338
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
the Blood Scorpion

339
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,200
parasitizes the host.

340
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,150
It feeds on human blood

341
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,080
inside the host.

342
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,200
The host dies in a month or so.

343
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,390
However,

344
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,800
you're different.

345
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,470
The Su family owes the scorpion bloodline.

346
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,150
When the scorpion enters the body,

347
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,960
instead of killing you,

348
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,440
it will merge with you

349
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,800
and boost your inner strength.

350
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,560
The scorpion venom
will be a hundredfold stronger.

351
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,390
I didn't know it has that efficacy.

352
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,720
The Holy Pearl inside Qi Pa
is the purest thing in the world.

353
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,720
After merging with the Blood Scorpion,

354
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,680
your venom will be second to none
in toxicity.

355
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,960
If Qi Pa gets poisoned,

356
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,040
her body will be affected

357
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,040
and repel the Holy Pearl.

358
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,470
Then the Holy Pearl
will leave her body naturally.

359
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,200
After you get the Holy Pearl,

360
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,350
Kui Mulang and the whole Beast Clan

361
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,750
will have to kneel at your feet.

362
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,600
But the merging process

363
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,390
is agonizingly painful.

364
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,320
Can you take it for our great cause?

365
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,840
Chun'er.

366
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,200
Chun'er.

367
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
Just leave these chores to me.

368
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,870
Chun'er.

369
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,720
I'm not bringing any trouble

370
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,470
by coming here, am I?

371
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,720
Of course not.

372
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,870
You're the main labor force

373
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,080
here in this kitchen.

374
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,600
Besides, they all envy me.

375
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,440
They do?

376
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,150
What do they envy about you?

377
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
About...

378
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,270

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,990
can endure this painful process?

445
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,630
She is too obsessed with Kui Mulang.

446
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,840

I'm sorry.

451
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,680
You've told me

452
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,870
that Her Ladyship

453
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,600
is of the scorpion bloodline,

454
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,110
so that scorpion won't take years
off her life.

455
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,320
Had I not said so,

456
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,600
would He have agreed to do it

458
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,230

How could it not shorten her living years?

460
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,840
The scorpion bloodline doesn't help.

461
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,840

462
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,390

Let's have a closure today.

477

It's all because of the Holy Pearl.

478

Otherwise, Kui Mulang
wouldn't have been enchanted by you.

Liu Jun, Bai Ke and the others

543
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,840
are no different from the walking dead.

544
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,960

545
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,870

546
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,960
Who got her injured?

547
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,840

548
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,960
Su He?

549
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,350
What about Chun'er?

550
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,110
Has she also been controlled?

551
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,230
I'm afraid so.

552
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,920
I'll go back to save her.

553

You go back to the palace now.

554
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,270
You are throwing yourself into a trap.

555

What should we do then?

556
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,150
The people in the palace

557
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,470
are just being controlled.

558
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,270
They are safe for the time being.

559
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,910
The urgent matter is to save Qi Pa.

560
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,880
She may not survive the night.

561
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,320
What can I do?

562
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,430
Tell me and I'll do it.

563
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,400
I need time to get her healed.

575
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,360
Did your plan work?

576
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,880
The entire Beast Clan

577
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,800
is now under my control.

578
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,080
Kui Mulang and Qi Pa escaped.

579
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,040
They sure did.

580
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,990
It doesn't matter.

581
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,800
Get ready for this.

582
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,560
Su He is still alive.

583
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,880
She entered the palace a few days ago.

584
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,670
Su He didn't die?

585
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,560
Five years ago,

586
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,510
she took my hit for Kui Mulang

587
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,470
and fell off the cliff.

588
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,910
But she's still alive?

589
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,910
Yes, she is.

590
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,080
Su Daqiang.

591
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,670
How many things are you hiding from me?

592
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,990
None of that matters.

593
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,270
The point is the entire Beast Clan

594
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,710
is under my control now.

595
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,120
Qi Pa has been poisoned by He.

596
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,710
She won't live long.

597
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,560
Kui Mulang has lost the Holy Pearl.

598
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,270
So no one is gonna help him.

599
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,840
We won.

600
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,670
You're going to be the king

601
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,400
of the Beast Clan soon.

602
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,600
We can go back to the palace.

603
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,160
I can finally leave here.

604
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,600
Ma Yingxiong.

605
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,950
Prince Consort.

606
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,470
How is Her Grace doing?

607
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,040
The toxin inside has been removed.

608
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,230
But Su He's venom is potent.

609
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,470
It must have affected her health.

610
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
It will take her some time to fully recover.

611
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,040
How about this?

612
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,510
I'll sneak into the city

613
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,230
and check the current situation.

614
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,270
No, you can't.

615
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,510
It's too dangerous.

616
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,800
I'll be careful.

617
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,800
Besides,

618
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,640
I need to get you something to eat and drink.

619
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,430
And medicine.

620
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,040
Her Grace will need them to recharge

621
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
since she's so weak.

622
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,800
Then we'll count on you.

623
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,710
You must be careful.

624
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,160
Don't worry.

625
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,270
By the way,

626
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,400
how am I gonna get out of this forest?

627
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,040
Look at that path.

628
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,910
Walk along it to the end
and you're out of here.

629
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,430
Okay.

630
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,040
Father.

631
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,080
I'm sorry.

632
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,840
I let Kui Mulang and Qi Pa escape.

633
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,910
I'll take any punishment, Father.

634
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,360
He.

635
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,190
You're doing great.

636
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,360
Kui Mulang is no longer a threat.

637
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,430
Just send some men to arrest him.
