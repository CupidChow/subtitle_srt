[Episode 16]

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,040
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,230
Are you looking for me?

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,550
Come here.

21
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,040
Come here.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,720
Come here.

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,910
Why did you call me here

24
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,110
so late at night?

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,550
Does it need a reason why?

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,470
It's okay.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
It's only two of us here.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,550
Easy, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,080
I know that

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,720
Elder Qi has been forcing you

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,110
to take decoction
for the baby recently,

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,800
and not let you move around at will.

33
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,240
With your temperament,

34
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,360
you must feel very bored.

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,110
But recently the elders

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,160
have attached great importance to this.

37
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,600
So,

38
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,080
it's hard for me

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,910
to weigh in.

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,080
So I...

41
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,320
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

42
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,720
Why are you a little different today?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,360
What's the difference?

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,720
Do you like it?

45
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

46
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,360
I love it.

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,390
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,830
Are you feeling

49
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,000
an overwhelming sense of anger right now?

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,600
It's okay. Let it out.

51
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,440
Here.

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,470
Come on.

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,630
What are you...?

54
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,240
Shouldn't you be angry?

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,240
Calm down.

56
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,880
Get away.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,350
Calm down.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,440
Get away.

59
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,950
You!

60
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,320
What did you use?

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,550
I...

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,320
Your Majesty.

63
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
It's being late.

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
Go back to rest.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
I am going to sleep.

66
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,550
It turns out that becoming animalistic

67
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,830
means to be clingy.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
It seems to be overused this time.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
If I use the right dosage

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,200
next time,

71
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,230
Kui Mulang can be hallucinated

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,600
and agree to my request.

73
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Your Majesty,

74
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,830
as you know,

75
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,950
we are running out of time.

76
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,550
I'm not urging you anymore.

77
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,720
Qi Pa began to study wolf grass

78
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,550
for abortion.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,270
If she succeeds,

80
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,790
she will find a way to escape again.

81
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,350
I didn't expect that
the three-month period she promised me

82
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,670
was just a stopgap measure.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,510
She wouldn't even

84
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,670
give me three months.

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,920
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,550
I will inform everyone

87
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,880
to strengthen the guards,

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,320
and I will definitely not
let Her Highness succeed.

89
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,440
Why didn't she even give me a chance?

90
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,440
Your Majesty, calm down.

91
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,230
Relationships take time.

92
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,040
You can be more positive.

93
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,670
Any advice?

94
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,000
Surprises.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,670
I've heard that

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,440
women like the unexpected.

97
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,600
You can think about her preferences

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,670
and create surprises accordingly.

111

138

You are also setting up a stall here.

155

Your Highness, don't make fun of me.

156

Never mind.

You don't look like a stall owner.

It's okay.

Yes, Your Highness.

173
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,470
But what is

174
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,760
a sales champion?

175
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,520
It's the best seller.

176
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,880
But

177
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,400
don't just focus on selling things.

178
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
Communicate more with

179

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,590
Your Highness, His Majesty said that

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,520
you can get whatever you like.

192
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,230
Really?

193
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,960
So you like sachets.

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,030
It's for your King.

195
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,590
It's perfect for wolf grass.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,550
And Kui Mulang will definitely
listen to me in everything.

197
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,790
You are even thinking about
choosing a gift for His Majesty.

198
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,110
He called everyone

199
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,230
to prepare a surprise for me.

200
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Just in return.

201
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,200
I will take this.

202
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,960
I said I don't want to come here.

203
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,910
You like shopping at the market the most.

204
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,790
You always say that you don't have time
for that because you are on duty.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,910
Now His Majesty

206
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,590
moved the whole market here.

207
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,790
Just take use of it.

208
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,350
I won't go to the market

209
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,320
that His Majesty prepared for that woman.

210
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,000
Hush.

211
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
She's the Queen.

212
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,030
His Majesty loves her deeply.

213
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,760
Look.

214
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Be careful.

215
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,590
I am leaving.

216
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,440
Don't.

217
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,880
Beauty.

218
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,960
Your Highness.

219
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,910
Here you are.

220
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,400
There is

221
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,910
so much to see here.

222
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,910
It's good to choose something.

223
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
Don't miss it.

224
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,510
This is for you.

225
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,320
I don't want anything from you.

226
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,240
It's okay.

227
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,680
But don't waste your own beauty.

228
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,590
This is

229
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,560
the most popular hairpin outside the palace.

230
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,950
Whoever wears it will be attractive.

231
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,750
Really?

232
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,920
Of course.

233
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,000
This hairpin

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,920
was sold at Chun'er's stall.

235
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,440
Go over there and have a look.

236
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,270
But

237
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,320
if you don't have enough money today,

238
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,320
I can lend you some.

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,120
Do I look like I'm short on money?

240
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,480
Listen.

241
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm going to buy

242
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,750
everything from her stall now.

243
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,510
Hu Die!

244
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,270
Bai Ke.

245
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,560
Girls

246
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,480
need to be coaxed.

247
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,040
Take it.

248
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,510
Take it.

249
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,800
It doesn't fit me.

250
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,680
Go.

251
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

252
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,270
No way.

253
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,040
I can't control myself every time I go shopping.

254
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
I bought so many things today.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm glad that you like it.

256
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,630
Everyone loves shopping.

257
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,240
It's very decompressing.

258
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,120
I will suggest His Majesty

259
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,560
to hold more such activities

260
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,320
in the palace.

261
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
No need.

262
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,630
It's no use for him to do anything.

263
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,710
I will definitely be going back

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,150
after three months.

265
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,560
Your Highness...

266
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,240
You should go back.

267
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,320
Your Highness.

268
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,270
You still won't forgive me?

269
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,190
It's not about this matter.

270
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,950
We have nothing to do with each other.

271
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,150
I got it.

272
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,270
I'll take my leave.

273
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,390
What's wrong with me?

274
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,510
It can't go on like this.

275
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,920
I have to ask Kui Mulang
to let me go as soon as possible.

276
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,710
Otherwise, over time,

277
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,070
I can't bear to part with them.

278
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,150
Today His Majesty held a market in the palace.

279
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,240
All the maids and eunuchs went there.

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,040
It must be very lively outside right now.

281
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
Kui Mulang is doing such boring things again.

282
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,920
It is said to make Her Highness happy,

283
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,750
for fear that she will be bored in the palace.

284
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,040
He did so much for a woman.

285
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,040
I look down on Kui Mulang

286
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,270
even more.

287
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,680
If someone did this for me,

288
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,880
I would be moved to tears.

289
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,750
How is that woman?

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
I applied her the best medicine in the palace

291
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,190
according to your instructions.

292
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,270
She was still in a coma when I left.

293
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,360
Okay.

294
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,270
There is a market in the palace now,

295
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,710
and the guard is relaxed.

296
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,390
Let's go have a look.

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,480
Yes.

298
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,480
Jing Muhan.

299
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,070
I didn't expect you to wake up so soon.

300
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,880
What's your purpose

301
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,800
in saving me and bringing me here?

302
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,560
I heard that you are very good at disguise.

303
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,070
So your previous identities in the city

304
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,320
were Stewardess Qing,

305
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,950
Chun'er,

306
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,560
and Qi Pa as well.

307
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,710
It has nothing to do with you.

308
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,190
I don't care what you are up to,

309
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,880
but you'd better

310
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,440
send me back as soon as possible.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,710
Otherwise, my master
will definitely not spare you.

312
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,390
It's a pity that

313
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,630
your master no longer wants you.

314
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,240
If it weren't for me,

315
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,680
you would probably be dead

316
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,830
under the cliff right now.

317
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,800
Yes.

318
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,320
You were on the verge of dying.

319
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,270
Your master

320
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,150
has no mercy for you,

321
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,750
and wants you to fend for yourself.

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,630
Master.

323
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,270
Is this the kid you said

324
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,870
with the chameleon bloodline?

325
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,230
Yes.

326
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,560
Want it?

327
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,560
Come.

328
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,390
Eat it.

329
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,960
Xiniang.

330
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,870
Keep her.

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,960
Yes.

332
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,270
To stay with the master,

333
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,800
you have to be useful.

334
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,840
If not,

335
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,440
you don't deserve to live.

336
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,680
Yes.

337
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Practice your skills.

338
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,630
Once again.

339
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,630
The master hates weak and useless people the most.

340
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,110
If you don't get up, I will kill you.

341
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,600
Get up!

342
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,200
It seems that

343
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,150
I am no longer useful to the master.

344
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
You finally figured it out.

345
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,440
Since I am no longer useful,

346
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,320
why did you save me?

347
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,350
A talent needs a scout.

348
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,320
I think you are useful.

349
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,750
Yes.

350
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,040
Only useful people deserve to live.

351
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,630
Say it.

352
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,270
What do you want from me?

353
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,920
Whether a person is useful or not

354
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,390
is not told by others.

355
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,600
You have to earn your own life.

356
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,390
Most of your poison

357
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,870
has been cleared by me.

358
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,080
But you are still weak.

359
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,320
Let's talk about it when you recover.

360
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,350
Eunuch Ruo.

361
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,080
I will leave her to you.

362
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,920
Yes.

363
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,040
I thought

364
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,110
she would love this market.

365
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,510
Unexpectedly, she still insisted on leaving.

366
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,390
Your Majesty.

367
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,990
In my opinion,

368
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,320
Her Highness bought you a gift on the market.

369
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,720
It shows that the surprise during the day works.

370
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,960
Take a seat.

371
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,720
Yes.

372
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,150
You mean

373
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,630
the surprise during the day works?

374
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,960
It makes sense.

375
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,110
I'm way too anxious.

376
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,800
If the surprise during the day works,

377
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,200
I have to take advantage of it

378
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,110
and give her a chance

379
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,230
to give me the present.

380
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,720
Your Majesty, you mean...

381
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,390
I have studied Daxia's
marriage and love books before.

382
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,040
There are many dating methods

383
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
that seem to be very effective for Daxia's women.

384
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,320
Maybe I can try.

385
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Your Majesty, you are so wise.

386
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,150
If it goes on,

387
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,080
it is just around the corner that
you and Her Highness

388
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,110
will fall in love with each other
and you can get the Holy Pearl.

389
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,390
I didn't think of that much.

390
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,870
Now I only hope that

391
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,350
Qi Pa can stay in Beast Clan for me.

392
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,870
Liu Jun.

393
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,600
Go for Qi Pa and tell her,

394
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,110
I'd like to meet her in the back mountain.

395
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes.

396
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,630
Your Highness.

397
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Liu Jun is outside.

398
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,470
Come in.

399
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,920
What's the matter?

400
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,750
His Majesty asked me to come and invite you
to meet him at the back mountain.

401
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,270
The back mountain?

402
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,990
Yes.

403
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,270
His Majesty is inviting you

404
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,750
for a date

405
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,510
Date?

406
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,080
Kui Mulang got to know more.

407
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,440
Date...

408
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,080
I can take the chance to

409
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,040
give this special sachet to Kui Mulang.

410
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,230
Lead me there.

411
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,960
I can't wait to

412
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,840
go on a date with your King.

413
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,230
Your Highness, please.

414
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,390
Okay.

415
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,150
Your Majesty.

416
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,870
Greetings to Your Majesty.

417
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,150
This is where

418
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,600
you're going to date me?

419
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,110
Don't you like it?

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,270
Of course I do.

421
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,920
I love it.

422
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,390
Follow me.

423
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,390
His Majesty loves Her Highness so much.

424
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,630
I also want a love like this.

425
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,680
You will.

426
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,080
Really?

427
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,470
Let's not bother them.

428
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,040
Let's go back first.

429
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,150
You haven't visited here

430
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,040
since you came to Beast Clan.

431
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,600
From here,

432
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,320
you can see the night view
of the entire Beast Clan.

433
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,720
I didn't expect the night view
of Beast Clan

434
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,990
to be so beautiful.

435
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,200
Yes.

436
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,080
It needs to be discovered bit by bit.

437
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,390
Indeed.

438
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,080
Thank you.

439
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,600
If there is anything you want to do

440
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,920
or any place you want to go

441
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,150
in the future,

442
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,600
just let me know.

443
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,230
I will satisfy you.

444
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,750
Really?

445
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,470
- Well...
- Except for Daxia.

446
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,680
I have told Mr. Li before.

447
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,750
Actually, I...

448
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,990
I know you don't like me yet.

449
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,800
But I said

450
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,200
I will wait for you.

451
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I heard that you brought a present to me?

452
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,750
Yes.

453
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,800
Wolf grass again?

454
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,390
Look here.

455
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,720
Do you want it?

456
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,470
Yes.

457
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
If so,

458
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,870
go over there

459
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,040
and spin for me.

460
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,350
Go and spin.

461
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,150
Good.

462
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,510
Now he's totally lost.

463
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,750
Since I've given you a present,

464
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,320
should you also give me one?

465
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,840
Yes.

466
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,320
Okay.

467
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,440
Then tell everyone tomorrow that

468
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,870
I have had a miscarriage.

469
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,680
Also,

470
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,440
could you send me home
before the three-month deadline?

471
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,920
No.

472
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,990
Why not?

473
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,510
You know it's all fake.

474
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,040
You didn't intend to

475
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,440
send me back at all, did you?

476
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,270
Even if the three months are up,

477
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,990
you won't send me back.

478
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,230
I will do what I promise you.

479
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,800
But before that,

480
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,270
I won't send you away.

481
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,870
Don't waste your time doing these things.

482
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,990
I will never like you.

483
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,270
Absolutely not!

484
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,750
As soon as the three months are up,

485
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
send me home.

486
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,840
The moonlight is so beautiful tonight.

487
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,040
When you see a beautiful scene,

488
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,560
you would like to share it with someone.

489
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,800
Mr. Liu Jun.

490
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,680
Do you know what that means?

491
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,320
What?

492
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,470
It means that

493
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,350
from now on, I will miss

494
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,470
the moon I watched with you tonight.

495
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,920
Chun'er said that she was very glad that

496
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,040
she expressed her feelings to Ma Yingxiong.

497
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,870
Otherwise,

498
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,840
she would not even have anyone to miss.

499
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,040
I was deeply inspired

500
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,510
after listening to it.

501
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,630
Mr. Liu Jun.

502
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,600
You have been unable to sense my feelings.

503
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,390
After much deliberation,

504
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,870
I think there is only one reason.

505
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,630
You've already have someone in your heart.

506
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,350
I...

507
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,750
You don't have to be afraid of hurting me.

508
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Her Highness said that
one needs to be brave in love.

509
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,870
But she also said that

510
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,040
love can't be forced.

511
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,470
If you do like someone else,

512
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,840
just forget about...

513
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,040
There is no one else!

514
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,110
Hongxiu.

515
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,750
You don't even know how much I envy you.

516
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,200
Me?

517
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,230
For what?

518
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,230
You are the bravest girl I have ever met.

519
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,080
Your Highness.

520
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,840
What are you looking at?

521
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,150
Look at that cloud.

522
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,510
Is it like a drumstick?

523
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,870
I think

524
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,040
it looks more like

525
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,470
the powerful fist of Mr. Liu Jun.

526
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Liu Jun

527
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,230
all the time.

528
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,870
Love is blind.

529
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,920
No!

530
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,350
You just thought about drumsticks.

531
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,150
Who did you think of?

532
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,800
Your Grace, look what it is.

533
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,990
Roast chicken.

534
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,230
After all, the two of us
share wealth and woe here.

535
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,150
Let's enjoy it together.

536
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,750
Nobody.

537
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,990
I just want to eat meat.

538
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,870
Your Highness.

539
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,150
If you want meat, just eat it.

540
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,350
Don't hold back.

541
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,990
It's bad for your health and your mood.

542
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,800
If someone caters to your pleasure

543
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,150
just to gain your trust,

544
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,750
I'd rather not eat

545
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,510
the meat.

546
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,750
But

547
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,200
can you really tell

548
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,200
why this person is so nice to you?

549
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,870
I am nice to Mr. Liu Jun.

550
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,350
But I also wish he would trust me more

551
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
and like me more.

552
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,390
And I...

553
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,040
And I hope for many things.

554
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,680
It's different.

555
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,750
What is the difference?

556
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,870
I recently had a new realization.

557
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,840
Seeing isn't necessarily believing.

558
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,630
You have to listen to
what the other party has to say.

559
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,440
What if he has any difficulties?

560
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,350
Miss Haitang is much better
after taking the decoction.

561
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,560
Your Royal Highness, don't worry.

562
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,320
The toxins in her body will be removed soon.

563
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
And she will be at your command.

564
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,320
We saved Haitang,

565
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,870
but we can't lose contact with them,

566
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,630
lest they suspect.

567
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,920
You mean...

568
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,150
You should continue to inquire about the news

569
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,630
and keep them informed promptly

570
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,600
Working along both lines

571
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,230
is the best for me.

572
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,720
You are so wise.

573
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm on it.

574
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Feelings can be developed.

575
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,470
But I don't want to develop feelings for you.

576
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,600
I just want to go home.

577
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,320
But before that,

578
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,630
I won't send you away.

579
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,600
Don't waste your time doing these things.

580
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,630
I will never like you.

581
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,870
Absolutely not!

582
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,680
As soon as the three months are up,

583
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,840
send me home.

584
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,990
Your Majesty.

585
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,990
Your Majesty.

586
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,510
Did you spend the night here?

587
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,600
I meditated here last night,

588
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,600
and flaked out.

589
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,200
It's okay.

590
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,110
I am fine.

591
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,840
You are fine.

592
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,630
But

593
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,600
you don't feel good.

594
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Why do you talk so much?

595
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,110
I need to talk to Qi Pa.

596
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,990
I've never been so hesitant.

597
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,350
It's all Li Xiong's fault.

598
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,270
It's me.

599
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,600
Your Highness.

600
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,990
I don't want to see you.

601
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,040
If you have something to say,

602
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,750
say it now and leave.

603
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,390
I have something very important to tell you.

604
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,040
Whether you are willing to forgive me or not,

605
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,560
whether you allow me to exist

606
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,040
in the rest of your life or not,

607
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,750
I have to give it a try today.

608
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,630
What?

609
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,990
Are you trying to play a trick?

610
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,750
Go with me outside the palace for a walk.

611
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,600
Just you and me.

612
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,920
I know that you are a bit depressed

613
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,800
after staying here for a long time,

614
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,230
so...

615
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,800
Kui Mulang took me out last night.

616
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,990
I'm not depressed.

617
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,230
Well...

618
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,710
I...

619
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,360
But if you

620
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,230
change the place,

621
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,040
I will think about it.

622
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,800
Okay.

623
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,670
It's up to you.

624
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,190
Go outside the palace?

625
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,360
[General's Mansion]

626
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,800
General Ma.

627
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,950
Miss E'huang.

628
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,950
That's right, General Ma.

629
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,400
You should have brought back
a portrait of Zhong Kui long ago.

630
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,320
All your previous fantasies

631
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,360
are absolutely false.

632
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,600
Don't talk nonsense.

633
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,510
It was Her Majesty who sent me here.

634
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,080
She asked me to tell you that

635
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,320
His Majesty has sent more people

636
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,800
to look for Her Grace everywhere.

637
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,040
Take a few more days off.

638
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,430
Put yourself together and join us.

639
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,600
I have told you many times.

640
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,560
Why don't you believe me?

641
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,270
I did meet Her Grace

642
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,320
in a place called Beast Clan.

643
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,840
And Her Grace said that

644
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,910
we will definitely meet in Daxia again.

645
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,040
Okay, I see.

646
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
You'd better hang up

647
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,910
the portrait of Zhong Kui

648
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,910
and rest for a few days.

649
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,270
I...

650
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,040
I am leaving.

651
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,670
Yingxiong.

652
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,990
How are you over there?

653
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,950
When will you come back to see me again?

654
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,880
I made steamed buns for you again

655
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,640
and waited for you to come back and eat.

656
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,750
Don't you have something to tell me?

657
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,560
Why are you so silent?

658
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,510
I have so much to say.

659
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,160
I don't know where to start

660
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,840
If you don't say it now,

661
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,670
I am going back.

662
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,750
Qi Pa.

663
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,120
Sorry.

664
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,270
If an apology is useful,

665
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,190
what do we need the law for?

666
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,160
Actually you don't have to apologize to me.

667
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,470
After all, you work for Kui Mulang.

668
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,040
It's your job

669
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,600
to act toward me.

670
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,910
It's not like that, Qi Pa.

671
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,710
Although I lied to you about something,

672
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,470
I treated you sincerely.

673
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,510
I am not acting.

674
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,080
You have no idea

675
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
how bad I am feeling

676
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,400
since you have been ignoring me

677
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,670
all this time.

678
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,470
But I have to tell you that,

679
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,360
although my identity has changed,

680
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,840
I never meant to hurt you.

681
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,230
Maybe

682
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,120
you can try to trust me again.

683
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,040
Okay.

684
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,640
I trust you.

685
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,470
So can you help me escape from here?

686
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,360
Can you guarantee that

687
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,710
you won't tell Kui Mulang

688
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,270
every time I take action?

689
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,910
I...

690
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,950
You can't.

691
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,560
Qi Pa.

692
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,160
Although I...

693
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,320
Li Xiong!

694
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,560
Don't!

695
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
It's poisonous.

696
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,190
Li Xiong! Li Xiong!

697
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,080
Doctor, how is he?

698
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,670
This poison is rare.

699
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,360
Your Highness, you saved Mr. Li's life

700
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,190
by sucking out the poison timely.

701
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,840
But since he is weak himself,

702
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,000
the detoxification

703
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,520
drained him of lots of energy.

704
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,390
Weak?

705
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,390
It's impossible.

706
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,000
Li Xiong has always been in good health.

707
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,630
Your Highness.

708
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,390
A person who looks healthy

709
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,670
may suffer from inner injury.

710
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,800
Mr. Li is a martial artist.

711
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,840
He could have some old wounds.

712
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,760
Li Xiong.

713
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
