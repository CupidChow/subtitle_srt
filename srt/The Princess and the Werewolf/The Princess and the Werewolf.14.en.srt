[Episode 14]

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,360
The process is all over.

19
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,800
Don't be dazed anymore.

20
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,320
Today

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,320
I wanted to give you a perfect wedding.

22
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,800
But because of Jing Muhan,

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,270
I had to do this.

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,910
Don't worry.

25
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,320
I will definitely make it up
to both of us in the future.

26
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,910
Never mind.

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,000
Ma Yingxiong was also involved.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,910
You don't blame me, and I don't blame you.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,720
We've even.

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,110
But your brother

31
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,390
really caused much trouble.

32
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,520
He is

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,750
my sore point.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
Would you like to listen to me?

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,110
Jing Muhan is

36
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,470
my only younger brother.

37
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,670
We grew up together

38
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
and played together.

39
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,360
But after I became King,

40
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,880
he targeted me everywhere.

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,270
He even

42
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,750
staged a coup.

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,550
It seems you got it.

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm just guessing.

45
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,190
You must have guessed that

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
I locked him up for five years.

47
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,030
I thought he would have remoulded himself.

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,440
But I didn't expect him

49
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,000
to hate me even more now.

50
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,910
So you knew

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,160
his plan this time?

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
He came to see me before our wedding.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,030
I was in an argument with him

54
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,240
and he inadvertently tore off my mask.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,630
Although he promised me to keep it a secret,

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,190
I know him well

57
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,470
and I guessed that he wouldn't let it go easily.

58
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,040
Then why didn't you execute him back then

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
or imprison him for life?

60
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,720
Usurping the throne is a capital offense.

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,640
He is my brother after all.

62
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,350
And I promised my mother

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,440
to take good care of him.

64
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,670
That's to say,

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,390
you won't blame Ma Yingxiong either?

66
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,320
He's just bewitched.

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,920
And

68
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,720
all he wants is to take you back to Daxia.

69
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't worry.

70
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,390
I will definitely do what I promised you

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,440
and send him back safely.

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,720
That's good.

73
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,640
Actually, I've always been

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,720
curious about one thing.

75
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,390
I don't know if I should ask.

76
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,760
Go ahead.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,270
The Kings of Beast Clan

78
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,110
never show their true face

79
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,920
in front of the people,

80
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
is it because

81
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,760
all of them...?

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,600
Have a different looking

83
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,950
like me?

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,200
It's just a tradition.

85
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,440
Just think of me

86
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,350
as a unique one.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,510
There are so many traditions in the Beast Clan.

88
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,830
Today is the second time

89
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,270
I can talk to you with peace of mind like this.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,950
When was the first time?

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,040
The time you promised me to marry me

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
and proposed to me for three months.

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,230
You have a really good memory.

94
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,950
I remember clearly

95
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,920
every time I got along with you.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,720
It's getting late.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,720
It's time for me to go back to my chamber.

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
I am leaving.

99
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,760
What are you doing?

100
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,320
We set up rules.

101
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,000
It is our wedding night.

102
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
You should at least stay here

103
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,600
until dawn.

104
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,640
Okay.

105
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,270
Don't worry.

106
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,110
I would never break my promise.

107
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,830
It's good for both of us

108
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,600
to put on a show.

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,760
Okay.

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,550
You should sleep on the bed.

111
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,320
What about you?

112
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,640
I'm going to read.

113
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,760
I have no choice but to

114
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
sleep in your chamber tonight.

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm not going to fall asleep.

116
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,390
Don't come close.

117
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,880
Okay.

118
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,760
It's all up to you.

119
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,790
Don't fall asleep, Qi Pa.

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,520
that came here early in the morning.

131
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,910
The King ordered me
to come and pick you up.

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,910
No need. I can go back myself.

133
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,440
You just got married.

134
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,550
It is inappropriate for you to go back by yourself.

135
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,200
I want to discuss the matter
of Ma Yingxiong with Kui Mulang.

136
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,640
Don't worry about this, Your Grace.

137
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,350
His Majesty went to the elders early in the morning

138
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,840
for his lenient punishment.

139
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,080
Your Grace, happy wedding.

140
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,470
Congratulations to Your Grace.

143
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Thank you.

144
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,320
Your Grace.

145
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,280
Your Grace, something's up.

146
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,440
Come with me.

147
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
What happened?

148
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,350
Just come with me.

149
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,960
Take it easy. These are all fragile.

150
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,030
Wish His Majesty and Your Grace a happy wedding.

151
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,790
This...

152
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,110
Greetings to Your Grace and royal heir.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,590
Good morning.

154
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,960
Elder Qi.

155
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,640
What are these?

156
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,590
These are all wedding gifts

157
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,030
from all palaces.

158
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,760
Hongxiu.

159
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,230
Hurry up and go stew

160
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,550
those wild ginseng, snow lotus, etc.,

161
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
for Her Grace.

162
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,840
Yes.

163
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,910
Elder, no need for that.

164
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,350
The royal heir is the top priority.

165
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,030
What's more, Ma Yingxiong held the prince hostage

166
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,790
and threatened His Majesty...

167
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,590
I will take them.

168
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,960
Give me everything you have.

169
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,440
Although Ma Yingxiong was impulsive in the palace,

170
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,840
we have found out that

171
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,760
he was bewitched by Jing Muhan.

172
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,550
Exactly.

173
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,710
The only shortcoming of Ma Yingxiong

174
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,350
is his IQ.

175
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,840
But this time Ma Yingxiong was way too arrogant.

176
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,590
He can be spared the death penalty,
but has to accept the punishment.

177
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Will he continue to be imprisoned?

178
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Don't worry, Your Grace.

179
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,440
His Majesty has interceded for him.

180
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,550
So...

181
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,910
So...

182
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,790
He needed to plant 100 trees before.

183
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,440
Now he needs to plant 300 trees.

184
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,110
Once the task is completed,

185
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,080
he can go back.

186
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,350
You are so kind!

187
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Calm down.

188
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
Be careful with the baby

189
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,840
Okay.

190
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,320
Thank you, Elder Qi.

191
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,590
Mammy Xiong.

192
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,470
Yes.

193
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,550
Your Grace.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,710
That's it for the matter of Ma Yingxiong.

195
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,150
However, Your Grace has been so naughty

196
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,110
in recent times,

197
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,520
I have decided that Mammy Xiong
will take care of you from now on.

198
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,910
Your Grace, please behave yourself.

199
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,590
Elder Qi.

200
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't think it necessary.

201
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,320
Of course it is.

202
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,760
I can only rest assured

203
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,470
with Mammy Xiong here with you.

204
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,350
Although the essence
of the sun and the moon is good,

205
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,280
it should not be over absorbed.

206
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,640
In the future, whenever Her Grace
moves too frequently,

207
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,000
you have to remind her to rest.

208
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,320
Elder Qi.

209
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not necessary.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,760
I don't need anyone to help me.

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,440
I...

212
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,550
Your Grace.

213
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,470
Don't overdo it.

214
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
She has great strength.

215
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,030
Her name fits her well.

216
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,080
Respect.

217
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,960
Your Royal Highness.

218
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,030
It's time to eat.

219
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,280
I have no appetite.

220
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,080
Your Royal Highness.

221
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,910
You should at least eat something.

222
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,790
You can't go on like this.

223
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,590
I was only one step away from succeeding.

224
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,320
Why could Kui Mulang

225
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,910
predict every plan of me?

226
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,840
Is he really smarter than me?

227
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,080
Your Royal Highness.

228
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
You made such a big mistake,

229
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,550
but the King only punished you
to reflect on yourself in the chamber.

230
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,960
He did show mercy.

231
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,150
Anyway, we can't go out now.

232
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,230
Just take some rest.

233
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,960
No way!

234
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,350
Kui Mulang can never lock me up.

235
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,520
Now the secret passage leading
to the outside of the palace is sealed.

236
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,080
I could dig another one for you,

237
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,640
but...

238
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,150
No.

239
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,230
We can't use the same method again.

240
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,000
What's your plan then?

241
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,030
Are you going to be stuck here forever?

242
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,520
Don't forget that

243
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,910
I still have Elder Lu.

244
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,030
Even Kui Mulang is subject to the Elders' Court.

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,550
Yes.

246
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,710
Since you were young,
Elder Lu has treated you best.

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,030
He will definitely help you.

248
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,030
Prepare me the ink.

249
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,840
Let me impress him with emotion and reason.

250
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,230
Elder Lu's biggest fault is being softhearted.

251
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,230
Yes.

252
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,710
Breathe.

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,670
Stretch.

254
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,200
Good.

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,030
Good, hold on.

256
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,590
Good, balance.

257
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,400
Breathe.

258
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,520
Yes, hold on.

259
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,280
Stretch. Keep balance.

260
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,960
Your Grace.

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,280
Mammy Xiong.

262
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,910
May I take a rest?

263
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,110
Your Grace.

264
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,440
Hold on.

265
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,760
Only a strong and supple physique

266
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,470
helps in childbirth.

267
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,150
Let's continue. Lift your leg.

268
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,000
No.

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,640
I quit.

270
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
Your Grace, be careful.

271
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,590
I can't make it anymore.

272
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,470
I'm going to vomit.

273
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,960
Your Grace.

274
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,910
Time to take the medicine.

275
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,880
I am full now.

276
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,550
I want to see your King.

277
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,080
His Majesty is busy with government affairs.

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,150
Your Grace, just take good care of the baby.

279
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,150
I have something to tell him.

280
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,400
Something very important.

281
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,470
Is there anything more important in the world

282
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,640
than a royal heir?

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,190
Yes.

284
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,590
That's the relationship between me and him.

285
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,110
If the parents are not in harmony,

286
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,920
will the baby be happy?

287
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,950
Right?

288
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,520
Hongxiu.

289
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,590
Make an appointment with the King for me.

290
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,070
Let him wait for me in the Imperial Garden.

291
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,830
Yes.

292
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,680
Kui Mulang.

293
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,230
I have something very important to tell you.

294
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,560
Please go ahead.

295
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,230
Could you do me a favor?

296
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,710
Ask Elder Qi

297
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,880
to get Mammy Xiong away.

298
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,400
I really can't stand her.

299
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
Mammy Xiong works for Elder Qi.

300
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,190
It's hard for me to say so.

301
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,040
Didn't you say that

302
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,160
you would listen to me in everything?

303
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,040
You don't even help me with this.

304
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,110
Just bear with it.

305
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
After all, you were the one

306
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,350
who admitted the pregnancy in the hall.

307
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,470
No way.

308
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,430
I need a decent excuse to set me free.

309
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,310
Otherwise, I will be confined in the palace

310
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,760
by Mammy Xiong every day,

311
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,950
and I can hardly stand it anymore.

312
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,520
What excuse do you want?

313
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,350
By the way,

314
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,760
any progress

315
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,190
in the Debilitating Powder thing?

316
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,950
Do you need me to help you solve the case?

317
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,190
You mean

318
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,920
you want to get freedom

319
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,040
on the excuse of investigating the case?

320
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,640
It's not an excuse.

321
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,950
I am really working on it.

322
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,280
Please help me.

323
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,830
Mammy Xiong.

324
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,400
Your Majesty.

325
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,520
I want Qi Pa to assist me

326
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,110
in investigating the case of Debilitating Powder.

327
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,590
If Qi Pa goes out

328
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,680
to investigate the case,

329
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
you don't have to follow her.

330
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,110
Your Majesty, this...

331
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,190
I will explain it to Elder Qi.

332
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,950
Yes.

333
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,680
At your command.

334
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,710
Your Majesty,

335
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,800
you are so wise.

336
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,230
You are not bad, either.

337
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,040
We're starting the case today.

338
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,070
Let's go to the pavilion in front.

339
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,520
Come on.

340
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,830
I've checked this bottle before

341
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,590
and find nothing special.

342
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,960
[Deliberating Powder]

343
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,760
Now it's easier.

344
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,950
Look.

345
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,440
There is a wrong word in the powder name.

346
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,760
[Deliberating Powder]
There is a wrong word in the powder name.

347
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,160
Wrong word?

348
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,830
It seems that the assassin's not

349
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,520
well educated.

350
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,950
The assassin

351
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,350
tried several times to sneak into the palace,

352
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,760
but she failed again this time.

353
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,310
She certainly won't let it go.

354
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,950
If she is still in the palace,

355
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,110
we can catch her by handwriting.

356
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,680
I thought it was hard

357
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,560
to catch someone with handwriting alone.

358
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,000
But now it seems

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
much easier.

360
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,880
Okay.

361
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,880
I will make arrangements now.

362
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,310
Good.

363
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,950
I will be grateful,

364
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,560
and loyal to His Majesty.

365
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,830
and never forget about the kindness today.

366
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,590
Jing Muhan.

367
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,520
Elders.

368
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,680
Look.

369
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,680
Muhan's letter of remorse

370
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,800
is so touching.

371
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,040
He is sincerely repentant.

372
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,280
Jing Muhan.

373
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,110
Not only have you offended His Majesty many times,

374
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,230
but this time you even disrupted his wedding feast.

375
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,160
Did you realize your sin?

376
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,680
I was held hostage by Ma Yingxiong.

377
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,520
Nonsense.

378
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,350
Ma Yingxiong confessed everything.

379
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,350
If you hadn't gone there yourself that day,

380
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,070
how could you have ended up like this?

381
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,070
Qi.

382
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,310
Muhan has been kneeling for so long.

383
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,560
I really feel sorry for him.

384
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,350
He was just...

385
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,560
He was just naughty.

386
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,430
It's nothing serious.

387
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,350
He was just making a joke

388
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,000
with his brother.

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,760
A joke?

390
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,640
How could this be a joke?

391
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,230
Actually,

392
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,470
I just didn't want

393
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,640
my brother to get married.

394
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,110
What are you talking about?

395
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,590
Did you hear him?

396
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,430
Listen to what he is talking about.

397
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,590
Because I want my brother

398
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,070
to be with me forever.

399
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,000
Since childhood, he would share with me

400
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,070
any delicious and fun things.

401
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,430
After he took the throne,

402
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,800
he became indifferent to me

403
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,070
and was busy with government affairs.

404
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,040
Now that he is married,

405
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,950
he doesn't even want to see me.

406
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,640
What a touching brotherhood.

407
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,830
Just spare him.

408
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,040
Yes, Elder Qi.

409
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,520
Just spare him.

410
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,520
I will not spare anyone

411
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,110
who wants to hurt the royal heir.

412
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,190
But Muhan was imprisoned
in the forbidden area for so long

413
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,520
and suffered a lot.

414
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,400
I really can't bear with that.

415
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,280
If he continues to be imprisoned,

416
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,760
how can he stand it?

417
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,350
Instead of confinement,

418
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,400
it is better to let him stay in the Elders' Court,

419
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,280
and copy scriptures every day

420
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,520
to cleanse his soul.

421
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,230
I'll discipline him
like I did when he was a kid.

422
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Just to kill two birds with one stone.

423
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,640
Elders.

424
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,680
I am willing to keep Elder Lu company every day.

425
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,680
I don't want to go back to

426
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,470
my lonely and cold chamber again.

427
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,590
Yes.

428
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,760
Then do what Elder Lu said.

429
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,520
But Jing Muhan, listen up.

430
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,110
I hope this time you are sincerely repenting.

431
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,710
Otherwise, I will never let you go.

432
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,350
Thank you, elders.

433
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,680
Everyone, listen carefully.

434
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,560
In order to bless the marriage
of the King and Queen,

435
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,280
and also to bless the royal heir,

436
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,190
the King decided to organize an event
in the palace.

437
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,350
Each of you writes a word of blessing,

438
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,520
attach your own name and give it to me.

439
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,950
Mr. Li.

440
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,520
We are all workers

441
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,710
and have not been to school.

442
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,350
Will Her Grace laugh at us?

443
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,230
Never mind.

444
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,950
These are all your best wishes.

445
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,400
Captain Hao.

446
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,040
Chun'er.

447
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,920
The palace is collecting

448
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,710
everyone's blessings for the King and Queen.

449
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
You two should also write something.

450
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,800
General Ma.

451
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,310
Could you teach me a few auspicious words?

452
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,880
I haven't gone to school,

453
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,070
and I don't know what to write.

454
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,830
General Ma.

455
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,110
You are so capable.

456
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,310
You must be adept with both the pen and the sword.

457
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,070
Do you know how to get there?

458
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,310
Where?

459
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,950
Your heart.

460
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,520
So sweet.

461
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
If you like it, there is more.

462
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,640
I devoted myself to it.

463
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,040
What?

464
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,830
My love to you.

465
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,880
I went to the sea today.

466
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,800
What sea?

467
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,920
See you again.

468
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,560
I...

469
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,760
I got crushed today.

470
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,110
What crushed you?

471
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,040
Crush on you.

472
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,070
You do have literary talent.

473
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,920
Your Grace.

474
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,350
Why are you here?

475
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,040
The king asked me to send notes of blessings.

476
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,110
I know you're still mad at me.

477
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,590
But it's my job.

478
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,040
Please cooperate with me.

479
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,760
Okay.

480
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,280
I won't say anything to you

481
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,070
except for work.

482
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,230
Why so many mistakes?

483
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,760
This is...

484
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,760
Sun Caodan?

485
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,040
Your Grace.

486
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,560
Watch your words.

487
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,280
That's what is written on it.

488
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,710
What's wrong with Caodan?

489
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,000
Cao(grass) and Dan(eggs)

490
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
are both everyday vulgar things

491
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,110
and not decent at all.

492
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,230
So it's uncivilized.

493
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,110
Have more babies. Chun'er.

494
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,560
Good faith, virtue and patriotism.
Blood splashes on the scene.

495
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,710
Ma Yingxiong.

496
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,710
Is he crazy?

497
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,680
No blessings.

498
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,710
Hu Die.

499
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,560
There isn't any mistake.

500
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
But poor handwriting.

501
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,920
It seems that your handwriting
is quite good.

502
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,630
Do we know each other well?

503
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,510
Don't talk nonsense with me.

504
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,870
Yes.

505
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,470
You'd better check the handwriting now.

506
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,600
No need for that.

507
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,200
These people are almost illiterate.

508
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,270
Are you also illiterate?

509
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,680
I have learned since childhood.

510
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,110
There are many civil servants
in the palace who are also able to read.

511
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,040
It's just that I didn't expect many guards,

512
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,560
maids and eunuchs in the palace

513
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,630
to be like this.

514
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,150
Your willingness to learn shows that
you are motivated.

515
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,230
But those who have not learned

516
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,150
do not necessarily choose ignorance.

517
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,040
But this is the dereliction of duty

518
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,320
of King Kui Mulang.

519
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,720
He can't even provide

520
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,440
compulsory education to his people.

521
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,630
What education?

522
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,470
Have more babies.

523
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,440
Chun'er.

524
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,470
Nuts.

525
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,870
Jing Muhan.

526
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,150
How dare Jing Muhan

527
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,750
write “Nuts”?

528
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,840
Let's wait and see.

529
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,270
I will show you what I can do.

530
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,840
Arrogant people will never be treated politely.

531
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,630
Your Grace, calm down.

532
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,350
Have you found any clues now?

533
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,990
No.

534
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,350
According to their educational level,

535
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,960
the one who left the wrong word in the powder name

536
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,630
is already highly-educated.

537
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,560
Congratulations to your King

538
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,110
for acquiring

539
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,040
some kind illiterates.

540
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,510
I have to make arrangements

541
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,870
and make everyone able to read
as soon as possible.

542
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,390
I can't let Qi Pa think I'm incompetent.

543
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,750
Your Grace.

544
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,080
Your Grace.

545
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,230
It's time to rest.

546
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,350
I tried to get some freedom

547
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,720
through the investigation.

548
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,080
Looks like it failed.

549
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,720
Go back and tell Kui Mulang that

550
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,230
the trail went cold.

551
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,600
Let him deal with it himself.

552
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,390
Yes.

553
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,280
[Elders' Hall]

554
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,960
I think he is sincerely repenting.

555
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Yes.

556
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,200
Muhan realized his mistake.

557
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Just let it go.

558
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,630
Right.

559
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,230
His Majesty is coming.

560
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,040
Greetings to Your Majesty.

561
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,230
Your Majesty.

562
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,630
Muhan has realized his mistake.

563
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,320
As his elder brother,

564
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,350
you should give him a way out.

565
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,110
It's better to have him copying scriptures here

566
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,110
than to be alone in the chamber.

567
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,080
We will discipline him strictly.

568
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,510
Liu Jun has already reported to me.

569
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,440
Elder Lu's discipline

570
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,440
is the best for him.

571
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,320
Your Majesty, is there anything else?

572
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,470
Ma Yingxiong accepted the punishment today

573
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,470
and went to plant trees.

574
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,800
I heard that he worked very hard.

575
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,320
He alone did what a normal person
would do in ten days

576
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,350
and planted 300 trees.

577
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,720
I think Ma Yingxiong

578
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,080
has remoulded himself.

579
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,080
After all, he's not a member of the Beast Clan.

580
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,510
It's better to send him back
to his hometown as soon as possible,

581
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,680
lest he stay here and be used by others,

582
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,560
causing trouble again.

583
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,440
It makes sense.

584
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,040
Now that he's been punished,

585
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,560
it's time to send him back.

586
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,150
Thank you, elders.

587
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
Take your time, Your Majesty.

588
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,150
I'm allowed to leave so soon?

589
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,600
What?

590
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,350
Is it because the Beast Clan
is a rich nation with plenty of products,

591
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,320
so you don't want to leave?

592
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,870
Of course not.

593
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,870
It's just...

594
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,560
If you want to

595
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,150
take Her Grace with you,

596
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,600
you'd better give up this idea.

597
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,320
I'd like to

598
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,920
meet Her Grace alone.

599
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,750
Okay.

600
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,560
I found that you, as a bodyguard,

601
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,870
love to make decisions for your King.

602
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,960
You'll get yourself in trouble.

603
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,560
You are offending your superior.

604
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
His Majesty is open-minded.

605
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,080
Of course.

606
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,870
We'll report back to him.

607
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,230
Yes.

608
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,110
Thank you.

609
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,800
Mammy Xiong.

610
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,510
Be gentle.

611
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,040
I am very gentle.

612
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,840
Your Grace. Your Grace.

613
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,920
Your Grace. Your...

614
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,920
Ma Yingxiong.

615
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,200
Your Grace.

616
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,110
Who is this?

617
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,990
This is Mammy Xiong.

618
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,110
This is Ma Yingxiong from my hometown.

619
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,390
I'd like to talk to Ma Yingxiong.

620
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,110
Mammy Xiong, could you leave us alone?

621
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,350
I'll take my leave.

622
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,750
Your Grace.

623
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,720
Uphold justice for me.

624
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,270
Your Grace.

625
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,630
After I leave,

626
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,200
when can I meet Chun'er again?

627
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,750
Your Grace, I don't want to leave.

628
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,040
Alright.

629
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,990
A man shouldn't easily cry.

630
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,390
Unless he's brokenhearted.

631
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,720
A man will always find his beloved one.

632
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,990
She's the only one

633
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,630
I want.

634
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,600
I can't live without her.

635
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,160
When did you become so literate?

636
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,880
Love makes me a poet.

637
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,750
I can't live...

638
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,470
Your Grace,
I will kill myself for the country.

639
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,080
Shut up.

640
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,990
The relationship between Chun'er and I

641
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,320
finally eased up.

642
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,560
Why are they asking me to leave now?

643
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,510
Why?

644
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,470
You'd better stand up at once.

645
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,040
Be quiet.

646
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,160
Your Grace.

647
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,600
Have you confessed to Chun'er?

648
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,320
This...

649
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,670
No.

650
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,230
Do it now.

651
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,600
I dare not.

652
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,470
I would rather kill myself

653
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,320
than be rejected by Chun'er.

654
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,120
You really learned

655
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,160
the essence of my mother.

656
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,360
Follow my heart?

657
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,470
In that case,

658
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,840
I will think of a way for you.

659
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,430
Sure!

660
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,910
I'm gonna ask Kui Mulang

661
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,710
to hold a friendly beach ball game

662
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,510
before you go.

663
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,080
Can we play ball on the beach?

664
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,040
Of course.

665
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,080
Think about it.

666
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,990
Before my mother went out to travel,

667
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,190
didn't she always hold ball games
in the palace?

668
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,430
So what does this have to do with Chun'er?

669
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,640
What should I say?

670
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,400
You fool.

671
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:41,800
Look.

672
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,990
Both athletic men

673
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,230
and smart men

674
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,560
are very attractive

675
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,270
to women.

676
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
You have well-developed limbs
but a moronic head.

677
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,600
We'd better play to your strengths.

678
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,040
Sports games are best for you.

679
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,600
Whether you can give full play
to your strengths

680
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,840
and win Chun'er's heart

681
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,430
is up to you.

682
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,040
But...

683
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,910
Chun'er will definitely not agree
to go back to Daxia with me.

684
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,510
Be big-hearted.

685
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,560
A long-distance relationship will also work.

686
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,040
A long-distance relationship

687
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,080
will also work?

688
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,800
Of course.

689
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,510
Your Grace.

690
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,120
Would you like to go back to Daxia

691
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,990
with your baby?

692
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,560
After the failure last time,

693
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,360
Kui Mulang

694
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,800
is warier of me.

695
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,950
And I promised him

696
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,670
to stay here for at least three months.

697
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,190
Three months?

698
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,710
This...

699
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,800
No worries.

700
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,320
Since Kui Mulang

701
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,040
can bring people back and forth freely,

702
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,670
there must be a connecting channel

703
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,510
between Daxia and Beast Clan.

704
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,120
Don't worry, Ma Yingxiong.

705
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,600
We will definitely meet again in Daxia.

706
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
I better not tell him about the fake pregnancy.

707
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,080
If something happens again, it's over.

708
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,640
We don't need to

709
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,080
meet each other so deliberately every night.

710
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,880
After all, we are now a couple.

711
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,230
We should make it look real.

712
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,910
Alright.

713
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,320
About what I just asked...

714
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,800
Beach volleyball?

715
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,640
I agree.

716
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,040
They are such a perfect match.

717
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,950
It's such a blessing

718
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,640
to drink tea and chat

719
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,430
with the beloved one

720
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,950
on such a romantic night.

721
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,950
I mean His Majesty and Her Grace,

722
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,120
not the two of us.

723
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,950
Never mind.

724
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,670
I know what you mean.

725
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,120
I feel as good about it

726
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,190
as you do.

727
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,710
But what are you going to do

728
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,840
after Ma Yingxiong returns to Daxia?

729
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,320
I'm going to find out

730
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,670
who's been trying to kill me.

731
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,840
Anyway, I can't leave here for a while.

732
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,470
Instead of sitting still waiting for death,

733
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,800
I'd rather be proactive.

734
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,360
Okay.

735
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,800
What about your pregnancy?

736
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,040
It depends.

737
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,670
Anyway, even if the day comes,

738
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,040
I can't give birth to anything.

739
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,670
You are really outspoken.

740
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,470
What do I have to worry about?

741
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,080
Qi Pa.

742
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,230
Haven't you forgiven Li Xiong yet?

743
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,190
You care about him.

744
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,160
After all, I made him lie,

745
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
and sent him to you.

746
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,710
If you are angry with Li Xiong now,

747
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
it is the same as being angry with me.

748
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,160
Don't worry.

749
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,950
I don't think so at all.

750
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,950
You have nothing to do with him.

751
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,670
I am sleepy.

752
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,080
I'm going back to rest.

753
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,910
Hongxiu, I'm tired.

754
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,750
Your Grace.

755
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,080
