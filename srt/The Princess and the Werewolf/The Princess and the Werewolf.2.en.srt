[Episode 2]

18
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,440
The princess is from a different race.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,120
It must be hard for her to stay here.

20
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,760
I've made up my mind.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,910
I will give her an unshakable status,

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,230
so that no one dares to despise her.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,190
What's your plan, Your Majesty?

24
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,270
Marry her.

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,510

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Haven't the elders been persuading me

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,270
to get married as soon as possible
to produce an heir?

28
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,950
Now the best candidate is right in front of me.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,870
You forgot what's recorded

30
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,950
in "Ancient History of the Beast"?

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,870
I didn't forget it.

32
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,000
The Holy Pearl is the purest thing.

33
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,630
If one wants to absorb it,

34
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,440
he has to pass it through the mouth

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,720
with the beloved one.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,000
To pass it through the mouth,
the two have to be in love.

37
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,910
It's already unfair to Qi Pa that

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,830
I brought her to the Beast Clan rashly.

39
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,670
And taking out the Holy Pearl
requires mutual love.

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,030
I should marry her.

41
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,720
But it takes time.

I know what you're worried about.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,630
But there is only one way.

Go to escort Qi Pa

51

and keep her safe.

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,110

to deliver internal force to the Holy Spring.

Preparations are being made
everywhere in the palace.

188
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,230
Kui Mulang

189
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,720
never does uncertain things.

190
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,960
Haitang.

191
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Keep an eye on that woman.

192
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,280
Yes.

193
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,400
I'll take my leave.

194
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,120
Sir.

195
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,600
Do you doubt that this woman
has something to do with the Holy Pearl?

196
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,160
Right.

197
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,070
Kui Mulang is very powerful now.

198
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,870
Even if he doesn't have the Holy Pearl,

199
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,750
it's very difficult

200
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,430
for me to kill him.

201
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,550
If he got the Holy Pearl,

202
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,750
it would be even impossible

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
for me to ascend the throne.

204
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,040
Xiniang.

205
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,070
He can't get the Holy Pearl.

206
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,360
Yes.

207
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,870
Your Grace.

208
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,070
Take a good rest here tonight.

209
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,990
The King isn't available at night.

210
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,310
Tomorrow morning I will take you
to meet the King.

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,070
No way.

212
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,670
I am going to see him

213
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,480
right now.

214
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,630
Your Grace.

215
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,870
[Hongxiu, bloodline: cat, fast, soft and caring]
I know you are anxious.

216
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,840
But calm down.

217
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,510
I am not anxious, I...

218
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,480
Yes.

219
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,720
I am indeed anxious.

220
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,110
I am going to see him right now.

221
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,550
When the right time comes,

222
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,160
the King will come to see you.

223
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,190
Tonight,

224
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,870
just have some rest here.

225
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,990
Your Grace.

226
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,110
You are so lucky.

227
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,600
We've been here for so long.

228
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,280
But we've never seen the King in person.

229
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,750
You've never seen him?

230
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,240
What do you mean?

231
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,550
Your Grace, don't you know?

232
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,750
It's the tradition of Beast Clan.

233
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,750
In fact, the previous kings
didn't show up much.

234
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,670
Even if they did,

235
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,600
they were wearing masks and hoods.

236
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,430
So none of us

237
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,800
has seen what they look like.

238
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,240
Masked King?

239
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,430
So even you of Beast Clan

240
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,550
haven't seen the true appearance

241
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,360
of Kui...

242
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,840
Kui...

243
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
Mu...

244
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,040
Mu...

245
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,510
Lang...

246
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,630
Lang?

247
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,360
No.

248
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,720
Your Grace, the King said that

249
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,800
you are his fiancée since childhood.

250
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,840
Soon it will be the day

251
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,040
when you two will get married as your parents agreed.

252
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,310
He saw you fainted in the woods,

253
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,110
and he was ashamed to send you back by himself

254
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,990
because he was worried about
violating etiquette,

255
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,040
so he asked me to pick you up.

256
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,670
Marriage since childhood?

257
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,870
It's a lie.

258
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,600
Our King never lies.

259
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,840
Never?

260
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,040
Now he lies.

261
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,630
Who is Kui Mulang indeed?

262
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,310
He abducted me in broad daylight.

263
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,280
The King wouldn't do this.

264
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,630
He's dapper in appearance

265
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,630
and the only one of its kind.

266
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,990
You haven't seen

267
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,670
his real face.

268
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,990
Why did you say that
he's dapper in appearance?

269
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,280
I just know it.

270
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,600
He attends to government affairs diligently
and loves the people.

271
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,870
He is nice to us.

272
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,070
As the old saying goes,

273
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,070
the face is the index of the heart.

274
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
He must be very handsome.

275
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,630
Enough.

276
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,840
It's been a busy day for you.

277
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
You don't need to serve me.

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Go back.

279
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,720
Your Grace, have a good rest.

280
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,960
I'll take my leave.

281
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,430
I can't wait any longer.

282
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
I'd like to see

283
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
what is Kui Mulang up to.

284
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,240
Anyone?

285
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,400
Judging by the furnishings here,

286
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,510
it should be Kui Mulang's bedroom.

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,600
The same clothes.

288
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,670
Could it be that the masked man is Kui Mulang?

289
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
There is not even a person

290
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,070
in such a big bedroom.

291
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,040
Monster!

292
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Stay away from me!

293
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,870
How dare you!

294
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,110
You broke into the king's bedchamber,

295
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,720
and you are so rude.

296
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,430
King?

297
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,510
So you are

298
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,670
Kui Mulang?

299
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,400
I am Kui Mulang.

300
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,750
What do you want to do?

301
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,070
No wonder the King of the Beast Clan

302
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,040
never showed his real face
in front of everyone,

303
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,280
and took a woman for marriage by force.

304
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,400
He must have been afraid that
after others saw his true face,

305
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,670
no girl would like to marry him,

306
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,670
so he grabbed me here.

307
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,310
It's the middle of the night,
and you didn't stay in your bedroom

308
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,550
but came to mine instead.

309
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm afraid it's out of line.

310
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,280
Could you tell me

311
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,160
what do you like about me?

312
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,800
I like your...

313
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,840
I can't tell Qi Pa about the Holy Pearl.

314
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,360
She is so resistant to me now.

315
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,150
If she thinks that this is a deal,

316
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,240
it will be even more difficult for her
to truly love me.

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,680
I...

318
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,110
I can change.

319
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,640
Let me tell you.

320
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,710
I went out that day to enjoy the scenery.

321
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,280
I saw how bold you were

322
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,710
in taming the fierce horse.

323
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,520
So I fell in love with you at first sight.

324
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,520
I can surely tame you.

325
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,040
That's why I want to marry you.

326
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,070
I have never seen

327
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,680
such a rude person like you.

328
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,920
Whatever you say.

329
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,430
Anyway, you're in Beast City now.

330
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,350
King.

331
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,280
Are you kidding me?

332
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,000
You know how to return to Daxia, right?

333
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,760
Just let me know.

334
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,920
I can go back on my own.

335
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,310
Let me tell you.

336
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,710
There is no way to leave Beast City.

337
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't believe it.

338
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,560
Don't you believe me?

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Never mind.

340
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,430
Over time, you will naturally know

341
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,190
whether I am telling the truth or not.

342
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
So horrible.

343
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
This must be a dream.

344
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,280
No way.

345
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,400
I'd better sleep

346
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,350
and think about how to escape tomorrow.

347
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,800
Your Majesty, you originally planned to

348
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,760
meet the princess during the day.

349
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,950
But she has seen you as you are now.

350
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
What's your next plan?

351
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,430
What else can I do?

352
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,830
From now on, I can only

353
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
meet her at night as Kui Mulang.

354
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,950
In any case, I can't let Qi Pa know that

355
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,280
I look different during the day and night.

356
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,680
After all, we don't know much
about the princess yet.

357
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,760
For the safety of Your Majesty and Beast Clan,

358
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,920
we'd better be cautious.

359
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,680
She was terrified

360
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,590
when she saw me just now.

361
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,800
As I expected,

362
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,400
she can't stand my look at night.

363
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,400
Your Majesty.

364
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,710
Today I went to the Library Pavilion
of the Elders' Court

365
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,350
to fetch "Ancient History of the Beast".

366
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,230
Look.

367
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,950
The book requires the two to be in love,

368
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,110
but there is no requirement
for appearance and form.

369
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,350
Why don't you test her

370
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,470
with your daytime appearance and body?

371
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,190
Maybe she can better accept you.

372
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,470
As long as you can get the Holy Pearl,

373

anything will do.

374
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,640
It seems to be the only way.

375
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,430
The plague

376
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,190
hundreds of years ago

377
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,400
made us all have

378
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,190
the characteristics of animals.

379
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
The ancestors were worried that our clan
would be misunderstood

380
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
and killed,

381
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,400
so they created the enchantment
to hide the Beast City.

382
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,000
It's just that the people here don't know that

383
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,230
The kings of Beast Clan of all dynasties

384
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,470
need to consume their own lives

385
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,950
to inject internal force into the Holy Spring.

386
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,190
If the people cannot drink

387
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,920
the spring water that has been infused
with inner force,

388
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,230
the plague will still recur.

389
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,680
The reason why the kings didn't
show their true appearance to others

390
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,310
was because they were worried that
they couldn't control the changes

391
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,920
in their appearance
after excessive consumption of internal force,

392
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,680
and would cause panic if it was discovered.

393
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,590
Moreover, the kings

394
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,190
had a short lifespan

395
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,470
because they practiced force
to the Holy Spring all the year round.

396
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,040
How can the common people

397
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,280
know the secret?

398
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,920
Not knowing is a good thing for the people.

so that I can protect the well-being
of the people of Beast Clan.

403
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,950
For the Beast Clan,

404

in the future?

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,350
Okay.

560
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,510
What're you talking about?

561
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,390
I don't understand at all.

562
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,750
Who are you?

563
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,110
Tell me the truth.
And I will spare you.

564
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,320
Or I will carry out the execution now.

565
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,040
You are such a cold beauty.

566
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,630
But you are so cruel.

567
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,510
Why are you so mean?

568
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,080
You look so beautiful.

569
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,960
If you always get angry,
you will get wrinkles.

570
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,600
How dare you!

571
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,470
I am Hu Die, the deputy commander
of the Imperial Guards.

572
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,870
Who are you?

573
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,200
How dare you barge into
the Beast City?

574
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,630
You are Hu Die?

575
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
So your bloodline is the butterfly?

576
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,440
Not bad.

577
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,750
You are just like your bloodline.

578
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,200
So beautiful.

579
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,080
It's none of your business.

580
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,630
My gosh.

581
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,630
My gosh.

582
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,470
So stinky.

583
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,440
Who is farting?

584
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,630
Who are you looking at?

585
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,510
Beauty.

586
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,470
Could it be that...?

587
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:02,990
Who are you pointing at?

588
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,270
Believe it or not, I will kill you.

589
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,040
I am the future Queen.

590
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,230
How dare you hurt me?

591
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,720
Deputy commander.

592
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,350
She just said that she is a princess.

593
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,390
So she's the expectant Queen
that the guards are looking for today.

594
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,870
Shall we...?

595
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,800
She's talking nonsense.

596
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,390
Her whereabouts are strange,
with ulterior motives.

597
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,470
How could she be the Queen
of the Beast Clan?

598
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,320
Even if she is really that princess,

599
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,350
she is not worthy of the King.

600
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,600
Excuse me.

601
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,390
Excuse me.

602
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,110
Go after her.

603
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,750
Stop!

604
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,600
Stop!

605
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
[Clear Spring Pool]

606
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,470
Stop.

607
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm really Princess Qi Pa.

608
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,080
Your expectant Queen.

609
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,510
If you kill me,

610
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,720
Kui Mulang will definitely not
let you go.

611
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,750
Come out first.

612
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,200
Let's make it clear.

613
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,920
Come out?

614
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,880
[Male]

615
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,150
Are you embarrassed to come here?

616
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,470
No.

617
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,800
This is a forbidden place
for women in the city,

618
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,870
and women are not allowed to enter.

619
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,350
That's good.

620
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,870
Then you should...

621
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,630
You!

622
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,840
You!

623
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,870
A woman entered!

624
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,150
A woman entered!

625
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,800
Look at her.

626
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,560
You know it's for males. Why are you...?

627
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,560
You are so shameless.

628
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,040
How could the King choose you?

629
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,080
I didn't expect that

630
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,230
you are a fan of Kui Mulang.

631
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,080
Sorry for that.

632
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,720
I'm really shameless.

633
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,990
You can spread the word

634
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,750
and stop him from marrying me.

635
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,110
You!

636
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,440
Beauty.

637
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:25,990
It's a woman.

638
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,320
Stop!

639
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,150
You...

640
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
Why did she enter?

641
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,110
Why did she enter?

642
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,560
[Open]

643
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,560
Closed today.

644
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,750
Great.

645
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,990
I don't want to see that.

646
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,600
Let me go in and see if there is a back door.

647
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:23,880
Oops.

648
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
It's not a back door.

649
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,540
Isn't it closed? Why is there someone inside?

650
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,280
It's you.

651
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,870
You are so handsome.

652
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,950
With good shape.

653
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,430
Please watch your words, Your Grace.

654
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,710
Who are you?

655
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,840
How do you know I'm a princess?

656
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,360
Wait.

657
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,080
I'm wearing men's clothing.

658
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,600
It should be Liu Jun.

659
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,560
If he suddenly came in
and called me Your Majesty,

660
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,120
my identity would be exposed.

661
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,000
You haven't answered me yet.

662
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,600
How do you know I'm a princess?

663
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,720
This is the badge
of Daxia's Shadow Guards.

664
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,800
[Xia]
This is the badge of Daxia's Shadow Guards.

665
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,870
You...

666
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,000
You are...

667
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,710
Zimei!

668
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,800
You kept your face covered in Daxia.

669
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,670
I almost didn't recognize you.

670
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,520
Great.

671
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,870
Great.

672
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,470
I finally met my people.

673
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,710
By the way,

674
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,560
do you remember how you got here?

675
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,840
Your Grace.

676
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,630
I have been trying to stop the thief

677
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,670
from taking you away that day.

678
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,040
So I followed you.

679
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,320
After being attacked suddenly,

680
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,280
I fell into a coma.

681
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,950
After waking up,

682
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,040
I found myself in Beast City.

683
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,390
It also happened to me.

684
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,280
After I lost consciousness,

685
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,080
I got here inexplicably.

686
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,280
I dragged you down.

687
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,600
Actually,

688
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,390
Kui Mulang's target

689
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,670
is me.

690
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,280
But why are you here?

691
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,120
Didn't Kui Mulang arrest you?

692
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,600
Of course he got me.

693
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,560
Kui Mulang always likes

694
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,230
to soak in hot springs.

695
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,080
So he asked me over to
test the water temperature for him.

696
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,230
Test the water temperature?

697
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,360
Yes.

698
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,000
It's such a private matter.

699
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,560
Why did he ask you to do so?

700
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,320
Could it be that...?

701
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,710
No.

702
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,430
Your Grace, you got me wrong.

703
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,630
Kui Mulang felt that
my skills were extraordinary,

704
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,840
so he took me to be his bodyguard.

705
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,150
Even you can't defeat him.

706
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,390
Right.

707
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,080
I just thought that

708
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,080
if I stayed with Kui Mulang as a bodyguard,

709
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,910
I could search for your whereabouts.

710
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,950
I didn't expect to meet you today.

711
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,390
Zimei.

712
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,000
You really paid too much for me.

713
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,230
Actually, you should call me Li Xiong here.

714
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,520
Li Xiong?

715
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,390
Is it the new nickname
given to you by Kui Mulang?

716
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,470
Sort of.

717
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,760
Alright.

718
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,630
Don't worry.

719
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,280
I will definitely

720
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,120
try to get you out of here.

721
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,430
After we get back to Daxia,

722
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,470
I will ask aunt Lyu

723
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,470
and uncle

724
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,200
to give you some pension.

725
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,280
[Pension]
to give you some pension.

726
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,670
I will be responsible

727
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,320
for the rest of your life.

728
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,870
Thank you, Your Grace.

729
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,080
That being said,

730
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,150
you now know Kui Mulang
better than I do.

731
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,120
By the way,

732
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,040
you also saw
his amazing appearance, right?

733
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,910
I was so scared.

734
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,800
Are you afraid of him?

735
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,360
It's said that
the face is the index of the heart.

736
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
Since he treats you like this,

737
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,800
he must be very cruel.

738
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,430
Your Grace.

739
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,600
You might have gotten me wrong.

740
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,360
Although I was taken captive by him,

741
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,390
according to my observation,

742
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,190
he is not a bad person.

743
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,000
Wake up.

744
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,520
Don't be brainwashed by him.

745
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,430
You have to know that

746
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,040
our biggest goal is to return to Daxia.

747
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,800
Beast City is like an iron barrel.

748
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,560
Apart from Kui Mulang,

749
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,760
no one knows of Daxia.

750
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,000
By the way,

751
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,280
what did you find from Kui Mulang?

752
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,000
Maybe I was obsessed
with searching for your whereabouts,

753
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
so I didn't pay much attention
to other things.

754
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,840
But, Your Grace,

755
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,870
I know you are eager to go back to Daxia.

756
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,520
But it's better not to do things

757
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,390
like today's trespassing
in the men's spring pool.

758
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,470
So what do you think we should do next?

759
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,470
Let's do this.

760
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,760
I will continue to stay by Kui Mulang's side
as a bodyguard,

761
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,670
looking for news.

762
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,040
Your Grace.

763
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,870
If you find anything later,

764
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,360
just let me know.

765
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,560
Okay.

766
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,600
My people are really reliable.

767
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,840
