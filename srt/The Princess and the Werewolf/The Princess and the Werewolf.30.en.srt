[Episode 30]

18
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,190
Never try to play tricks.

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,480
Tell me.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,190
What's the deal with the secret room
in your chamber?

21
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,000
And why is that spring

22
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,480
almost dry?

23
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,000
How many things are you hiding from me?

24
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,950
It seems you got it.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,800
Presumably you also know that

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,950
kings of Beast Clan won't live long.

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,360
What do you mean?

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,630
The spring in my room

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,310
is called the Holy Spring.

30
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,720
It is related to the fate
of the entire Beast Clan.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,830
The mission of all the kings

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,160
is to protect the Holy Spring.

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,670
In fact,

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,080
the plague of the Beast Clan
a hundred years ago

35
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,520
has never ended.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,390
If the common people can't drink

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,270
the spring water injected with internal force,

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,830
they may be at risk of being attacked

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,030
by the residual disease in their bodies
at any time.

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
We need to constantly inject

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,910
internal force into the Holy Spring.

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,910
Our lives

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,960
are also greatly depleted.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,080
How come?

45
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,160
That's why the kings of Beast Clan
of all ages

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,000
couldn't show anyone their true colors.

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,320
As we become weaker and weaker,

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
our appearance

49
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,960
will also become uncontrollably animalized.

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,440
Haven't you always wanted to know my secret?

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,910
This is my secret.

52
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,670
The truth about my changing appearance.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
I can't believe this.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,110
So this is also the case with

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
our father and ancestors?

56
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

57
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,720
Because I am your elder brother.

58
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,360
This is a mission I should undertake,

59
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,320
not yours.

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,550
I sought the Holy Pearl

61
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,630
in order to completely change my destiny.

62
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,110
Yet I failed.

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,750
If you become the King,

64
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,160
I will pass on to you
all the cultivation methods

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,470
left by ancestors

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,750
to activate your internal force.

67
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,630
But do remember.

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,960
Jing Muhan.

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,630
You have to take back the Holy Pearl

70
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,440
to completely save the Beast Clan.

71
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,920
Never let Su Daqiang rule the clan.

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,270
This is the real secret of the Holy Pearl.

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,950
No.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't believe it.

75
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,550
Not even a word.

76
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,920
Jing Muhan.

77
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,600
Take the current situation seriously.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,880
The hopes of the entire Beast Clan

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,270
is pinned on you.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160

81

Can Qi Pa

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,880
be ruthless and kill Kui Mulang?

85
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,880
So many people detain them.

86
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,510
Even if she wants to play tricks,

87
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,720
there is no way for them to escape.

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I think that

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,350
the so-called love

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,390
is just a lie.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,390
I've known all along that

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,760
this woman only cares about herself,

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
not Kui Mulang at all.

94
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,920
Kui Mulang.

95
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,790
Now you also feel

96
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,440
the bone-chilling coolness.

97
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,110
It must feel good

98
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,040
to be cut into pieces by your beloved one,
huh?

99
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,950
Give her the sword.

100
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Execution.

101
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,950
Don't be afraid.

102
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,350
I'm meant to die.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
You just set me free earlier.

104
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,510
Qi Pa.

105
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,200
What are you doing?

106
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,390
Do it now.

107
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay.

Qi Pa.

109
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,040
Although I lost the Holy Pearl,

110
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,760
since my blood

111
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,790
made you sober from a mad state,

112
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,510
it will definitely help you
temporarily recover your force.

113
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,320
You'll be fine.

114
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880

The entire Beast Clan should thank you.

If it weren't for you sacrificing yourself

to merge your blood with mine,

174
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,440
I wouldn't have been able to take back
the Holy Pearl back then.

175
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,710
I remembered that

176
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,710
my blood worked on you

177

when you went berserk,

178
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,630
so I decided to take a risk.

179
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,390
I didn't expect it to succeed.

I should have slashed my body
a few times

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,190
While in prison,

192
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,920
I didn't have a chance to speak to him.

193
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,510
Now things are all settled.

194
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,950
He should come to me.

195
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,190
Did he go for Chun'er?

196
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,120
Ma Yingxiong committed suicide

197
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,590
in order to keep the secret for us.

198
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,320
What?

199
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,440
I have arranged for an elaborate funeral.

200
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,750
His cenotaph is right in the back mountain.

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,590
If we miss him,

202
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,070
we can visit and pay our respects
at any time.

203
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,150
I shouldn't have brought him here.

204
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,070
I don't deserve to be his princess.

205
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,000
What about Chun'er?

206
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,070
Chun'er...

207
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,360
She was overwhelmed with grief
when she heard the bad news

208
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
and passed out.

209
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,390
Don't worry.

210
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,840
I have asked the imperial doctor
to stay by her side

211
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,960
to diagnose and treat her at any time.

212
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,750
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

213
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,560
Jing Muhan is kneeling outside the chamber,

214
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,510
hoping to have a private chat
with Your Majesty.

215
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,510
Will he try to do anything else to you?

216
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,270
It's okay.

217
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm back to normal now.

218
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
He can't do anything to me.

219
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,150
Just wait here for me.

220
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,750
I will be right back.

221
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,560
Bai Ke.

222
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,870
Leave us alone.

223
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,040
What's done is done.

225
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,320
I have no excuse left.

226
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,390
I have only one request.

227
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,870
If you still regard me
as your younger brother,

228
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,270
I hope you can spare Haitang.

229
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,990
I can promise you

230
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
to spare her life,

231
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,840
but she has to pay

232
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,110
for what she has done.

233
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,960
I trust you.

234
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,870
My brother always keeps his promises.

235
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,270
Who allowed you to die?

236
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,960
Although you repeated the same mistakes

237
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,800
and your crime is unpardonable,

238
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,720
death is the easiest thing.

239
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,390
I want you to stay alive.

240
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,960
Copy the laws of the Beast Clan every day,

241
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,150
and earnestly learn

242
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,870
how to bear the responsibility of a prince.

243
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,200
Aren't you afraid
that I can't change my nature

244
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,350
and do something

245
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,200
that goes against the moral conscience again?

246
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,630
With your current strength,

247
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't think you can make it.

248
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,350
What's more,

249
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,470
you are my younger brother after all.

250
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,470
I didn't know the ins and outs

251
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,230
of what happened in the past.

252
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,750
I used to think that father chose you
to be the King

253
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,040
because he favored you.

254
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,470
It seems that I'm wrong.

255
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,200
In fact, the person

256
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,990
father preferred is me.

257
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
He wanted you to bear

258
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,960
the hardships that all the kings
had to go through,

259
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,630
and gave me

260
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,560
a longer and better life.

261
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,720
Don't you blame him?

262
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm the elder brother.

263
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,200
This is my responsibility.

264
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm supposed to take care of
my younger brother.

265
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,720
And we are the royal family.

266
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,390
We have to take on the responsibility
of protecting the Beast Clan.

267
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,270
Brother.

268
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,800
It's my fault.

269
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,680
We are here today

270
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,800
to pray for the spirit of Ma Yingxiong.

271
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,840
I hope you can forget the pain soon,

272
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,990
and live well with his aspirations in mind.

273
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,270
Write down everything

274
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,720
you want to say to him.

275
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,200
He will hear it.

276
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,680
Yingxiong.

277
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,800
You really became a hero.

278
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,600
You will always be our hero

279
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,680
and my fool.

280
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,200
Alright.

281
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,600
Light the lanterns.

282
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,720
I grew up in the army

283
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,720
and lived a rough life.

284
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,680
I like to eat white steamed buns
with pickles.

285
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,150
I won't eat this steamed bun.

286
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm going to dry it out.

287
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,840
I'll look at it

288
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,390
whenever I think about you.

289
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,440
You fool.

290
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,200
I would like to be your hero,

291
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,040
and I would also like to be your fool.

292
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,320
Where is Her Grace?

293
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,630
Where is she?

294
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
You Grace, I am here.

295
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,750
Don't be afraid of them.

296
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,440
Your Grace, revenge complete.

297
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,750
Hard work for you.

298
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,470
Ma Yingxiong.

299
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,080
I am from Daxia.

300
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,870
Of course I have to abide
by Daxia's rules.

301
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,680
- Just call him...
- Never mind.

302
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,960
Prince Consort.

303
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,800
Okay, Prince Consort.

304
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,150
General Ma.

305
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,150
Hope you are all well in heaven.

306
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,560
Don't worry, General Ma.

307
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
I will take good care of Chun'er for you.

308
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,990
I will accompany her out of the sadness.

309
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,680
General Ma.

310
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,470
Rest in peace.

311
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,560
Ma Yingxiong.

312
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,200
Thank you for everything

313
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,630
you did for us and Beast Clan.

314
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,870
May under your protection,

315
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,840
the people of Daxia and Beast Clan

316
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,470
can be happy and healthy.

317
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,270
Haitang.

318
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,560
Do you think I can atone for my sins?

319
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,990
As long as we sincerely repent,

320
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,750
I believe we can.

321
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,920
After tonight,

322
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,230
I will follow His Majesty's order

323
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,230
and go to jail to serve my sentence.

324
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,870
I'll go with you.

325
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,990
I promised my brother that

326
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,390
I would truly take responsibility
for protecting the Beast Clan.

327
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,960
Only when I am cleansed of my sins

328
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,470
am I qualified to do so.

329
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
[Yaohua Palace]

330
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,230
The story between you and His Majesty
is so sweet.

331
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,150
His Majesty even pretended
to be Mr. Li to date you.

332
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,110
So why doesn't His Majesty

333
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,270
wear his cape and hood anymore?

334
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,510
Why does the whole palace
have a three-day holiday?

335
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,040
Is there any happy event?

336
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,960
You have so many questions.

337
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,320
This is a secret of the royal family

338
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,200
and should be kept secret.

339
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,960
By the way,

340
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,630
what's your plan for today?

341
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,560
Ask Liu Jun out.

342
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,470
After all, it is difficult for a man
to chase a woman,

343
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,600
but it is very simple for a woman
to chase a man.

344
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,040
I've been trying hard.

345
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,990
It's different now.

346
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,870
After all, the world is stable and peaceful.

347
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Why doesn't Liu Jun

348
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,750
agree to you?

349
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,840
Ask him out tonight.

350
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,600
Just tell him that...

351
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,750
I'm embarrassed to do so.

352
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,270
It's just short of the final step.

353
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,800
Liu Jun is very popular.

354
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,800
I will give it a try.

355
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,870
I believe in you.

356
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,750
Your Highness, Liu Jun asked to see.

357
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,390
Please come in.

358
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,470
Hongxiu.

359
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,040
I have something to tell you.

360
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,270
What?

361
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,920
It's up to you tonight.

362
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,110
Go for it. Don't let me down.

363
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,560
Well.

364
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,040
Hongxiu

365
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,720
also has something to tell you.

366
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,720
I will leave you alone.

367
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,720
I am going for Kui Mulang.

368
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,750
Hongxiu.

369
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,800
Do you have anything to tell me?

370
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,960
You go first.

371
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,440
Today I am on holiday.

372
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,350
I wonder if you have time.

373
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,390
Yes.

374
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,270
I do. Let's go together.

375
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,750
Okay.

376
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,920
See you later.

377
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,510
Hu Die.

378
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,510
Hu Die.

379
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,870
The whole palace is on holiday.

380
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,990
Why don't you go out?

381
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,200
What's the point of going out alone?

382
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
Then go out with me.

383
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,440
Why should I go out with you?

384
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,110
Hu Die.

385
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,870
Yes or no?

386
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,110
Just let me know.

387
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,560
What do you mean?

388
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,470
Be my girlfriend.

389
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,750
Yes or no?

390
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,510
If you say no,

391
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,680
I won't bother you again.

392
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,320
You!

393
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,470
You always have an ambiguous attitude,

394
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,720
which makes me unable to eat or sleep.

395
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,680
Look.

396
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,350
Why are you laughing at me?

397
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
What do you mean?

398
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,110
What do you think?

399
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,870
I have no idea.

400
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,230
Your mind is the hardest to guess.

401
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,080
You!

402
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,320
Look at how Her Highness treats His Majesty.

403
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,750
Whether she likes him or not,

404
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,230
she never hides her feelings.

405
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:48,800
You!

406
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
It's obvious to all.

407
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,720
All the lovers are together.

408
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,270
What about me?

409
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
I...

410
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,150
I am still guessing your mind.

411
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,150
Then go for Her Highness.

412
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,870
Stop guessing my mind.

413
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,080
Now!

414
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,470
Go back where you came from.

415
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
I get annoyed when I see you.

416
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,270
Why are you angry again?

417
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,840
I...

418
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,350
Do I have to

419
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,440
make myself clear?

420
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,040
Of course you do.

421
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,750
Or I won't know.

422
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,200
Well...

423
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,110
That's a yes.

424
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,680
No.

425
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,630
Wait.

426
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,320
It's a yes.

427
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,750
Miss Hongxiu.

428
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,840
Mr. Liu Jun.

429
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,680
I'm sorry I'm late.

430
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,870
No.

431
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,270
I was early.

432
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,040
No worries.

433
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,800
I went to buy you candy.

434
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,960
I didn't expect

435
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,080
such a long queue on the streets today
because of the holiday.

436
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,200
So I was late.

437
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,510
Why did you buy me candy?

438
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,720
Mr. Liu Jun.

439
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,470
In fact, there is something

440
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,440
I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

441
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,040
I have long

442
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,320
been silently watching you.

443
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,110
But I'm just a maid.

444
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,110
There is very little I can do for you.

445
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,680
After much deliberation,

446
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,680
I felt that I could only buy you

447
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,470
all the sweetest and delicacies
of the Beast Clan.

448
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,440
I hope you will be happier

449
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,800
and smile more

450
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,510
after you eat them.

451
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,440
Hongxiu.

452
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,630
Mr. Liu Jun.

453
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,840
Actually, when we made wishes

454
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,350
under the sky lanterns last night,

455
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,990
I not only prayed for Chun'er
and General Ma,

456
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,800
but also secretly

457
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,560
made a wish for myself selfishly.

458
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,390
I hope that

459
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,960
the person I love can no longer escape

460
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,990
or restrain himself.

461
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,560
Mr. Liu Jun.

462
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,840
I like you.

463
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,840
Hongxiu.

464
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,040
I like you, too.

465
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,080
It started a long time ago.

466
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,710
You've always been there for me.

467
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,550
Your bravery puts me to shame.

468
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,750
After going through this,

469
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,360
I realized that

470
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,310
instead of being overcautious and indecisive,

471
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,550
it is better to cherish the person
in front of me.

472
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,230
You are wearing these gloves.

473
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,920
But...

474
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,160
Mr. Liu Jun.

475
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,230
As long as you like me the same,

476
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,640
there's nothing

477
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,310

[Yaohua Palace]

488
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,400
Watch your steps.

489
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,080
Here.

490
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,470
Qi Pa.

491
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
What are you going to show me?

492
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,880
You'll know it soon.

493
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,750
Let's go.

494
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,030
So mysterious.

495
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,990
Alright.

496
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,840
Open your eyes now.

497
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,640
How is it?

498
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,360
Does it look good?

499
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,920
The style of these clothes

500
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,790
is a bit special.

501
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,310
Let's put it on.

502
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
You...

503
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I am afraid

504
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,710
I will lose my dignity in it.

505
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,640
A man dolls himself up for his lover.

506
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,550
Won't you wear it

507
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,640
for me?

508
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,710
This is a haute couture couple outfit

509
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,510
designed by me personally

510
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,360
and rushed out by the tailors.

511
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,360
What outfit?

512
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,880
It means that we are in love

513
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,470
and wear the same color
and style of clothes,

514
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,790
so that others know

515
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,310
we are a couple.

516
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
I will put it on

517
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,360
and show others that we are a couple.

518
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,640
Look.

519
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,160
The flower is me.

520
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,160
And the wolf is you.

521
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,470
It means...

522
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,640
We are bound together.

523
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,640
You are clever,

524
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,510
indeed!

525
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,310
You are so considerate.

526
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,310
But even if the flower is not on the clothes,

527
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,270
you are always in my heart.

528
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,710
What a

529
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,160
sweet talker.

530
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,120
So this is called a cute puppy in the eye
of the beholder.

531
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,710
What puppy? I am a wolf.

532
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,120
Okay.

533
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
You are a Cute wolf.

534
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,120
I am just a wolf.

535
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,640
Why do you think I am cute?

536
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,160
You can only be cute in front of me.

537
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,510
Thank you.

538
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,230
But I'm still not used to

539
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,080
seeing you like this at night.

540
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,200
It feels a little strange.

541
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,310
Strange?

542
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,030
Where?

543
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,270
Adorably strange.

544
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,640
You have to bear with it.

545
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,440
After all, I will always

546
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,030
be so handsome.

547
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,310
You were handsome before.

548
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,310
Luckily I had kissed that face before.

549
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,750
Otherwise it would be a big loss.

550
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,550
You really want to
take advantage of anything.

551
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,550
I only take advantage of you.

552
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,950
Who wouldn't want a good deal

553
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,750
of buying one and getting one free?

554
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:41,920
By the way,

555
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,200
you still owe me a word, right?

556
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,790
What?

557
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,360
Stop pretending.

558
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,550
Say it now.

559
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,710
All women love it.

560
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,840
I...

561
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,640
Listen carefully.

562
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,840
Qi Pa.

563
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,680
The only thing I want

564
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,950
in my life

565
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,270
is you.

566
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,680
I love you.

567
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,030
Are you satisfied?

568
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,710
Okay.

569
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,230
I saw the surprise you prepared.

570
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,230
I also have a surprise for you.

571
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,310
You do?

572
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,600
Let's go.

573
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,840
Let's go up the mountain
to watch the stars.

574
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,270
Hold on.

575
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,680
We should have something more important to do

576
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,120
before that.

577
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,990
Is there anything more important?

578
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,710
When we were in the cave before,

579
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,270
we had a wedding ceremony.

580
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,510
Shall we have

581
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,600
our wedding night now?

582
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,400
I've been waiting for this moment
for a long time.

583
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,470
I will never let you go today.

584
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,510
Ever since you came to me,

585
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
you have seduced me several times.

586
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,990
What?

587
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,990
Do you think I'll keep calm all the time?

588
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,360
I will show you tonight.

589
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,240
[One year later]

590
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,550
Kui Mulang left it behind.

591
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,790
Liu Jun left it behind.

592
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,310
Even the elders left it behind.

593
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,790
Why did they leave me with this mess?

594
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,600
Calm down.

595
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,270
Your Royal Highness.

596
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,990
I am coming again.

597
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,310
There are more?

598
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,880
It's all Qi Pa's fault.

599
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,640
She said that Daxia's people

600
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,710
would go on a honeymoon.

601
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,790
Kui Mulang went on a honeymoon.

602
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,470
Liu Jun went on a honeymoon.

603
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,470
Even Bai Ke went on a honeymoon.

604
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,920
Alright.

605
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,880
Easy.

606
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,950
When they come back,

607
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,310
let's go on a honeymoon.

608
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,600
Okay.

609
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,990
Not only a honeymoon,

610
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,360
but also a honey-year.

611
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,680
You two are so sweet.

612
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,640
Why don't you just

613
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,990
leave us alone?

614
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:53,990
Yes.

615
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,750
The princess cried very sadly,

616
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,030
staring blankly at

617
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,710
the tall and mighty man in front of her.

618
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,080
The book is not well written.

619
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,120
The princess

620
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,710
depends on men for everything,

621
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,950
and has no charm at all.

622
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,270
Dear.

623
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,950
You've improved.

624
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,600
It's all because of you.

625
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,710
The book is not good enough.

626
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,600
I will change it for you.

627
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,710
Auntie, uncle.

628
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,270
Xingping is coming.

629
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,710
Xingping, come here.

630
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,550
He came to see you from such a distance.

631
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,080
He must like you very much.

632
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,030
I

633
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,680
also like him very much.

634
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,440
Before, I was just pretending.

635
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
I knew it.

636
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,400
What are you two whispering?

637
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,920
It is a secret

638
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,880
between girls.

639
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,920
Your Grace, Prince Consort.

640
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,790
His and Her Majesty

641
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,310
have been holding two babies all day long,

642
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,600
refusing to let us help.

643
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,160
Her Majesty also asked

644
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,550
if she could stay with them a little longer.

645
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,880
That would be great.

646
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,160
We just want to ask Aunt Lyu

647
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,360
to take care of Xiao Zongzi
and Xiao Yuebin.

648
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,550
My Lady.

649
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,310
Let's go back and play
with the younger siblings.

650
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:44,920
Okay.

651
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,840
I knew you'd like to be alone.

652
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:53,920
Let's go.

653
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,440
Go.

654
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,440
Go.

655
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,270
Goodbye.

656
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,120
Xingping knows a lot.

657
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,840
I think she's right.

658
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,230
Prince Consort.

659
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,310
Aren't you supposed to

660
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,120
give me a honeymoon?

661
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:21,840
It's all up to you.

662
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,640
Let's go then.

663
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,360
My parents were overjoyed
when they heard that

664
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,440
I had found my Mr. Right.

665
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,750
They invited us

666
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,310
to exchange the latest Daxia culture

667
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,920
with the local people,

668
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,880
and then go back to Beast Clan
to have a look together.

669
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,710
Alright, just stop here.

670
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,790
What's wrong?

671
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,990
I have no problem with my suit.

672
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,440
But yours

673
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,710
is way too skimpy.

674
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,200
The people over there

675
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,750
are all dressed like this.

676
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,230
Alright.

677
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,600
Let's go.

678
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,510
Don't miss the ship.

679
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
Visa, tickets.

680
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,400
My dear.

681
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,160
Europa.

682
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,750
We are coming!

683
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,360
