Just send some men to arrest him.

20
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,440
Yes.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,550
Don't worry, Father.

Jing Muhan looks so proud.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,630
Perhaps he thinks that

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
he can always be the king.

38
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,630

I don't understand one thing.

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,190
Why don't you use

43
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,880
the Soul-driving Pill directly
on Jing Muhan?

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,390
Wouldn't it be more worry-free

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,550
to let him take orders from you?

46
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,000
Jing Muhan and Kui Mulang

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,830

112
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,640
She should be looking for you
and Her Grace.

113
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,830
She looked like

121
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,720
because he happened to be out of the palace.

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,480
We should hurry up

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
and find a way to get them all out.

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,270

125
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,790

and Qi Pa back to Daxia first.

133
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,070
No.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
Send Her Grace back to Daxia to recuperate.

135
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,880
I can't leave yet.

136
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,640

and go back by myself.

141
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,390
And you don't even have a helper.

142
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,510
If I stay and help you,

143
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,760
it will be extra favor.

144

Thank you then.

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,350
Don't say that.

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,510
How about I go back to Daxia

147
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,720
and bring my men here?

148
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,950
There is strength in numbers.

149
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,320
No way.

150
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,070
On the one hand,

151
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,720
the less people know

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
the secret of the enchantment,
the better,

153
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,040
to avoid danger in the future.

154
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,270
On the second hand,

Even though there are
enormous dangers and difficulties ahead,

160
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,470
I will never take a step back.

161
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,960
Otherwise,

162
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,350
I will kill myself.

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,910
Never mind.

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,470
Prince Consort.

166
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,110
Didn't you just tell Her Grace

167
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,590
that you are fine?

168
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,280
Su He's poison is so insidious

169
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
that it will inevitably damage the body.

170
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
I said so just to reassure Qi Pa.

171
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,350
Let's do this.

172
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll sneak into the palace first

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,710
to check what's going on there.

174
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,400
If we can figure out

175
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,030
what kind of medicine they are using,

176
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,640
maybe

177
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,760
we can turn the tide.

178
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,640
Now we have no other choice.

179
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,030
And I have to see Chun'er

180
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,000
to reassure myself.

181
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
You have to pretend

182
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,640
to be drugged by them too.

183
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,400
Never expose yourself.

184
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Here comes my test.

185
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,350
Be careful.

186
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,030
Come back immediately
after ascertaining the information.

187
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,110
Don't act rashly.

188
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,760
We will meet at this place

189
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,150
tomorrow.

190
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,150
Okay.

191
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,200
Deal.

192
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,000
See you tomorrow.

193
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,880
General Ma.

194
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,320
Are you feeling better?

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,920
Did Su He

196
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,750
take away the Holy Pearl?

197
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,190
It's all my fault.

198
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,320
All my fault. All my fault.

199
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,510
You fool.

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not your fault,

201
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,240
but mine.

202
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,190
I took Su He so lightly.

203
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,750
No.

204
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,560
It was me who lost my temper

205
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,800
with you at a critical moment.

206
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
I should have kissed you earlier.

207
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,270
And Su He wouldn't have had any chance.

208
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,830
Well...

209
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,150
You can kiss me now.

210
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Why are you still in the mood

211
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,680
of making fun of me?

212
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,270
Don't worry.

213
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,680
With me here,

214
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,000
everything will be solved.

215
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Where is Ma Yingxiong?

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,880
He has gone to the palace.

217
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,190
Can he make it alone?

218
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,800
I told General Ma

219
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
not to act rashly

220
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,880
after arriving in the palace,

221
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,040
and to come back immediately
after checking the news.

222
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,510
He will definitely follow the plan.

223
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,590
That's all we can do now.

224
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,440
Qi Pa.

225
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,710
Come with me.

226
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,360
Chun'er.

227
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,190
I hope you are all well.

228
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,750
This is where you took me

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
on my birthday.

230
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Yes.

231
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,950
It's relatively hidden.

232
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
We won't be found

233
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,190
for now.

234
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,830
Do you remember what it's called?

235
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,150
Yes.

236
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,320
It's Kui Mulang Star.

237
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,070
Your Constellation.

238
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,800
You also told me

239
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,830
it belongs to me.

240
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,880
Kui Mulang Star.

241
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,950
I hope you will bless us

242
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,510
through this difficult time.

243
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,270
Qi Pa.

244
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Promise me one thing, okay?

245
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,040
What?

246
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,440
Look at the constellation.

247
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,510
Remember what it looks like.

248
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,440
Then no matter where you are in the future,

249
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,240
you can see it with your head up at night.

250
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,880
as if

251
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,950
I will always be by your side.

252
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,440
Are you

253
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,270
not feeling well?

254
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,480
You sucked out the poison for me just now,

255
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
did the poison come back to you?

256
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,630
It has nothing to do with that.

257
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,920
Then

258
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,390
why you said all those things?

259
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,630
You have been poisoned by Su He.

260
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,630
How long can you live?

261
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,560
Qi Pa.

262
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,920
How long?

263
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,240
Don't think that much.

264
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,510
Silly girl.

265
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,710
Don't worry about me.

266
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,920
Let's have

267
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,750
another wedding ceremony.

268
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,120
Qi Pa.

269
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,950
You know

270
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,440
I am dying.

271
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,750
I hope you can forget about me

272
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,320
and choose a better man.

273
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,680
What are you talking about?

274
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,510
No more nonsense.

275
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,070
I hope you will

276
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,680
be happy all the time.

277
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
I don't have to

278
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,150
get married.

279
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
But as long as my heart has chosen someone,

280
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
it will never change.

281
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,270
You are the one

282
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,390
in my life.

283
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,590
Kui Mulang.

284
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't need

285
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,040
any extravagant and grand wedding.

286
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,320
As long as we love each other,

287
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,510
that's enough for me.

288
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,710
Okay.

289
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,800
The heaven and the earth are our witnesses,

290
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,320
and Kui Star is the matchmaker.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,590
Okay.

292
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,880
In the presence of Kui Star.

293
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,320
I, Kui Mulang,

294
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,230
take Qi Pa to be my wife,

295
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,470
to have and to hold from this day forward,

296
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,630
for everything that may happen to us,

297
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,320
until death do us part,

298
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,920
and never to fail each other.

299
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,390
In the presence of Kui Star.

300
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,320
I, Qi Pa,

301
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,350
take Kui Mulang to be my husband.

302
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,440
to have and to hold from this day forward,

303
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,350
for everything that may happen to us,

304
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,560

♪And everything is you♪

318
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,390
Don't worry.

319
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,990
I have my way to deal with it.

320
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,720
What's it?

321
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,080
It will be a full moon tomorrow night.

322
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,230
I'm going to lose my mind because of it.

323
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,390
But my strength will also increase accordingly.

324
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,960
I can take this opportunity

325
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,150
to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop.

326
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,350
I have made an appointment with Ma Yingxiong

327
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,230
to meet here tomorrow.

328
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,630
We will send you back to Daxia first.

329
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,470
I'm not going back.

330
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,920
And the plan is too risky.

331
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,720
- I'm worried that...
- Qi Pa.

332
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,750
Listen to me.

333
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,470
If you stay here,

334
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,750
you are bound to become

335
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,630
a hindrance to Ma Yingxiong and me.

336
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,560
I can only give it a go

337
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,270
if I'm sure you're safe.

338
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,870
Never mind.

339
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,600
Trust me.

340
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,600
Put him in the prison

341
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,560
and inform the master.

342
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,470
Yes.

343
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,230
Stop.

344
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,230
Tell me.

345
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,960
Where are Qi Pa and Kui Mulang?

346
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,230
You vicious woman.

347
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,800
Go ahead.

348
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,390
You are really tough.

349
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,840
Chun'er!

350
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,200
Yingxiong!

351
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,680
Chun'er!

352
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,440
Chun'er!

353
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,350
Let her go!

354
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,600
Just come for me.

355
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,510
Yingxiong.

356
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,270
As long as you tell everything,

357
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,870
Miss Su will let us go.

358
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,920
Didn't you go to the forest

359
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,750
to pick mushrooms for me?

360
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,640
What happened later?

361
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,480
I almost forgot that

362
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,880
even you are under their control.

363
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,600
Su He.

364
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,760
You femme fatale.

365
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,480
No wonder Prince Consort doesn't like you.

366
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,030
You are far worse off

367
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
than Her Grace.

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,550
You jerk!

369
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,790
Chun'er!

370
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Don't hurt her!

371
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,150
Stop!

372
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,190
Okay.

373
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Then tell me

374
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,430
where Kui Mulang is.

375
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,510
Won't you say that?

376
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,790
Chun'er!

377
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,150
Stop!

378
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
Don't hurt her!

379
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,510
If you don't tell me now,

380
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
Chun'er will die.

381
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,550
Even if you don't say it,

382
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,790
I can find them.

383
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,720
Chun'er.

384
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,360
Today is the fifteenth day.

385
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,150
It's a good day.

386
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,190
I wanted to

387
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,510
ask Her Grace

388
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,000
for the hand of you today.

389
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,430
I was so afraid that

390
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,910
Her Grace would say no.

391
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,430
You are so good.

392
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,760
I don't deserve you.

393
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,360
I have been incompetent since I was a child,

394
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,720
and I have not been able to be your hero now.

395
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,840
All I can do is

396
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,240
kill myself

397
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,310
to apologize.

398
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,880
Master.

399
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,880
Miss Su has already set off

400
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,360
for the border forest with her men.

401
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,190
He must be

402
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,880
determined to catch them.

403
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,310
Xiniang.

404
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,960
Once He finds the whereabouts of Kui Mulang,

405
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,600
a brimstone bomb would be used as a signal.

406
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,760
Remember to

407
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,550
do her a favor.

408
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,240
Yes.

409
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,720
Kui Mulang.

410
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,760
Kui Mulang.

411
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,960
You two agreed to

412
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,270
meet here, right?

413
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,000
Yes.

414
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,190
What about the time?

415
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,880
Is it right?

416
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Don't worry.

417
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,480
Trust him.

418
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,510
Ma Yingxiong has no sense of direction.

419
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,270
Did he get lost?

420
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,360
No!

421
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,000
What happened?

422
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,760
Did anything happen to him?

423
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,080
We can't wait any longer.

424
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,390
Hu Die, left.

425
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,880
Bai Ke, right.

426
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,480
Liu Jun and I, middle.

427
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,960
Use brimstone bombs as a signal.

428
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,430
Be sure to catch Kui Mulang and Qi Pa

429
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,000
before today ends.

430
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes.

431
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,760
We haven't met Ma Yingxiong yet.

432
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,000
Qi Pa.

433
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,510
They are heading here.

434
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,790
We have to go.

435
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,190
Kui Mulang.

436
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,150
I'm fine.

437
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,190
Qi Pa.

438
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,550
Don't worry.

439
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,390
After I solve all this,

440
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,600
I will definitely go to Daxia for you.

441
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,550
But what will you do

442
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,000
after I leave?

443
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,000
What about Ma Yingxiong?

444
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,790
What about the people of Beast Clan?

445
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,720
How could I let you face

446
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,120
these dangers alone?

447
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,510
Qi Pa.

448
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,960
You can't change anything even
if you don't leave.

449
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,480
We are running out of time.

450
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,120
Leave now.

451
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,790
Kui Mulang.

452
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,790
We agreed to

453
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,670
be together through life.

454
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,960
No matter what happens,

455
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,840
we will face it together.

456
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,190
Right?

457
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,960
Qi Pa.

458
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,550
Don't let me go.

459
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,840
Qi Pa.

460
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,960
Leave.

461
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,430
What happens to you?

462
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,480
Find a place to hide yourself.

463
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,240
Hurry up.

464
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,790
Kui Mulang, are you okay?

465
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,360
- Leave!
- Kui Mulang!

466
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,080
Leave!

467
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,640
Kui Mulang!

468
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,910
Leave!

469
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,150
Kui Mulang, are you okay?

470
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,190
I'm not leaving.

471
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,510
I'm not leaving.

472
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,430
Don't hurt yourself.

473
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,510
Liu Jun.

474
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,790
Release the brimstone bomb.

475
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,270
Inform Hu Die and Bai Ke.

476
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,670
Kui Mulang.

477
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,080
Kui Mulang.

478
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,390
Qi Pa.

479
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,080
Kui Mulang.

480
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,480
Take him down.

481
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,840
My father sent you here?

482
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,670
Yes.

483
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,790
The master knew that

484
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,880
you would need a favor,

485
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,960
so he asked me to bring Freezing Chain
from the Forbidden Area

486
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,760
to help.

487
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,880
My Lady.

488
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,840
The master said that this woman
can restrain Kui Mulang.

489
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,640
We have to keep her alive.

490
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,910
Bring Qi Pa and Kui Mulang
back to the palace.

491
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

492
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,310
Your Royal Highness.

493
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,670
We made it.

494
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
What do you mean?

495
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,360
Kui Mulang was captured.

496
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,720
Not only that,

497
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,310
Su Daqiang also arranged for Kui Mulang

498
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,510
to be paraded through the streets.

499
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Everyone thought he was a monster

500
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,190
who killed the real king.

501
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,510
The elders have announced

502
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,600
your succession to the throne.

503
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,270
Great.

504
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,550
Good.

505
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,600
Last night
was the night of the full moon.

506
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,310
But they took advantage of it.

507
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,640
Kui Mulang.

508
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,430
You woke up.

509
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,720
Qi Pa.

510
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,510
Kui Mulang.

511
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,910
I am sorry for that.

512
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,030
Last night,

513
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,910
- I...
- I'm fine.

514
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,670
You're going to die yourself,

515
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
and you're still worried about Qi Pa.

516
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,550
What did she do to seduce you?

517
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,150
I died for you once.

518
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,150
Why can't I become the Queen

519
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,720
and get your love?

520
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,120
If you promise to marry me,

521
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,510
I will give you the Holy Pearl.

522
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,640
How is it?

523
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,910
Make a decision.

524
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,360
Kui Mulang.

525
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,030
Kui Mulang.

526
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,390
It's okay.

527
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,310
I will never give up Qi Pa

528
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,910
for you.

529
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,600
From the day
I fell in love with Qi Pa,

530
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,270
I never thought of giving up

531
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,360
and changing my mind.

532
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,270
No matter the past,

533
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,950
present

534
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,840
or future,

535
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,470
I, Kui Mulang, only love Qi Pa.

536
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,120
Kui Mulang.

537
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,600
Did you even forget yourself as a king

538
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,640
for this woman?

539
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,200
Then die together.

540
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,360
Wait.

541
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,600
You have asked about Kui Mulang's choice,

542
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,950
but you haven't asked mine.

543
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Qi Pa.

544
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,710
Although I love Kui Mulang,

545
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,440
I don't want to die.

546
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,270
Okay.

547
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,270
You don't want to die?

548
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,470
Yes.

549
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,600
No matter how deep my love is,

550
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,230
I can't sacrifice my life

551
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,880
for one person in vain.

552
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,550
I don't think it

553
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,920
worth it.

554
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,640
Why do you think I will believe you?

555
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,750
I can attest that

556
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,950
I am not lying with my actions.

557
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,470
I can kill Kui Mulang

558
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,790
right now.

559
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:07,990
I, Qi Pa, take Kui Mulang to be my husband.

560
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,310
to have and to hold from this day forward...

561
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,990
until death do us part

562
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,510
Kui Mulang.

563
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,750
Did you hear that?

564
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,840
This is the woman

565
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,400
you are willing to sacrifice everything
to protect.

566
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,310
Good.

567
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,680
I will give you a chance,

568
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,750
but not now.

569
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,030
Tomorrow is the day of execution.

570
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,790
I want you to cut Kui Mulang into pieces

571
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,360
in front of everyone.

572
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,920
Okay, I promise you.

573
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,710
As long as you can spare my life,

574
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,030
I promise you anything.

575
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,710
Kui Mulang.

576
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,600
Don't you regret it yet?

577
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,640
Su He.

578
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,310
I don't want to stay here any longer.

579
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,270
Since I agreed to your condition,

580
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,750
can I go back to the chamber?

581
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,550
Guard.

582
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,510
Take Qi Pa to her chamber.

583
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,360
Yes.

584
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,320
♪I'm the liar♪

585
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,640
♪Should be forgotten♪

586
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,320
♪Be wallowing in memories

587
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,280
♪Let me taste alone♪

588
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,360
♪The time without you♪

♪I don't deserve it♪

590
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:47,880
♪I don't deserve to be forgiven♪

591
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,400
No wonder Kui Mulang

592
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,030
stayed in the chamber so mysteriously
every day.

593
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,790
It turns out there is a secret room here.

594
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,920
Your Royal Highness.

595
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,160
The spring seems to be drying up.

596
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,510
This...

597
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,990
It seems to be connected
to the water source of the entire clan.

598
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,230
The spring is almost dry.

599
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,030
Does it mean that there is a problem

600
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,680
with the Beast Clan's water source?

601
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:39,950
No way.

602
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,920
I have to ask Kui Mulang about this.

603
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,120
My mighty brother, I never imagined that

604
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,230
I would meet you in the prison.

605
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,920
How is it?

606
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,550
It doesn't feel good to be a prisoner,
does it?

607
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,160
Think about the five years
you held me captive.

608
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,080
Now you also know how it feels.

609
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I have imprisoned you for five years.

610
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,950
Why didn't you make any progress

611
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,310
but even act evilly in collusion with him?

612
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,230
Why are you still so stubborn?

613
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,680
Kui Mulang.

614
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,200
You are going to die.

615
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,080
By then, the entire Beast Clan will be mine.

616
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,510
I will be the King.

617
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,640
Aren't you angry?

618
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,470
Aren't you jealous?

619
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,640
Since you want to be the King so much,

620
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,880
I will give you the chance

621
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,270
for you to feel

622
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,710
what it's like to be a King.

623
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,030
What do you mean?

624
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,710
I was thinking about

625
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,750
how to meet you.

626
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,920
It's good that

627
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,640
you came to me yourself.

628
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,710
Never try to play tricks.

629
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,030
Tell me.

630
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,680
What's the deal with the secret room
in your chamber?

631
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,550
And why is that spring

632
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,160
almost dry?

633
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,680
How many things are you hiding from me?

634
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,040

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,160
