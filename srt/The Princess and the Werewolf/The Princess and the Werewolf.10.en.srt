00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,400
I...

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,590
Your Grace.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,230
Where are you going?

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,400
I...

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,590
Are you trying to escape again?

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
His Majesty said that

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,510
you cannot leave the palace.

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,680
What? Are you unhappy?

26
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,440
Mr. Liu Jun may have someone he likes.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,600
Really?

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,160
Who's that?

29
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,000
You?

30
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,800
Your Grace.

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,550
I'm so sad.

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,720
Why are you still kidding me?

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,080
Alright.

34
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,110
Cheer up.

35
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,960
Liu Jun stays by Kui Mulang's side

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,440
all day long.

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,440
How can he have time to fall in love?

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,910
Mr. Liu.

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,320
Are you looking for me?

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,440
Your Grace.

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,550
I am looking for Ms. Hongxiu.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,750
Hongxiu?

43
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,910
Mr. Liu Jun.

44
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,000
What's up?

45
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,080
May I borrow you for a minute?

46
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,800
You should go.

48
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,160
I won't escape.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,440
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

50
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,440
It's time for escaping.

51
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,440
It turned out that His Majesty
wants to propose to Her Grace.

52
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,630
I thought that...

53
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,110
What?

54
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,520
Nothing.

55
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,110
When I chatted with Her Grace,

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,440
she said that in her hometown,

57
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,800
there would be a very grand marriage proposal ceremony.

58
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,440
It is best to have candles,

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,360
clusters of flowers,

60
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,520
light gauze

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,750
and white curtains,

62
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,550
and shiny stars.

63
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,440
Mr. Liu Jun.

64
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,440
Thank you so much.

65
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,110
What you said will definitely help His Majesty.

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,790
I feel very happy to be able to help you.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,830
Mr. Liu Jun.

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,040
Her Grace ran away.

69
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,070
His Majesty's wedding is imminent.

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,070
I want your undivided attention

71
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
and no room for error.

72
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,790
Yes.

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,950
Alright.

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
Return to your posts.

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,760
Dissolution!

76
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,670
Yes.

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,440
Hu Die! Hu Die!

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,760
His Majesty will get married in a few days.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
Don't make trouble.

80
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,390
What do you mean?

81
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,790
When did I make trouble?

82
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,920
No, you...

83
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,670
Haven't you

84
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,320
always liked...?

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,160
So I told you in advance,

86
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,670
in case you do

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,160
something that you regret later.

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,950
You!

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't get angry.

90
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,880
Whenever you get angry, you...

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,390
You!

92
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,640
Listen, Hu Die.

93
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,110
I haven't finished yet.

94
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,720
Ma Yingxiong.

95
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,640
Your Grace.

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,920
I finally see you.

97
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm worried that I won't be able to see you.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,160
I didn't expect you to come by yourself.

99
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,350
Good for you.

100
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,270
No more nonsense.

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,480
This time my marriage with him

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,760
is actually a cover,

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,040
and my purpose is to find a chance to go back.

104
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,880
Since you are here, there is hope.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Your Grace, do you have a plan?

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,950
It's our last chance before marriage.

107
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,670
I will find an opportunity to tell Kui Mulang that

108
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,880
you are not having a good time here,

109
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,230
and there is no need to force you
to stay here to watch the wedding.

110
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,760
Then I will ask him

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,920
to send you back before the wedding.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,230
Find some dirty clothes from the inn's woodshed

113
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,270
and put them in the box.

114
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,320
I'll find another chance to hide myself in there.

115
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
And then we can go back together.

116
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,670
Your Grace, you are so wise.

117
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,790
Also,

118
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,270
I have to leave with someone else.

119
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,200
As for who this person is,

120
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,760
you'll know it soon.

121
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,550
General Ma.

122
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,950
Is Her Grace in there?

123
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,600
Your Grace.

124
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,320
Now is the time to show our acting skills.

125
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,830
Ma Yingxiong.

126
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to marry His Majesty soon,

127
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,230
so I may not see my parents
and fellow villagers anymore.

128
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,390
When you go back, tell them for me that

129
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,790
I am very happy here,

130
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,160
and tell them not to think of me.

131
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,720
I will.

132
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,550
Your Grace, stop crying.

133
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,550
Mr. Liu Jun guessed that you were here.

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,880
I know you must be homesick.

135
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,720
Hongxiu understands me best.

136
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,510
Your Grace.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,950
His Majesty wants to see you.

138
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,830
Please.

139
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,320
Was I seen through?

140
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,000
Your Grace.

141
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,440
This...

142
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,790
Your Grace.

143
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,110
Your Grace.

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,510
I'm leaving.

145
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,550
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
General Ma.

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,160
Ms. Chun'er.

148
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,880
I thought you were mad at me for being reckless

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,270
and wouldn't come again.

150
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,040
How come?

151
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm just a maid.

152
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,520
How dare I be angry with you?

153
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm fine.

154
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,710
It's just that I'm a little tired

155
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,470
because I came here twice today.

156
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,470
Hard work for you.

157
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm very grateful.

158
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,840
General.

159
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,790
I really admire you.

160
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,880
Really?

161
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,150
You have many advantages.

162
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,880
I admire your prowess

163
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,880
and loyalty to Her Grace.

164
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,710
Of course.

165
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,760
It is my duty to be loyal to Her Grace.

166
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,030
Her Grace is indeed worth following.

167
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,030
In fact, I have always admired her.

168
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,230
It's normal.

169
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,400
In Daxia,

170
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,910
she is welcomed by everyone.

171
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,000
You are right.

172
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
But...

173
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,910
If I don't tell you something,

174
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
I can't feel at ease.

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
What?

176
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,200
Actually, I know about Her Grace.

177
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,110
I feel sorry for what happened to her.

178
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm also clear that

179
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,550
she doesn't really want to
stay in Beast Clan at all.

180
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,230
You came all the way to Beast Clan,

181
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,550
and finally found Her Grace,

182
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,710
but you couldn't take her away.

183
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,200
I really don't understand
what His Majesty is doing.

184
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,200
So

185
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,760
I want to help you.

186
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,590
Actually...

187
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,470
Actually, Her Grace once saved my life.

188
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,760
I have long wanted to
find an opportunity to repay her.

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
I see.

190
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
You are so kind.

191
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,200
I am flattered.

192
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,670
So,

193
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,350
after careful consideration,

194
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,280
I thought of a way.

195
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,350
What way?

196
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,670
This is the Debilitating Powder
I got from the black market.

197
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,880
I guess

198
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,400
it'll work for you.

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,320
Ms. Chun'er, you...

200
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,440
I think

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,400
you wish to escape with Her Grace.

202
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,550
But His Majesty's so powerful.

203
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,280
He won't let you go easily.

204
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
So,

205
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,670
as long as you use this

206
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,350
on His Majesty,

207
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
it will buy you some more time.

208
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,400
But with this drug,

209
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,230
It's not frank and upright for me.

210
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,670
It's not my style.

211
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,470
Is there anything more important

212
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,150
than saving Her Grace?

213
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Thank you for your kindness.

214
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,080
It's just that

215
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,030
I have my own ethics.

216
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,640
Don't you want to take her away?

217
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,960
I know you are for my own good.

218
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,960
It's just that

219
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,590
I can't decide at the moment.

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,270
Please go back and let me think about it.

221
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,200
[The Imperial Garden]

222
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,830
Stop.

223
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,040
His Majesty has ordered that

224
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,920
no one should approach
the Imperial Garden tonight.

225
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,120
Why?

226
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
What's going on there?

227
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,390
It's not your turn to inquire
about His Majesty's affairs.

228
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
What happened?

229
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,190
No idea. No more asking.

230
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,750
Who's that?

231
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,000
You deliberately broke the rule.

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,390
If the commander finds out,

233
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,510
you will be punished.

234
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,630
Don't you wonder

235
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,920
why His Majesty suddenly
locked the Imperial Garden?

236
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,390
I also heard that

237
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,270
His Majesty himself

238
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,440
has been busy in it for a long time.

239
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,390
Then

240
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,120
Liu Jun and Hongxiu went in

241
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,440
with the queen-to-be.

242
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,040
As a man, why are you curious about this?

243
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Don't you want to know

244
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,750
what will happen to His Majesty
and the queen-to-be?

245
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,710
Hongxiu.

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,630
Are we there yet?

247
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,120
Didn't you say that
Kui Mulang was looking for me?

248
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,590
We're almost there, Your Grace.

249
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,830
Your Grace, watch your steps.

250
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,270
We are almost there.

251
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,120
Your Majesty.

252
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,680
Here comes Her Grace.

253
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,950
Hongxiu.

254
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
If you fall,

255
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,390
I'm not responsible.

256
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,480
I may just take it off.

257
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,040
Hold on.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,750
Not now.

259
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,040
I have a surprise for you.

260
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
Why so mysterious?

261
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,150
Come here.

262
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,270
What are you doing?

263
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,590
What are you doing?

264
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,190
I heard that

265
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,240
this is the favorite courtship etiquette

266
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,880
for girls in Daxia.

267
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,150
Being carried in arms.

268
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
This is...

269
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
Is this

270
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,560
what you call a marriage proposal?

271
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,680
My queen-to-be.

272
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,390
Are you satisfied?

273
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,560
I didn't expect you to propose to me.

274
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,590
I will do my best to meet all your requests,

275
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
except

276
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,440
to let you go.

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Qi Pa.

278
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,440
I know that

279
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,630
from the first day you came to Beast Clan,

280
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,360
you have been full of fear and anxiety.

281
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I don't expect you

282
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,950
to fall in love with me immediately,

283
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,590
but I hope

284
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,950
you can give me a chance.

285
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,320
Let's get to know each other

286
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
officially from scratch.

287
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,360
Here.

288
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,830
I, Kui Mulang, have never knelt down

289
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,870
to anyone except my father.

290
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,080
But I am willing to
respect the etiquette of Daxia.

291
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,080
Qi Pa.

292
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,350
Will you marry me

293
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,750
and be my Queen?

294
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,750
I do.

295
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,040
What did you say?

296
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,920
I said

297
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,040
I do.

298
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,440
Seriously?

299
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,040
Her Grace said yes.

300
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,630
She said yes.

301
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,110
What did Hongxiu just say?

302
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,270
What yes?

303
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,470
You said you don't care about them.

304
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,320
Why are you still asking?

305
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,270
Did you hear it?

306
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,630
I guess that

307
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,270
His Majesty is preparing a surprise

308
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,870
for Her Grace,

309
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,630
and the latter is very happy.

310
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,390
His Majesty locked the Imperial Garden today

311
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,390
and made careful preparations.

312
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,990
Is he secretly courting Her Grace?

313
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,840
Yes.

314
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,680
Hongxiu smiled so happily.

315
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
Her Grace must have agreed.

316
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,600
Exactly.

317
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,150
What did Her Grace agree?

318
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,840
Say it.

319
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,990
Dayu, say it.

320
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,560
Commander, Deputy Commander.

321
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,560
Her Grace agreed to marry His Majesty.

322
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,800
What?

323
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,230
How could His Majesty propose to a woman?

324
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,080
- Hu Die.
- I...

325
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,150
- Hu Die.
- Hu Die, calm down.

326
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,840
Control your emotions.

327
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,990
Or you will fart.

328
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,200
I...

329
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,470
You...

330
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,680
I...

331
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,840
Hu Die.

332
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,230
I...

333
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,470
I didn't expect you to agree.

334
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,230
Maybe everything is meant to be.

335
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,870
Thank you.

336
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,270
Thank you

337
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,040
for saying yes.

338
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,750
In fact, I have seen

339
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,350
your sincerity to me.

340
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I was already very grateful

341
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,600
that you brought Ma Yingxiong here.

342
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm glad you like it.

343
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
But

344
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,040
Ma Yingxiong doesn't seem to be happy.

345
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,080
What do you mean?

346
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,510
Have we

347
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,750
treated him badly?

348
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:30,960
No.

349
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,110
He couldn't find me at first,

350
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,510
and then he was brought into
the Beast Clan inexplicably.

351
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,470
Later, he knew

352
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,600
what Alai

353
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,560
is really like.

354
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,350
A series of blows

355
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,040
made it difficult for him to accept.

356
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,390
Actually, I went to see him secretly today.

357
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,040
I can't bear

358
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,630
to see him in that state.

359
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,510
What are you going to do?

360
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,990
I'm worried

361
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,350
he'll be more irritated

362
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,870
if he stays here to watch our wedding.

363
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,200
How about sending him back to Daxia

364
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,870
before our wedding?

365
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,560
Okay.

366
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,440
No problem.

367
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,630
Just do as you say.

368
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,870
Okay.

369
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,560
I also want to prepare some gifts from Beast Clan

370
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,440
for him to take back.

371
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,230
Sure.

372
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,110
I'll ask

373
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
Hongxiu

374
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
to help you.

375
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,750
Okay.

376
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,270
Hongxiu.

377
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,200
Let's go back.

378
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,920
Coming, Your Grace.

379
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,920
Your Grace.

380
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,150
I am so touched.

381
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,350
His Majesty loves you so much.

382
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,680
Tomorrow I will share the news

383
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,270
with the whole palace.

384
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,870
I will remember this proposal forever.

385
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,840
It's not that you were proposed,

386
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,350
why should you remember?

387
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,040
Because

388
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,150
I witnessed it with Mr. Liu Jun.

389
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,600
I think it's very precious.

390
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,470
I see.

391
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,320
By the way,

392
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,990
Ma Yingxiong is going back soon.

393
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,200
I want to prepare some specialties
for him to take back.

394
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,040
Please prepare them for me.

395
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,270
Don't worry, Your Grace. Leave it to me.

396
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,390
I'm a little tired today.

397
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,110
Go back and rest early.

398
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,990
Have a good rest.

399
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
I will take my leave.

400
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,440
I didn't expect Kui Mulang to do this

401
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,600
to marry me.

402
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,080
Kui Mulang.

403
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,080
I appreciate your kindness.

404
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,870
But I said yes to stabilize you first.

405
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,750
I must ensure that you let go of your guard,

406
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,470
and then try to return to Daxia
as soon as possible.

407
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,510
Li Xiong.

408
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,840
We'll be back soon.

409
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,200
I am so happy for you, Your Majesty.

410
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,870
I didn't expect Qi Pa to agree.

411
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,920
I thought

412
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,870
this was another challenge set by her.

413
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,080
I was even prepared to be rejected.

414
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,270
Your Majesty.

415
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,630
It's great news.

416
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,990
This shows that

417
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,800
Her Grace has accepted you deep down.

418
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,440
But

419
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,800
I still feel a little unreal.

420
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Your Majesty, don't think so.

421
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,720
You have done so much for Her Grace

422
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,720
since announcing your wedding.

423
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,600
Even if she was hesitant before,

424
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,200
she was definitely touched by you tonight.

425
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,440
I hope so.

426
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,240
[Yaohua Palace]

427
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,990
Your Grace.

428
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,750
Li Xiong, here you are.

429
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,920
Yes.

430
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,960
You look so happy today.

431
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Is it because of Kui Mulang's proposal last night?

432
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,200
What are you talking about?

433
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,040
That's...

434
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,230
just a formality,

435
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,200
not real.

436
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,560
What do you mean?

437
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,960
I did this

438
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,440
just to stabilize Kui Mulang.

439
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Also,

440
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,200
tonight is our last chance.

441
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,960
I have asked Ma Yingxiong

442
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,800
to arrange a box with dirty clothes

443
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,150
in the woodshed of the inn.

444
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,470
The capacity of this box

445
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,630
is enough for the two of us.

446
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,720
But to be on the safe side,

447
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,350
we'd better split up.

448
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,200
You should find the opportunity
to pack yourself in.

449
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,390
I will wait for you in the box.

450
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,320
Then we can go back to Daxia together.

451
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,840
Li Xiong.

452
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,840
Li Xiong.

453
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,150
Did you hear me?

454
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,230
Never let others know.

455
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,150
After tonight,

456
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,320
we can go home together.

457
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,230
Your Majesty.

458
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,800
What happened?

459
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,510
Qi Pa wants to escape.

460
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,150
What?

461
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,870
She plans

462
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,350
to hide in a box of woodshed from the inn.

463
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,150
How dare she deceive you like this?

464
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,440
Liu Jun.

465
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,270
Arrange for Hu Die to hide in the box

466
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,320
to deceive Ma Yingxiong,

467
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,110
and then find a chance to run out by herself.

468
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,680
I want to get Qi Pa back

469
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,230
and send Ma Yingxiong back to Daxia.

470
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,920
Yes.

471
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,960
I see.

472
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,040
It would be a big show.

473
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,750
You.

474
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,390
Tell that person their plan.

475
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,870
Yes.

476
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,320
Everything is ready.

477
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,840
Just wait for Her Grace.

478
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,920
Chun'er.

479
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,320
General Ma.

480
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,510
Something's up!

481
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,390
His Majesty proposed to Her Grace last night.

482
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,510
And Her Grace said yes!

483
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,870
No way.

484
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,990
Her Grace made an appointment with me.

485
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,230
She must have been forced.

486
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,320
General Ma.

487
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,040
At this moment,

488
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,680
you can't hesitate anymore.

489
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,680
You have to find a way

490
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,470
to escape from here with Her Grace.

491
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,750
It's just that the strength of His Majesty
cannot be underestimated.

492
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Debilitating Powder

493
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
will help.

494
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,630
You are right.

495
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,750
Kui Mulang is cruel and heartless.

496
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,270
Why should I be aboveboard

497
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,110
when dealing with this kind of person?

498
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,350
That's right.

499
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
By then,

500
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,560
if Kui Mulang wants to hurt you,

501
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,600
you can get rid of him directly

502
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,560
while he is got Debilitating Powder.

503
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,800
It's all for Her Grace.

504
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,990
And...

505
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,560
And if His Majesty doesn't die,

506
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,510
once I'm found out,

507
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,960
I definitely won't have a chance to survive.

508
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,110
Don't cry.

509
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,800
I got it.

510
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,040
There is nothing I can do

511
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,470
to repay your kindness.

512
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,990
Don't worry.

513
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,800
Even if it is brought to light,

514
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,320
I will never expose you.

515
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,990
As long as Her Grace can escape here smoothly,

516
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,600
I will be relieved.

517
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,230
Your Majesty.

518
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,150
Here comes Her Grace.

519
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,150
Come here.

520
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,390
Take a seat.

521
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,960
What's up?

522
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,960
The Imperial Kitchen prepared some specialties

523
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,320
for our wedding reception.

524
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,470
Have a try.

525
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,870
Sit down.

526
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,200
Do you have anything on your mind?

527
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,990
No.

528
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,800
It looks good.

529
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,800
But aren't you going to
bid farewell to Ma Yingxiong?

530
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,200
Did you forget it?

531
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
How could I forget

532
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,150
what I promised you?

533
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,680
I heard you say that you wanted to
prepare something special

534
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,990
for Ma Yingxiong to take back.

535
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,040
I've sent someone to find some.

536
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,270
I'll send them there in a while.

537
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,320
No need.

538
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,200
I've prepared them for him.

539
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,720
It's all thanks to you.

540
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,600
Never mind.

541
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,800
Prepare more

542
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,320
to show your parents and fellow villagers that

543
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,440
you are living a good life here.

544
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Yes.

545
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,870
My parents would be delighted

546
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,800
to know that

547
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,870
I am so favored here.

548
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,750
Qi Pa.

549
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,270
The wolves only marry one person in a lifetime.

550
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,920
After I marry you,

551
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,990
I will treat you wholeheartedly.

552
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,630
Men are all liars.

553
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,200
Yes.

554
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,720
The oath lasts forever.

555
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,350
Your Majesty.

556
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,440
I believe in you.

557
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,320
Here, take a try.

558
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,920
What's wrong?

559
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,320
Your Majesty.

560
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,390
Actually,

561
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,800
I don't have much appetite.

562
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,470
Well.

563
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,470
Brides should not eat too much
before their wedding,

564
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,470
because it will cause them to gain weight
and swell their faces,

565
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,470
making them unattractive.

566
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,470
I see.

567
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,750
In fact, Daxia has another rule,

568
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,470
that is, the bride and groom

569
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,200
should not meet before the wedding.

570
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,470
Really?

571
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,320
Yes.

572
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,110
Otherwise, it will be considered unlucky.

573
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,230
So you better let me go back first.

574
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,680
It was my oversight.

575
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,560
Okay.

576
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,110
I will walk you back.

577
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,800
No need.

578
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,960
I can go back on my own.

579
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,350
You'd better send Ma Yingxiong back right away.

580
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,040
Aren't you going to see him off?

581
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,230
I would like to.

582
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,720
But I'm afraid I'll be sadder

583
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,440
when I see them leave.

584
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,510
Okay.

585
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,600
Your heart is as beautiful as your appearance.

586
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,720
I will send them back safely.

587
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
Say goodbye to them for me.

588
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,920
If there is nothing else,

589
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,920
I am going back.

590
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,320
[Yaohua Palace]

591
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,110
Can this be used as a mask?

592
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,870
Don't touch it.

593
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,470
If it gets dirty, I'm going to get acne.

594
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,680
Go back and rest.

595
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,920
I'm going to take a beauty sleep

596
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,080
so that I can be charming on my wedding day.

597
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,390
This...

598
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,990
Will beauty sleep work during the day?

599
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,990
Of course.

600
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,990
The more you sleep, the better.

601
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,040
Remember what I told you?

602
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,840
Whatever happens,

603
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,990
don't wake you up.

604
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,800
Right.

605
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,080
Don't worry.

606
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,630
Have a beauty sleep

607
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,150
and attend the ceremony tomorrow at your best.

608
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,870
I feel happy even thinking about it.

609
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,390
I wonder

610
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,630
if I will be moved to tears tomorrow.

611
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,750
Hongxiu.

612
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,680
You have taken good care of me

613
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
since I came here.

614
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,040
I also...

615
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,390
regard you as my best friend.

616
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,390
I hope you and Liu Jun

617
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,870
can end up well.

618
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,870
But if he's way too arrogant,

619
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,750
find someone else.

620
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,080
You are so good.

621
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
There are so many men,

622
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,230
and there is no need to be obsessed with him.

623
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,110
Your Grace, what are you talking about?

624
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,720
Nothing.

625
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,600
Thank you anyway.

626
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,080
Your Grace.

627
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,040
Why did you suddenly say this?

628
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,560
Well.

629
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,600
Maybe it's because I feel complicated
before I get married.

630
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,270
Alright.

631
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,560
Come back to rest.

632
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,800
I am going to sleep.

633
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:50,750
Okay.

634
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,320
Take a good rest.

635
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,880
Why did Ma Yingxiong

636
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,360
stuff it with so many smelly socks?

637
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,710
Why hasn't Li Xiong arrived yet?

638
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,800
I'll leave here first.

639
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,120
Ms. Chun'er.

640
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,560
What are you doing?

641
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,510
Captain Hao.

642
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,270
I'm going to throw out some old clothes.

643
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,400
When did the Imperial Kitchen
start managing clothes?

644
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,470
The Imperial Costume Department
is understaffed.

645
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,160
Stewardess Hong asked me

646
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,080
to throw out all these old clothes.

647
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,360
If there is nothing else,

648
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,080
I will get to work.

649
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,080
Wait.

650
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,950
Is this box full of clothes?

651
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,080
Yes.

652
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,710
We'll help you.

653
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
No need.

654
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,160
Ms. Hao.

655
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,230
I can make it myself.

656
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,840
It's nothing.

657
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
No need for that.

658
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,560
I mean it.

659
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,840
I can manage it.

660
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,160
Let's go.

661
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,360
Take a look.

662
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,040
Sir.

663
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,670
Long time no see.

664
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,320
General Ma.

665
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,040
Did you get everything now?

666
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,990
Yes.

667
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,360
Where is your King?

668
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,470
Greetings to Your Majesty.

669
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,670
Greetings to Your Majesty.

670
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,640
It seems that General Ma is leaving
with a lot of good things.

671
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,270
Let's go.

672
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,080
Commander Bai.

673
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,710
What are you doing?

674
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,160
We are helping Chun'er

675
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,990
deliver the used clothes
from the Imperial Costume Department.

676
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,400
Isn't Ms. Chun'er from the Imperial Kitchen?

677
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,600
The Imperial Costume Department
is understaffed.

678
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,910
I am just doing a favor.

679
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,710
It's all for His Majesty's marriage,

680
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,840
so it's okay to share the work.

681
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,560
Right.

682
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,040
This is the fine tradition of Beast Clan.

683
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,560
Do you remember?

684
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,670
Yes!

685
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,840
Ms. Chun'er, good for you.

686
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,560
Haonan, good for you.

687
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,990
Soldiers, good for you.

688
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,360
Let's go.

689
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,230
Let's go.

690
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,560
Ms. Chun'er.

691
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,120
Where do we need to put them?

692
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,840
The forest outside the city.

693
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,840
Okay.

694
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,080
The two of you.

695
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,880
Help Chun'er deliver the garbage
outside of the city.

696
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,800
Yes.

697
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
It's not necessary, Ms. Hao.

698
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,950
It's too much trouble for you.

699
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,800
Not at all.

700
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,120
Go.
