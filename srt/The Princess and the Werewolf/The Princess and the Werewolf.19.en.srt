18

It's such a brilliant idea.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't give it up just like that.

I'm a sinful woman.

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm guilty.

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,880
Your Highness.

29
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,110
Why are you

30
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,630
bringing that up again?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,110
Besides, you and His Majesty are still young.

32
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,000
Boost your constitution

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,270
and you'll be pregnant again.

34
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't want to lie to you, Elders.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,670
I'm actually in poor health.

36
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,110
I don't think that can be improved

37
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,000
in a short period of time.

38
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,390
As the queen,

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
I'm responsible for the heir of His Majesty.

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,670
As King of Beast,

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,720
his harem is empty.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
I can't let that happen.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,520
What do you mean, Your Highness?

44
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,800
Elders.

45
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,720
I have a plan.

46
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,440
I'd like to set up performance class.

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,270
Performance class?

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,030
And we pick the best girls in it

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,440
and make them his concubines.

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,470
But His Majesty is absorbed in state affairs.

51
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,030
He rejected it.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,190
That's why I came here

53
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,630
to discuss this matter with you.

54
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,800
- Well...
- We...

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,880
Your Highness.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,670
We can't help you with this.

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,520
His Majesty can only have one woman
in his life

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,800
since he's a member of the wolf clan.

59
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,470
He doesn't need other women in his harem.

60
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,270
What?

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,800
King of Beast

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,550
is monogamous.

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,190
Yeah, he is.

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,390
That's right.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,240
Then we should treat our marriage with
discretion.

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,960
He should meet enough girls

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,750
before he finds his true love.

68
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,240
Though we're already married,

69
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,600
as time goes by,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
His Majesty may not see me as a good spouse

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
and want a divorce.

72
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,520
About that...

73
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,670
If that happens, the two of us

74
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,470
will live in misery for the rest of our life.

75
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,110
As the saying goes,

76
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,880
you can only rule a country well
when you have a harmonious family.

77
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,670
In that case, will Kui Mulang

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,390
still be able to handle the state affairs

79
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,040
and be a good king?

80
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,760
Besides, it's easy to get married
but hard to get along.

81
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,230
The performance class is not just for fun.

82

It's a touchstone

91

She does have support from the Elders.

94

But such a large-scale event

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,480
will need a big sum of money,

96
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,440
which the Elders will not give her.

97
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,950

Hu Die said she never wanted to see him again.

135

That's why he's wearing a mask

136

You touched a raw nerve.

189
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,790
Next one.

190
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,910
Yes.

191
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
[His Majesty Celebrated Her Highness's Birthday]
His Majesty celebrated your birthday

192
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,200
in a brand new way

193
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,710
to the Beast Clan.

194
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,880
It has become a beautiful story
out of the palace.

195
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,790
People are all following suit.

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,760
It's a trend now.

197
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,440
His Majesty's love for you

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,760
has also...

199
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,440
Stop. That's it.

200
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,470
Not important.

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,230
I've got it.

202
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,000
Your Highness.

203
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
Aren't we trying to get money
for the performance class?

204
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,030
How will the gossip help?

205
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,760
Just follow my lead

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,710
and be a good assistant.

207
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Liu Jun.

208
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,710
Mr. Liu Jun, I was looking for you.

209
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,030
Miss Hongxiu.

210
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,790
Why are you looking for me?

211
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,640
Mr. Liu Jun.

212
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,710
The gloves aren't poisonous, are they?

213
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,280
They're not.

214
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,710
I wear them to insulate toxins.

215
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,760
So...

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,710
Her Highness said that would do.

217
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Could I borrow your gloves?

218
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
No problem.

219
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,760
But what do you need them for?

220
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,200
Not for me, for Her Highness.

221
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,710
Why does Her Highness want them?

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,710
I don't get it.

223
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,670
Neither do I.

224
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,710
But I trust Her Highness.

225
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,550
Please give your gloves only to me.

226
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,320
Is that okay?

227
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Here.

228
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,670
Thank you, Mr. Liu Jun.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,960
I'll be off then.

230
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,150
Commander Bai.

231
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,520
Think about it.

232
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Even Mr. Liu Jun

233
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,470
gave his gloves to Hongxiu?

234
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,440
What's there to worry about?

235
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,710
Please, just give me your mask.

236
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,960
It's an order from Her Highness.

237
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,030
Her Highness?

238
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,910
But Hu Die said she didn't want to see me.

239
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,550
I can't take off this mask.

240
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,790
Deputy Commander Hu Die only said that

241
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,910
because she got angry.

242
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,440
Then you showed up with a mask on.

243
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,790
It's like you did it on purpose to retaliate.

244
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,960
So she got even more upset.

245
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Is that true?

246
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,960
Why didn't she tell me about it?

247
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,320
Her Highness said

248
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,470
Deputy Commander Hu Die says one thing
and means another.

249
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,590
She just enjoys messing with you.

250
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,670
Don't say that.

251
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,230
Hu Die is nice to me.

252
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,760
All right.

253
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,520
I won't speak ill of her.

254
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,960
Anyway, Her Highness has a piece of
advice for you.

255
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,280
If you keep wearing this mask,

256
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,710
you are only pushing her away.

257
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,640
Take off the mask

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,710
and she may find you attractive.

259
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,000
Is that true?

260
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,280
Of course it's true.

261
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,440
Her Highness is never wrong.

262
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,790
Okay.

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,910
Take it.

264
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,200
What happened to your face?

265
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Well, I...

266
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,590
Don't be afraid, Miss Chun'er.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,520
The mask did it.

268
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,960
I'll just go apply some ointment.

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,640
You got your face ruined for love.

270
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,710
I'll write this down.

271
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,710
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,840
Love makes people stupid.

273
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
I also become stupid

274
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,080
for Yingxiong.

275
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,200
Your Highness.

276
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,470
We got everything

277
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,400
you asked us for.

278
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,960
What's next?

279
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,640
Now

280
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,640
you have 30 minutes to do one thing.

281
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,520
[Script]

282
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,400
I want you

283
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,670
to learn these lines on it by heart.

284
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,960
I'll check later.

285
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,910
Word by word.

286
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,880
Make sure you memorize them.

287
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes.

288
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,590
Come on, you can do it.

289
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
I'll check later.

290
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Let's memorize together

291
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,000
and recite to each other.

292
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,670
I'm kind of busy today.

293
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,470
But when I'm done with this project,

294
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,640
we can be officially together.

295
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
I'll tell you about it some other time.

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,760
Your Majesty.

297
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,640
Say it.

298
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,670
Your Majesty.

299
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,880
Is there something on your mind?

300
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,080
Do you know that

301
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,200
Qi Pa is doing something

302
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
with Hongxiu and Chun'er?

303
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,670
Recently Chun'er

304
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,590
seldom goes to the Imperial Kitchen.

305
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,550
She goes to Qipa's palace every day

306
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,710
and read poems there.

307
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,350
I also find that weird.

308
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,440
Today Hongxiu asked me for my gloves.

309
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Bai Ke told me

310
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,640
that Chun'er asked him for his mask.

311
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,440
Mask and gloves.

312
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,910
So it looks like

313
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,710
Qi Pa has given up filling my harem.

314
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,390
She has a new hobby.

315
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,440
That's great.

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,590
I'm glad she's not on the concubine thing.

317
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,710
Your Majesty, you're wise.

318
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,750
I guess the "no money" trick

319
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,150
totally worked.

320
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,560
Dear friends,

321
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,480
are you looking for an amulet of love?

322
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,190
Have you ever racked your brain
to get your lover a special present?

323
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,680
Yes! Great.

324
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,390
Your Highness.

325
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
Keep the momentum tomorrow.

326
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,120
We'll count on you

327
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,590
to raise funds.

328
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,040
I won't let you down, Your Highness.

329
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,680
They are here.

330
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,150
Now it starts.

331
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,190
Here we go.

332
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
[Mr. Liu Jun, you're my dream lover!]

333
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
[Bai Ke, I love you]

334
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Dear friends,

are you looking for an amulet of love?

336
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

337
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
Have you ever racked your brain
to get your lover a special present?

338
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,950
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

339
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,880
Now I declare that

340
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,750
the auction of Beast Royal Palace starts.

341
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,270
- Yeah!
- Great!

342
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,040
If there's anything to your taste,

343
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,150
please don't hesitate

344
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,560
to raise your hand

345
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
and buy it.

346
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,710
Yes!

347
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,560
Now we're presenting you lot 01.

348
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,190
Please allow me to introduce it.

349
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,800
What is it?

350
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,630
It's made of quality silk that's rarely seen.

351
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,590
Several crafts masters worked day and night

352
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,710
to make this piece of item.

353
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,830
But the story about it

354
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
is far more fascinating than its rarity.

355
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,750
Because it witnessed the love
that can not be blocked

356
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,360
by high mountains or deep water.

357
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,390
It may insulate poison,

358
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,880
but not love.

359
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,360
It's the pair of gloves

360
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,270
we took off from Mr. Liu Jun.

361
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,190
It still carries the blessing of love.

362
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,240
The next minute

363
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,120
it will go to a lucky buyer down there.

364
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,520
The opening bid is one tael of silver.

365
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
[Opening bid: one tael of silvers]
The opening bid is one tael of silver.

366
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,240
Please make your bids now.

367
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,150
Five taels.

368
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,880
30.

369
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,950
50.

370
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,960
I bid 50 taels.

371
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,200
60.

372
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Now I know what Her Highness

373
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,750
wanted my gloves for.

374
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,800
Who would know that she planned an auction?

375
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,630
Well,

she does have some wild ideas.

377
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,960
Your Majesty,
you should do something about this.

378
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,200
Perhaps one day

379
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,080
Her Highness may sell me out as well.

380
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,110
Oh, right.

381
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,040
It's just a pair of old gloves.

382
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,870
But so many people want it.

383
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,040
You are way more popular

384

385
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,270
That's not true, Your Majesty.

They're crazy about the gloves

387

562
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,270
Even if he is up to something,

563
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,920
he won't succeed.

564
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
After such a long refining process,

565
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,200
the Soul-driving Pill will finally be done

566
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,680
in a month.

567
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,200
Compared to the pill from five years ago,

568
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,350
this one is far more potent.

569
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,110
Xiniang.

570
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,750
After I take it.

571
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,990
I will be able to beat the crap out of
Kui Mulang

572
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,990
without any help.

573
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,110
It's okay that Jing Muhan is disloyal.

574
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
I just need him to keep an eye

575
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,990
on Kui Mulang for one month

576
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,600
to stop Kui from getting Holy Pearl.

577
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,080
Xiniang.

578
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,630
One mission for you.

579
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,270
I still need an ingredient.

580
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,680
This is what it looks like.

581
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,750
The herb grows at the bottom
of a cliff in the deep forest.

582
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,720
It emits scent at night only.

583
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,470
Not very hard to find.

584
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,630
Go and come back soon.

585
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,510
Yes, Master.

586
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,630
Your Majesty.

587
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,630
I wasn't part of this.

588
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,680
Then who do Black Gloves refer to?

589
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,270
Relax.

590
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,470
I've had guys look into it.

591
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,110
They said Qi Pa and Hongxiu did it.

592
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,230
They did it to utilize your fame.

593
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,720
Oh, Hongxiu.

594
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,990
Qi Pa did all these things

595
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,470
to put women in my harem.

596
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,150
Her Highness is pretty flexible.

597
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,840
How did she come up
with the auction for fund-raising?

598
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,600
Brilliant.

599
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,840
But Her Highness has gone too far.

600
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,150
Come on.

601
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,230
We haven't found the assassin yet.

602
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,320
And Qi Pa is determined to set up the class.

603
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,350
I'm afraid the assassin
will take advantage of the situation.

604
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,960
I must keep an eye on her in person.

605
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,680
Well, about the class...

606
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,510
It is not gonna happen.

607
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I will marry no one except for Qi Pa.

608
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,600
What are we going to do?

609
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,200
Do we have any choice?

610
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,630
Let her be.

611
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,470
Then we'll see what we can do.

612
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,390
Yes.

613
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
[Join the Black Gloves Performance Class]

614
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,870
I saw this by the street today.

615
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,390
I think it's a good chance for us.

616
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,110
No.

617
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,990
Screw the performance class.

618
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,110
Looks like Liu Jun and Qi Pa are in charge.

619
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,200
It's just a trick

620
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,630
to select concubines for Kui Mulang.

621
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,870
What bothers us now

622
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,350
is that we can't get close to Kui Mulang.

623
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,870
In that case,

624
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,960
how are we gonna assassinate him?

625
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,230
But if I make it into the class,

626
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,390
I will be able to approach him,

627
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,720
seduce him,

628
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,870
and sleep next to him.

629
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,110
Then I'll find a chance to kill him.

630
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,990
No.

631
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,470
No again?

632
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,390
Do you want to overthrow Kui Mulang or not?

633
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,560
They only know that I can disguise myself.

634
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,230
But they don't know about my art of seduction.

635
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,230
If I manage to enter the class

636
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,680
with my real appearance,

637
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
it will be a perfect opportunity.

638
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,680
What perfect opportunity?

639
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
As I see it,

640
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,960
the timing is not right yet.

641
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,470
You...

642
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,720
Why don't you get it, Miss Haitang?

643
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,080
His Royal Highness

644
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,680
doesn't want you to seduce His Majesty.

645
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,390
Zip your mouth.

646
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm sorry.

647
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,720
Anyway, I've already signed up.

648
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm gorgeous enough

649
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,080
to stand out among those women.

650
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,870
I'm made up my mind.

651
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,720
It's non-negotiable.

652
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,200
Good then.

653
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,720
You'd better succeed this time.

654
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,870
This time

655
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,920
I won't fail again.

656
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,390
Here come the officers.

657
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,320
I'd like to introduce them.

658
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,560
Commander Bai Ke of the Beast Clan.

659
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,150
Deputy Commander Hu Die.

660
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,470
Mr. Ning and Ms. Nan.

661
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,150
Many of you are from outside the palace.

662
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,600
We've been checking on strangers recently.

663
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,920
Please cooperate with our investigation.

664
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,750
We don't want Her Highness
to be assassinated again.

665
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,440
Then we'll be in trouble.

666
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,720
Hu Die.

667
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,630
Hu Die.

668
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,720
Her Highness

669
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,040
is doing this for His Majesty.

670
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:21,990
Yeah.

671
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,800
Miss Hongxiu is right.

672
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,960
Commander Bai.

673
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,800
Where is your mask? Why aren't you wearing it?

674
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,470
Mask?

675
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,560
You auctioned it off. Don't you remember?

676
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,270
Without further ado.

677
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,110
Haonan.

678
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,270
Take your squad to check that line.

679
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,800
Dayu, you check that line.

680
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,630
Yes.

681
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,680
What's your bloodline?

682
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,040
I'm of the rabbit bloodline.

683
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,630
And you?

684
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm of the fox bloodline.

685
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,390
What's your name and bloodline?

686
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,200
My name is Haitang. I'm a leopard.

687
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,150
Leopard?

688
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,920
Are you the daughter of Bao Laosan in town?

689
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,470
I don't know that person.

690
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,080
Bao Daxing in the suburb
is my distant relative.

691
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,200
He's the brother of my aunt's

692
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,440
second uncle's cousin.

693
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,230
There is no Bao Laosan

694
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,870
in the Leopard family.

695
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,470
Commander Bai.

696
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,200
It's my first time in the palace.

697
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,750
I'm not familiar with the rules here.

698
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,350
Please forgive my behavior if improper.

699
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,200
It's all right.

700
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
Why are you staring at her?

701
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,080
I... I... I...

702
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,960
- I'm just...
- And you.

703
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,230
Why did you make eyes at him?

704
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,630
I didn't.

705
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,390
Hu Die.

706
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,990
She's just an ordinary woman.

707
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,720
Why are you mad at her?

708
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,440
Ordinary woman?

709
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,960
She looks like a man-eater.

710
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,510
The queen

711
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,510
has always acted weird.

712
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,270
And now she brought weirdos to the palace.

713
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,350
Lords.

714
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,870
Have you done with your checking?

715
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
Commander Bai, nothing strange.

716
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,870
Our line is also fine.

717
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,440
Miss Hongxiu.

718
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,840
We've finished it.

719
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,840
Come on.

720
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,150
Why is she angry again?

721
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,110
This is the information
I asked Eunuch Ruo to collect.

722
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,800
About people with leopard bloodline
in Beast City.

723
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,470
Bear them in mind.

724
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,960
Don't let things go wrong.

725
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,320
I understand.

726
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,470
One more thing.

727
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,320
I learned a secret about Kui Mulang.

728
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,630
His face looks different from ordinary people.

729
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
But don't worry.

730
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,560
I've pictured his appearance.

731
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,600
Take a look.

732
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,110
Okay.

733
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,840
Is this Kui Mulang?

734
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,320
Right.

735
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,320
But remember,

736
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,750
don't mention this to anyone.

737
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,080
Don't worry.

738
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,510
Su Daqiang is no longer my master.

739
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,430
Apart from you,

740
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,910
I have no one to talk to.

741
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,670
Good.

742
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,320
The performance class is set up

743
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,670
to select concubines for Kui Mulang.

744
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,470
Now that you know

745
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,800
his real look,

746
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
It might be helpful.

747
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,270

Did I do something that offended Qi Pa?

00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,710
She's using the class thing

797
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,520
