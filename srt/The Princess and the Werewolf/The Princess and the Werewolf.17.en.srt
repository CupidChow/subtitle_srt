[The Princess and the Werewolf]
[Adapted from Orange's novel of the same name]

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,240
[Episode 17]

18
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,720
This poison is rare.

19
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,360
Your Highness, you saved Mr. Li's life

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,160
by sucking out the poison timely.

21
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,760
But since he is weak himself,

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,000
the detoxification

23
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,190
drained him of lots of energy.

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,040
Weak?

25
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,120
It's impossible.

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,910
Li Xiong has always been in good health.

27
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,550
Your Highness.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,310
A person who looks healthy

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,590
may suffer from inner injury.

30
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,720
Mr. Li is a martial artist.

31
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,760
He could have some old wounds.

32
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,670
Li Xiong.

33
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,440
What have you been through?

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,270
You've finally awake.

35
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,550
How are you doing?

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,390
I'm fine.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,800
How can you be fine?

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,000
The Imperial Doctor said you were drained of energy.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,320
You almost died.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
You've forgiven me?

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,390
What.

42
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,470
Force me to forgive you when you're ill?

43
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,160
Yeah.

44
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,030
Come on.

45
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,910
You're so seriously hurt.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
If I still hold a grudge against you,

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,550
how cold-blooded I am!

48
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,630
Doctor.

49
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,550
Your Highness, don't worry.

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,800
Mr. Li just fainted out of weakness.

51
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,960
Have rest and he'll be fine.

52
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,830
All right.

53
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,160
Your Highness.

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,750
Your Highness.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,110
Elder Qi.

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,670
Li's blood smeared on my dress.

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,520
Great.

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,240
Oh, blood.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,190
Have I just

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,160
miscarried?

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,160
Doctor.

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
Take her pulse.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,390
Check the baby.

64
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,800
Elder Qi.

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,320
I didn't feel any pulse that indicates pregnancy.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,670
It is a miscarriage.

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,160
Oh my.

68
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
My baby.

69
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,030
My heir.

70
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,800
Elder Qi.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Liu Jun.

72
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,240
Send Elder Qi back to Elders' Court.

73
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,030
Doctor.

74
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,270
Go take care of Elder Qi.

75
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,360
- I'll make a prescription for you, Your Highness.
- Guard!

76
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,390
Please take the medicine on it

77
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,600
to recover from the miscarriage.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,110
Sure.

79
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,880
Hurry, be quick.

80
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,480
Your Highness.

81
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,390
I'm sorry that you lost the baby.

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,160
But you have to pull yourself together.

83
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,350
Cutie.

84
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,160
I know you feel sorry for me.

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,600
But don't worry. I'll be fine.

86
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,670
You must be weak now.

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,760
Is there anything you feel like eating?

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll go buy it for you.

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,110
I want something sweet.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,790
I'll go now.

91
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,350
I thought Princess Qi Pa and her guard

92
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,670
were pretty weak

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,230
and we could kill them easily.

94
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,200
I didn't expect that guard to be so powerful.

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,230
He isn't just any bodyguard.

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
Looks like Kui Mulang

97
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,110
made him the guard to protect Qi Pa.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Xiniang.

99
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,830
That's it.

100
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,070
She is not easy to kill.

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,920
We should stop our plan for now.

102
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,670
Don't do anything.

103
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Sorry, I failed the mission.

104
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,160
Five years ago, Kui Mulang
got me seriously injured.

105
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,760
For the past five years,

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,000
I've been hoping to recover and back to my best.

107
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,720
Thus, I tried all kinds of remedies.

108
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,550
And I believe I will get healed.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
At that time,

110
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,600
I'll revenge myself on him.

111
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,880
You told Xiniang that they were

112
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,000
out of the palace

113
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,790
and then that person made the move.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,550
But Qi Pa and Li Xiong

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,920
still came back alive?

116
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,600
Yes.

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
How is Li Xiong?

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,390
I heard he's badly hurt.

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
But his life is not in danger.

120
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,670
He can't be just her bodyguard.

121
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,950
Or he wouldn't have risked his life for her.

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Princess Qi Pa is just that charming.

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,760
We underestimated him.

124
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,350
He managed to keep Qi Pa safe

125
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,390
in that dangerous situation.

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Now I start wondering

127
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,640
about the identity of Mr. Li.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
Mr. Liu Jun.

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,600
Are you getting out of the palace too?

130
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,510
The Imperial Doctor
made a prescription for Mr. Li.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,350
The Imperial Health Institute lacks an ingredient,

132
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,670
Lingzhi Herb.

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,550
I'm gonna get some in town.

134
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Good.

135
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,920
I'm on my way to get Her Highness some desserts.

136
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,230
Let's go together.

137
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
Miss Hongxiu.

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Are you still sad

140
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,390
about the miscarriage of Her Highness?

141
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,200
Of course I am.

142
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,070
I was so excited about the baby
and expected its birth.

143
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,270
But now it's gone just like this.

144
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,200
Miss Hongxiu.

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,110
I understand your sadness.

146
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,790
But here's the thing.

147
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,790
Among her friends,

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,040
only you are always by her side.

149
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,950
You still need to comfort her.

150
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,040
If you wore a sad face all day,

151
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,670
Her Highness would feel worse.

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,390
You're right, Mr. Liu Jun.

153
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,230
I can't stay so dispirited.

154
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,640
I should be there to support her.

155
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,880
That's the attitude.

156
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
Her Highness is still waiting for the desserts.

157
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,790
Let's go and come back soon.

158
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,200
Thank you.

159
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,110
Please take care.

160
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,830
Mr. Liu Jun, please wait a moment.

161
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,040
Excuse me.

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,510
How much is this candy?

163
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,510
One copper coin for each.

164
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,270
One copper coin?

165
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,710
I didn't take many coins with me.

166
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,710
I'll have 15.

167
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,840
Okay.

168
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,320
Thank you.

169
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,790
One, two, three, four, five.

170
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,910
Thank you.

171
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,320
It's super sweet.

172
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,470
Let's go.

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Liu.

174
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
Lingzhi Herb doesn't grow

175
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,910
in this season.

176
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,280
[Lingzhi Herb]
We don't have any

177
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
in stock.

178
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,760
I see.

179
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,110
Thank you.

180
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,550
Mr. Liu.

181
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,670
Are you filling a prescription for His Majesty?

182
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,550
This herb has a surprising effect on people

183
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,710
of the wolf clan.

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,520
Not His Majesty.

185
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,550
One of his guards.

186
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,710
That guard is also of the wolf clan.

187
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,710
Mr. Li turns out to be one of the wolf clan.

188
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,960
No wonder His Majesty values him so much.

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,520
How gracious our king is!

190
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,080
It's uncommon

191
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,670
to treat a guard with herbs so precious.

192
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,350
We'll check other stores.

193
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,080
Thank you.

194
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,710
Sure.

195
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
The season is not right.

196
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm afraid it's hard to get it.

197
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,110
Miss Hongxiu.

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
I may have to go to a few more pharmacies.

199
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,710
If you're tired, you can...

200
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm not.

201
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,350
I'll help you find it.

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Many hands make light work.

203
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,790
Mr. Liu Jun.

204
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I have an idea.

205
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
It can save our time.

206
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,230
Kids.

207
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,470
You run around on the streets all day.

208
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,030
Could you do me a favor?

209
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,080
Yes.

210
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,440
I got sweet treats for you.

211
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,350
Yeah!

212
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,030
Now you go to the pharmacies along the streets

213
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,470
and check whether they have

214
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,880
Lingzhi Herb in stock.

215
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,230
Okay.

216
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,640
And each of you

217
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,910
will get three candies for it.

218
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah!

219
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Here. Now get started.

220
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
- I also want one.
- Give me some.

221
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,440
We two go to the west.

222
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
You three the east.

223
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,030
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,230
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

225
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,080
Go!

226
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,150
Be careful.

227
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,910
Hongxiu, you are smart.

228
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,710
Mr. Liu Jun.

229
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,880
Let's go look for the herb, too.

230
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,710
We can't just watch.

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,590
Okay.

232
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,350
Wait a second.

233
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,960
How much are all these candies?

234
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,550
One tael of silver.

235
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,760
Mr. Liu Jun.

236
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,590
Why did you...

237
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,320
I did it to express my thanks.

238
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,280
Well, you didn't have to.

239
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Miss Hongxiu.

240
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Let's go.

241
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,000
Sister Hongxiu, I found it.

242
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,760
In the pharmacy at the east end.

243
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,760
They have Lingzhi Herb.

244
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,590
Go there with your husband.

245
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,150
He's... He's not... not my...

246
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,910
Thank you, boy.

247
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,840
We'll go now.

248
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,320
Hongxiu.

249
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,790
You've been a great help.

250
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,840
Let's go get the herbs.

Here's some sweet food.

He's just in a feverish coma.

296

It's gonna be a while before he wakes up.

297
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,390
I suggest we move him back to His Majesty's.

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:22,950
How about that?

299
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,750
No need.

After a miscarriage,

304
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,830
You must be in a poor state of health.

305
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,560
You might as well get some rest.

306
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
Or you could eat something at least.

307
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,560
I did just lose a baby

308
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,040

Could you put these desserts over there?

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,920
Yes.

315

You just had a miscarriage.

Why don't you go rest,
and let Hongxiu take care of you?

I'll look after Mr. Li.

319

I said,

320
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,200
I'll take care of him myself.

321
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,560
Your health is more important than his.

322
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,390
Mr. Li is also important.

Your Highness.

324
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,390
His Majesty is also worried about Mr. Li.

325
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,080
Please leave him to me.

326
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,990
Or His Majesty would blame me.

327
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,720
You go back and tell Kui Mulang

my exact words.

329
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,750
Li Xiong got injured to save me.

330
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,470
So I must watch him getting well.

331
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,840
Before he fully recovers,

332
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,510
he's not getting back.

333
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,470
That's kind of inappropriate.

334
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,960
It's appropriate when I say it is.

335
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,680
You've been here all day.

336
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,110
Don't you need to go to the lavatory?

337
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,040
I don't.

338
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,750
Looks like Mr. Li needs to.

339
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,320
You don't know that.

340
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,270
I...

341
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,390
It's just a guess.

342
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,320
How about this?

343
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,920
Considering his current condition,

344
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,750
it's inconvenient for him to move.

345
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,270
I'll send someone to bring a chamber pot.

346
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,560
Okay, sure.

347
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,990
Oh, it's getting dark.

348
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,680
Your Highness.

349
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,870
I'd better take a look

350
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,200
and check how Mr. Li doing.

351
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,440
Please slide over.

352
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,560
That's impossible.

353
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
What's wrong? Is it getting worse?

354
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,750
No, he's not.

355
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
He's getting better.

356
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,440
The sun has set.

357
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,470
But His Majesty didn't transform.

358
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,470
Why?

359
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,470
I didn't transform.

360
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,230
Your Majesty.

361
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,080
How are you?

362
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,960
Your Majesty.

363
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,630
How do you feel?

364
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,040
I tried to run my power

365
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,320
and found my inner power abated.

366
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,350
This suggests that Holy Pearl isn't inside me.

367
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,920
Besides, the delivery of Holy Pearl

368
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,630
requires a true love's kiss.

369
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,800
Qi Pa and I

370
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,230
are not there yet.

371
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
Your Majesty, you were in a coma just now.

372
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,840
And Her Highness was the only one around.

373
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,320
Are you sure nothing has happened?

374
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,800
Sorry for crossing the line.

375
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,990
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

376
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,470
There's no harm in that.

377
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,560
I'm too weak because of the injury.

378
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,270
I can't recall something that matters.

379
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
But if Holy Pearl didn't get into my body,

380
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,600
why didn't my appearance transform

381
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,150
during the night?

382
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,440
Her Highness sucked out the poisonous blood for you

383
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
and was not harmed at all.

384
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,080
In that case,

385
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,270
Holy Pearl must have worked in this.

386
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,040
Your Majesty, do you think that's the key?

387
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,870
It's possible.

388
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,680
After all, Holy Pearl
has stayed in her body for five years.

389
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,560
Maybe Her Highness herself could save you.

390
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,110
Your Majesty, you...

391
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,080
I'm all right.

392
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,560
Now things have come to this,

393
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,320
let's see what will happen next.

394
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,720
And one more thing.

395
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,680
Her Highness got your blood

396
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,600
on her dress.

397
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,230
So she told everyone

398
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,800
that she miscarried.

399
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,150
Now Qi Pa got what she wanted.

400
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,990
Elder Qi knew about it too.

401
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Then let's cooperate with her

402
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,350
and make others believe it.

403
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,920
It's a good chance for me.

404
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,080
I can pretend to be sad

405
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
and stay in my chamber.

406
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,350
Tomorrow, you tell the Imperial Kitchen

407
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,110
to prepare dietary supplements for her.

408
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,680
The reason is she just had a miscarriage.

409
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,270
Yes.

410
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,800
And you...

411
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,350
Your Majesty.

412
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Please get some rest.

413
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,840
You can't be too careful with this injury.

414
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,870
I'm good.

415
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,080
It's just a bruise.

416
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,350
Since my appearance doesn't change at night,

417
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,630
I can't take the chance

418
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,920
to spend more time with Qi Pa.

419
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,960
It's too risky.

420
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,470
You can't do that.

421
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,080
Have you found the mysterious man in the forest?

422
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,320
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

423
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,040
I've looked into it in secret.

424
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,270
Check this out.

425
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,230
The assassin who attacked us

426
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,270
must be a woman.

427
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,040
And this is her hidden weapon.

428
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,230
Hidden weapons. No close combat.

429
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,680
She's not the one who disguised as Qi Pa.

430
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,080
That sounds reasonable.

431
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,110
But you and Her Highness left the palace

432
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,510
without telling others,

433
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,230
how could they know about it?

434
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,680
That mysterious man
has tried to kill Qi Pa several times.

435
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,990
They must have a spy in the palace.

436
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,440
The female assassin with the chameleon bloodline

437
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,560
is still nowhere to find.

438
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,750
You must protect Qi Pa well.

439
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,440
Nothing can go wrong from now on.

440
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,990
I'll make arrangements.

442
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,510
As for today's assassination,

443
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,350
I'll go all out to find out the truth.

444
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,040
Okay.

445
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
[Yaohua Palace]

446
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,560
Li Xiong.

447
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,840
You are fully recovered?

448
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,990
Yeah.

449
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,110
I have something important to tell you.

450
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,440
Qi Pa.

451
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,320
I like you.

452
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,080
I've liked you for a long time.

453
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,320
Are you sure?

454
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,390
Yes, I am.

455
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,150
Though I was badly hurt back then,

456
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,320
I meant what I said.

457
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,470
Because I was afraid

458
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,390
that if I didn't,

459
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,630
I would never have a chance to say it.

460
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,270
Can I ask you a question?

461
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,920
Do you like being with me?

462
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,720
Yes, I do.

463
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,800
Does your heart give a flutter

464
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,080
when you see me?

465
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,150
Yeah.

466
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,350
That means you like me.

467
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,470
Are you willing to stay in Beast City with me?

468
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,630
Stay in Beast City?

469
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,560
Are we not going back to Daxia State?

470
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,510
Back to Daxia?

471
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,960
In that case,

472
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,920
are we going

473
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
to live in different places

474
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,990
like Ma Yingxiong and Chun'er do?

475
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,840
I don't know.

476
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,320
I haven't thought about it yet.

477
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,960
It's a serious matter.

478
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,990

Come on, time to get up.

485
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,150
I fell asleep.

486
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,600
Watch your steps, Your Highness.

487
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,110
Where's Li Xiong?

488
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,230
He wasn't there

489
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,320
when I woke up.

490
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,110
And Mr. Liu Jun is also missing.

491
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,750
He's still wounded. Where could he go?

492
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,470
Go look for him.

493
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,800
Yes.

494
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,600
Why are you up?

495
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,200
Your Highness.

496
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,630
You're still wounded. Why don't you lie in bed?

497
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,680
Where have you been?

498
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,270
I'm almost all right.

499
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,600
I just went to the lavatory.

500
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,680
You should wake me up

501
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,840
and I would go with you.

502
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,270
That doesn't sound right.

503
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,920

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,350
Why do you still call me Your Highness?

506
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,230
What else should I address you?

507
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,680
Do you remember what you said

508
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,800
when in a coma?

509
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,750
I fainted and was in a coma.

510
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,870
How would I remember what I said?

511
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,080
What did I say?

00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,840

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,080

Forget it.

00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,200
You don't need to know.

519
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,750

why don't you just go back?

524
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,840
His Majesty already knows I'm here.

525
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,320
So I don't need to rush back tonight.

Oh, why am I being so bad-tempered？

533
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,600
It's just a man.

534
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,230
Losing him is not a big deal.

535

We've sent someone to inform His Majesty.

Mr. Liu came out

545
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,750

From now on, no one shall disturb His Majesty.

549
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,920

- Yes.
- Yes.

No bowing down and greetings to me?

554
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,150
Sorry but I can't do it now.

I want you to treat me as your new master.

561

That's why you saved me.

562
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,990
You can think it over.

And I never abandon

567
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,470
those who are loyal to me.

568
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,990
You saved my life,

569
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,920
so I can work for you

570
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,990
to repay the favor.

571
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,320
But you will never be my master.

572
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,630
Why?

573
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,320
How is he better than me?

574
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,720
That's irrelevant.

575
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,800
I almost died once.

576
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,200
I don't want to be attached to anyone.

577
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,440
From now on,

578
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,630
my only master can just be myself.

579
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,840
That's very ungrateful of you.

580
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,200
Fine.

581
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,350
Take your time to think about my offer.

582
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,840
Ruo.

583
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,470
Let's go.

584
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,270
Your Royal Highness.

585
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,270
That woman is too full of herself.

586
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,960
How dare she turn down your offer?

587
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,270
What's the rush? We still have time.

588
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,440
That's wise, Your Royal Highness.

589
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,270
I know people of her kind.

590
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,110
She's never been treated with tenderness.

591
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,560
If we want to make her feel touched

592
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,040
and devote herself to us.

593
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,750
we only need to do one thing.

594
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,630
Be nice to her.

595
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,920
That's really wise, Your Royal Highness.

596
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,040
What's bothering you, Your Majesty?

597
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,080
Qi Pa treated me oddly last night.

598
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
She's never acted like that before.

599
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,750
Could it be something you said

600
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,750
when you were unconscious?

601
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,720
Her Highness may detect something fishy.

602
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,440
Do you remember what you said

603
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,600
when in a coma?

604
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,390
I fainted and was in a coma.

605
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,390
How would I remember what I said?

606
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,920
What did I say?

607
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,390
You...

608
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,440
Did I really spill the beans?

609
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,200
What should we do now?

610
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:38,920
Your Majesty.

611
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,320
It's good that now you don't transform at night.

612
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,990
But our priority is still to get Holy Pearl.

613
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,470
No.

614
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,150
I have to find it out.

615
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,720
If I did something

616
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,960
to upset her,

617
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,990
I will explain it clearly.

618
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,920
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

619
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,510
No.

620
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,510
I want closure with Li Xiong.

621
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,110
Your Highness.

622
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,990
You just had a miscarriage.

623
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,200
Why don't you rest in bed?

624
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,040
Here, drink this tonic soup.

625
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,390
What's this?

626
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,720
Cutie.

627
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,510
How about you drink it?

628
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,200
I didn't miscarry.

629
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,990
Red dates, wolfberries and longan.

630
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,440
They are all good for girls.

631
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,040
You don't need a miscarriage to drink it.

632
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
Just drink it.

633
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,270
Your Highness, where are you going?

634
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,630
I'm going to end it with a playboy.

635
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,270
Playboy?

636
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,390
Your Highness.

637
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,470
[Kuixing Palace]

638
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,110
Your Highness.

639
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,110
Your Highness.

640
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,190
Your Highness, are you here for His Majesty?

641
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,270
I came for Li Xiong.

642
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,840
I have something to tell him.

643
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,990
Mr. Li just went to your palace.

644
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,950
He went to see me?

645
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,800
Thank you.

646
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,510
Qi Pa.

647
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,750
I haven't told you...

648
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,160
Your Highness.

649
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,990
Mr. Li.

650
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,510
Hongxiu?

651
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,800
Have you seen Her Highness?

652
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Her Highness just went out.

653
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,160
She said

654
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,190
she was going to end it with a playboy.

655
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,670
Playboy again?

656
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,360
I see.

657
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,280
♪Dressed in white, you fell by my side♪

658
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,160

I've looked all over for you.

671
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Why are you mad at me all of a sudden?

672
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,950
I've thought it over and over.

673
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,800
Is it because of some nonsense I said

674
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,990
when in a coma that day?

675
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,990
Did it upset you?

676
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,600
Nonsense?

677
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,560
You think it was nonsense?

678
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,470
I guess that's the reason.

679
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,670
Could you forgive me?

681
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,160
You don't even know what you said.

682
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,270
What are you apologizing for?

683
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,670
No matter what I said,

684
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,270
I made you unhappy.

685
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,600
Then it was my fault.

686
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,080
My apology.

687
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,510
Last night when you were in a coma,

688
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
you took my hand and said something.

689
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,270
You don't remember a single word you said?

690
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,360
I took your hand?

691
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,080
What did I say after I took your hand?

692
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,550
This is what you said.

693
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,310
What's this?

694
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,840
It means love.

695
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,230
Yesterday you said you liked me.

696
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,640
Do you remember that?

697
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,710
I like you.

698
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,750
Well, here's a question.

699
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,920
Do your words still count?

700
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,840
Are you willing to be together with me?

701
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,200
Yes, I do.

702
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,030
And no matter what obstacles
we encounter in the future,

703
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,310
you will never give up easily?

704
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,400
I will never let you down

705
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,920
Deal.

706
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,120
If you ever deceive me again,

707
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,550
I will not let you off.

708
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,440
I promise.

709
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,160
Buck up.

710
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,920
Each of you was elected by me.

711
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,080
The top of the elites.

712
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,990
Your job is to protect this place

713
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,440
and everyone here.

714
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,990
Why is he laughing?

715
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,440
Your Highness.

716
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,640
You're back.

717
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,230
What are you so happy about?

718
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,550
Your Highness.

719
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,120
Spin.

720
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,550
Wait.

721
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,510
Stop.

722
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,880
Stop spinning.

723
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,990
I'm getting dizzy.

724
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,990
You don't get it.

725
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,200
Love makes a person spin.

726
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,360
Is there anything happy

727
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,990
between you and His Majesty?

728
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,640
Shoot. I totally forget about Kui Mulang.

729
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,440
No.

730
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,360
I have to talk to him.

731
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,470
