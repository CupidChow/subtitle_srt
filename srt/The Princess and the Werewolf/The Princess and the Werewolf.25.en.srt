[Episode 25]

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,760
Your Grace.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,270
Hongxiu.

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Why are you here?

21
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,590
I will accompany you back to Daxia.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,190
Leave with me?

23
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,440
Your Grace.

24
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,630
I'm really worried about you.

25
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,270
You have now lost His Majesty.

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,550
If you went back to Daxia by yourself

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,270
without me,

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,480
It would be like that
you are abandoned by the whole world.

29
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,760
I will never leave you alone.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,830
Don't be impulsive.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I am not impulsive.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,360
I know that

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,880
His Majesty may have lied to you.

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,110
I don't know what he lied to you,

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,600
but it did happen.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,080
I support you to go back to Daxia.

37
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,360
You treat me so well.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,630
I can't bear to part with you.

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,360
You are really loyal, Hongxiu.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Hongxiu.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,160
I read that letter.

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Do you really want to leave?

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,880
Are you really going back to Daxia with her?

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,670
Hongxiu.

45
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,320
I am very touched

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,550
by this.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
But Daxia

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,000
is a completely unfamiliar place to you,

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,800
just like Beast Clan is to me
when I first arrived.

50
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,390
So

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,320
you'd better stay.

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,110
This is your home.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,520
Your Grace.

54
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,270
Liu Jun.

55
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,960
Hongxiu

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,670
really likes you.

57
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,270
I'm sure

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,670
you like her very much, too.

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,470
Be brave in love.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
Don't hesitate anymore.

61
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,440
Take good care of Hongxiu.

62
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,030
Only by leaving her to you

63
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,750
can I rest assured.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
My own love is not complete.

65
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,910
It is my consolation
if you two have a happy ending.

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,910
Also,

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,160
get a message to Bai Ke and Hu Die for me.

68
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,880
Let the two of them stop arguing.

69
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,750
It is a lifelong regret

70
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,630
for two people in love to miss each other.

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,550
Cherish each other.

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,550
Okay.

73
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Let's go.

74
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,790
Your Grace.

75
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,320
Grab my hair, and you know I'm there.

76
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
Are you feeling at ease now?

77
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,030
I tied a bell on your wrist.

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,520
If you need me,

79
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,040
just shake it.

80
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,150
I'll be there in time.

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,150
Alright.

82
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,480
What's this?

83
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,390
In our place,

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,320
this is called Constellation.

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,080
From today on,

86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,760
this constellation is yours.

87
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,390
With it, I want you to know

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,550
that I'm protecting you

89
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,080
day and night.

90
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,480
Why did you take me to watch
that Constellation

91
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,960
that day?

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,920
Because its name

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
is Kui Mulang.

94
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,200
I see.

95
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,200
I should have found out long ago.

96
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,830
Li Xiong

97
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,480
is Kui Mulang.

98
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,830
Let's go.

99
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,910
Here we are.

100
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,280
I thought

101
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,110
we could go back to Daxia today.

102
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,550
That's it.

103
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,400
Exactly like what's in my dream.

104
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,230
You've always been lying to me,

105
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,350
and I've trusted you time and time again.

106
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Sorry.

107
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,790
I made countless mistakes before.

108
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,790
But today

109
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,030
I will end them all myself

110
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,280
and send you home.

111
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,430
I hope it can be like what you said.

112
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,760
After you return to Daxia,

113
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,870
forget everything here,

114
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,840
and forget me too.

115
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,230
That's where you brought me here?

116
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,840
Yes.

117
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,790
Then I can leave the Beast Clan

118
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
from here, right?

119
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,760

149
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,990
When you were in Beast Clan, you said that

150
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,990
we would definitely meet in Daxia.

151
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,790

Are you back alone?

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,030
Chun'er didn't come.

155
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,350
His and Her Majesty will be very happy

156
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,550
after knowing it.

157
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,350
Your Grace, let's go home.

161
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,520
Pass my order.

162
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,840
From now on, there will be

163
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,790
no one named Qi Pa in the palace,

164
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,870
and there will be no Queen of Beast Clan.

165
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,720
Yes.

Your Grace.

170
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,470
Your Grace, aren't you feeling well?

171
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,640
I may have slept too long,

172
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,790
and I'm a little dizzy now.

173
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,910
After you came back last night,

174
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,440
you told His and Her Majesty that

175
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,200
you went to a place

176
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,950
called Beast Clan,

177
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,390
which is exactly what General Ma
said at that time.

178
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,880
But back then,

179
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,590
we all thought that he went crazy.

180
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,880
Now

181
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,800
the truth finally comes to light.

182
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,910
It is normal for you not to believe.

183
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,390
You can never

184
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,800
go to that place.

185
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,950
Your Grace.

186
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,030
Is that place scary?

187
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,910
Did they bully you?

188
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,800
It's

189
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,590
not scary at all.

190
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,150
There's a nice group of people there,

191
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,120
warm and kind.

I can tell

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,950
all the happiness and wantonness
you have never had

384
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,400
in the past few months.

385
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,950
So I am always grateful to Her Highness.

386
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,000
You gave everything for the Beast Clan.

387
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,240
Only liking Her Highness

388
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,760
is the only thing you can do
for yourself in this life.

389
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
But this relationship

390
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,880
doesn't belong to me after all.

391
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,240
Now that I have made a choice,

392
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,280
there is no turning back

393
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,790
and no regrets.

394
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,310
Mr. Su.

395
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,830
How do you think about

396
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,470
what I told you that day?

397
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,160
No one in the Beast Clan

398
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,400
knew that Kui Mulang has two faces.

399
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,790
If we make a big fuss about this

400
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,640
and let the people
of the Beast Clan know that

401
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,070
the King they have always admired

402
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,790
is actually a demon
whose face has been changed

403
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,160
due to practicing sorcery,

404
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,310
we will definitely overthrow Kui Mulang
in one fell swoop.

405
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,640
What?

406
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,920
Don't you think it's doable?

407
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,360
Faithful words grate upon the ear.

408
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,160
It's just that your idea

409
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,280
is way too naive.

410
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,520
I know

411
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,470
you are a master of pharmacy.

412
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,950
We fell short five years ago.

413
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,550
In the past five years,

414
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,830
I believe you have a new plan.

415
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,240
You only need to know one thing.

416
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,470
Even without your help,

417
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,710
I can defeat Kui Mulang alone.

418
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,120
So, Your Royal Highness,

419
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,550
I don't think this deal

420
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,520
matters.

421
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,160
Su Daqiang, what do you mean?

422
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,790
Your Royal Highness.

423
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,070
No worries.

424
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,520
Since Xiniang brought you here,

425
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
I won't

426
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,830
just sit idly by.

427
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,160
I think

428
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,590
you'd better

429
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,670
not be impulsive in the future.

430
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,000
Follow my arrangement.

431
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,520
You mean

432
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,310
you want me to be your subordinate?

433
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,160
Yes.

434
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,470
I'm the prince of the Beast Clan.

435
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,470
So what?

436
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,880
I have a certainty of victory.

437
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,710
The secret of Kui Mulang

438
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
means nothing

439
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,590
to me.

440
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,880
So,

441
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,880
what substantive help

442
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,640
can you offer me?

443
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,670
It seems that you are still willing
to believe me.

444
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,520
I am deeply moved

445
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,880
Faced with a formidable foe,

446
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,790
I hope you can

447
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,520
follow my lead.

448
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,950
Okay.

449
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,430
Mr. Su.

450
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,000
I know what you mean.

451
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,160
Chun'er.

452
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,040
I miss you so much.

453
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,880
Your Grace.

454
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,760
I didn't know you were coming,

455
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,000
so I didn't come to greet you.

456
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,470
I will kill myself.

457
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,760
Forget it.

458
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,720
[From Yingxiong, who misses you terribly]

459
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,520
This is

460
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,790
Chun'er in your mind?

461
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,280
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

462
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,950
Is this the beauty in your eyes?

463
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,790
I thought you were

464
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,790
of great taste.

465
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,470
I didn't expect you to be so ignorant of art.

466
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,280
Do you have more wine?

467
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,430
Give me some.

468
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,880
Yes.

469
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,590
Here, Your Grace.

470
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,280
Your Grace, you...

471
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,590
What's going on?

472
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Isn't it normal

473
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,710
to drink with friends?

474
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,400
Tell me.

475
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,310
You draw a portrait of Chun'er
every single day.

476
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,430
You must miss her very much, right?

477
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,310
Of course.

478
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,950
This long-distance relationship
is so difficult.

479
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,790
Chun'er

480
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,920
also misses you very much.

481
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,160
Really?

482
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,590
Your Grace.

483
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,120
Do you think

484
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,470
Chun'er and I

485
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,040
will meet again?

486
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,760
Of course you will.

487
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,430
Is this a white lie?

488
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,950
Believe it or not.

489
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,160
Your Grace.

490
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,870
It's not that I don't believe you.

491
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,800
Kui Mulang

492
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,040
was unwilling to send you back anyway.

493
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,230
Now he let you back so easily.

494
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,400
Well...

495
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,750
Could it be that you two had a quarrel?

496
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Or what happened to Beast Clan?

497
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,080
Is Chun'er okay?

498
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,630
No way.

499
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,320
I am going back to save her.

500
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,560
Hold on.

501
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,990
Don't panic.

502
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,200
No.

503
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,080
Nothing happened.

504
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,470
It's me.

505
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,710
I never want to

506
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,870
see Kui Mulang again.

507
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,750
I don't even want to mention his name.

508
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,800
That's good.

509
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,350
What's so good?

510
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,230
Ma Yingxiong, what are you talking about?

511
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,230
Your Grace.

512
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,200
Is your long-cherished wish

513
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,110
to go back to Daxia, right?

514
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,320
Kui Mulang

515
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,960
finally sent you back.

516
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,280
Shouldn't you be happy?

517
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,230
Forget it.

518
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,110
Chatting with a heartless person like you

519
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,710
is meaningless.

520
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,960
My bad.

521
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,350
Nothing.

522
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,830
I actually don't think

523
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,560
our time at Beast Clan

524
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,320
was that bad.

525
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,830
Yes, Your Grace.

526
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,870
In fact, I really miss Chun'er

527
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,510
and others in the Beast Clan.

528
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,230
Liu Jun

529
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,470
looks like a gigolo.

530
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,960
But he's good at martial arts.

531
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,920
And the martial arts

532
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,870
of Hu Die and Bai Ke are also good.

533
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,830
And that maid Hongxiu

534
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,160
who is always by your side.

535
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,510
She's no worse than E'huang.

536
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,160
To be honest,

537
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,200
I feel relieved

538
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,080
to have her by your side.

539
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,870
Your Grace.

540
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,070
Why are you crying?

541
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,960
Are you also missing life

542
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,520
in the Beast Clan?

543
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,720
It makes sense.

544
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,830
Except Kui Mulang...

545
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,030
What's wrong with Kui Mulang?

546
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,440
Don't speak ill of him.

547
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,440
Then why did you come back?

548
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,350
I was missing home.

549
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,630
That's why I wanted to go back.

550
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,160
Tell me.

551
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,720
If a person lied to you,

552
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,000
but you love him very much,

553
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,830
would you forgive him?

554
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,030
Who's that?

555
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,400
Kui Mulang?

556
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,270
How dare he lie to you?

557
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm going to the Beast Clan to kill him.

558
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,270
Stop.

559
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,720
How can you get there?

560
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,270
And you even want to kill him?

561
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,760
Actually, Your Grace,

562
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,550
Kui Mulang

563
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,790
is pretty reliable.

564
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,110
Not to mention anything else,

565
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,070
when I was in the Beast Clan,

566
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,870
he saved you twice.

567
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,030
How dare you still have
improper thoughts about Qi Pa?

568
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,550
Help!

569
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,200
But

570
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,720
he must have done it to take advantage of me.

571
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,680
How dare he?

572
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,520
I will never speak for him again.

573
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,870
But

574
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,270
sometimes,

575
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,590
he even risked his own life

576
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,030
to save me.

577
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,520
He may not have used me.

578
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,350
Keep her alive

579
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,240
and I can do anything for you.

580
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,200
I'd like to see

581
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,110
how much you can do for her.

582
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,960
Li Xiong!

583
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,350
What Kui Mulang did

584
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,550
proves that he is a real man.

585
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,000
So

586
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,680
he actually treats me well.

587
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
So should I go back?

588
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,630
No way.

589
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,960
After all, you were deceived by him,

590
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,240
and you must feel resentful.

591
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,760
You can't just go back.

592
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,030
Right?

593
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,200
You are right.

594
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,270
I can't lose my prestige.

595
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,110
Yes.

596
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,350
I can't be obsessed with being in love.

597
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,590
Exactly.

598
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,440
Your Grace.

599
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,870
I am in favor of you.

600
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,310
Nowhere is better than here.

601
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,630
Forget it.

602
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,310
I'm going back to rest.

603
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,400
Enjoy yourself.

604
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,270
Are you just leaving?

605
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,240
Drink more.

606
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,520
Your Majesty.

607
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,720
Your Majesty.

608
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,110
You suffered several times of injuries,

609
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,350
which is a huge drain on your body.

610
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,790
You also need to transfuse force
into the Holy Spring.

611
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,550
If you go on like this,

612
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,590
I'm afraid you won't live longer
than your father.

613
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,590
The Holy Spring is about to dry up.

614
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,680
I don't know how long I can last.

615
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,200
Liu Jun.

616
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,870
Ask the elders to come to the hall.

617
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,520
Your Majesty.

618
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,350
No.

619
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,590
Go.

620
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,520
Your Majesty.

621
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,870
I have followed you
and taken care of you for many years.

622
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
I am where I am today

623
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,590
because you never forsake me.

624
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,630
I never gave up hope.

625
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,310
Until now,

626
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,030
I still believe that

627
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
you and Her Highness will get back together

628
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,110
and you can get the Holy Pearl.

629
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,310
I'm afraid it won't happen.

630
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,480
Your Majesty.

631
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,790
Are you really going to give up Her Highness

632
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,760
and the Holy Pearl?

633
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,920
Then tell me what to do.

634
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,400
Liu Jun.

635
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,920
If you still treat me as the King,

636
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,550
stop talking nonsense.

637
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,270
Just go.

638
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,630
Yes.

639
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,960
It's done.

640
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,720
The Soul-driving Pill

641
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,440
is done.

642
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,720
Congratulations, master.
Your great cause is to be accomplished.

643
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,160
Xiniang.

644
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,070
Refine it in this way.

645
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,760
In just a few days,

646
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,830
We will get more Soul-driving Pills.

647
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,440
Then let's proceed with our plan.
