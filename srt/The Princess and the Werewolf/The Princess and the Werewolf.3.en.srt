she will be the benefactor
of the entire Beast Clan.

189
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Why is she not worthy

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,510
of the position of Queen?

191
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
You are right, Your Majesty.

192
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,590
My bad.

193
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,880
She came to Beast Clan because of me.

194
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,270
No matter what outrageous things she did,

195
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,440
I will bear

196
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,920
all the consequences.

197
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,120
All the people who suffered losses

198
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,560
will be compensated with funds
from my private treasury.

199
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,710
Tell them that is from Queen-to-be.

200
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,480
Yes.

201
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,830
I'll be on it.

202
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
What again?

203
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,270
Your Majesty.

204
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,880
I found a message

205
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,390
in the Remonstrance Books that

206
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,150
doesn't sound like
someone from Beast Clan.

207
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,440
And the postscript is...

208
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
[Kui Mulang, pay attention
to image management]

209
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,840
[Remonstrance Box]

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,710
Remonstrance Box?

211
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,120
Kui Mulang.

212
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,950
You need to pay attention
to image management.

213
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,150
Your Majesty.

214
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,480
Forget it.

215
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,120
This opinion of the princess

216
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,240
must be aimed
at your appearance at night.

217
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,510
She is very pleased

218
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,000
with your appearance during the day.

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,070
Stop it.

220
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,120
It doesn't work.

221
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,510
Get out of the way. Let me go.

222
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,270
Let's go back.

223
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,150
Hu Die, deputy commander of Imperial Guards
is asking to see His Majesty.

224
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,830
Come in.

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,240
[Hu Die, bloodline: weasel, farting, competitive]
[Bai Ke, bloodline: hedgehog, thorny and upright]

226
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,270
What's the matter?

227
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,480
Your Majesty.

228
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,150
Hu Die ran into the princess
in the city yesterday.

229
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,480
She came here today to plead guilty.

230
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,800
I'm not here to plead guilty.

231
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,120
Your Majesty.

232
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,800
The princess forcibly broke into the forbidden area.

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,320
Due to her improper conduct, I don't think
she's qualified to be the Queen of the Beast Clan.

234
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,630
Please recall the order, Your Majesty.

235
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,320
I heard that you knew the identity
of the princess yesterday,

236
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,150
but you still insisted on hurting her.

237
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,710
Is that true?

238
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,040
Tell me the truth.

239
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,880
Your Majesty.

240
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,630
Even if I recognized her at that time,

241
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,320
she acted strangely
and her origins were unknown.

242
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,440
I lost my head for a while

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,750
because I was worried about your safety.

244
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,480
Enough.

245
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,480
It is your duty to defend the city,

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,630
and you deserve the award.

247
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,150
But you offended your superior
because of your private thoughts,

248
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,150
so you should be punished.

249
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,630
Reward and punishment are equal.

250
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,360
I punish you to stay at home
and reflect on yourself.

251
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

252
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,320
Let's go.

253
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
Your Majesty, I...

254
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's go.

255
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,040
Qi Pa is really good at causing trouble.

256
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,000
Your Majesty.

257
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,070
This is the Queen you chose.

258
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,830
Come with me to her chamber.

259
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,560
Just do as I told you.

260
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,440
Yes.

261
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,390
Your Grace.

262
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,440
Liu Jun asked to see you.

263
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,630
Mr. Liu Jun.

264
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,830
Look at you.

265
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,830
Here.

266
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
Your Grace, Miss Hongxiu.

267
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
This is Li Xiong.

268
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,000
He is the guard assigned by the King
to Your Grace.

269
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,630
In the next few days,
he will be with Your Grace

270
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,000
to protect your safety.

271
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,190
Greetings to Your Grace.

272
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,710
The King is really nice to Your Grace.

273
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,070
The King is so considerate.

274
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,560
Thank him for me.

275
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,270
Okay, I'll take my leave.

276
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,510
Hold on.

277
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,320
Hongxiu.

278
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,830
I see many flowers blooming
in the garden today.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
How about you and Liu Jun

280
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,680
go pick some flowers

281
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,240
to decorate my place?

282
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,560
Me and Mr. Liu Jun?

283
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,440
Liu Jun.

284
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,480
Is that okay?

285
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,350
Should I go?

286
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,000
Go.

287
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,190
I'm asking you. Why did you look at him?

288
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,110
It's what I should do.

289
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,590
Then leave us.

290
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,670
Miss Hongxiu, please.

291
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,320
I'll take my leave.

292
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,640
Kui Mulang sent you to protect me.

293
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,910
How did you make that?

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,710
Your Grace, I've told you that

295
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,350
the King is nice.

296
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,640
He was very worried

297
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,470
when he learned yesterday that

298
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,760
you were in danger outside.

299
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,400
And he gave me this.

300
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,350
[Token]
Exit Token.

301
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,400
Exit Token.

302
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,550
The King thinks

303
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,670
you are having fun in the city.

304
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,200
So he allows you to leave the palace freely

305
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,880
under my protection.

306
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,590
Wait.

307
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,400
Since you got this,

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,640
were you hurt?

309
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,030
Your Grace, you got it wrong.

310
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,640
Actually, he didn't...

311
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,200
Alright, enough. I understand.

312
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,840
It's so hard for you to be around him.

313
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,000
No more nonsense.

314
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,960
Come here.

315
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,470
I hastily drew a map
of Beast City yesterday

316
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,880
so that we can escape.

317
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,470
[Royal Palace, Beast City]
I was worried about how to find you.

318
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,230
I didn't expect you to come today.

319
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,440
Let's have a good discussion.

320
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,710
You even drew a map?

321
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,400
Of course.

322
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,440
I'm afraid this map won't work.

323
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,710
Why?

324
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
I ran around the city.

325
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
I have a little understanding

326
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,790
of the roads and defenses in the city.

327
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,030
You should try to learn more.

328
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,280
And we can definitely leave here.

329
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,670
Your Grace.

330
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,550
Even if we escape the city,

331
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,440
we won't be able to escape the Beast Clan.

332
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,230
What do you mean?

333
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,790
I inquired about the news from Kui Mulang.

334
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,710
According to him, in Beast Clan,

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,840
no one can take us back to Daxia

336
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,710
except him.

337
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,640
Well...

338
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,150
What to do then?

339
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,110
Your Grace.

340
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,910
Why don't you try to
get on good terms with him?

341
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,840
If he feels that
you are in good faith with him,

342
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,000
maybe he will reveal

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,670
some useful information to us.

344
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,190
Are you asking me

345
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,560
to make friends with Kui Mulang,

346
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,640
so that we can find our way back to Daxia?

347
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,110
No way.

348
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,160
It's better for me not to see him.

349
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
I'd better avoid him.

350
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,560
You said you are not afraid of him.

351
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,070
I'm not.

352
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,400
But when I think of him taking me here,

353
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,800
I still feel a little apprehensive.

354
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,400
I don't think he's a bad guy.

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,070
You can try to get along with him.

356
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,950
Maybe you will find his advantages.

357
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,070
But you have been with Kui Mulang

358
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,040
for a few days.

359
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,760
Didn't you find any way

360
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,040
to return to Daxia?

361
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,640
Although I have been by his side these days,

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,190
he wants to marry you wholeheartedly.

363
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
So there is still a difference
between you and me.

364
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,470
He is definitely closer to you.

365
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,640
Closer?

366
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,800
Looks like it's up to me to do it myself.

367
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,280
As long as I get him done,

368
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,920
we can go back to Daxia.

369
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,920
Didn't you have breakfast?

370
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,190
I need meat in my meals.

371
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,160
I didn't expect Beast Clan to be vegetarian.

372
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,800

You'll know it later.

554
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,680

I can't handle Kui Mulang.

This is my ancestral skill.

Your Majesty.

00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,800
Sorry for that.

683
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,600
Nothing.

684
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,910
It's just that you are very bold
with Liu Jun

685
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,470
when you are drunk.

686
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,840
Mr. Liu Jun came?

687
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,950
Oh, no.

688
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,270
I didn't do anything weird, did I?

689
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,600
Easy.

690
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,640
You didn't do anything weird.

691
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,470
So cute.

692
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,080
Facing a hesitant man like Liu Jun,

693
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,470
you should strike hard.

694
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,080
What you did is nothing at all.

695
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,230
Mr. Liu Jun won't hate me, will he?

696
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,190
If he hates you, that's his problem.

697
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,470
Easy, alright.

698
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,910
I have an important task for you to do.

699
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,990
Please go ahead, Your Grace.

700
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,230
Next, I need armor.

701
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,600
Armor?

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,670
