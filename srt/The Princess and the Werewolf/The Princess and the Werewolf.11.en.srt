[Episode 11]

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,590
General Ma.

19
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,590
Why are these dirty clothes so heavy?

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,190
Look how tired these two soldiers are.

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,230
Good question.

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,310
I have always asked you to train more.

23
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,400
Look at you now.

24
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,720
So shameful.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,720
Can't you carry

26
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,360
such a light box?

27
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,440
General Ma.

28
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,030
Since everyone is tired,

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
how about letting them have a rest?

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,470
Rest in place.

31
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,080
Miss.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,110
Thank you so much.

33
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,960
Just stop here.

34
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,600
You still have to go back to patrolling.

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,880
Don't waste time.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
But...

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,030
Actually, I'd like to

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,520
relieve myself in the forest.

39
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,630
If you follow me there,

40
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,000
I will...

41
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,630
I will...

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
We are all girls.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,830
What are you afraid of?

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,800
You are not afraid, but I am.

45
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,830
I just want to be alone.

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,270
I don't want to be watched.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,750
Please, I am begging you.

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,390
Alright.

49
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,080
We are leaving then.

50
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,190
Can you make it alone?

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Of course.

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,720
Wait.

53
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,470
What's wrong?

54
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,270
Can you really manage it?

55
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,720
Sure.

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Be careful.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,440
What a familiar smell.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,830
Sorry, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,800
I failed to hold on.

60
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,190
Never mind.

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,830
I'm used to it.

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,390
Where is Her Grace?

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,030
Hand her over.

64
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,080
Her Grace?

65
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,390
The person in the box was meant to be Her Grace?

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,670
Why didn't Your Majesty say it
when you gave me the task?

67
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,600
I promised to take you back.

68
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,320
I will keep my promise.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,480
But I never said that I would send Her Grace back.

70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,000
How insidious and cunning!

71
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,070
I will fight it out with you!

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,790
A hero will never

73
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,160
hurt others by hidden weapons!

74
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,510
The life of Her Grace is at stake.

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,440
I have to do this.

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,920
Give us back Her Grace.

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,110
Otherwise I won't be leaving.

78
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,040
You wish!

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,550
Her Grace won't go back with you.

80
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,160
Leave by yourself or

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
stay here as prisoners.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,110
Report!

83
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,230
Your Majesty, something's up.

84
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,510
News came from the palace

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
that the queen-to-be is missing.

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,040
What?

87
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Why did you wake up so soon?

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,640
Who are you? Where is Ma Yingxiong?

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,640
Help!

90
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,160
Are you okay?

91
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,110
Kui Mulang?

92
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,160
How do you know I'm here?

93
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,670
Be careful!

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,390
Are you okay?

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,790
Kui Mulang! Kui Mulang!

96
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,040
Your Majesty!

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,350
Send him back to the palace.

98
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,110
Yes.

99
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880
[Fumeng Spring]

100
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,880
You failed?

101
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
I am incompetent.

102
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,320
You really are.

103
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,110
Please spare my life, My Lord.

104
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,790
These three piercing needles are your punishment.

105
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,270
If it happened again,

106
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,830
I wouldn't keep you alive.

107
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,510
Yes, Master.

108
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,230
Did Kui Mulang hurt you?

109
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,790
I didn't expect him to have such power

110
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,110
after being hit by Debilitating Powder.

111
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,160
It seems that the opportunity

112
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,270
destined for me has not yet arrived.

113
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,790
If He was here,

114
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,920
she would be of great help to me.

115
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,640
Why did His Majesty

116
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,270
get hit by Debilitating Powder?

117
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,040
Also,

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Hu Die came back with Ma Yingxiong and the others,

119
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,110
and said that he was going to harm His Majesty.

120
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,720
She got elders involved.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,350
What happened?

122
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,640
Let's talk about this later.

123
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,840
The elders are out?

124
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,710
Exactly.

125
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,470
It happened just after they were out,

126
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,590
so they are very angry.

127
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,520
Okay, I see.

128
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,280
Go to guard the palace gate now.

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,640
I'm going to check how His Majesty is doing.

130
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,670
Okay.

131
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,790
That's the whole plan.

132
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,590
He asked someone to hand over
the Debilitating Powder to Ma Yingxiong,

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,150
and then arranged for someone to kill Qi Pa quietly.

134
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,440
He tried to kill two birds with one stone.

135
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,520
But it failed.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,280
All the men he sent

137
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,590
were seriously injured by Kui Mulang.

138
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,350
How could that subordinate

139
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,710
be so incompetent

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
that let Kui Mulang escape again?

141
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,230
I have no idea.

142
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,910
But every time I connect with

143
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,790
a woman named Xiniang.

144
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,000
But I don't know

145
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
who exactly did it.

146
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,520
I will never allow

147
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,760
this kind of waste

148
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,230
to be by my side.

149
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,960
Today the elders went out.

150
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,670
And Hu Die brought Ma Yingxiong back

151
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,280
and sent him directly to the Elders' Court.

152
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,280
Check the situation there.

153
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,470
Yes.

154
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,710
Qi Pa!

155
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,790
Qi Pa!

156
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,840
Qi Pa!

157
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,470
Your Majesty.

158
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
Where is Qi Pa? How is she?

159
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,710
I have already sent her back to the chamber

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,470
and asked the imperial physician to check.

161
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
She's fine.

162
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,710
Now Hongxiu is taking care of her.

163
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,670
I simply asked Her Grace.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
But the assassin was masked,

165
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,790
so she didn't see who it was.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,760
But that woman was dressed as a maid.

167
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,470
Dressed as a maid?

168
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm afraid it has something to do with
the one who failed in the last assassination.

169
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,150
Quite possible.

170
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,110
By the way, Your Majesty,

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,710
Look at this.

172
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,910
What's this?

173
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,440
This is the bottle of the drug from Ma Yingxiong.

174
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,920
After being poisoned, I realized that

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,590
Ma Yingxiong was not

176
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,750
using the ordinary overpowering drug,

177
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
but Debilitating Powder.

178
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,680
This drug should have been banned for many years,

179
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,360
and it is a strong drug unique to Beast Clan.

180
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,040
How could Ma Yingxiong have it?

181
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,120
It must be someone from Beast Clan who gave it to him.

182
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Ma Yingxiong is from Daxia.

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
How could he have colluded
with anyone in Beast Clan?

184
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Someone must have bought him.

185
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,880
Otherwise, it is impossible for Qi Pa
to be held hostage.

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,710
I'm afraid this has something to do
with the murderer

187
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,480
who wanted to assassinate Qi Pa last time.

188
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Now the only person who can
solve the mystery is Ma Yingxiong.

189
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,000
Where is he now?

190
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
The three elders closed their retreat today.

191
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,830
Hu Die directly took Ma Yingxiong

192
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,950
to the Elders' Court.

193
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Look at her!

194
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,630
Go and check how Qi Pa is doing.

195
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,800
I'll fix it.

196
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,630
Yes.

197
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,120
Your Grace.

198
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,190
Where were you before?

199
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,240
You smelled so bad when you came back.

200
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm not clean anymore.

201
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,480
I didn't mean that.

202
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,920
You've already taken a bath.

203
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
You are not as smelly as before.

204
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,710
By the way, Hongxiu,

205
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,710
did you see Mr. Li today?

206
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
No.

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
Why are you looking for him?

208
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,150
Nothing.

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,000
Your Grace.

210
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,440
Liu Jun is coming.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mr. Liu Jun, come in.

212
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,590
Your Grace.

213
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,710
Hold on.

214
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,710
Take this.

215
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,830
Hongxiu.

216
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,240
At least wait until I'm done throwing up
before calling him in, okay?

217
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,360
You don't take me seriously.

218
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,950
Mr. Liu Jun.

219
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
Check on her.

220
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,480
She kept throwing up.

221
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,800
Your Grace.

222
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,800
What happened to you?

223
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,190
This is a physiological response.

224
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,710
Your Grace.

225
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,710
Take some of this

226
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,480
for relief.

227
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,320
Then you won't want to throw up.

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,880
Thank you.

229
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,390
If you still want to throw up, take another one.

230
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,680
By the way, Liu Jun,

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,360
how is Kui Mulang?

232
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,590
Also, have Ma Yingxiong and the others

233
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,680
safely returned to Daxia?

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,950
I'm here to tell you

235
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,920
they might be in trouble.

236
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,590
What do you mean?

237
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,240
They might be in trouble.

238
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,440
[Elders' Hall]

239
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,480
Elders.

240
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,830
I have always been suspicious about the identity
of the Queen-to-be.

241
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,710
She behaves strangely and perversely.

242
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,830
She has bewitched His Majesty many times,

243
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
making His Majesty repeatedly neglect
government affairs for her,

244
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,320
subvert the palace rules,

245
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,240
and even ignore the advice of loyal ministers.

246
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,950
Now people from her hometown

247
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,710
even wanted to attack His Majesty.

248
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,950
They do have wild ambition

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,710
to overthrow Beast Clan.

250
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,390
Nonsense.

251
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,950
I didn't want to overthrow your clan.

252
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,150
I just wanted to take Her Grace back to Daxia.

253
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,390
She doesn't want to be in your wild place.

254
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,360
Shut up.

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,950
I...

256
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,590
You attacked His Majesty.

257
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,070
According to the law of Beast Clan,

258
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,150
you will be executed.

259
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,190
What right have you to condemn me?

260
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,480
How dare a small barbaric country sanction me?

261
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
You're so disrespectful to the Beast Clan
even when you're dying.

262
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,150
You are new here alone,

263
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
if you had no one on the inside,

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,800
you wouldn't have been able to hurt His Majesty.

265
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,830
If I am right,

266
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,070
your helper should be from the palace.

267
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,390
Elders.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
I am on duty today.

269
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,710
More than a dozen people went out of the palace.

270
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,240
But Haonan told me that

271
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,710
only Chun'er went outside the city,

272
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,710
and even went to the forest.

273
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,240
That being the case,

274
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,880
Commander Bai, go with the deputy commander
to the Imperial Kitchen

275
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,270
to carefully interrogate the maid Chun'er.

276
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,510
Yes.

277
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,190
This... I...

278
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,510
You intended to assassinate His Majesty.

279
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,750
According to the law of Beast Clan,

280
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,150
you should be beheaded.

281
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,270
I am Ma Yingxiong, the number one fighter in Daxia.

282
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,710
If you dare to hurt me,

283
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,950
I will make Daxia crush the Beast Clan.

284
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,880
How dare you!

285
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Take him away.

286
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,480
Wait.

287
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,510
Greetings to Your Majesty.

288
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,190
Congratulations to the three elders
for closing the retreat.

289
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,120
However, there may be some misunderstandings

290
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,750
in today's matter.

291
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:21,800
This person...

292
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,390
Elders.

293
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,800
Your Grace.

294
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,950
Are you the legendary Queen-to-be?

295
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,150
You really don't follow the rules.

296
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,510
Your Grace.

297
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm relieved that you're fine.

298
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
A real man is not afraid of death.

299
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,630
Kill me if you want.

300
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,320
Ma Yingxiong.

301
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,360
Elders.

302
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes.

303
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,360
Calm down.

304
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,070
Otherwise even I can't keep you.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
I know.

306
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,190
As I see,

307
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,920
the Queen-to-be is bad-mannered

308
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,390
and still needs to learn a lot.

309
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,270
Your wedding should be

310
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,390
given further thought.

311
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,960
It is an unforgivable crime for Her Grace's men

312
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,350
to stab His Majesty.

313
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,990
Immediate execution.

314
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,350
You can kill me.

315
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,960
But let go of Her Grace first.

316
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,320
How dare you!

317
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,470
Get him out of here.

318
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,600
Hold on.

319
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,320
This... Your Grace.

320
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,440
What's wrong?

321
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Is the Queen-to-be

322
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,990
in poor health?

323
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,920
Look at her...

324
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,680
Could it be that...?

325
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,150
She is pregnant!

326
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,990
The royal heir is a major event
for the royal family.

327
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,750
If the Queen-to-be is really pregnant,

328
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,320
it may damage the well-being of the royal family.

329
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
The jury is still out on the matter.

330
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,720
Let's talk about it later.

331
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
Elders, you got us wrong.

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,200
Actually, we...

333
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,720
Yes.

334
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,960
Right, I am indeed...

335
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,840
pregnant.

336
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,150
This...

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,680
Your Majesty.

338
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,200
You will be a father soon.

339
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,680
Elders.

340
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,990
We are indeed a de facto couple.

341
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,510
The Queen has been pregnant for more than a month.

342
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,350
That's why I'm so anxious to get married.

343
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,750
Now that I can no longer hide this today,

344
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I will make it clear.

345
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,720
It may be not good

346
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,840
to kill a life rashly now.

347
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,200
Elders,

348
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,350
please show mercy.

349
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,350
His Majesty has not been married for many years

350
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,560
and has no heirs.

351
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,230
Now there is not only a Queen-to be,

352
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,750
but also a royal heir.

353
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,150
The royal heir is top priority.

354
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,600
But we still need to

355
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,440
discuss this matter.

356
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,470
What about the one from my hometown?

357
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,150
For the sake of the royal heir,

358
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,230
put him in prison first.

359
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,510
Let's make a decision later.

360
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,990
Wait, Your Grace.

361
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,470
Take him down and put him in jail.

362
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,040
Your Grace.

363
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,150
You have to rest well
after returning to the palace.

364
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,750
No running around.

365
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,630
After all, the royal heir needs rest.

366
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,110
Qi Pa is pregnant?

367
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,920
I didn't expect that there is true love
between His Majesty and the Queen.

368
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,350
Qi Pa has always wanted to leave Kui Mulang.

369
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,630
How could she be pregnant?

370
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,840
His Majesty treats the Queen so well.

371
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,470
Anyone

372
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,390
would be touched.

373
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,040
I am not asking you.

374
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,560
Even if Qi Pa is really pregnant,

375
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,750
it won't change anything.

376
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,630
One day, I will ascend the throne

377
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,840
and achieve supremacy.

378
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,750
I'm looking forward to that day.

379
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,720
You have always been loyal to me.

380
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,630
When that day comes,

381
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,720
I will definitely reward you.

382
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,040
People with earthworm bloodline
are born to be physically weak

383
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,390
and never amount to much.

384
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,230
What I can do for you is

385
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,080
to do my best to

386
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
help you accomplish your great cause.

387
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,750
Go and notify that person immediately.

388
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,870
This time we failed.

389
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,800
And now the palace is strictly on guard.

390
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,390
Let's stop for a while.

391
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,150
Let me think about other things.

392
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,750
Yes.

393
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,630
Unexpectedly,

394
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,840
three such troublesome old men

395
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
appeared in Beast Clan.

396
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,040
I mean three respected elders.

397
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,720
They even have

398
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,350
the power to kill someone.

399
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,800
Can't even you stop them?

400
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,840
The authority of the elders is above me.

401
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,960
It's just that they are usually in retreat,

402
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,600
not managing the Beast Clan's affairs.

403
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,440
It's hard even for me

404
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,040
to weigh in today's situation.

405
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,560
Qi Pa.

406
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,350
I didn't expect you to do this.

407
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,920
What?

408
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,350
You mean the pregnancy?

409
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Don't get me wrong.

410
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,870
I did this

411
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,040
to save Ma Yingxiong and the others.

412
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,470
On a whim of mine,

413
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,200
you brought them here.

414
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,040
I absolutely cannot let them get hurt.

415
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,630
Actually it's my fault.

416
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,840
No.

417
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,870
It's my fault.

418
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,630
And you saved me today.

419
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
You also saved me.

420
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,320
In the most dangerous moment,

421
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,510
you stood in front of me.

422
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,840
Don't be moved by this.

423
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,750
I have always been

424
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,150
chivalrous and courageous.

425
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,960
My body is faster than my brain.

426
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,870
But Liu Jun said that

427
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,040
You got attacked by Ma Yingxiong and the others.

428
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Ma Yingxiong obtained the Beast Clan's
banned drug Debilitating Powder

429
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,840
in a certain way.

430
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,040
That's to say,

431
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,840
in addition to my escape plan tonight,

432
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,390
another group of people was set to reap benefits,

433
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,110
and even used Ma Yingxiong to attack you

434
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
and hurt us?

435
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,920
But how did you know

436
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,230
about my escape plan?

437
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
I

438
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,870
told Liu Jun

439
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,270
to keep an eye on your movements,

440
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,560
so I knew about your plan.

441
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,510
Are you sure it's Liu Jun?

442
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,390
Who else could it be?

443
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,960
Nothing.

444
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,560
Where is Li Xiong?

445
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,840
Li Xiong?

446
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,720
Now that I knew your plan,

447
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
how could I let him go?

448
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,440
I forced him.

449
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,390
He was forced to do it.

450
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,680
Qi Pa.

451
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
I've been meaning to ask you.

452
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,560
Why is Li Xiong so special to you?

453
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,800
We are just congenial.

454
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,680
What about me?

455
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,960
I don't want to lie to you.

456
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,040
Although you have treated me well

457
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,150
and saved me many times,

458
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,470
and I am very grateful to you,

459
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,720
I do not

460
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,510
like you.

461
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,720
I just can't understand

462
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,920
why you insist on marrying me.

463
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,680
But such being the case,

464
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,470
I will agree to marry you

465
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,630
and continue to pretend to be pregnant.

466
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,630
Ma Yingxiong and the others
are now in prison.

467
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,750
I want your help to get them out.

468
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,350
You want to make a deal with me?

469
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,350
Yes.

470
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,510
Nothing is more important than human lives.

471
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,040
Okay, that's a deal.

472
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,840
Also,

473
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,680
I want you to promise me three things.

474
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,320
Say it.

475
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,720
One,

476
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,390
after we get married,

477
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,680
you have to release Li Xiong, Ma Yingxiong
and the others

478
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,110
and send them back to Daxia safely.

479
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,750
Okay.

480
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,230
But I have to interrogate Ma Yingxiong first

481
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,960
to know the manipulator behind him.

482
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,870
Okay.

483
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,990
I also want to dig it out.

484
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,470
Two,

485
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,470
it's just a formal marriage,

486
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,350
not a real one.

487
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,510
Okay.

488
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,350
Three,

489
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,560
in three months,

490
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,630
if I still don't like you,

491
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,230
you will set me free.

492
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,200
You...

493
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,150
Don't you want my heart?

494
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,720
I can try to know you.

495
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,990
But when the deadline is up,

496
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,320
and I still don't have feelings for you,

497
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,840
you can't force me.

498
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,270
Okay.

499
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,200
I promise you.

500
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,680
Okay, deal.

501
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,320
Deal.

502
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,680
Shall we go to see

503
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,990
Ma Yingxiong now?

504
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,470
Okay.

505
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,840
Sure.

506
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,600
I won't eat any of your food

507
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,470
even if I'm starving to death.

508
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,080
I don't understand

509
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,080
why you are so prejudiced against us.

510
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,630
I have the right to remain silent.

511
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,990
Mr. Liu.

512
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,440
You've spent the night with me here.

513
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,150
I won't say anything.

514
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,600
Please go back.

515
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,320
That being the case,

516
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,350
I will take the food away.

517
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,320
I...

518
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,200
How long will Kui Mulang imprison me?

519
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,990
I am the general of Daxia.

520
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,560
I'm not hungry.

521
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,270
I will never eat anything from the enemy.

522
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,560
This is the integrity of Daxia's men.

523
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:53,960
Your Grace.

524
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,560
Your Grace.

525
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,720
I thought I would never see you again.

526
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,840
They abused you?

527
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,230
They didn't give you anything to eat?

528
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,040
How could they treat us Daxia people like this?

529
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,230
As far as I know,

530
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
General Ma was treated well,

531
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,470
but he himself refused.

532
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,230
How do I know

533
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,630
if you have poisoned my food?

534
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,150
I've always been cautious when I'm out.

535
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,230
They can't do anything to me.

536
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,960
They can only

537
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,960
torture me mentally.

538
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,750
Your Grace, don't worry.

539
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,390
I will remain resolute

540
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,150
and I won't insult the reputation of Daxia.

541
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,230
Otherwise,

542
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,600
I would kill myself to serve the country.

543
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,440
I...

544
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,200
Come on, we can't even fend for ourselves.

545
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,110
Don't think about serving the country.

546
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,560
Enough.

547
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,630
Let me ask you.

548
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,080
Where did you get the Debilitating Powder?

549
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,470
It's not from Daxia.

550
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,470
Everyone has a secret.

551
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,110
Your Grace.

552
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Allow me to have my own secrets.

553
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
You even keep it a secret from me?

554
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,720
Do you know that I was almost killed that day?

555
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,600
This...

556
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,750
I only knew that Kui Mulang switched the boxes.

557
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
When we carried the box to the forest,

558
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,720
we found that the box

559
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,200
contained a female commander

560
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,230
named Hu Die.

561
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,680
That's when I found that you were switched.

562
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,200
I wanted to look for you.

563
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,680
But I was subdued by them.

564
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,200
Did they do anything to you

565
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,470
after they switched you?

566
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,230
No.

567
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,600
The person must have used
a powerful knockout powder on me.

568
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,960
I didn't remember anything

569
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,150
when I woke up in the forest,

570
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,680
including her face.

571
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,150
I screwed it up.

572
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,600
So you should tell me the truth.

573
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,630
I'm the princess of Daxia.

574
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,600
Is there anything about you that I cannot know?

575
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
As a real man,

576
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,960
I shouldn't reveal something to the outsiders.

577
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,080
You!

578
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,270
Your Majesty.

579
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,270
Queen-to-be.

580
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,150
Chun'er, a maid of the Imperial Kitchen,
has disappeared.

581
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,750
The guards who were attacked

582
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,470
didn't see clearly who attacked them.

583
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
But according to the time when Haonan saw Chun'er,

584
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,040
it should be her.

585
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,230
Chun'er?

586
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
It's Chun'er, right?

587
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
How dare you

588
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,750
not even listen to me?

589
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,510
Your Grace, punish me.

590
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,200
I will accept it.

591
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,870
You!

592
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,560
Liu Jun.

593
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,150
Why are you looking at me?

594
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,470
What do you think?

595
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,230
Ma Yingxiong is really...

596
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,080
I don't think Ma Yingxiong

597
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,230
will tell you anything for now.

598
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,600
Take your time.

599
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,200
According to what I know about Ma Yingxiong,

600
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,350
he is not good at keeping secrets.

601
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
It seems to be complicated.

602
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,320
What are you going to do?

603
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
Conciliation.

604
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,110
Okay.

605
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,560
He's your people.

606
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,990
I will leave him to you.

607
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
[Yaohua Palace]

608
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,440
Your Grace.

609
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,270
Your Grace.

610
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,990
Why aren't you up yet?

611
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,440
It's time for breakfast.

612
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,150
You are now pregnant.

613
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,600
Eating breakfast is good for your health.

614
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,720
How did I suddenly become a wife

615
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,270
and a mother?

616
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,720
Everything needs a process of adaptation.

617
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,270
Isn't getting married and having children

618
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,270
the happiest thing for women?

619
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,080
Who

620
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,870
told you that?

621
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,440
I'm not happy.

622
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,600
Your Grace.

623
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,200
You are not used to it yet.

624
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,150
You'll be fine later on.

625
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,320
No.

626
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,990
I will never admit defeat.

627
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,080
Your Grace.

628
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,150
Where are you going without breakfast?

629
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,440
I want to find out

630
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,230
who gave Ma Yingxiong the Debilitating Powder.

631
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,150
I failed to escape because of that person.

632
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,230
I believe I can check it out.

633
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,510
It seems that Qi Pa

634
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,230
was almost assassinated

635
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,680
because of the missing maid Chun'er.

636
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,630
When did Chun'er enter the palace?

637
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,110
Has she ever shown
her martial arts in front of others?

638
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,440
Chun'er has been in the palace since she was 15.

639
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,200
I haven't heard of

640
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,320
any other strengths in her

641
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,870
other than being gossipy.

642
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,870
It is impossible for her to

643
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,200
have a banned drug like Debilitating Powder.

644
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,390
Could it be the one with chameleon bloodline?

645
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,270
Stewardess Qing was burned to death back then.

646
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,560
When I saw the charred face of the corpse

647
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,390
and couldn't confirm its identity,
I felt strange.

648
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,600
Maybe she didn't die,

649
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
and this time she pretended to be Chun'er.

650
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,720
That chameleon impersonates someone else every time.

651
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,390
We don't even know

652
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,720
her true face yet.

653
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,600
Now Chun'er is missing.

654
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,680
All of this is just speculation.

655
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,680
The top priority is to find Chun'er first.

656
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,990
I have asked Bai Ke and Hu Die
to search for her with all their strength.

657
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,470
Say it directly.

658
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,110
Then I will get to the point.

659
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:03,990
Your Majesty.

660
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,680
How could you promise the Queen-to-be

661
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
a three-month period?

662
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,720
If she doesn't fall in love with you
within three months

663
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,510
and you don't get the kiss of true love,

664
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,200
the Holy Pearl...

665
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,350
Within three months, I will change her mind.

666
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,080
She's been here for a long time.

667
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,350
Did you make it?

668
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,350
Sorry for that.

669
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,990
But your internal force is depleted day by day,

670
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,680
and the water in the spring is gradually drying up.

671
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,720
It is really imminent to get the Holy Pearl.

672
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,990
Your Majesty, what are you...?

673
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,350
Enough!

674
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,750
I kidnapped her

675
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,350
and she was forced to declare that
she was pregnant,

676
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,560
which is already hard for her.

677
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,800
If I continue to push her hard,

678
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,720
how can she give me her heart?

679
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,470
Three months is my deadline.

680
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,110
Within this,

681
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,750
if I still can't make her fall in love with me

682
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,270
I won't force her anymore.

683
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,720
Your Majesty,

684
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,320
are you giving up your life
and the future of Beast Clan

685
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
for Her Grace?

686
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,390
It turns out that when you
fall in love with someone,

687
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,270
you are afraid that she will be hurt,

688
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,680
suffer grievance,

689
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,120
or be sad.

690
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,640
Kui Mulang.

691
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,430
Kui Mulang, I am coming in.

692
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,990
But

693
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,990
the one who makes her hurt, suffer and sad

694
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,230
is me myself.

695
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,600
Kui Mulang, it's me.

696
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,750
What's up?

697
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,120
I thought about it.

698
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,990
Chun'er is cute and innocent,

699
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,190
and she doesn't know martial arts at all,

700
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,600
so how could she suddenly attack me?

701
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,640
Could the murderer

702
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,710
be the same person
who impersonated me last time?

703
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,510
She disguised as Chun'er this time.

704
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,800
Your Grace, you are so smart.

705
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,840
You two are on the same page.

706
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,230
Do you also think so?

707
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,430
Great.

708
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,040
So Ma Yingxiong and Chun'er

709
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,750
have been cleared of suspicion?

710
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,190
This is just our speculation.

711
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,470
Before there is any real evidence,

712
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,430
they still cannot be cleared of suspicion.

713
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,560
But Ma Yingxiong has the most contact
with the fake Chun'er.

714
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,710
If he is willing to disclose more details,

715
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,400
it may be possible to prove his innocence
as soon as possible.

716
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,470
No problem. Leave it to me.

717
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,400
I will let him tell the whole story.

718
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,990
Your Grace.

719
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,470
You must be hungry. Eat now.

720
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,670
Take your time.

721
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,710
Otherwise, you will choke to death
before you starve to death.

722
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,320
Thank you, Your Grace.

723
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,230
Look at you.

724
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,120
You are so stubborn.

725
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,120
Why sacrifice your own health?

726
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,270
Your Grace.

727
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,430
This is the integrity of Daxia's men.

728
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,670
But using Debilitating Powder

729
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,800
is not something a hero should do.

730
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,270
It's my fault.

731
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,230
I'm going to kill myself.

732
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,640
Enough, just

733
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,800
tell me the truth.

734
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,270
I will fix it for you.

735
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,950
Do you want me to

736
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,880
watch you die here?

737
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,510
Ma Yingxiong.

738
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,400
What about your faithful belief in me?

739
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,800
I almost got killed.

740
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,710
Now I can only choose to marry Kui Mulang.

741
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,040
Don't you want to tell me anything?

742
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,750
Your Grace, wait here.

743
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,950
I'm going to find Kui Mulang

744
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,040
to force him to send us home.

745
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,510
Come back.

746
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,950
Come back.

747
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,190
Calm down.

748
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,040
Making a scene
can't solve the problem at all.

749
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,880
You better listen to me.

750
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,360
If I listen to you,

751
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,270
you don't have to marry Kui Mulang?

752
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,080
Why so much nonsense?

753
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,430
The thing is very tricky now.

754
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,040
To tell you the truth,

755
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,840
we suspect that the Chun'er
you met that day

756
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,430
was not the real Chun'er,

757
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
but someone disguised as her.

758
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,190
How come?

759
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,910
Now Kui Mulang

760
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,880
has sent someone to look for the real Chun'er

761
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,040
to clear you of the crime.

762
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,320
For her good,

763
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,880
tell me the truth.

764
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,600
Okay.

765
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,990
Here is the thing.

766
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,360
When I first met Chun'er,

767
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,910
she accidentally tripped

768
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,270
as soon as she entered the door.

769
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,710
Seeing that she was tripped,

770
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,710
I went to help her.

771
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,990
That's it.

772
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,230
It's totally true.

773
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,640
You mean Chun'er

774
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,560
seduced you?

775
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,840
No, absolutely not.

776
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,950
She's just...

777
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,320
Just...

778
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,160
Just want?

779
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,910
I said that she is not the real Chun'er.

780
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,160
Why did she do this?

781
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,470
What good would it do her
to deceive my affections?

782
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,360
I understand.

783
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,080
I understand, Your Grace.

784
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,270
What did you understand?

785
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,320
Your Grace.

786
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
When Ms. Chun'er met me for the first time,

787
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
she was indifferent to me.

788
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,950
But then

789
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,600
she treated me
in the exact opposite way.

790
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,510
Could it be that I was really deceived
by the villain

791
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,160
and mistrusted her words?

792
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,270
It's a good thing you can analyze rationally.

793
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,230
Let's clear your name immediately.

794
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,750
In this case,

795
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,910
we and Zimei

796
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,910
will have a chance to
successfully escape from here.

797
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,840
Zimei?

798
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
It's Li Xiong.

799
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,600
During my days in Beast Clan,
he has been protecting me,

800
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,910
enlightening me

801
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,040
and chatting with me.

802
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I promised him that

803
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,470
I would go home with him.

804
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,360
Your Grace.

805
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,880
I didn't get you.

806
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,430
Zimei has been in Daxia Palace all the time.

807
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,560
He's been in Daxia Palace all the time?

808
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,160
Yeah.

809
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,840
When you were missing last time,

810
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,800
someone attacked Zimei

811
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,470
and he even lost his badge.

812
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,800
He lost his badge?

813
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,360
