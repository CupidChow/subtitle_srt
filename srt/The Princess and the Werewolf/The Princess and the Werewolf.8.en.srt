376
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,160
Let's join them.

377
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,560
Come on.

378
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Pretend to kiss me.

379
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,400
No way.

380
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,160
If Her Grace goes on like this,
something serious will happen.

381
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,590
Let's go.

382
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,280
Your Majesty.

383
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,350
What to do?

384
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,640
Everyone in the palace is talking
about Her Grace and Mr. Li.

385
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,680
I know.

386
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,920
After all I am the protagonist.

387
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,470
What about the marriage?

388
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,470
Pass my order.

389
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,920
Let everyone get prepared.

390
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,070
The wedding will be brought forward
three days later.

391
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,310
If it goes on like this,

392
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm afraid Qi Pa will come up
with more ways to break off the engagement.

393
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,950
I'd better make it quick

394
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,590
to avoid further trouble.

395
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,830
Your Majesty, you are wise.

396
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm on it.

397
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,830
Although I feel a little sorry for Qi Pa like this,

398
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,070
I think

399
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,760
she will understand me one day.

400
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,280
Unexpectedly, Li Xiong is quite good at acting.

401
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,880
He acted like it was real.

402
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,040
Your Grace.

403
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,160
How is it?

404
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,830
Is Kui Mulang very angry

405
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,880
and ready to condemn me?

406
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,520
His Majesty just said to
bring forward the wedding date.

407
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,830
You will get married in three days.

408
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,560
What?

409
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,310
How could he not be angry?

410
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,590
He's cuckolded!

411
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,680
But he usually

412
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,040
wears a black hood.

413
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,950
Kui Mulang isn't like a man!

414
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,310
It seems that I have encountered a tough opponent.

415
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000
Your Grace,

416
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,710
I wish you could meet me in the Imperial Garden.

417
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
Jing Muhan.

418
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,680
Looks like I can only clutch at a straw.

419
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,350
Jing Muhan.

420
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,160
Our plan has failed.

421
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,400
It didn't work at all.

422
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,430
He's

423
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,350
not jealous

424
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,880
at all.

425
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,310
I asked you here today

426
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,230
to give you another advice.

427
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,800
Since we are going to cooperate,

428
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,310
we have to be honest with each other.

429
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,400
To tell you the truth,

430
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,880
the woman thing you mentioned

431
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,000
never happened between me and Kui Mulang.

432
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,800
I just don't think

433
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,640
he deserves to sit on the throne.

434
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,230
I won't let him get

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,760
whatever he wants.

436
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,160
Since he has made up his mind to marry you,

437
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,800
I won't let him have his wishes fulfilled.

438
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,430
Love begets hate.

439
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,070
What about you?

440
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,230
Are you willing to be honest?

441
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,400
I...

442
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,470
What do you want to know?

443
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,560
Why does Kui Mulang insist on marrying you?

444
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,950
Good question.

445
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,040
Probably because of my good looks.

446
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,880
Then why don't you marry him?

447
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm not one of your Beast Clan.

448
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,160
My hometown is called Daxia.

449
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,400
You wouldn't know it.

450
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,430
Anyway, I was captured

451
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,230
by Kui Mulang.

452
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't want to marry him at all.

453
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,230
I just want to go home.

454
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,040
But only he knows my way home.

455
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,000
That being the case,

456
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,880
our alliance is reached.

457
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm in charge of breaking off the engagement

458
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,760
and finding a way to send you home, okay?

459
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,350
Seriously?

460
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,040
Yes.

461
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,430
Kui Mulang's dissatisfaction

462
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,040
is my wish.

463
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,830
It's up to you.

464
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,830
My inspiration has dried up.

465
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,710
There is really nothing I can do

466
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,040
to stop him from marrying me.

467
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,310
What's your plan?

468
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
I heard that Kui Mulang

469
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,760
brought specialties from your hometown.

470
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,230
How about we make it harder for him?

471
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,400
You mean...?

472
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,710
How about having him bring someone?

473
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,110
Good idea.

474
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,310
Kui Mulang.

475
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,520
Here you are.

476
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,280
It seems that you already know

477
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,760
about the wedding in three days.

478
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,800
I didn't say yes.

479
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,880
Qi Pa.

480
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,350
I have fulfilled

481
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,160
all your requests one by one.

482
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,470
What else do you want?

483
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,470
Both Durian and David are items.

484
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,760
I'm here alone.

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,920
I haven't seen my family for a long time.

486
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,950
You want to see your family?

487
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,710
Not necessarily family.

488
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,160
Just relatives and friends

489
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,400
who can relieve my homesickness.

490
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,280
Approved.

491
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
I have to make it harder.

492
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,680
What if I want to see them tomorrow?

493
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,430
No problem.

494
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,400
Really?

495
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,310
My words count.

496
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,950
I will wait for your good news.

497
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,950
Your Majesty.

498
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,070
I know you are eager to marry the princess.

499
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,040
But the less people know

500
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,400
about the existence of enchantment, the better.

501
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,760
Otherwise, the consequences will be disastrous.

502
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,590
I have thought of a countermeasure.

503
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,920
As long as it makes Qi Pa happy,

504
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,920
everything will do.

505
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,680
It seems that the storybook

506
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,430
has inspired you a lot.

507
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
The secret to falling in love

508
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,760
is to make Her Grace happy.

509
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,070
It's not the storybook.

510
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
Not the storybook?

511
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,640
Is that what you want to do?

512
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,880
Leave me alone.

513
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,040
Your Royal Highness, why did you

514
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
come up with such an idea for the princess?

515
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,160
Do you really want to help her escape?

516
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,310
What does it matter to me?

517
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,350
All I care about is

518
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,760
where is Daxia

519
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
that Qi Pa mentioned,

520
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,280
and how Kui Mulang

521
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,680
can beat Qi Pa's trick.

522
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,640
Li Xiong. Li Xiong.

523
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Where has he been?

524
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,710
Li Xiong.

525
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,160
Li Xiong.

526
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,110
Are you calling me?

527
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,520
You scared me!

528
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,230
Why do you walk

529
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,640
without making a sound
like Kui Mulang?

530
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,590
What's up, Your Grace?

531
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,590
Let's talk privately.

532
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,000
Come here.

533
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,520
Hurry.

534
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,190
What happened?

535
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,760
Where is Kui Mulang?

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,590
His Majesty is meditating in the secret room.

537
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,800
Good.

538
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,950
Listen.

539
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,040
I asked Kui Mulang to pick up someone from Daxia.

540
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
And he agreed.

541
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,560
We can take this opportunity

542
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,310
to sneak a peek at how to get home.

543
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,800
Your Grace, you haven't given up yet?

544
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,830
Of course not.

545
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,640
As long as there is the slightest chance
of being able to go home,

546
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I will not let it go.

547
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,830
It turns out that

548
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,190
only Kui Mulang knows the way back to Daxia.

549
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,470
As long as we follow him,

550
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,830
we will surely succeed.

551
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,190
Your Grace, I'd be happy

552
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,640
if you could go back to Daxia.

553
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,600
But have you ever thought about

554
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,510
what to do if you run into an assassin again

555
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,350
after running away several times?

556
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,320
I have you with me.

557
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,720
That's true.

558
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,080
Your Grace.

559
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,840
If you have any plans in the future,

560
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,990
tell me immediately.

561
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,200
Don't worry.

562
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,630
I will tell you all my plans.

563
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,800
I'll run with you anyway.

564
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,600
Deal.

565
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,560
See you tonight at the stone lion
next to the side gate of the palace.

566
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,800
As soon as Kui Mulang leaves the palace,

567
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
let's quietly follow him.

568
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,870
See you tonight.

569
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,390
I'm leaving.

570
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,560
Okay.

571
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,200
The princess really has a lot of ideas.

572
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,200
Your Majesty, you are trying
to bring someone from Daxia here

573
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
to relieve her homesickness.

574
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,440
But she still wants to escape.

575
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,840
You must be very disappointed.

576
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,750
I was the one who forced her to stay here.

577
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,270
What right do I have to feel disappointed?

578
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,040
So what are you going to do tonight?

579
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,630
I've thought of a way.

580
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,200
Your Grace.

581
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,150
Your Grace.

582
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,870
Come out.

583
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,040
Your Grace.

584
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,150
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

585
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,150
General Ma.

586
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,800
Stop hiding, Your Grace.

587
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,920
Come out, Your Grace.

588
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,110
We've all been searching for so long.

589
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,960
I don't think Her Grace

590
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,200
is in this forest.

591
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,230
[Ma Yingxiong, General of Daxia]
This is the last forest.

592
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,510
If I still can't find Her Grace,

593
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,470
I will be ashamed to face His Majesty,

594
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,840
Her Majesty,

595
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,440
and

596
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,750
all her royal family,

597
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,680
Alright.

598
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,680
Let's keep searching.

599
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,680
Your Grace.

600
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,200
Your Grace.

601
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,720
Your Grace. Your Grace.

602
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,270
Li Xiong,

603
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,680
Where are you now?

604
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,750
Forget it. I will follow him first.

605
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,920
Kui Malang, good for you!

606
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,840
You are playing a trick.

607
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,200
Your Grace.

608
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,800
You can't find him like this.

609
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,510
Right.

610
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,270
Wait.

611
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,440
Jing Muhan?

612
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
You have been following me?

613
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,110
Haven't you been following Kui Mulang too?

614
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,990
Wait, you...

615
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,390
I can find him.

616
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,680
Are you sure?

617
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,750
Most of my bloodline is from my mother.

618
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,600
But I am Kui Mulang's younger brother after all.

619
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,720
I have part wolf bloodline,

620
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,080
so my night vision is very good.

621
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
Dayu?

622
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,750
Hold on.

623
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,230
Did Kui Mulang ask you to do it?

624
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,510
So you were the one I followed

625
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,920
after I left the palace?

626
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,470
Yes.

627
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,870
Your Grace, easy.

628
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,750
To be honest,

629
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,320
I don't know

630
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,560
why His Majesty made such an arrangement.

631
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
He just ordered us to circle the forest.

632
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,150
Circle?

633
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,960
Kui Mulang.

634
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,680
Good for you!

635
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,110
Your Majesty.

636
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,270
All goes well with the plan.

637
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,200
As expected,

638
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,560
Jing Muhan is behind all this.

639
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,510
Could it be that Jing Muhan has already discovered

640
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,750
the existence of the enchantment?

641
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,440
I don't think so.

642
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,470
According to what I know about Jing Muhan,

643
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,560
he is just curious about

644
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,840
why I will suddenly marry a woman of unknown origin.

645
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,390
If I don't find a way to stop the two of them now,

646
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,720
they will discover the existence
of the enchantment sooner or later.

647
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,270
Your Majesty, it's a good idea.

648
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,270
General Ma.

649
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,360
We have been looking for her

650
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,600
for so many days with durians.

651
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,430
When can we find Her Grace?

652
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,560
I will definitely find her.

653
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,120
If I can't find Princess Qi Pa,

654
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,120
I will kill myself.

655
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,320
I smelt this strange smell from afar.

656
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
It's this thing again.

657
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,430
I really don't understand

658
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,710
why Qi Pa likes to eat this kind of thing.

659
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,080
Since she likes it,

660
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,750
take it back as a dowry.

661
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,990
Okay.

662
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,800
We are lucky

663
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,670
to meet these people here.

664
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,470
We don't have to go to Daxia's Palace.

665
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,470
Bring

666
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,670
that person back.

667
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,400
He's acquainted with the princess.

668
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,080
Yes.

669
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,750
Hold on.

670
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,600
Bring all of them back.

671
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,120
The more people, the better.

672
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,710
Got it.

673
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,160
[Yaohua Palace]

674
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,880
Li Xiong.

675
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,310
Your Grace.

676
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,310
I couldn't make it there yesterday

677
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,510
because Kui Mulang

678
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,950
imprisoned me

679
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,080
after finding out my whereabouts.

680
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,470
I see.

681
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,200
Did you get hurt?

682
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,600
I'm fine, Your Grace.

683
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,920
Probably Kui Mulang

684
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,440
knows that we have been to the forest before.

685
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,710
So he was wary of you

686
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,310
and locked you up,

687
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,510
making it impossible for you to contact me.

688
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,790
Were you anxious?

689
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,400
Kui Mulang is so bad

690
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
that he played me like a fool.

691
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,030
I didn't expect him to be

692
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,550
more scheming than I imagined.

693
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,230
In fact, Kui Mulang has a message for you.

694
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,550
He said that today you can meet someone from Daxia.

695
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,270
Really?

696
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
Did he bring someone here?

697
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,270
Liu Jun.

698
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,750
His Majesty ordered

699
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,880
the two of you to inspect the border

700
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,710
of the forest carefully today.

701
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,990
Forest outside the city?

702
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,790
It's always been safe there.

703
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,120
What's His Majesty's plan?

704
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,990
He has his own consideration.

705
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,400
Let me go with you.

706
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,310
Please.

707
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,030
Deputy Commander, what's wrong with you?

708
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,840
I...

709
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,710
Eat less breakfast in the future.

710
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,710
You should go.

711
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,790
I'll take a look over there.

712
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,710
Hu Die, I will keep you company.

713
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,360
No need.

714
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,360
Liu Jun.

715
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,120
Let's go over there.

716
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,600
Wake up.

717
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,710
Wake up.

718
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,710
What happened?

719
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,270
Why are we all asleep?

720
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,710
I have no idea.

721
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,710
It seems that Her Grace is not in this forest.

722
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,600
How about this?

723
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,440
Let's go back to the palace first.

724
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,680
We will make a decision after reporting
to the His Majesty and Her Majesty.

725
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,640
What do you think?

726
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,230
This is not the place we passed by
before falling asleep.

727
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,990
Who's that?

728
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,200
Enemy attack!

729
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,640
Everyone, cover your mouth and nose.

730
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,470
Be careful.

731
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,310
So stinky.

732
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,920
This way. Let's go.

733
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,200
Yes.

734

So stinky.

735
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,310
