00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,190
Tell me.

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,800
Who's the woman that invited you to dance?

192
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,630
Oh, a blind date.

193
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,680
My parents arranged several blind dates

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,070
and she's one of them.

195
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,800
One of them?

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,950
Didn't you say

197
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,390
you would go home and reject them?

198
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,750
How could you eat your words?

199
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,750
Liar!

200
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,750
How do you know

201
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,070
I would reject them?

202
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,590
You eavesdropped.

203
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,750
I... I didn't.

204
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,040
Hu Die,

205
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,320
control yourself.

206
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,270
I...

207
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,560
Every time you get angry, you fart.

208
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,000
I...

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,560
I...

210
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,070
Calm down.

211
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,560
I'm wrong.

212
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,680
I'm wrong, all right?

213
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,480
What attitude is that?

214
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,920
I...

215
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,190
Hu Die!

216
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,560
Don't follow me.

217
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,440
But...

218
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,880
Did I do something wrong again?

219
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,590
- Nice.
- Nice.

220
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,390
Your Majesty,

221
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,830
this is Haitang, the master performer

222
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,560
I picked out from many girls

223
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,320
and trained in person.

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,710
Your Majesty, you must have seen

225
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,000
her wonderful dance.

226
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,480
Haitang, say greetings to His Majesty.

227
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,710
Greetings, Your Majesty.

228
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,120
I've been admiring you all the time.

229
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,440
Gratefully, Her Highness cultivated me.

230
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,270
Hope I can

231
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,590
stay by your side and take care of you.

232
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,190
I appreciate it, my queen.

233
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,150
But I don't need to be taken care of.

234
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,510
Your Majesty,

235
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,680
Haitang is a beautiful girl.

236
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,880
She can sing and dance

237
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,950
and do all kinds of arts.

238
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
Moreover, she's the best graduate

239
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,510
of my Performance Class.

240
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,630
She admires you, too.

241
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,040
How about you think about it?

242
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,190
All right.

243
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,630
My queen and I have a business to talk about.

244
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,320
You may leave us.

245
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,800
- Aye.
- Aye.

246
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,880
Your Majesty, I know you're too shy

247
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,950
to say this in front of everyone.

248
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,480
I get it. I do.

249
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
You don't.

250
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,190
I just didn't want to embarrass you

251
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,710
in front of everyone.

252
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,000
I never agreed with your Performance Class.

253
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,590
So, I won't take her with me.

254
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,360
Kui Mulang,

255
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,070
You must not look closely,

256
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,360
take a good look at Miss Haitang.

257
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,480
Look at her beautiful face,

258
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,320
her sexy body,

259
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,000
and her perfect profile.

260
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,240
A wonderful girl.

261
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,390
My queen,

262
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,750
did you recruit so many girls

263
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,240
just to pick her out for me?

264
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,270
Let me say it one last time.

265
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,510
I won't take her.

266
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,590
Kui...

267
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,750
Your Majesty,

268
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,880
please help me.

269
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,190
I've lived a wretched life.

270
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,000
When I was little, I got lost with my family.

271
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,390
Some villains sold me
to an illegal music house.

272
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,120
Instructing ladies

273
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,710
always cursed me and beat me.

274
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,320
Every time they were upset,
they tortured me.

275
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,440
I have bruises all up my back.

276
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
I was really desperate.

277
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,440
When I happened to see
the notice Her Highness issued,

278
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,840
I ran away and came all the way here.

279
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,600
I'm begging you, Your Majesty.

280
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,750
Please let me stay.

281
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,720
Don't expel me.

282
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,350
Or I would die.

283
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,230
Miss Haitang.

284
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,040
Get up. Come on.

285
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,600
I didn't know you had

286
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,680
such a miserable past.

287
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,880
His Majesty is always benevolent.

288
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,760
Since you suffered this much,

289
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,190
His Majesty will keep you.

290
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,560
Am I right, Your Majesty?

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,640
Your Majesty,

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,310
when I was living in purgatory,

293
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,000
I heard a lot about you, Your Majesty.

294
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,070
You're my moral support.

295
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,230
If even you don't help me,

296
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,190
I'll have to die.

297
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,680
Miss Haitang, you won't die.

298
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,350
His Majesty will keep you.

299
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,350
Is that so, Your Majesty?

300
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,590
You can stay.

301
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

302
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,880
But you don't need to stay by my side.

303
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,110
Stay with my queen and you'll live, too.

304
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,680
- No.
- No.

305
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm saying...

306
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,590
Miss Haitang

307
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,350
loves you, Your Majesty.

308
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,640
I told you

309
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,040
I didn't need a woman in my chamber.

310
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,950
That's settled, then.

311
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,110
But...

312
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,600
I'll take care of it.

313
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,950
This doesn't make any sense.

314
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,070
I picked the right girl.

315
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,950
Why did he reject?

316
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:45,950
Forget it.

317
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,400
Let's get back

318
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,350
for a further discussion.

319
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,350
His Majesty must be disliking me
because I'm a low woman.

320
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,760
When I can't stay here,

321
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,000
I would rather kill myself.

322
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,470
Wait.

323
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,000
Come back.

324
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,470
What are you doing?

325
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,310
Outside the window is the corridor.

326
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,680
When you jump, you won't die.

327
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,280
How about you try somewhere higher?

328
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,590
The city wall, for example.

329
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Don't worry.

330
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,830
His Majesty allowed you to stay.

331
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,190
Stay with me for the moment, then.

332
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,710
But I'm here for His Majesty.

333
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,590
When I can't stay by his side,

334
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,310
what's the point of staying?

335
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,190
I understand.

336
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,160
I really do.

337
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,560
The story you just made up

338
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,040
sounded so real.

339
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,560
That's... That's my...

340
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,280
Anyway, your behaviors

341
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,070
were just perfect.

342
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,920
Kui Mulang is

343
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,280
rather insensible, though.

344
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,350
Looks like I have to do something else

345
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,920
to make him take you.

346
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,470
Your Highness, you cultivated me.

347
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
How about I try my luck again?

348
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,470
Men

349
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,560
always say the opposite of what they think.

350
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,310
In front of everyone,

351
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,640
His Majesty rejected me.

352
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,280
But I don't believe

353
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,830
when he and I are alone,

354
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,350
he can still remain indifferent.

355
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
This is exactly what I want,

356
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
your tenacious spirit.

357
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,070
I'm rooting for you.

358
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,520
Go take some rest.

359
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,310
I'll see what I can do.

360
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,920
Hongxiu,

361
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,760
walk Haitang out.

362
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,950
Aye.

363
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,880
[Kuixing Palace]

364
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,160
Come on,

365
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,640
what's going on in Qi Pa's head?

366
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,880
Calm down, Your Majesty.

367
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,800
Her Highness's intention is crystal clear.

368
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,560
We can't let her continue.

369
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,950
I'll go talk to her.

370
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,590
Qi Pa.

371
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,680
Li Xiong?

372
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,070
What are you doing here?

373
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,070
What's wrong? You look so serious.

374
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,560
Could you stop foisting Haitang

375
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,590
on His Majesty?

376
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,430
You knew that?

377
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,590
Right.

378
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,800
That was a big ball.

379
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,190
I guess the word is out.

380
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,710
He...

381
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,280
But why do you want to stop me?

382
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,430
Don't you want a rightful relationship

383
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,400
with me?

384
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,680
I do, of course.

385
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,920
But we can do it

386
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,160
in some other way.

387
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,400
We should be generous.

388
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,920
We can't make Kui Mulang

389
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,560
a single man.

390
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,470
Don't worry. I've picked the girl.

391
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,830
Haitang is really good.

392
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,110
But I don't think His Majesty

393
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,280
likes that girl.

394
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,110
You're not him. How do you know...

395
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,000
How do you know he doesn't like her?

396
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,160
Maybe very soon,

397
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,590
Kui Mulang will fall in love with Haitang.

398
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,280
We would be helping, then.

399
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,230
But...

400
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,590
- But...
- Come on.

401
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,400
Say no more.

402
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,830
I admit

403
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,000
that I've had

404
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,590
little time for you.

405
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,070
I'm trying hard to make Kui Mulang

406
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,470
accept Haitang.

407
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,560
After I succeed,

408
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,920
I'll date you, all right?

409
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,040
That's what Haitang said?

410
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,110
Yes.

411
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,280
Looks like Qi Pa is dead set

412
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,230
on giving her to Kui Mulang.

413
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,190
That's very gracious of Her Highness.

414
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,190
What do you know of it?

415
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,400
No way. I have to check on her.

416
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:15,950
But Your...

417
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,160
What is His Royal Highness worried about,

418
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Haitang or her mission?

419
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,880
Come on. Get down.

420
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,760
[Kuixing Palace]

421
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,350
You hide here

422
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,400
and I'll send the guards away from the door.

423
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,110
Then you can sneak in.

424
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,230
And it's all on your own.

425
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
I will make it.

426
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,760
Where is it?

427
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,310
- Greetings...
- Greetings...

428
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,400
No need.

429
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,160
His Majesty must be asleep.

430
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
Don't disturb him.

431
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,230
Your Highness, you're not here
for His Majesty?

432
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,310
Here's the thing.

433
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,230
I suddenly noticed

434
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,160
the hairpin His Majesty gave me was gone.

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
I couldn't find it anywhere.

436
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,640
I guess I lost it the last time I came here.

437
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,830
How about you help me look for it?

438
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,710
Now?

439
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,470
But we have to guard here.

440
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,950
Just do me the favor.

441
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,400
It won't take too much time.

442
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,470
And it's a hairpin from His Majesty.

443
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,710
Very precious.

444
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,000
Tomorrow, if he asks me

445
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,310
why I'm not wearing it,

446
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,520
I have to tell him

447
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,830
that you don't help me look for it.

448
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,950
We'll look for it, Your Highness.

449
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,430
Right over there.

450
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,230
Your Majesty,

451
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
it's me, Haitang.

452
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,830
Your Majesty.

453
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,230
How did you get in?

454
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,040
Her Highness sent me.

455
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,400
My queen thinks highly of you now.

456
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,000
So, I'm not gonna kill you.

457
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,160
But if you break in again...

458
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,160
Being killed by you

459
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,470
would be better than being tortured
to death by someone else.

460
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,830
I would die with no regret.

461
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,800
What's going on in there?

462
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,000
Get out!

463
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,160
I knew

464
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,350
you wouldn't kill me, Your Majesty.

465
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,710
You're as merciful as you're said to be.

466
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,400
I'd like to be your maid, Your Majesty,

467
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,190
as long as I can stay by your side.

468
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

469
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,230
And how did you get in?

470
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,590
Just now, I heard

471
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,110
some impact noise

472
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,680
and I worried about Haitang.

473
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,310
I guess I disturbed you.

474
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,400
I'm leaving right away.

475
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,680
Stop!

476
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,160
You get us wrong.

477
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,710
It's not what you think it is.

478
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,110
I can understand.

479
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,230
And I accept that.

480
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,430
You know, Miss Haitang...

481
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,230
She has a true love for you, Your Majesty.

482
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,920
How about you marry her?

483
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,680
Then no one would disturb you.

484
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,430
Thank you, Your Highness.

485
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,560
Get out, both of you!

486
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,400
Don't be discouraged.

487
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,950
I'll see what else I can do.

488
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,640
Your Highness,

489
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,640
why did you suddenly break in?

490
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,310
If you hadn't,

491
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,800
I would have succeeded.

492
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,070
I was trying to help you.

493
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,560
When I was your witness,

494
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,760
he couldn't deny it.

495
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,430
What about now? Did you really help?

496
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,070
Be patient.

497
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,160
There are some other chances.

498
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,310
Just now, you hugged at least, right?

499
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,160
It's a pretty big step.

500
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,230
Tomorrow, we'll think of another way.

501
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,560
How about you just rush in?

502
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,680
All right, Your Highness.

503
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,950
I'm tired.

504
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,590
We'll talk tomorrow.

505
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,590
How could she blame me?

506
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,950
Only one question.

507
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,110
But I'm too tired

508
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,680
to talk.

509
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
Is your story true?

510
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,070
None of your business.

511
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,520
Why not?

512
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,950
Be honest with me.

513
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,160
If the story is true,

514
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,110
I won't let go of the owner

515
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,800
of the illegal music house!

516
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,430
Actually,

517
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,070
you don't need to care this much about me.

518
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,880
I always care about my minions.

519
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,400
A better understanding means
better cooperation.

520
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,830
Don't worry.

521
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,230
Those who bullied me

522
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,950
are all dead now.

523
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,230
The mysterious man got you out

524
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,400
from those guys, right?

525
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,710
That's why you're so loyal to him.

526
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,640
Jing Muhan!

527
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,470
Stop trying to make me talk.

528
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,470
Since I promised to cooperate,

529
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,710
I will do this for you.

530
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,190
And the rest...

531
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,160
I won't tell you.

532
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,590
Don't waste your time.

533
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,110
Haitang.

534
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,190
Whether the story is true or not,

535
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,710
I'll be there for you

536
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,400
and I won't let you

537
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,830
suffer anymore.

538
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,350
Come on.

539
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,710
What a snoop!

540
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,640
Your Highness,

541
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,520
how was it going?

542
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,520
Did His Majesty take Haitang?

543
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
No.

544
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,880
It was my fault.

545
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,950
I shouldn't have broken in.

546
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,470
I knew it.

547
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,520
His Majesty

548
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,070
has the wolf bloodline

549
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,430
and he's the one-woman man.

550
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,680
With you, Your Highness,

551
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,710
His Majesty will not

552
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,710
love anyone else.

553
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,680
No!

554
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,230
I don't believe that.

555
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,680
I'll recruit some more girls.

556
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,350
But Your Highness...

557
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
[Kuixing Palace]

558
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,680
Her Highness is quite resourceful!

559
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,710
She sent Haitang into your chamber secretly.

560
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,760
Your Majesty,

561
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,230
I have a plan

562
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,160
to stop Her Highness from doing this.

563
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,640
But I don't think you'll accept it.

564
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,640
Tell me.

565
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,320
My trick is

566
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,710
to go with it.

567
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,470
Go with it?

568
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,350
Are you asking me to take Haitang?

569
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,640
No way.

570
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,680
Every member of my royal family

571
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,920
loves only one woman in a lifetime.

572
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,520
Relax, Your Majesty.

573
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,070
You won't really take her.

574
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,640
This is just for solving the problem.

575
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,230
Think.

576
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,310
Her Highness loves Li Xiong.

577
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,230
So, she accepts what's within you.

578
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,310
She has feelings for you,

579
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,190
but she just doesn't realize it yet.

580
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,950
What you should do is make Her Highness

581
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,680
gradually accept your true identity

582
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,350
with what's inside you.

583
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,160
In this way, Her Highness will love

584
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,070
the whole pack of you.

585
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,070
By then, you can get the Holy Pearl.

586
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,000
Be specific. What do I do?

587
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,520
Your Majesty, you can marry Haitang

588
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,590
and be intimate with her.

589
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,920
Her Highness will be jealous, upset,
and bothered.

590
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,710
Then she will realize

591
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,160
you actually mean a lot to her.

592
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,760
In that case, everything can be solved.

593
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,070
Her Highness will be upset enough

594
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,800
to send Haitang away from the Palace.

595
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,800
No way.

596
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,160
I'm the King of Beast.

597
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
How could I use such a dirty trick?

598
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,590
Your Majesty, listen.

599
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,590
It's not what...

600
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,190
What's the noise?

601
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,710
Somebody.

602
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,040
Your Majesty.

603
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,680
What's the noise out there?

604
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,560
For your information, Your Majesty,

605
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,000
Her Highness is putting up notices

606
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
to recruit more girls to the Palace.

607
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,830
For you, as I heard.

608
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,110
Get Haitang to my chamber immediately!

609
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:35,830
Aye.

610
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,230
It's wise of you, Your Majesty.

611
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,760
The weather is very good lately.

612
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,070
We should do some airing.

613
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,590
He.

614
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,160
You...

615
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,680
Mother.

616
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,230
He,

617
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
I've brought you

618
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,470
what you were most familiar with.

619
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Check it and maybe you'll recall something.

620
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,830
My Lady,

621
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,830
he's indeed your father.

622
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,190
You should let your guard down.

623
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,400
Mother.

624
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,160
Lan'er,

625
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,920
they really seem to be your family.

626
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,310
If they help you get back your memories,

627
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,760
that's not a bad thing.

628
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,640
How about we get them in?

629
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,280
You come with me, then.

630
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,760
He,

631
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,470
you used this sword for many years.

632
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,560
You should remember it, huh?

633
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,070
Lan'er is a lady.

634
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,640
How could she use a sword?

635
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,190
Think harder.

636
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,680
Did you recall something?

637
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,350
Did you?

638
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,190
I can't recall anything!

639
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,800
Lan'er,

640
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,760
if you can't, stop trying.

641
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,430
Think harder.

642
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,190
You must have recalled something.

643
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,560
What are you doing?

644
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,630
She said she couldn't recall anything!

645
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,600
She's about to get something back.

646
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,520
Try harder.

647
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,800
You will recall something!

648
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,600
Think harder!

649
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,630
- What are you doing?
- I can't recall anything!

650
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,950
I can't recall anything, Mother!

651
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,670
What's wrong with you?

652
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,000
What a father you are!

653
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,670
She said she couldn't recall anything,

654
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,800
but you keep forcing her!

655
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,150
Get out, both of you!

656
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,800
Lan'er, Lan'er.

657
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,040
Do I have to expel you?

658
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,470
Don't be scared, Lan'er.

659
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,120
Mother.

660
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,120
Unexpectedly, Her Ladyship saw her sword,

661
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,560
but she still couldn't recall anything

662
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,800
and she repulsed us that much.

663
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,000
Five years ago,
I tried to manipulate Jing Muhan

664
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,520
into killing Kui Mulang

665
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,080
and becoming the puppet king.

666
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,430
But I failed.

667
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,800
Kui Mulang even gave me
some internal injuries.

668
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,430
I suffered quite a lot.

669
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,040
In the last five years,
I've been muddling along in the dark,

670
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,520
and trying awfully hard
to kill Kui Mulang for revenge.

671
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,080
Unexpectedly,

672
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,360
Haitang first gave herself away.

673
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,870
Then Jing Muhan betrayed me.

674
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,190
But fortunately,

675
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,560
God helped.

676
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,470
My daughter is still alive.

677
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,040
Xiniang,

678
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,320
if I can cultivate her

679
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,520
to approach Kui Mulang again,

680
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,280
we'll have the opportunity
to redo our big plan.

681
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,430
What are you gonna do, My Lord?

682
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,840
That year, she betrayed me
before the attack.

683
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,870
Now, time for her to come to her senses.

684
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,710
Our priority is to get back her memories.

685
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,470
Xiniang,

686
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,670
now that soft tricks didn't work,

687
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,430
let's play hardball!

688
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,230
Your Majesty,

689
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,040
here I am.

690
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,960
[Please play the zither
until His Majesty comes]

691
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,600
What a king!

692
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,560
He appears to be decent,

693
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,800
but privately, he has a lot of tricks.

694
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,080
I heard His Majesty loved

695
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,390
Miss Haitang.

696
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,040
They played music together

697
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,910
as if they were intimate friends.

698
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,520
Right.

699
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,670
I heard about that, too.

700
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,230
I also heard His Majesty was fascinated

701
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,670
by Miss Haitang and he spoilt her.

702
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,080
If things go on like this,

703
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,000
Her Highness may lose her throne.

704
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,000
Seriously? I don't think so.

705
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,600
It's hard to tell.

706
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,230
Everything is possible, anyway.

707
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,710
Nothing in love can be predicted.

708
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
I really feel anxious for Her Highness.

709
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,800
That's enough.

710
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,280
What if you say more

711
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,670
and really annoy Qi Pa?

712
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,950
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

713
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,000
The angrier she gets,

714
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
the better she can sense her real feelings.

715
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,950
What does this mean?

716
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,150
A cheer-up gesture Her Highness taught me.

717
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,190
For encouragement.

718
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,760
Anyway, try hard, Your Majesty.

719
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,520
Let's wait and see.

720
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,950
What news? Tell us.

721
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,710
You know what?

722
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,710
Yesterday, in the Imperial Garden,

723
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,760
I saw him with her.

724
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,230
That's true.

725
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
I wrote it down personally.

726
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,280
I wouldn't lie.

727
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,710
- Go.
- Go.

728
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,280
Hurry.

729
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,080
You know what? They're together now.

730
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,230
That's right. I heard it for myself.

731
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,950
They're together.

732
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,080
- Is that true?
- I heard that.

733
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,630
Really?

734
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,630
I told you it was true.

735
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,230
It's true.

736
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,760
Everyone is aware now.

737
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,950
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

738
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,960
[Yaohua Palace]

739
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,800
Your Highness,

740
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I went for a walk in the Palace

741
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,600
and heard some unreal rumors.

742
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
What rumors?

743
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,150
It's...

744
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,520
Umm...

745
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,710
Tell me. I can hold it.

746
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,230
People in the Palace are saying

747
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,670
that His Majesty and Haitang
are hitting it off.

748
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,040
And they

749
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,520
stayed up all night long, playing music.

750
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,280
They clicked at first sight
and had an interesting chat.

751
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,840
Your Highness, don't be sad.

752
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,670
His Majesty couldn't have done that.

753
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,390
Don't trust those rumors.

754
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm not sad.

755
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,150
Instead, I'm happy.

756
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,950
Now that His Majesty accepted Haitang,

757
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,040
he would let me go for sure.

758
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,710
In this case,

759
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,840
you don't need to stay.

760
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,390
Hongxiu.

761
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,390
Here.

762
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,230
Take them out of the Palace.

763
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,600
Aye.

764
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,040
Follow me.

765
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,390
- Aye.
- Aye.

766
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,560
Clicked at first sight
and had an interesting chat?

767
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,390
I really didn't see this coming.

768
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,190
