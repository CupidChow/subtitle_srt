00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,420
This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,548
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings and events.

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,390
Are you lonely?

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
No.

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,730
Are you unhappy?

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,357
I'd like to introduce my husband,

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,943
- Vice-Chairman Kim Yongkook.
- You're mine.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,403
Let go of me!

9
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,741
My marriage
was already ruined long ago.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,453
Why are you protecting it
if it means nothing to you?

11
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,414
If Oh Wansoo exposes everything
after she divorces you,

12
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,624
you will lose your inheritance
and management rights.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,709
Don't you get it?

14
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,924
The only way she has
of leaving this family

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,468
is through death.

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,803
Divorce is not an option.

17
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,639
What about him?

18
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,476
I'll kill them myself.

19
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,525
I need you.

20
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,031
You need me?

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,059
Red Swan

22
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,436
New York, USA

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,731
UNICEF Headquarters

24
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:59,202
Episode 1

25
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,812
Hello. My name is Andrew Jacobs.

26
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,021
I'm the secretary-general.

27
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,940
-Nice to have you here.
-Nice to meet you.

28
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,358
Please come this way.

29
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,747
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce

30
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,250
Wansoo Oh from South Korea.

31
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,051
I would like
to thank all the members

32
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,054
for allowing me to speak today.

33
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,890
I am Korea's goodwill ambassador,

34
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,976
Oh Wansoo,
the Director of the NOW Foundation.

35
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,394
I'm Oh Wansoo.

36
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,108
I'm accompanied by three other guests

37
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,818
who have joined me today.

38
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,821
Survivor, Ms. Adia Balak.

39
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,620
Lawyer, Ms. Sandra Adford.

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,092
Ms. Balak's family was murdered

41
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,179
and she was forced into sexual slavery

42
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,390
where she suffered sexual abuse
at the hands of many ISIS members.

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,517
They must stand trial

44
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,354
and be served justice at the World Court.

45
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,356
Let's take a look.

46
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,070
A little touch of the NOW Foundation

47
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,240
has a great impact
on the lives of those in need.

48
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,534
NOW Foundation was founded
to offer love to our neighbors

49
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,829
suffering from poverty and disease.

50
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,331
Even at this moment…

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:15,004
Manila, Philippines

52
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,524
Director Oh.

53
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,444
ISIS sent us an email
threatening us with an act of terrorism.

54
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,196
A death threat? From ISIS?

55
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
-Yes.
-They said they're going to kill me?

56
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,916
Should we cancel your schedule in Manila?

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,337
Sure. I'll just cancel all my schedule
because they scared me straight,

58
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,297
and stay holed up at home instead.

59
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,215
What a great idea.

60
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,344
My apologies, ma'am.

61
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,637
We picked up your dress
from New York just now

62
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,639
and your necklace
will be picked up in Manila.

63
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,391
-Okay.
-One more thing.

64
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,894
Chairwoman Park will also be
attending the party in Manila.

65
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,604
What?

66
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,740
Seoul, Republic of Korea

67
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,353
Excuse me, Butler Byeon.

68
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,523
What was that?

69
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,442
You've been out for too long.
Let's head inside.

70
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,152
I asked you what that was.

71
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,071
I'm sorry. I needed to use the restroom.

72
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,197
Darn it.

73
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,159
Can't you even hold it in, you fool?

74
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,911
I lost all the chi I gathered
thanks to you.

75
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,247
It's been over an hour now, ma'am.

76
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,542
Has it been that long?

77
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,092
I'll be flying tomorrow for that party
that will be held in two days.

78
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:10,054
You know how some people still look old
even when they're in a fancy party dress?

79
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,181
I'd hate for that to happen to me.

80
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm worried you might have absorbed
too much of the moon's energy

81
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,437
and caused an imbalance in your body.

82
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,524
Are you making fun of me right now?

83
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,153
You look much younger.

84
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,739
-Your skin looks smooth.
-Really?

85
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,869
Oh. Look at the moon.

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,329
Let's go.

87
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:46,424
Manila, Philippines

88
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,985
-I'm not late, am I?
-We have plenty of time.

89
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,821
Vice-Chairman Kim
has just arrived at Manila Airport.

90
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,037
Check, please.

91
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,121
Ah, ah.

92
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,748
Okay.

93
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,967
-Okay?
-Yes, okay.

94
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,136
I seem to interview you more often

95
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,804
after you've married into the Hwain Group

96
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,681
than when you used to be a pro golfer.

97
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,391
That's because you work
for a current affairs magazine.

98
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,102
Yes. You'll be on the cover
of our Asian edition.

99
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,479
So I've heard.

100
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,731
We'll begin once the crown prince arrives.

101
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,815
All right.

102
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,242
Welcome. I'm Oh Wansoo.

103
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,911
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm here to make a contribution.

104
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,247
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,582
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,045
Manila

107
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,881
Eight Star Fortune Casino

108
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,568
What I do is collect donations,

109
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,194
or fundraise.

110
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,533
Crown Prince Muhammad
has agreed to donate to help Ms. Balak,

111
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,661
a victim of war,
who I'm raising funds for at the moment.

112
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,204
I see.

113
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,375
May I ask how much he will be donating?

114
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,379
It will be more than five billion
in Korean won.

115
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,883
Five million dollars.

116
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,135
Wow!

117
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,447
Hey.

118
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,450
You can go to hell.

119
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,826
Asshole.

120
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,509
Hey.

121
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,761
Come with me for a second.

122
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,928
You two go without me.

123
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,972
This way.

124
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,069
NOW Foundation is mostly
focused on humanitarian work in Africa,

125
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,196
where we provide aid to victims of war.

126
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,074
And of course, we search for people
who can help fund our work

127
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,950
and ask them for a handout.

128
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,411
Begging for money.

129
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,458
I'm here to pay up.

130
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,627
Honey.

131
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,505
This is my husband.

132
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,131
My husband, Kim.

133
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,176
Ms. Park, the reporter,
and Crown Prince Muhammad.

134
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,886
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,056
How do you do?
It's an honor to see you, Mr. Muhammad.

136
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,641
Hello, Mr. Kim.

137
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,228
Congratulations on being made
a goodwill ambassador.

138
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,695
Mr. L is coming?

139
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,114
- Who's that?
- An assassin for hire.

140
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,704
A Korean policeman died
a few months ago in our area.

141
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,789
Mr. L did that.

142
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,635
He has another gig in Manila today.

143
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,680
He'll do it as soon as
the boss receives the money.

144
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,348
Where in Manila?

145
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,244
No.

146
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,829
Not yet.

147
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,250
The money hasn't been wired yet.

148
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,588
I'll wait then.

149
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,423
Okay.

150
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,383
It will be fine.

151
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,936
Welcome, sir.

152
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,531
It's to your right.

153
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,703
Let's head inside.

154
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,832
Hey.

155
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,750
Hurry up and get out of here.

156
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,710
Oh. Yes, sir.

157
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,256
Come in.

158
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,176
Oh!

159
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,387
-Welcome, Mr. Park.
-Hello.

160
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,602
-I said get out.
-I'm sorry, sir.

161
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,731
I'm here with a delivery
from the flower shop.

162
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,025
- Is that so?
- Yes.

163
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,152
The flower shop delivery
is complete.

164
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,657
Shall we have a look?

165
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,914
Thank you, Mr. Park.

166
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,227
What's Mr. Park doing here?

167
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,872
Incoming call
Hwain Park Kyungju

168
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,793
Hello, sir.

169
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,253
I hope you've been well.

170
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm in Manila. We should catch up.

171
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,385
I heard you've been here
for over three months,

172
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,887
after what happened to Juhyuk.

173
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,140
Hey!

174
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,224
3 months ago
Tondo, Manila

175
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,101
Let's keep doing our best!

176
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,153
What was that?

177
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,696
Is he dead?

178
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,079
No.

179
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,536
Juhyuk!

180
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,047
Juhyuk!

181
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,190
The flower shop delivery is complete.

182
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,694
Juhyuk!

183
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,362
Hang in there, Juhyuk!

184
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,780
Stay with me.

185
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,991
-The…
-Hang in there.

186
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,868
The photo…

187
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,703
What?

188
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,623
Hang in there.

189
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,334
Don't die on me, Juhyuk!

190
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,839
Juhyuk!

191
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
Juhyuk!

192
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,344
Juhyuk!

193
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,520
Where in Manila?

194
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,481
Makati shopping district.

195
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,524
He'll be working alone.

196
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,808
You should leave an hour later,
Director Oh.

197
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,645
Q2 and Q3 are still doing security checks
at the venue for the party tomorrow.

198
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,109
The rest of the team is at the airport
to escort Chairwoman Park.

199
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,568
We don't have anyone to guard you.

200
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,654
I'll be fine. It's just a simple errand.

201
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,738
I see.

202
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,948
If you say so.

203
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,873
Manila

204
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,586
Makati shopping district

205
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,941
- Hello and welcome.
- Hello.

206
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,359
-This way, please.
-Yes.

207
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,696
-The weather's beautiful today, isn't it?
-It is.

208
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,111
No, stop!

209
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,654
Please don't be mad.

210
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,574
Oh, my god!

211
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,705
This is the one
you ordered from Korea.

212
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,250
It's truly gorgeous.

213
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,544
Almost too beautiful to donate, isn't it?

214
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,298
My husband will buy it back
at the charity auction.

215
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,674
What a perfect husband.

216
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,593
Yes, he is.

217
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,328
Samantha!
She forgot her jacket.

218
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,360
Ms. Oh Wansoo.

219
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,502
When I give you the signal,
run over to that car in the back.

220
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,879
Got that?

221
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,636
Now!

222
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,013
Stay down.

223
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,718
We've made it out. You should be okay now.

224
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,141
Are you hurt?

225
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,811
Who are you?

226
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,946
I'll find a safe place for us to park.

227
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,216
I asked you who you were.

228
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,890
What happened to my security personnel?

229
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,646
I'm just a passerby.

230
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,190
What are you talking about?

231
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,733
I'm not one of them.

232
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,818
I really was just passing by.

233
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,944
You can stop worrying now.

234
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,750
Track down the location of that car

235
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,920
and call the embassy
to request local police assistance.

236
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,181
We won't be going back
into town right away.

237
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,683
Why is that?

238
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,186
I removed the GPS tracker
to lose anyone who may be tailing us.

239
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,147
Then what do we do now?

240
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,440
First, we should get out of here.

241
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,525
Where to?

242
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,863
The place I'm staying in is nearby.

243
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,453
Do you have a phone with you?

244
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,168
Call the police for me.

245
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,881
That might not be a good idea.

246
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,093
There could be people in the police
who are on their payroll.

247
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,178
We should get going.

248
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,681
They have likely tracked
our current location.

249
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,436
Let's get going then.

250
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,445
It's on the second floor.
Let's head inside.

251
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,286
Wait.

252
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,039
You're bleeding a lot.

253
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,791
Shouldn't you see a doctor first?

254
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,543
I'll be fine. Let's go.

255
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,173
Don't worry. It's safe here.

256
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,606
Who is the person that wants you dead?

257
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,696
I should go. Thank you for saving me.

258
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,573
It's still dangerous.

259
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,867
I don't know who you are.
Move out of my way.

260
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,536
Calm down.

261
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,288
I promise that you'll be safe here.

262
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,793
I'll drive you to the embassy.

263
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,921
Call whoever you can trust
and have them pick you up from there.

264
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,217
But don't tell them
your exact location just in case.

265
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,553
Just tell them you'll arrive
at the embassy in 15 minutes.

266
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,305
Here.

267
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,376
-You need a doctor--
-What about the call?

268
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,044
Did you call them yet?

269
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,174
I don't have anyone's number memorized.

270
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,720
I don't know anyone's number by heart.

271
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,599
That's fine.
I'll just drive you to the embassy then.

272
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,684
Wait.

273
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,521
Do you know me?

274
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,735
I don't think there's a single Korean
who doesn't know who you are.

275
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,194
You used to be a famous pro golfer.

276
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,196
Do you live in Manila?

277
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,406
No, I don't live here.

278
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,297
You should wash your face.

279
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,192
Let's go.

280
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,243
Manila

281
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,912
Embassy of the Republic of Korea

282
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,460
Director Oh.

283
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,093
I'm not hurt.

284
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,220
There's nothing to worry about.

285
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,514
The ambassador will be here shortly.

286
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
And the witness?

287
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,517
He's in the other room,
writing his statement.

288
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,978
- Let's get her to a hospital first.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,855
-Reward him as you see fit, Mr. Park.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,939
We should get going.

291
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,109
Can you walk?

292
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,194
This way.

293
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,739
You've got
so much blood on you.

294
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,586
Call off tomorrow's party.

295
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,839
I heard you received
a threat from ISIS a few days ago.

296
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,676
How could you think of coming here
when it's so dangerous?

297
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,179
Let me get some shut-eye.

298
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,776
Thank you for your hard work.

299
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,612
I am the head of security
in charge of protecting Director Oh.

300
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,738
Hello.

301
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,659
May I ask you where the witness is?

302
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,703
He left a moment ago
saying that he was busy.

303
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,038
I see.

304
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,916
That must be his statement.

305
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,125
May I take a look at it?

306
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,710
Of course.

307
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,341
DYS, Seo Doyoon

308
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,011
"Seo Doyoon"?

309
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,889
Yes. He was Korean.

310
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,350
He left as soon as he was done
writing the statement.

311
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,228
Hey, Doyoon. It's me.

312
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,439
You wrote that statement
at the embassy, didn't you?

313
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,108
Yes, sir.

314
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,567
Okay.

315
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,319
Let's save the details
for when we meet.

316
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,987
We're still on for tonight, right?

317
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,447
Why don't we meet a little earlier?

318
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,865
Where are you now?

319
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,577
Hey, Doyoon.

320
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,999
It's been so long since I last saw you.

321
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,168
-I hope you've been well.
-Of course.

322
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,963
But what are you doing here in Manila?

323
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,631
I'm just getting by doing odd jobs.

324
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,842
-Why don't we sit down?
-Sure, let's do that.

325
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
It's Mother.

326
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,864
Yes, ma'am.

327
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,075
I just got out of the shower
and was going to see you.

328
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,749
-What did you say?
-I already told you I wouldn't do it.

329
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,170
Then have your husband do it.

330
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,131
The party was called off
because of that darn terrorist attack,

331
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,176
so this is the least we could do
to get China to help us.

332
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,636
You can tell him yourself.

333
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,013
Tell him myself?

334
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,185
Are you trying
to order me around right now?

335
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,770
I refuse to take any part in this.

336
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,647
Is that so?

337
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,776
So you don't want to get
your precious hands a little dirty.

338
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,112
I won't call off the party.

339
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,657
-I'll prepare something else for them.
-Hey!

340
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,160
I've told you countless times that money
is the best way to get things done!

341
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,204
I refuse to bribe them myself.

342
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,291
Who are you trying to fool?

343
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,169
Should I get your brother in Seoul
to do it instead then?

344
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,589
I don't care who my brother
gave bribes to and when.

345
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,882
I know nothing about that.

346
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,343
You don't know, do you?

347
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,179
Do you think you're being
questioned by the prosecution?

348
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,681
It could backfire on us.

349
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,974
Why you…

350
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,226
Darn it. Hey!

351
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,853
How much do you think this is?

352
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,773
How can this much money
make anything worse?

353
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,401
I will be attending the party tomorrow.

354
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,362
It might be best for you not to attend
if you're going to keep this up.

355
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,907
Hey!

356
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,077
Just do as you're told!

357
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,164
It's my party.

358
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,833
Please don't embarrass me.

359
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,418
And don't come to the party.

360
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:19,088
If you do, I will refuse to do
any business with China in the future.

361
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,384
Hey!

362
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,136
I ought to…

363
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,388
Did something happen?

364
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,268
That insolent brat!

365
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,702
I want you

366
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,872
to have her killed.

367
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,295
Would you like another glass?

368
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,075
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

369
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,453
We'll confirm your identity
before we administer the anesthetic.

370
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,206
Please tell us
your name and your date of birth.

371
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,709
Shin Juhyuk. May 21, 1985.

372
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,380
Seo Doyoon. September 4, 1985.

373
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,590
It will hurt, right?

374
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,429
Thank you for giving me your kidney.

375
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,349
Starting anesthesia.

376
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,733
Starting anesthesia.

377
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,654
I wouldn't mind giving you
anything of mine.

378
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,615
Put it to good use, all right?

379
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,869
Right. I can promise you this one thing.

380
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,871
If you ever end up

381
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,623
falling in danger,

382
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,126
I will put my life
on the line to protect you

383
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,920
since I'm much better in a fight.

384
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,256
I'm starting to think
that you're being serious right now.

385
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,882
I really mean it.

386
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,427
Let's go grab a drink.

387
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,471
Nonsense. It's only been a month
since our surgery.

388
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,306
It's been a whole month already.

389
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,058
Don't be such a wuss.

390
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,019
You should come back to Seoul
and help me out.

391
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,441
Director Oh could have died
if it weren't for you today.

392
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,985
Just thinking about it
sends shivers down my spine.

393
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,739
We should work together
at the flower shop…

394
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,618
Right. The company I work for.

395
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,747
"Flower shop" is what we call Hwain Group
for confidentiality reasons.

396
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,710
The flower shop delivery is complete.

397
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,380
Let's work together again
like the old days, Doyoon.

398
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,549
Thank you for the offer,

399
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,385
but I'll get back to you
after I give it some thought.

400
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,470
Okay.

401
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,389
Take your time, but call me
as soon as you make up your mind.

402
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,576
Calling
Hwain Park Kyungju

403
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,249
Sir. It's me, Seo Doyoon.

404
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,114
I've managed to stop the press.

405
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,037
Did Chairwoman Park give you
that bag full of money?

406
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,499
I did. She told me to give it
to the Chinese ambassador.

407
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,792
You know you can't do that.

408
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,544
It's just business.

409
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,295
It's my party.

410
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,631
Then you should hash it out with her.

411
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,385
Don't forget that I told you not to.

412
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,361
This is for today's press conference.

413
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:59,118
Have you included the email and the video
we received from ISIS as I've instructed?

414
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,828
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,454
-Proceed.
-Yes, ma'am.

416
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,666
A press conference? Are you mad?

417
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,295
Do you plan on telling the whole world
that ISIS has threatened to kill you?

418
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,462
You'll just provoke them.

419
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,964
I'm going to alert the press.

420
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,842
Is the foundation more important to you
than your own life?

421
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,302
Like you said,

422
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,763
this is a chance to let everyone know
just how much my work means to me.

423
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,603
Please go back.

424
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,937
Hey, go back, please.

425
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,106
Is it true that you were blackmailed?

426
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,941
Please look this way.

427
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,699
Was yesterday's attack related
to the terror threat you received?

428
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,910
Is it true that you received
death threats from ISIS?

429
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,537
What is the reported number of casualties?

430
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,205
Do you have any specific
information about the suspect?

431
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,291
Is it true that you received
a cautionary email

432
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,001
before the terrorist attack happened?

433
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,503
Quiet, please.
We will now begin the press conference.

434
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,798
Hello, everyone. I'm Oh Wansoo.

435
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,347
First, I'd like to let everyone know
that I am safe and unharmed.

436
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,725
Let me start by telling you
what you want to know the most.

437
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,770
Because of my recent speech
in support of Ms. Balak,

438
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,855
who is part of an ethnic minority in Iraq,

439
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,900
and urging the World Court
that justice must be served,

440
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,526
it's true

441
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,238
that ISIS has threatened me
with acts of terror.

442
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,449
So it's true?

443
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,533
She says it's true.

444
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,455
But the assailant got away

445
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,375
and there was no evidence
to be found on the scene.

446
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,461
Thankfully,
there weren't any casualties

447
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,963
save for a few security personnel
who were injured.

448
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,425
The investigation is still ongoing,
so I can't go into the details,

449
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,968
but I, Oh Wansoo--

450
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,720
Darn it!

451
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,224
Explain to me why she's holding
that press conference.

452
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,810
Who does she think she is to do that?

453
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,646
The nerve…

454
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,817
How dare she hold a press conference?

455
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,902
Who does she think she is?

456
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,862
"I, Oh Wansoo"?

457
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,947
That brat…

458
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,825
I, Oh Wansoo, hereby announce

459
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,662
that I won't stop working to build
a better future for those in need

460
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,374
even if there are threats of terrorism

461
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,292
made against my life.

462
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,842
Evil must not go unpunished.

463
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,596
I will fight until the end.

464
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,065
Did ISIS send you
any more threats since the attack?

465
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,942
How severe
are the injuries of the bodyguards?

466
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,236
What's your plan for the future
in your fight against ISIS?

467
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,029
How will this affect Hwain Group?

468
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,490
Please wait your turn
before asking questions.

469
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,661
I'm Steve Peltz from DNN.

470
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,664
What are your thoughts on
expecting further retaliation from ISIS?

471
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,841
Wansoo.

472
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,426
- Auntie.
- Hi, Junhee.

473
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,845
- Did you eat yet?
- Not yet.

474
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,600
Thank you for inviting us to the party.

475
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,477
It's nothing, really.

476
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,020
You're getting
more handsome by the day.

477
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,275
What do you think?

478
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,359
It's gorgeous.

479
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,948
Are you enjoying your meal?

480
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,034
Yes, Auntie.

481
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,619
Enjoy your meal.

482
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,703
Okay.

483
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,209
Mom!

484
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,336
Chanhee!

485
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,595
This is no time
for you to be going skiing with your kid.

486
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,097
Don't go, Mom.

487
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,518
Come skiing with me.
I want to go skiing with you.

488
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,812
Don't cry, Chanhee.

489
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,271
I'll be back before you know it.

490
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,689
You'll be fine without me.

491
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,408
Wansoo.

492
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,327
Yes?

493
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,789
Are you sure you're okay?

494
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:18,293
I was too out of it yesterday
to even realize what had happened.

495
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,878
You could have died.

496
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,588
I know.

497
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,427
Will you be okay later?

498
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,596
I'm fine now.

499
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,182
I'm so relieved to hear that.

500
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,485
"Ladies and gentlemen."

501
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,113
"Thank you
and welcome to tonight's festivities."

502
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,699
"Welcome to tonight's festivities."

503
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,514
Vice-Chairman Kim.

504
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,811
This is Seo Doyoon, who will be
joining our security team as of today.

505
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,648
Say hello.

506
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,743
I'm Seo Doyoon.
