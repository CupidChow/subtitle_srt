Will it be me?

3005
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:09,660
I'm going to chase till the end to return to this position.

3006
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:11,210
This is a challenge towards him right?

3007
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:16,300
[Who will be the one sitting at the Polaris after an intense fight?]

3008
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,530
I'm the best even among those with All-Stars.

3009
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:13,750
I'm confident.

3010

02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:20,500
What is this?

3013
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:22,210
Is the scale really this big?

3014
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:23,600
[What mission will they be doing on such a grand stage?]

3015
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:25,040
I've never seen a show like this before.

3016
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:30,060
Through the Signal Song Mission, 12 Trainees will be eliminated.

3017

3019

They're eliminated just like that?

02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:36,730
[The boys' individual fight to not be eliminated!]

3021
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,320
This is so cruel.

3022
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:35,800
I'm going to cry.

3023
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:38,590
Don't cry. Stop.

3024
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:43,790
[Experiencing mixed emotions between qualifications and eliminations]

3025
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:42,420
I knew I was going to be eliminated.

3026
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:43,790
Oh, I really want to stop.

3027
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:50,670
[If you stop, you'll be eliminated. You need to dance repeatedly.]

3028
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:45,710
You can do this! You have to complete it.

3029
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:47,050
I want to survive.

3030
02:12:47,790 --> 02:12:49,590
I want to survive for a long time.

3031
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:58,080
Stop.

3032
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:04,230
But I just want to say we are human, we are not machines.

3033
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:06,410
[There are also unexpected situations]

3034
02:13:06,630 --> 02:13:12,130
