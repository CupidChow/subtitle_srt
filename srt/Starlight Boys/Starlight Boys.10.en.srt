00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,530

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,150
who will be the glorious boys

81
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,290
to realize their dreams?

82
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,120
The iQIYI Global Idol Audition, Starlight Boys' long awaited Final Round

83
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,250
is about to start now.

84
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,610
Light now, right now.

85
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,610
This is the last interview.

86
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,570
The last one?

87
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,610
So much time has passed?

88
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:02,130
-Because this is the last time, so I'm a little sad...
-It's starting to feel real.

89
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,620
It's been four months.

90
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,970
Boys from all over the world who gathered here

91
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,240
for their dream.

92
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,510
I can do this all day. I can do this all day!

93
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,780
The beginning of a long journey to become the brightest star.

94
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,630
Endless sweat and effort.

95
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,590
Just show yourself.

96
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,760
A glorious future.

97
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,530
Confidence that you can make a debut.

98
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:43,390
22,523,878 votes.

99
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,750
24.1 million.

100
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,240
240,036 votes.

101
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,480
Right now,

102
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,310
the birth of a new star to light up the world.

103
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,680
The top 9 you chose among the many stars

104
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,530
I'm clapping the slate. One, two, three.

105
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,310
"Remain true to our original aspiration and go forward bravely."

106
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,120
I tell myself that to remind myself

107
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,720
not to forget why I came to this show in the first place, or why I wanted to be an idol.

108
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,300
I really love singing and dancing.

109
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,770
I want to become someone who has both dance and singing skills.

110
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:48,130
That someone called SHAO ZI HENG is someone worth liking. As long as I take all my performances seriously,

111
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,540
I will become the Polaris.

112
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,760
To me, "Starlight Boys" is really the

113
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,730
last chance.

114
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,870
The reaction I got were "Why are you going on the show?" "Why are you doing this again?"

115
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,200
If it weren't for this, I thought I'd just be doing nothing.

116
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,200
I'm taking it as my last chance to challenge myself, to put on the performances I want to.

117
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,400
Even if I'd to do it five times,

118
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,750
I want to debut.

119
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,550
For me, the debut

120
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,530
is another new beginning.

121
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,840
After the team was disbanded,

122
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,660
I thought,

123
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,230
"Is my path as an idol over?"

124
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,090
I said

125
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,450
this.

126
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,080
I wanted to give up many times.

127
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:43,810
I really want to stand in front of more people and on a bigger stage, so I want to make my debut through Starlight Boys.

128
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:58,410
When I debuted in Thailand, I was already quite famous in Thailand, so it was OK to a certain extent.

129
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,410
My popularity kind of reached an international level, so when the opportunity arrived,

130
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:12,150
I didn't want to leave any regrets. This has been my dream from the beginning. And I'll do my very best

131
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,710
in order to realize it.

132
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,770
During the first interview...

133
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:23,340
I really think this will be the last challenge I take on.

134
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,830
I work hard for every moment like it's my last.

135
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,120
I will do my best till the very end.

136
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,030
Through a performance even better and cooler than before,

137
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,080
I'll make it to the TOP9.

138
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,910
Like a fairytale until the end.

139
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,960
In fact, performing the Signal Song was my dream.

140
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:52,280
During the Signal Song performance, I realized my first dream, and I still remember how happy I felt then.

141
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,100
That feeling.

142
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,760
Trainee HONG SUNG MIN is an energetic hexagonal warrior, right?

143
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,400
Thank you.

144
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:12,340
Especially this time after I performed a rap song, which was seldom sung before, I've made further progress and gained confidence to do everything well.

145
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,560
He's really...

146
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:21,200
I will grit my teeth more in the Final for everyone to see my glamorous lead singer and dance clearly.

147
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:31,900
For me, Starlights Boys lets me find the one who used to sing, dance, rap and shine again.

148
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:40,190
Because through these two public performances, I have found the glittering Mr. Duan, and he has come back.

149
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,150
Fighting, XIN CHE.

150
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,660
The first time I thought I could be eliminated was

151
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,120
during the evaluation of the Signal Song.

152
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,820
XIN CHE.

153
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,570
I didn't expect to survive to this day.

154
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,550
I've certainly

155
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,870
made a lot of progress.

156
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,510
And I think I've grown quite a bit too.

157
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:16,070
That because everyone is helping me, practicing hard with me every day, can I make it till today.

158
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,530
On the Final Performance,

159
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,910
I want to prove it again.

160
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,880
Hello, I am...

161
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,170
ZAI who practices singing very hard.

162
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:34,510
For me, this stage can urge me to grow

163
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,390
and develop.

164
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:44,890
Because of my mistakes, I'll remember not to make mistakes the next time. I will set higher standards for myself.

165
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:52,310
I wasn't confident about myself at that time, that is, I didn't think I was good looking or talented enough.

166
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,970
But after, I saw that

167
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,980
a lot of fans supported me, liked me, voted for me. At that moment, I felt

168
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,250
I have to go up and can't stay left behind.

169
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,070
I think these four months are the most youthful time I've ever had.

170
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,050
It's really like going back to youth.

171
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:16,320
It's like living intensely. I've learned a lot in the process.

172
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,420
And I feel that I'm full of confidence.

173
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,610
Of course we have to get ready for the stage. I hope we won't regret.

174
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:31,870
Today's live show I want to block your video on your edge is a good memory.

175
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,040
A wonderful experience and brilliant journey.

176
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,020
I wish I could make my debut.

177
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,510
The best thing is

178
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:49,680
being able to present a really good performance with my good colleagues. I think it's the happiest thing to be able to present a great performance together.

179
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,410
If I could do my part, I would work even harder.

180
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,320
To do no harm.

181
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,490
That's what I think we should do.

182
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,570
As I went along with life,

183
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,990
this is something I've never experienced.

184
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,540
I think I did as much as I could.

185
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,910
Because I failed once.

186
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,410
All the more

187
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,190
eager for debut I've become now.

188
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,910
And this time,

189
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,150
if I can debut,

190
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
I want to be an idol

191
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,330
who can make my fans proud of me.

192
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,190
Make them feel this feeling.

193
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,110
Debut for me

194
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,150
isn't the end but the beginning.

195
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,630
I guess I could say that.

196
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,030
Even if the debut is true, it doesn't necessarily mean it's over.

197
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,370
Debut means to really face the world.

198
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,510
If I make my debut,

199
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,330
I think it's a new beginning and I'm ready to run.

200
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,410
Honestly,

201
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,550
why am I here?

202
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,000
On this program?

203
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,950
I hope people could like

204
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,310
LINGQI a little more.

205
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,390
Give me a little more attention.

206
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,690
Just once,

207
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,340
I hope to get

208
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,630
the attention of everyone.

209
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,370
I want to be the brightest star among the many stars.

210
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,940
This is iQIYI's Global Idol Audition "Starlight Boys" that is being aired through a live stream. Hello, I am the Guardian Representative, LEE SUNG KYOUNG.

211
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:47,900
Finally, tonight, the nine boys that Guardians have voted as the final Starlight Boys member will be revealed.

212
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:57,300
Boys from all over the world who dream of becoming global idols have gathered to start their exciting journey as a Starlight Boy.

213
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:04,100
Of the 89 trainees who entered Starlight Academy, 71 trainees have left.

214
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,270
There are now 18 trainees left.

215
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,530
The trainees took on the Level Test, Signal Song mission, and
K-POP Generation Battle.

216
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,360
The Position Battle proved his brilliance on the stage.

217
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,210
Now it's only one step away from the debut.

218
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,470
Now here comes the Final.

219
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,020
Starlight Boys Final.

220
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,750
The last mission for the Trainees who broadcast live is

221
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,650
to...

222
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,550
This is the Debut Evaluation Mission.

223
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,230
In today's Final Performance, Trainees will stand on the stage

224
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,260
as a new team with a new Position.

225
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:05,820
Through global online voting, the Global Guardians will present new songs and Positions.

226
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,740
I heard the Trainees are more carefully prepared than ever before. Please support them.

227
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,200
Now, let's take a look at the special people who can add luster to the Final Performance.

228
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,060
They are the indispensable and precious existence of our Starlight Academy.

229
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:34,320
Introducing the Starlight Boys Guiders who have selflessly provided help and support to the trainees. Hello, Guiders.

230
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,080
Yes, although I have also been supporting and paying attention to the trainees during this period,

231
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:53,650
There is really no one who cares more about the trainees than our Guider. First of all, our Starlight Boys's performance director, Guider CHOI YOUNGJUN.

232
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:01,860
You've seen the preparation process the trainees have gone through. Say something to cheer these trainees on for this Final Perforamnce.

233
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,010
They've lived together in the dorms for a long time.

234
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:11,690
They are filled with nervousness every single day

235
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,910
for a few months

236
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,160
so it's really difficult to go on, be it physically or mentally.

237
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:27,220
Thank you very much for persisting this far and not getting injured too much.

238
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:33,300
I would like to express my gratitude to you all for creating legendary performances.

239
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,670
I hope you can also shine bright on stage today.

240
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,550
Thank you.

241
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:47,220
And it's the Final Performance, so we have a special Guider.

242
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,690
(G) I-dle Yuqi is with us. Hello, Yuqi Guider.

243
00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:08,360
Hello everyone, say hello to our guardians again. Okay, first of all, hello everyone. (G)I-DLE is really grateful for your invitation. Actually, we couldn't be together from the beginning, but now our trainees are together.

244
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,290
Thank you so much for being able to do this. Really, I just watched the stage for a while. Now...

245
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:30,680
Our friends Trainee are very enthusiastic, handsome and good, so today we are very, very looking forward to the final evaluation, and the most support is that we all work hard for our dreams.

246
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:41,450
In fact, I seem to be coming to a place in Korea to celebrate the New Year, but considering the feelings of the Trainee, I really understand and want to cheer for them.

247
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:50,840
I hope you won't get hurt on today's stage and do better. Come on, come on. Thank you.

248
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,140
Oh, yeah, try it. Come on. Fighting.

249
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,930
Today, Guider HUI's support team will be of great help.

250
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:01,740
Guider KWON EUNBI, you have not seen Trainees for a long time. What do you think?

251
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:08,900
Anyway, today should be one of the most unforgettable days in my life.

252
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:24,290
I also remember my Final Round like it was yesterday. Today, don't think of this stage as a competition, but really enjoy it. I hope you can do your best to finish it well.

253
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,110
To our trainees, fighting!

254
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Ok, thank you,. Next, let's meet Guider HUI. Please say hello to the trainees and Guardians all over the world.

255
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,730
Hello, everyone.

256
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,390
I'm HUI.

257
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,670
First of all, I'm very thankful for...

258
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,570
What?

259
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,710
I'm very thankful for

260
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,020
many Guardians.

261
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,520
Because

262
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,830
we are also very happy to have you.

263
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,290
Thank you very much.

264
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,060
And while I was doing this show, thanks to

265
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,620
all the trainees,

266
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:17,080
I think I have learned a lot and reflected a lot about when I first started working towards my idol dream.

267
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:27,090
I also thought about practicing harder, and I want to say to Trainee our friends who have made a lot of memories together that this time is too hard.

268
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,350
So far, all the Trainee who have participated in this program have worked hard. Thank you.

269
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,710
All right

270
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:42,010
Thank you, and the enthusiastic ERIC Guider also came to the Final Performance, today's feeling should be different.

271
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,840
Hello, I'm ERIC from THE BOYZ.

272
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,200
Hello, I'm ERIC.

273
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:57,260
First of all, this is how I spent my time with my friends at Starlight Boys.

274
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,040
I seem to have grown a lot during this time.

275
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,240
The most important thing is it's a long journey.

276
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,580
It's been really hard for trainees.

277
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,160
I want to give you a warm round of applause, and more importantly, to add luster to this occasion together today.

278
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,490
And thank you very much Guardians for coming.

279
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,900
Although today is the end of this long journey,

280
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:28,100
to all the trainees who have a new beginning in the future, I also support you wholeheartedly.

281
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,030
Thank you all.

282
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,710
All right.

283
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,260
Guider HANHAE, who has been working more seriously than anyone else this time, nice to see you. Please say your greeting.

284
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,070
Hello, everyone. I'm HANHAE. Hello.

285
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,720
First...

286
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,420
Although all the Guiders are serious too, I think our trainees were the most serious.

287
00:33:50,420 --> 00:34:02,990
In the moment when there was no camera, I also saw the sincerity of everyone around me, so I believe everyone's sincerity will be conveyed, and I hope today I'll put on the best performance in front of the Guardians and my friends and family.

288
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:12,530
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Next, our optimistic Guider, YOON. Good to see you. The Final Performance is coming. How are you feeling?

289
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,570
Hello, I'm YOON from STAYC.

290
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:24,850
Because I'm well aware of how intensely the trainees prepared for today, so I'm also

291
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:31,429
very nervous, and I'm also very excited to see the trainees' passion.

292
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:40,179
I've gained more insights and felt more excited, so it's a good opportunity for me to support what Trainees will do in the future.

293
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:46,870
I will always keep an eye on you, and I will always support you.

294
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:56,170
All right, thank you. Mr. LEE SEUNG GI, who is responsible for training the Trainees' vocal and cheering them up.

295
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:02,830
Yes, the Trainees are finally coming to the final stage. Please give them a word of encouragement while expressing your feelings.

296
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,890
Yes, hello, I'm LEE SEUNG GI.

297
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,930
Hello, I'm LEE SEUNG GI.

298
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,920
Just now,

299
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,560
From the very beginning, we spent so much time with these Trainees at Starlight Boys.

300
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:30,130
It makes me very excited and moved. Besides the Trainees on the Final Performance stage today,

301
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,190
the 69 Trainees who have been here

302
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:46,220
at the start of the program are also here now, some are watching on TV, and I want to applaud all the Trainees again.

303
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,650
And today,

304
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,030
for the final nine people who will make their debut through the Final Performance today,

305
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,140
I really hope they

306
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,280
soar as a global group,

307
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,820
and I hope it will be a group that will take the whole world by storm.

308
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,950
All the best!

309
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,750
Thank you to the Guiders for your encouragement.

310
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,880
Starlight Boys' Final Performance.

311
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,850
Who will be the nine protagonists who will realize the great dream of debuting?

312
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:34,080
The final nine members selected through tonight's Final Performance will communicate with fans around the world in the future.

313
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,380
You will grow up and mature

314
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,850
into true global artists.

315
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,840
Also,

316
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,670
the member of POLARIXC who gets the most support from Guardians across the world and makes his debut in the top rank

317
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,770
will be the center of the debut team.

318
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,110
As a representative of the Guardians, I am also looking forward to what kind of team will be born.

319
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:13,090
The name of a new global idol team created by Guardians around the world.

320
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,530
Are you curious about that?

321
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,310
The debut team's name of Starlight Boys

322
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,410
now

323
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,380
is going to be announced.

324
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,440
Yes, there is only one team that fans around the world are crazy about.

325
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,010
POLARIX.

326
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:57,690
Nine stars together, like the Polaris, the brightest star in the night sky. It means the creation of infinite possibilities.

327
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,870
For them to grow into a group as handsome as its name, please support them in the future.

328
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,330
With the love and support of fans all over the world, the upcoming global group

329
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,290
POLARIX, consisting of 9 debuting members

330
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,140
and the honorary 1st place Trainee.

331
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,190
You have not forgotten that this will be born out of Guardians' votes, right?

332
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,070
Guardians,

333
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,610
vote for the Starlight Boy you're cheering on now.

334
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,200
All right. This is Starlight Boys' Final Performance Mission.

335
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,660
It's time to see the performance prepared by the 18 trainees.

336
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:57,000
The 18 trainees who will put on the Final Performance today will be divided into two groups of nine to perform new songs on the stage.

337
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,680
The Debut Evaluation Songs of the Final Performance will be revevaled later.

338
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,590
Guardians should also have confirmed it through the iQIYI app, right?

339
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,630
Final Performance's first Debut Evaluation Song

340
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,690
is a song with both cool and fresh charms.

341
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,450
Pretty Dirty Boy.

342
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,620
The 2nd Debut Evaluation Song of the Final

343
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,100
is an impressive song with a strong and charismatic performance,

344
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,910
called MILLIONAIRE.

345
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,030
Both songs are very charming ones.

346
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,880
Yes, I think our Guiders are also full of expectations for the stage.

347
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,750
On the Final Performance stage of Starlight Boys decided by the votes of Guardians around the world,

348
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:21,430
what songs and what Positions on the stage will the Trainees choose?

349
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,000
The first stage.

350
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,200
Let's start with 《Pretty Dirty Boy》.

351
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,330
From the final practice of the Trainees to the final performance.

352
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,190
We will reveal it now.

353
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,530
Light now, Right now.

354
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:50,620
To the 18 Trainees who survived the Second Ranking Announcement Ceremony

355
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,230
of Starlight Boys,

356
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,150
congratulations, everyone.

357
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:07,710
Now, you are just one step away from your debut, and only one more task is left.

358
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,430
The title of the Final Performance is...

359
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,850
the Debut Evaluation Mission.

360
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,810
-Debut Evaluation.
-Are you going to debut?

361
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,490
The Evaluation will choose who will debut?

362
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:38,410
In the Final Performance, you will be divided into two groups of nine.

363
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,630
You'll be performing new songs.

364
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,010
New songs?

365
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,750
New songs.

366
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,840
So awesome.

367
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,100
What is the final song to be performed in the Debut Evaluation Mission?

368
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,830
-Everyone is curious about it, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

369
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,400
Starlight Boys Debut Evaluation Mission Final Performance Song,

370
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,010
right now,

371
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,230
is announced.

372
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,530
-So novel.
-It's highly anticipated.

373
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,760
The first song is Pretty Dirty Boy.

374
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,620
Pretty Dirty Boy?

375
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,270
Isn't that me?

376
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,390
I already feel fresh.

377
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:35,820
-It's cute. It seems to be cute.
-It's totally a hip hop Dance.

378
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:48,070
-Very cool.
-Come on.

379
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:01,180
-Not bad.
-Powerful and fresh.

380
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,330
I think this song is very suitable for cute people.

381
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:14,560
Ah. Let's do this. "Pretty Dirty Boy" suits me very well. I must do this song.

382
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:22,040
I heard "Pretty Dirty Boy" and I do quite like it. I think it suits my style.

383
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,330
-It's so youthful.
-So cute.

384
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,370
And the second song.

385
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:32,750
-"Millionaire."
-"Millionaire"?

386
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,130
Oh, this song is mine.

387
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,990
This is it. This is it.

388
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,690
Cool!

389
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:59,780
I love this. This is my song.

390
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,800
"MILLIONAIRE" is really sexy.

391
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,390
I feel satisfied.

392
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,860
That's great.

393
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,810
He made me excited. And when I heard it...

394
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,680
It's really my song. It's... It really suits me.

395
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,250
After the First Ranking Announcement Ceremony...

396
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:25,180
Through the final song Position Battle vote, you have to prepare for the Debut Evaluation Mission,

397
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,560
the song selection and distribution of parts.

398
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,440
All Polaris

399
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:39,960
will be decided according to the choice of the Guardians.

400
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,000
-It's been decided?
-Really?

401
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,770
Really?

402
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:23,720
-Can't I do this even if I want to?
-I can't do it.
-Please, please.

403
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,870
My gosh, we know nothing?

404
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:39,910
I wonder what kind of performance my fans want to watch me perform. Will it be a song that suits my style?

405
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:45,380
Or will they challenge me with a harder song?

406
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,670
I'm still a little nervous.

407
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,340
Wow, so no matter what, you must be able to do your part well.

408
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,510
They have to know how to read my mind.

409
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,730
Please.

410
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,890
I hope they receive my telepathy signals.

411
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,410
When they saw my performances,

412
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,880
I hope they'll acknowledge my voice tone and dance style, and vote for me.

413
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:13,410
The final vote for the Final Performance Songs and Positions for the 18 trainees. What are the results?

414
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,380
Is it out now? They're revealing it now?

415
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,150
It'll be announced at Starlight Academy tomorrow.

416
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:33,380
-How can I fall asleep?
-I can't fall asleep today!
-Look, if you fall asleep...

417
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,410
Read my mind, please.

418
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,020
Guardians, I will send a telepath.

419
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,900
-Let's go.
-OK.

420
00:46:51,900 --> 00:47:06,920
-Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-MILLIONAIRE.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

421
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,830
Remove it and there it is.

422
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,690
So nervous.

423
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,830
This is the most important.

424
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:22,380
Please choose the song and Position you want.

425
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:35,030
-LINGQI. Let's go.
-LINGQI. Let's go.

426
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:44,160
-LINGQI. What song are you going to sing, LINGQI LINGQI will probably choose《Pretty Dirty Boy》.

427
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,160
To be honest, I want both of them.

428
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,790
The two songs have completely different vibes.

429
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,780
This is a little sexy.

430
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,680
This is a bit refreshing.

431
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,810
Which one do you think I suit the most?

432
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,150
-LINGQI?
-LINGQI?

433
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,840
LINGQI, you're "Pretty Dirty Boy" Vocal 1.

434
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,680
Vocal 1?

435
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,810
-Nice.
-I think it suits you.
-Since the vocal range is pretty high.

436
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,770
Vocal 1.

437
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,010
No one can take it now.

438
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,490
Don't touch.

439
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:42,730
When I heard "Pretty Dirty Boy," I liked it very much, because the Polaris has many parts that I thought were really suitable for me.

440
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,020
I'm very sure on this song.

441
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,070
MILLIONAIRE.

442
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,390
I chose it.

443
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:03,380
I really, really want to sing Vocal 2 of MILLIONAIRE.

444
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:12,620
I haven't performed on the stage of a hip-hop style, and I have confidence in that. I feel that Vocal 2 appeals me.

445
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,580
So I chose this one.

446
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:27,590
In my opinion, this is the most brilliant part of the song, so I want Vocal 1.

447
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,110
Actually,

448
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,530
I didn't choose based on the songs. I just want to be with the members I want to team up with.

449
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:46,980
This is my goal. I want to team up with HAN GYUL, LEE JUN HYUK, and YANG DONG HWA

450
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,230
to present 《MILLIONAIRE》 together, so I chose 《MILLIONAIRE》.

451
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,920
I chose to be

452
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,820
the Vocal 2 of 《MILLIONAIRE》.

453
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,550
I think I can get it by acting.

454
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,810
I am very satisfied with this part.

455
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,450
I choose 《Pretty Dirty Boy》.

456
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:18,130
-I like this one.
-Then do it together. Let's do it together.

457
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,830
Well, no.

458
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,450
This is the last performance.

459
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,860
I want to let everyone know about

460
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,320
a different SHAO ZI HENG.

461
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,690
I'll reveal the "RAP2" part for "MILLIONAIRE" first.

462
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,300
I really want the second song "MILLIONAIRE."

463
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,640
This is my song!

464
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,980
The part I want should be...

465
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,570
the RAP part.

466
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,890
Who is it?

467
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,710
Who is it?

468
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:18,350
Very good!

469
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,470
Guys, I got to go. Bye.

470
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,040
-We all got what we want.
-I'll try, that's all.

471
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,990
-Happy. Happy.
-Happy.

472
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:44,260
-So who is Pretty Dirty Boy's Rap 3? I really don't know who it could be.
-Isn't it LEE DA EUL?

473
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:50,690
When singing happy songs, fans seem to like it very much. So they should recommend Pretty Dirty Boy to me.

474
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,530
This song might be recommended to me. Vocal is fine.

475
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,670
Rap is okay too.

476
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:02,630
I'm really, really nervous. I really want to join Team《MILLIONAIRE》.

477
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,730
What a manly man.

478
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:12,840
Actually, my fans prefer my cute side more, so they'll probably pick《Pretty Dirty Boy》for me.

479
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,950
Actually, I can do any Rap Position.

480
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,880
Rap 2?

481
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:39,840
-Skilled rapper.
-Yes, as long as it's the rap part. Thank god.
-As long as it's the rap. -Cool, cool.

482
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,050
Three, two, one.

483
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,330
What is it?

484
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:57,440
I felt happy. Cause, while it's a pity I can't be the Polaris,

485
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:09,690
it's a part I can showcase myself well. It's a part I like too. It feels like Guardians felt my signals. Thank you very much. Love you.

486
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:16,110
Here we go. Vocal line-up.
MIN JAE is so nervous now.
MIN JAE.

487
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:22,800
I can be here. I just want the part, "Yeah, yeah."

488
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,850
What will it be?
Ah, I can't predict it.
"MILLIONAIRE," Vocal 6.
I'll reveal it.
Quick.

489
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,100
LINGQI.

490
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,870
LINGQI!

491
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,210
Why is LINGQI here?

492
00:53:51,210 --> 00:54:00,460
-I didn't expect to be elected to MILLIONAIRE.
-I feel that LINGQI can show the feeling of coolness very well, because he's so cute. I think he's very suitable for Pretty Dirty Boy.

493
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,220
The style

494
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,750
is very sexy.

495
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:08,630
Turns out fans want to see this style.

496
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:11,760
Something big has happened.

497
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:17,400
-MIN JAE.
-No, no, no.
-MIN JAE, MIN JAE.

498
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:24,880
-The name is short
-The name is short. The name is short.
-Two words. Two words.

499
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,150
Two words, CONGB.

500
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,730
What? What?

501
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,670
Is CONGB Rapping?

502
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:39,070
CONGB is Rap 1? What's going on?
I guess they want to see a different side of him.

503
00:54:50,070 --> 00:55:00,310
I was scared out of my wits. That's interesting. Please, not like this, Guardians.

504
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:05,860
I have no rap experience at all... How could it be me?

505
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:11,110
How could it be me?

506
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,520
Sorry. I'm revealing

507
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,920
Vocal 5.

508
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:21,680
Who will it be?

509
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,400
HE XI LONG?

510
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:32,480
HE XI LONG?
It really exceeded my expectations. My heart skipped a beat.

511
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,710
I am 100% confident that I will go to "Pretty Dirty Boy."

512
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,280
But

513
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,070
I will try to make sure I...

514
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:48,800
digest it well, and then, um, complete this performance. Please look forward to it.

515
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,020
-Really, really.
-One,

516
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,950
Two, three.

517
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,290
Two, one.

518
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:07,770
Two, three.

519
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:14,830
-I'm gonna sing. I'm gonna sing.
-It's a short name. Is it MIN JAE?

520
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,910
Thank goodness!

521
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,950
Four left.

522
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,570
This is really interesting. Pretty Dirty Boy should be PENTOR.

523
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:43,780
PENTOR.

524
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:53,350
I think Trainee PENTOR has the biggest advantage. He's cool and cute. And he's very good at Vocal.

525
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,120
Polaris.

526
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,280
He could be the Polaris.

527
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,750
When it comes to《MILLIONAIRE》,

528
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:04,110
The people who fit the song's vibes and dance is probably... HAN GYUL?

529
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,200
HAN GYUL or...

530
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,550
ZI HENG, maybe?

531
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:13,570
For "Millionaire," HAN GYUL was the first to come to my mind.

532
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,610
Okay, this is the time for you to get nervous.

533
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,460
I can't do this.

534
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:28,640
I think the Guardians want to see me show vocals that are more powerful and strong.

535
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,730
I believe that they are also clear about which part I can pull off. I feel quite relieved.

536
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,430
-SHAO ZI HENG, are you okay? Not nervous?
-I'm not nervous. I'm not nervous.

537
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,460
-Ah, no.
-I chose the Polaris part for "MILLIONAIRE."

538
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:49,640
So I believe my fans will know my intentions, and cast their votes accordingly.

539
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:56,000
It'd be a pity. I feel more and more that if it wasn't me, it'd be a pity.

540
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,960
Then who on earth is the lead singer 1?

541
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,470
He's...

542
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,780
He's...

543
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:18,370
Seems that I am going to sing this song.

544
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:24,780
Really? What's going on? Wait a minute. This is something I didn't expect.

545
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:31,960
No, it must be one of these three.

546
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,400
Really, is it Pretty Dirty Boy?

547
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,800
-What if it is?
-My practice?
-But it doesn't make any sense.

548
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,630
-PENTOR and HAN GYUL.
-Please.

549
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,490
Wait. Polaris?

550
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:59,040
--The Polaris!
-I thought HAN GYUL or ZI HENG would definitely be here.
-Now HAN GYUL or SHAO ZI HENG might join 《MILLIONAIRE》, but there is only one Position left.

551
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,910
-There is only one Position left.
-SHAO ZI HENG for《Pretty Dirty Boy》.

552
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:08,070
《Pretty Dirty Boy》 SHAO ZI HENG.

553
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:15,080
-That's interesting.
-It's interesting if the fans choose this one.

554
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,940
Because my fans are my everything, I'll respect all their decisions.

555
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,970
-Here, say something.
-"Pretty Dirty Boy."

556
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,510
-Okay. At the same time.
-Wait.

557
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:33,110
All right, the both of you, lower your head.

558
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:39,040
-Is it HAN GYUL or SHAO ZI HENG?
-HAN GYUL or SHAO ZI HENG?

559
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,690
Two...

560
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:46,150
Three!

561
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,860
-Three!
-Three!

562
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:59,390
-What is it? What is it?
-He doesn't know yet.

563
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:06,680
I also believe that I will get that Polaris position. You gave me confidence.

564
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:10,370
SHAO ZI HENG...

565
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:18,010
I didn't think I'd get this song, but I'm grateful to Guardians. I'm in charge of the Polaris in Pretty Dirty Boy.

566
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:24,700
I'm in charge of the Polaris, a position full of expectations. I will try my best to perform it.

567
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:39,180
First of all, it's nice to meet everyone on our team.

568
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,990
-This team is so fresh to me.
-I don't think I've ever cooperated with them, right?

569
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:50,430
And everyone is lovely and beautiful on the whole.

570
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,700
Really, you are the biggest surprise here.

571
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,810
Actually, dirty is extra.

572
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,490
Actually, HAN GYUL is a little surprising.

573
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:10,120
But he's very good at this kind of thing because he always enjoys himself.

574
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,880
So on the whole,

575
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,590
They complement each other.

576
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,250
Thanks to you, Guardians,

577
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,740
we get the rare chance to perform such a happy performance.

578
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:27,720
We will try our best to prepare an interesting stage for the Guardians and Guiders.

579
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,190
First of all, I feel that we don't have much time to practice.

580
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:39,000
I don't think we have too much time to do this. So what I think is, do things like memorizing the lyrics and learning the dance together.

581
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,340
When you're done,

582
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,300
-gather when I say so later.
-Got it.

583
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,630
Our Polaris is HAN GYUL.

584
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:54,510
I've always wanted to perform with HAN GYUL. Cause I think he looks very

585
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:57,740
He seems very, very reliable.

586
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,350
First of all, let's practice individually.

587
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:08,090
I really have no experience in rapping.

588
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,230
But this song's rap part

589
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,520
is really hard.

590
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:26,620
What do I do? What do I do now?

591
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,880
-You sing this line.
-Which line?
-This line.

592
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,330
But it's so fast. Very fast.

593
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:53,970
Let's start by getting the rhythm right.

594
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,990
How about sharing half of the lyrics with me?

595
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:05,360
Well, it's like this.

596
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,010
As long as the beat is right.

597
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,830
It'll be okay if we practice more.

598
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,790
Be more relaxed directly and follow the rhythm a little more.

599
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:27,320
Don't freak out just because you've never sang rap before. I hope you can relax a little more. I used to be like that too.

600
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,490
The first time I rapped,

601
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,990
-I kept asking myself, what do I do? What do I do?
-I feel the same way now.

602
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,940
People who sing well can also rap well.

603
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:40,450
You rap very well.

604
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,910
-I can do it.
-You can do it, you can really do it.

605
01:03:50,660 --> 01:04:01,210
Yeah I go freaky freaky like a rockstar
Wicked wicked looking monster

606
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,750
I'm so thankful.

607
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,090
Now the end of the first section.

608
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,610
Because there were so many people, it's...

609
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,080
so hard.

610
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,190
It's a lot of back and forth. I feel like I'm being punished.

611
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,420
It's tough on you.

612
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:50,620
Wait a minute.

613
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,910
Because there are still many shortcomings.

614
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:59,980
We need more practice time, but HAN GYUL has calmed us down.

615
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,140
Very happy.

616
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,350
It's over.

617
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:21,180
Now, let's organize the formation. PENTOR, stand here.

618
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:21,940
PENTOR.

619
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,590
Well, PENTOR stands here.

620
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,260
XIN CHE.

621
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,590
LEE DA EUL.

622
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,120
LEE DA EUL needs to come out a little bit like this.

623
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:46,890
Yes. Mm. Very good. Good. 5, 6, 7. Wow... What a mess.

624
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:56,330
HAN GYUL confirmed all the formations today and told us the details of all the formation movements.

625
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:57,900
I think he's a great Polaris.

626
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:13,570
That's the end of part 1.
The end.

627
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,490
All done.

628
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,730
Thank you.

629
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,450
Okay.

630
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,550
How do we match the dance?

631
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,140
This is bad.

632
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:33,040
This is bad.

633
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,990
Let's burn the midnight oil.

634
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:41,640
Because it's the last performance, we should be ambitious.

635
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,000
XIN CHE.

636
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:56,040
-Practice.
-Okay.
-12:30 a.m.
-Okay.

637
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,190
Okay. Thank you.

638
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:05,250
Today.

639
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,110
Okay.

640
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,470
Today.

641
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,150
SUNG MIN.

642
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:19,020
-By 12:30.
-Shall we gather at 12:30?

643
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,470
Assemble at 12:30, YOO JUN.

644
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,970
Assemble at 12:30.

645
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:31,529
This is my last stage

646
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:33,149
in this program.

647
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:37,310
No matter what, I'll do my best.

648
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,010
Show everyone the best performance,

649
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,010
and debut.

650
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,740
Although I do my best for every performance, I will work even harder this time and showcase even more improvement onstage.

651
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:56,270
I'll show everyone an even more handsome me.

652
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:33,210
Okay, the first nine Trainees of the debut assessment, Team 《Pretty Dirty Boy》, has finished performing.

653
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:36,240
Everyone, what do you think about the trainees' performance? Was it good?

654
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:45,860
As the Guardian Representative, I feel very proud seeing these trainees' brightest side on the stage.

655
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:53,740
Guiders look very relieved too. Guider ERIC who has always given lessons with passion,

656
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:57,630
you were with them for the final lesson too. What do you think about these trainees' performance?

657
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:03,950
Well, first of all, I was also there at the performance– I also watched the practice,

658
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,880
Ah, looking at this performance today, compared to your practice,

659
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,080
you're much cooler,

660
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:13,830
and as the song says, it was a pretty performance.

661
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:20,780
Yes. Guider YOON really seemed to have been immersed in the performance. Can we hear what you thought about it?

662
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:34,030
Yes, first of all, I was actually very touched! You all looked like a united team, so I was very happy. And when you walked forward, I was thinking, "Wow, is this what youth is?" I couldn't stop smiling.

663
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:38,100
It's a very impressive stage. Thank you for your performance.

664
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:44,920
All right, thank Guiders for their praise, and please continue to pay attention to the next stage with a supportive heart.

665
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,110
Trainees, please get off the stage.

666
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,950
Thank you. Thank you.

667
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:55,400
Thank you.

668
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:03,810
The Starlight Boys will be decided by the votes of the global Guardians.

669
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:15,120
A global vote is being held to decide the debut members of POLARIX. The light of Guardians supporting Starlight Boys is quite popular.

670
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,130
Now here,

671
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:26,540
all the Guardians at the Final Performance and the Guardians watching the program and all the people around the world,

672
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:32,070
if you still haven't voted, please light up the light for the brightest boy.

673
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:35,270
you can now vote on iQIYI.

674
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,770
The Starlight Boys Debut Evaluation Mission.

675
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,410
Before enjoying the next performance,

676
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,550
we're revealing the real-time debut votes line

677
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,710
and the 9th place Trainee.

678
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,430
The trainee that is being revealed right now,

679
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:09,680
is the trainee that's at the 9th place, the cut off line for debut,

680
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,290
given the last week's 'Light Up' and the final's first round of 'Light Up'...

681
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,310
"Starlight Boys" Final,

682
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:20,700
the debut member

683
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,710
of the global group, POLARIX.

684
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,790
In real time,

685
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,360
here's the trainee currently at 9th place.

686
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,770
It'll be revealed through the screen.

687
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,610
Please reveal it now.

688
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:46,670
At present, the Trainee with the real-time Light ranked ninth is the Trainee LEE DA EUL.

689
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:57,700
Now the public ranking is not the final one of the Trainees. Will this result remain unchanged until the end?

690
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:03,630
Or will it be changed completely? This depends on the votes of the Guardians.

691
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:11,900
Now the 1st and 2nd rounds of the Final are over. The Light up for the third round will end at 9:30 p.m.

692
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,730
Guardians, please light up for the shining dreams of the Trainees.

693
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:24,750
Starlight Boys' Final Performance, Debut Evaluation Mission.

694
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,390
Now it's time for the next stage.

695
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,490
The second stage.

696
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:33,970
This is a song that shows the mature charm of the Trainees.

697
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:40,850
The stage is ready for the Trainees to present MILLIONAIRE.

698
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:53,770
Trainees who have proved their light in front of the Guardians, what changes will the Trainees have in the Final Performance? It is really very exciting.

699
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,430
《MILLIONAIRE》's performance

700
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,890
will be revealed now.

701
01:16:58,890 --> 01:16:59,870
Light now,

702
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:00,950
Right now.

703
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,380
There's only the Final Performance left. So I'm very glad that

704
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:15,800
-we can do this together.
-I'm happy. -As long as we're happy.

705
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:25,010
-Getting to do it with JUN HYUK itself is very difficult. I wanted to do it together. We've never been together before.
-Yeah, we've never been together,

706
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:32,680
Firstly, the member line up is very good. I hope to create a really cool performance. I'm looking forward to it.

707
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,840
After we debut, hopefully we become real Millionaires.

708
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:44,170
-Okay, so now, why don't we take a look at the full version of the dance?
-Yes!
-Yes!

709
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,110
Polaris!

710
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:03,020
The pelvis move...

711
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,790
Thrusting to the sky...

712
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,290
It suits you. Sexy.

713
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:19,140
I think MILLIONAIRE is very sexy and very memorable.

714
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,030
I think this song

715
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:25,000
is gonna be perfect for me. It's gonna be sexy for me to dance to it.

716
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:29,040
It feels just right for someone like me.

717
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,210
What is it like for someone like you?

718
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:35,790
A bit... mature?

719
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:40,970
For the Polaris Position in MILLIONAIRE,

720
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:45,650
everyone is so serious.

721
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:48,330
Polaris.

722
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:53,970
I think it is a position that gives everyone much pressure.

723
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:57,640
I picked the Polaris first.

724
01:19:53,700 --> 01:20:02,540
Is everyone's pelvis okay? Is your pelvis healthy?
ZI HENG, you have to thrust your pelvis really hard.

725
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:05,090
I'll do my best.

726
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:09,420
Let's have a try together.

727
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:16,480
For this one, don't go too far back.

728
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,550
One more time.

729
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:29,520
This part.

730
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,250
First down and then up.

731
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:05,070
Why is "Millionaire"... It's a really cool and sexy song...

732
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,170
But the dance... So...

733
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:11,170
I think my vibe's a little more youthful, fresher,

734
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,790
and brighter.

735
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,810
I think "MILLIONAIRE" will be a little difficult for me.

736
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,570
Am I going to the thrusting group?

737
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:25,860
I think LINGQI will choose VOCAL1 of "Pretty Dirty Boy."

738
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:34,130
-No one can take it now.
-The competition about lead singer 1 over there is fierce.

739
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:47,560
-I'll go over the details with ZAI and then teach you two Dance.
-Practicing alone?

740
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,160
Oh my god.

741
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:56,850
Aren't you doing right?

742
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,670
From here...

743
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:12,390
8 and 1. Everyone would help each other in details and moves.

744
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,600
On the same height.

745
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,020
At least I won't let others down.

746
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:27,260
I'm going to show everyone a sexy LINGQI.

747
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,720
But I will try to digest it well.

748
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,080
Everyone, please look forward to it.

749
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:54,260
The hip-thrust dance.

750
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:10,010
Because this performance is really the last performance of this long journey.

751
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,250
I'll do everything I want without regret

752
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,750
before leaving.

753
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,770
With 10,000% of my strength

754
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:19,090
and 10,000% effort.

755
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,570
I really want to leave a memorable performance in my life.

756
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:29,620
The final performance is really our dream performance.

757
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:36,520
It's a new song mission, and we are the first owners of this song. It's very meaningful.

758
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:38,490
I want to end on a high note.

759
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:45,270
Give everyone a satisfactory performance and then draw a perfect end to my journey.

760
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,750
We have one last time.

761
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,560
Because this is the last performance.

762
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,880
We want to present the best performance to our fans.

763
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:07,270
I will prove with my efforts

764
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,730
that you're not wrong about me.

765
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:45,020
The 2nd Debut Evaluation Song "MILLIONAIRE"

766
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,990
was performed by nine Trainees on the stage.

767
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:51,700
Guardians, what do you think of the progress the Trainees have made?

768
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:07,980
When we first met at Starlight Academy, we were still very young and immature, and it's really novel and amazing to see such tough and powerful performances.

769
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:13,370
Yes, I also want to hear the thoughts of our Guiders watching their performances here.

770
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:23,020
Just like your choreography, Guider CHOI YOUNGJUN, how do you think of the final stage of our Trainees?

771
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:26,690
Really,

772
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:31,060
I will also scream when I see them.

773
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:36,410
Every member showed their true potential.

774
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:40,580
I feel very proud.

775
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:47,870
I don't know if I'm too greedy, but it would be nice if your moves were a little more uniformed.

776
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:51,330
At least that's what I thought.

777
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:59,410
In the future, if you do this performance again, you will be able to do it even better. Anyway, you performed it really well.

778
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:05,160
Also XING XING, you managed to do so well while you're injured. Thank you so much.

779
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:16,900
Also, the other members, while you're practicing, there were parts I thought, oh you shouldn't do this, oh just a little more of this.

780
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,180
I feel like they've been fixed here.

781
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:28,880
So, in front of so many Guardians, being able to show this, I'm very proud of you. Thank you so much.

782
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,270
All right. Thank you

783
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:40,120
Our special Guider Yuqi, what do you think of the stage of the Trainee?
Actually, this is the first time I've seen the stage so close.

784
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:45,930
Personally, I like this kind of song very much. First, you looked very united,

785
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:51,390
and you were all very sexy.

786
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:55,470
Very, very... how should I put it... really very, very sexy and handsome. And I hope

787
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,580
You can, uh,

788
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:03,580
just enjoy the stage. I really look forward to it. I really like the style of your team. I hope you can get good scores.

789
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:10,720
And don't leave regrets for yourself. Fighting.

790
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:10,530
-Fighting.
-Thank you very much.

791
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:17,490
In particular, Guider HUI is showing how proud he is. Please tell us your feelings after watching their performance.

792
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:21,060
That's what I want to say——

793
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,350
Great!

794
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,530
Really.

795
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,310
So cool.

796
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:35,060
I have watched the Trainees grow from the beginning.

797
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:37,140
Today, really,

798
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:40,690
you performed like you've already debuted.

799
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:46,130
You guys give me the feeling that you're truly ready to debut now.

800
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,030
Really.

801
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:52,590
I'm so touched. You've all worked so hard during this period.

802
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,820
You're the best!

803
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:55,140
Well done!

804
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:56,650
Thank you.

805
01:30:57,830 --> 01:31:06,290
Yes, it's really a wonderful stage by the trainees. Our Guiders seem to be very touched. Trainees, you've worked hard. Please exit the stage.

806
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,090
Thank you.

807
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:09,910
Thank you.

808
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,310
Hi.

809
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:20,810
The Final Performance with the Debut Evaluation Songs are over.

810
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:24,300
Guardians, have you all casted your 'Light up' votes?

811
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,620
The Final Performance 'Light up' will end shortly.

812
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:37,800
When the voting is closed and the votes are tabulated, the final rankings of the Starlight Boys will be announced.

813
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,480
Please stay here with us until the last moment of the debut.

814
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:49,870
The live atmosphere of the Final of the Starlight Boys, an iQIYI Global idol talent show,

815
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,190
is getting warmer and warmer.

816
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:58,410
What gifts would Guardians most like to receive before the year is over?

817
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:07,670
Yes, perhaps, if the Trainees are asked to choose the gift they want most, it should be their debut.

818
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:15,740
Last Christmas, Starlight Academy welcomed Santa Claus, who is as exciting and precious as the first snow.

819
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:21,940
Who is the one who makes the winter of the Trainees very warm along with exquisite gifts?

820
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,350
The Christmas Story at Starlight Academy

821
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:29,690
is going to be announced now.

822
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:39,180
Sorry. Can I watch it again?

823
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,900
Performing it again is a little...

824
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:43,470
Performing it again is a little...

825
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,230
Hello.

826
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:01,670
Hello.

827
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:05,590
Hello.

828
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,520
-Hello.
-Hello.

829
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:12,790
Wow, their hair colors are so beautiful.

830
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,290
Oh, okay.

831
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:24,000
What's going on? Are you here for a riot? Why do you look so nervous, kids?

832
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,970
-Cause we have a lot of worries.
-A lot of worries? Why?

833
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:33,320
-This is my first time as a Vocal.
-Finally.
-Isn't this what you've always wanted?

834
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:46,180
-But the part I'm doing is much higher than my usual vocal range.
-So now, there's some uncertainty about your parts.
-Everyone's a bit worried.

835
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:52,020
-Then, for today, don't be burdened and let's take a look at the performance first.
-Okay.

836
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,570
That's it?

837
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:56,820
Yes.

838
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:14,340
Well, Trainee LEE DA EUL just started singing his part.

839
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,900
-I'm going to do it.
-Can't see the full song?

840
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,500
Well...

841
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:22,530
Although we're ready, we still need some more time.

842
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:25,450
Because this is practice, but...

843
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:28,390
Ah, but now I...

844
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:31,450
Because it's like a rehearsal.

845
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:39,530
I'm really sorry. Can I watch it again?

846
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:42,480
It might be difficult to give the right feedback.

847
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,660
Do it again.

848
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:51,710
Did something happen to you guys?

849
01:35:57,190 --> 01:36:01,570
Our practice didn't go very well.

850
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:04,410
So performing it again is a little...

851
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,810
It's not presentable yet, is it?

852
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,650
It's at an embarrassing

853
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:11,450
standard right now,

854
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:13,010
So I have nothing to say.

855
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,040
Just show it to us first.

856
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:25,070
There hasn't been much time given, anyway.

857
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:27,730
Sorry.

858
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,270
Please wait a moment.

859
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:54,830
-Because the song is very high-pitched.
-He's sad because he can't sing it.
-He can't get up to the pitch...

860
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:58,620
-He can listen to it again after that. -Why did he end up with the "pre-chorus 1" part?

861
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,080
Why are you laughing?

862
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,630
I think he ran out too fast.

863
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,070
SUNG MIN.

864
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,170
SUNG MIN, SUNG MIN, how is it over there?

865
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:27,090
The atmosphere is very cold.

866
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,420
When should we go in?

867
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,590
They'll give me the signal.

868
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:33,910
They'll give me the signal.

869
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:37,340
Since the Guiders are coming today,

870
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,820
how about we give them a surprise?

871
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:52,590
Because today is the Interim Check. One team has to dance badly. It's like a real prank camera. Gotta dance really badly. You have to dance super badly.

872
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,790
You have to cry when you're acting.

873
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,660
-This is gonna be fun.
-Let's just dance up to the first verse.

874
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,470
Dance up to the first verse for now.

875
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:13,800
-Yeah I go freaky freaky like a rockstar.
-The formation cannot be in sync.

876
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:23,440
-Get the lyrics wrong.
-Get the lyrics wrong too.

877
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:30,810
SUNG MIN too.

878
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,390
Gosh. I have no idea. Wow.

879
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:39,230
Sorry, but can you do it again?

880
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,650
Show it to us first.

881
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,510
Sorry.

882
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,300
I'm sorry.

883
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,270
The atmosphere seems good.

884
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:16,440
-HAN GYUL, has SUNG MIN been under a lot of pressure because of this?
-He's been stressed out about his part.

885
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,870
Was the atmosphere among the members alright during practice?

886
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:28,490
-I doubt it.
-Some members didn't really want this song in the first place.

887
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:34,980
But here's what I think. It's not my debut song, to be honest.

888
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:36,840
If this

889
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:42,630
is the reason why I don't get myself prepared for the stage, I don't think this is the right thing to do.

890
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:47,430
Oh, because it is a song that I don't want to perform, I just go through the motions.

891
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:49,060
Here, now...

892
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:52,810
It's actually a little inappropriate in this situation.

893
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:53,890
What's wrong？

894
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:56,550
What's going on?

895
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:59,070
I don't think it's appropriate in this situation.

896
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,590
What's going on?

897
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:14,750
-What?
-You guys are so bad!

898
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:21,580
I'm glad I didn't say anything. They were the only ones who were talking seriously.

899
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,450
So awkward.

900
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:30,240
You must be embarrassed.

901
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:40,720
-I feel ashamed for you.
-It's all because of YOON.
-Why is it my fault?
-YOON asked if something happened.

902
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:47,580
-Did you know about this?
-Anyone would have thought that something happened.
-So nothing happened?
-Nothing happened.

903
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:48,990
Everything's fine.

904
01:40:48,990 --> 01:41:02,940
-It's okay. -I thought so.
-This is legendary. -The training went well too.
-Ah really? You're so good at acting.
-We prepared gifts.

905
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:10,330
Letter of appointment to Guider LEE SEUNG GI. This Guider gives enthusiastic guidance

906
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:17,460
and attentive feedback to the trainees, raising the quality of the Starlight Boys' performances. We appoint you as the First-Class Guider Polaris.

907
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,340
Thank you. Thank you.

908
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:28,830
-And flowers too.
-A gift of flowers too.
-Thank you.
-And there's more. These are the cookies we made.

909
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:33,150
-Really?
-We made it ourselves.
-I'm so touched.

910
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:40,690
The one for Guider YOON is done.

911
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:55,060
Wow, I got goose bumps.

912
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:00,670
-I'm so touched.
-Appointment Letter. Guider HANHAE

913
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:04,090
Oh my god. My first award of the year.

914
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:15,350
The Guider calms down everyone with a gentle smile every time the Trainees are nervous.

915
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:19,350
So, he's now awarded Smiling Angel Polaris.

916
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:29,100
Wow, I got the Polaris. Thank you. Thank you.

917
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:37,680
Awarded with Polaris with interest boost. Thank you.
Finally, Guider YOON.

918
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,270
Whoa!

919
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:42,430
Polaris with Positive Power.

920
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:52,760
I'm Polaris with Positive Power. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so touched. Thank you.

921
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:58,670
But this is so gratifying. One star Guider Polaris. This is so gratifying. Thank you so much.

922
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:04,010
-Thank you very much indeed.
-We have been completely deceived.
-Completely.
-Everyone.

923
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:13,200
-It's not too late to change your dream. Instead of being a singer, how about being an actor?
-Really.
-How about changing a job?
-I was really fooled.
-They're so good at acting.

924
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,480
Wow, this is too much.

925
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,160
Thank you so much.

926
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:22,510
-Perfectly deceived, perfectly.
-Really.
-Perfectly.

927
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:28,800
-I want to take a photo.
-Okay, let's take a photo.
-Let's take a photo. -Sounds good.
-Feels like a graduation.

928
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,510
1, 2, 3.

929
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:53,670
"Like a millionaire," then go...

930
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:55,490
One more time?

931
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:58,020
Is it over?

932
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:05,070
Gifts from Santa have arrived at the first floor of Starlight Academy.

933
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,590
What? Santa?

934
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,030
-Let's go.
-Santa!

935
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:16,330
You can't cry.

936
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:19,350
You can't cry.

937
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:35,220
Wow! Hello.

938
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:47,190
That's good, everybody.

939
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:50,200
Welcome to your home!

940
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:57,340
Today, fans prepared this to support you.

941
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:24,540
I hope you can enjoy yourselves and have a nice day.

942
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:26,780
Let me relieve your pressure.

943
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:35,290
So? Do you believe me?

944
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:42,250
-Rice cake sausage skewers. Rice cake sausage skewers.
-Awesome.
-Rice cake sausage skewers and hot dogs.

945
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:44,990
-Churros.
-Thank you.

946
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:48,110
Rice cake sausage skewers. You can have two each.

947
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:52,270
-Thank you for the food!
-Thank you for the food!

948
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:56,630
-Relax and eat.
-Thank you.

949
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,930
Delicious.

950
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:06,390
Everyone looks better after surviving the competition.

951
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:08,600
So delicious.

952
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,130
We won.

953
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:17,030
-Thank you.
-While you're happy eating new things,

954
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:28,900
-I prepared something else. Oh, it's not a mission. It's the main event. Wait for a moment.
-I feel uneasy.

955
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:33,250
Give me a moment.

956
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:39,840
-Gifts! Gifts!
-Gifts! Gifts!
-It's Santa.
-There's this too.

957
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:46,900
-Wow, this...
-You can use these props to show your cute side.

958
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:51,870
There's a party at another place, so you can wear these,

959
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:53,690
and we can meet again at that place.

960
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:56,650
Just see you later.
I see
Thank you

961
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:10,230
Merry Christmas!

962
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:12,230
Merry Christmas!

963
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:31,690
Today, it's decorated in a Christmas style.

964
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:33,890
Speaking of Christmas...

965
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:50,460
-Gifts. Gifts.
-Of course gifts are important, but what else? What else?
-Christmas tree.
-We've got a Christmas tree. We're going to decorate it.

966
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:53,760
And play the games I prepared.

967
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:02,450
Bingo.

968
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:14,670
-Is there a team leader or something like that?
-Polaris.
-Polaris. Okay, so you two.

969
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:22,230
-Turn around. Rock, paper, scissors.
-Win once.
-Win.
-All right, let's begin. Rock, paper, scissors, 3, 2, 1.

970
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:29,570
Team 《Pretty Dirty Boy》 wins.

971
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:37,700
-It's okay.
-A man has to play rock.
-It’s okay. It’s okay.
-Let’s remove the block first.
-Okay.
-Remove a block first.

972
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:41,640
You can give it to me after you remove the block.

973
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:45,840
Okay. The first mission is...

974
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:52,440
Very good. Sing the Signal Song "Good Luck (Be My Luck)"

975
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,050
in a cute way.

976
01:48:54,050 --> 01:49:03,840
-Nice!
-The person who picked this has to do this. HAN GYUL being cute. How cute can it be?
-This is not easy.

977
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,890
Wow, HAN GYUL is turning red.

978
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:07,250
He turned red.

979
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:13,330
HAN GYUL's charm is at level 0 now. He has no understanding of this song.

980
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:17,500
Come on, one, two, three, four.

981
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:55,210
-I'll give you 2 points.
-Thank you for giving even 2 points.
-It's out of 100 points. Because acting cute is not only about your action and expressions but it also has to be sincere.

982
01:49:55,210 --> 01:50:02,220
-You seemed so macho. Who'd think you were acting cute, Mr. HAN GYUL?
-I'm sorry.
-This is a complete failure.

983
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:04,630
Ah, you failed.

984
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:12,140
-First of all, the opportunity is given to this team. Please come out and choose one.
-Who wants to participate?
-XI LONG!

985
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:18,610
-XI LONG wants to be goofy again.
-The last one.
-What will HE XI LONG choose?

986
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:19,850
Just pull it out.

987
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:30,430
Okay, okay. Praise the Trainee chosen by Guider DAESUNG for three seconds.

988
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:36,310
-Concentrate. Concentrate.
-Okay, okay.

989
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:43,860
Come on, I'm going to choose one. CONGB.

990
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:51,470
Sings very well, beautiful, and very tall. Right.

991
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:53,410
Is he tall?

992
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:57,390
-Very tall.
-This is it.

993
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:04,110
-Taller than me. Taller than me.
-Lie down. Lie down.

994
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:09,520
-First, CONGB comes out.
-I have heightening insoles.

995
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:28,200
-He needs to do this?
-He needs to do this?
-Oh, my God.

996
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:34,540
He even wore thick insoles. I don't accept that.

997
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,270
Well, CONGB's height is not tall enough.

998
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:39,170
Okay, they failed.

999
01:51:39,170 --> 01:51:41,590
Nice.

1000
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:46,010
We need to think about it. I'll let you choose as the MC.

1001
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:52,980
-CONGB, let's go. Let's go.
-This is what you deserve, CONGB.
-Everyone, pick one.

1002
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,250
This?

1003
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,680
Or this?

1004
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:59,540
My mouth worked faster than my brain.

1005
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,310
Gosh.

1006
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:10,820
-Alright, from "Pretty Dirty Boy!"
-XIN CHE.
-XIN CHE will pick.

1007
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:15,080
-Slowly, slowly.
-Slowly, slowly.

1008
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,830
I don't think XIN CHE can do this.

1009
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:28,510
-Carry a team member in a princess carry and do five squats.
-Me... Me carrying someone else?

1010
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:31,700
-Me carrying someone else?
-Carry DA EUL. DA EUL.

1011
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:42,800
Because this is not in XIN CHE's advantage in everyone's eye. Did you take the initiative to say it?

1012
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,450
I'll hold XIN CHE to do it five times.

1013
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:49,440
Please come out.

1014
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:55,920
-Okay, XIN CHE. Let's go, let's go.
-This is not interesting.

1015
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:56,630
Jump.

1016
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:58,140
Three, two, one.

1017
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:17,610
-But I'm really not satisfied.
-Right.
-It's too easy.

1018
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:22,940
When XIN CHE asked him to hold him, he jumped. But HAN GYUL didn't move a bit. Yeah.

1019
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:24,500
He stood like this.

1020
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:29,730
Now that HAN GYUL held you. Try to hold HAN GYUL, just once.

1021
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:33,550
-Just once.
-Okay.

1022
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:36,670
XIN CHE. You can do it.

1023
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:43,030
3 2 1.

1024
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:11,470
-In 5 seconds, name three Polaris trainees in the 3rd Mission.
-Hurry up. Who are they?

1025
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:16,350
-Wait, he's a foreigner.
-HAN GYUL and I.
-Time's up.

1026
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:28,360
-Why are you suddenly acting like you don't understand? Say three trainees with two syllables in their names.
-HAN GYUL, PENTOR, CONGB, LINGQI.

1027
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:34,860
But he should say three trainees. He said four.

1028
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:41,130
-That's good. Wait a minute. But he knows this many trainees.
-That's not important. This is the rule.

1029
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:44,610
Rules are the most important. Eliminated!

1030
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:02,200
Take this away.

1031
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:05,040
Okay, okay.

1032
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,570
Success!

1033
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:12,750
I've chosen this.

1034
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:21,630
This one! This one! Take this.

1035
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:29,680
It's me.

1036
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:39,020
-Expression and acting skills. And you can pass it only when MC admits it.
-DONG HWA. DONG HWA is nervous!

1037
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:42,470
All right, here we go!

1038
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:45,040
The first one is speechless.

1039
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:49,110
-Show the speechless look.
-Okay.

1040
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:52,690
Okay.

1041
01:55:53,170 --> 01:56:01,050
Okay, this is good. This is good. This is very good.

1042
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:06,190
-Okay, okay, fall in love.
-This is a little difficult.

1043
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:10,330
-Fall in love.
-This is a little difficult.

1044
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:19,220
-Go on, go on.
-So beautiful.
-What is beautiful?

1045
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:23,170
Give me a hug.

1046
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:33,990
OK.

1047
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:39,510
OK.

1048
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:44,390
Pretty good.

1049
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:49,670
Okay, that last one. This might be a little difficult. Despair.

1050
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:52,640
-With emotions. Go.
-Go.

1051
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:53,810
Ready,

1052
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:54,820
action.

1053
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:56,850
When you got your Polaris taken away.

1054
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:58,390
When you got your Polaris taken away.

1055
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:01,300
No!

1056
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:03,490
No!

1057
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:05,450
Great!

1058
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:15,970
That was awesome. Okay. Success!

1059
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:28,750
-Okay, now you can decorate your Christmas tree. please decorate the tree.
-Pull it out.

1060
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:32,830
-Pull it out. Pull it out.
-Put it in.

1061
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:40,560
What are you doing? What's wrong?

1062
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,090
Clever.

1063
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:46,910
That's a good idea.

1064
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:48,590
We can put this on it.

1065
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:50,270
Put it there. Put it there.

1066
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:05,100
Should we put this on it?

1067
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:11,870
Continue.

1068
01:58:11,870 --> 01:58:12,630
What?

1069
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:14,630
It's pretty.

1070
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,250
I really haven't decorated for a long time.

1071
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,300
I haven't decorated the Christmas tree for a long time.

1072
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,370
I haven't decorated a Christmas tree for years.

1073
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:52,570
I hope that everyone gets to debut together,

1074
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:54,110
then go to the beach together.

1075
01:58:54,850 --> 01:59:01,810
I hope all of us can stand on more stages in the future

1076
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:03,810
and that we can keep being busy.

1077
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:12,430
I wish I could be like

1078
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:18,780
this shining star, giving light and shining bright, illuminating all the people.

1079
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:23,000
I hope I can stand on a bigger stage in the future,

1080
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,560
and be the person I want to be.

1081
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:33,350
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

1082
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:09,730
The 'Light up' voting for the Final Performance of iQIYI's global idol competition show "Starlight Boys" has just closed.

1083
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:16,510
Guardians,

1084
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:20,080
have you lit up for the Trainees you support?

1085
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:33,400
The results of the 3rd round of the Light up of the Guardians voting in the past week and today's Final Light up will be combined to determine the final debut members later.

1086
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:44,540
Who will be the shining heroes born under the choice of the world's Guardians?

1087
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:57,500
Dear Guardians, I hope you can stay with the Trainees to wait for the moment when the new dream begins.

1088
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:09,490
Yes, our Trainees and Guiders have really developed a lot of affection during this time, Guider HANHAE.

1089
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:10,680
Yes.

1090
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:15,830
You seem really surprised. How about the surprise the trainees prepared?

1091
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:16,980
Ah, first of all,

1092
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:19,640
that day, the trainees were very

1093
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:29,870
strange and said things that were inappropriate for a trainee. So ERIC and I were seriously reprimanding everyone, but all of a sudden it was a surprise.

1094
02:01:29,870 --> 02:01:38,260
We were shocked and a little ashamed, and Guider LEE SEUNG GI was glad he didn't get angry. It was a little annoying seeing him like that.

1095
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:45,730
It must have been embarrassing. What was the atmosphere of the last lesson like for Guider LEE SEUNG GI?

1096
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:52,850
I thought ERIC and HANHAE were a little harsh with their words.

1097
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:56,270
It's a little bit like that, yeah.

1098
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:58,630
That's just a joke.

1099
02:01:58,670 --> 02:02:05,210
Really, as Guider ERIC said, they are not only good at dancing and singing, but also good at acting.

1100
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:09,830
With all these skills, I'm sure they will be a good artist.

1101
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:13,210
As compare to the atmosphere of the last practice we saw,

1102
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:20,830
it's certainly gratifying to see that they've shown us an even more perfect, cool, and exciting performance today at the finale.

1103
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:28,250
Guider KWON EUNBI, please share with us a moment where you felt proud of the trainees.

1104
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:40,530
Um, there are many moments that made me proud of them, but I think the most unforgettable moment is the first time I met them.

1105
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:53,440
I learned a lot from witnessing their passion then. And because it's the kind of passion that only comes during that stage of their lives, so I can't forget their gazes.

1106
02:02:53,710 --> 02:03:01,390
Thanks to the loving care of our Guiders, I think the trainees could grow and develop more.

1107
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:07,120
I hope to see the trainees on bigger and better stages in the future.

1108
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:12,000
Starlight Boys

1109
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,990
A very special stage is prepared this time.

1110
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:25,100
In order to inspire the Trainees who are going to pursue bigger dreams in the future, I would like to congratulate the team in which YOON is the Guider.

1111
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:29,320
I heard that STAYC has prepared a wonderful stage for us.

1112
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:36,710
Let's take a look at the special stage of Starlight Boys Final. Please welcome STAYC.

1113
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,590
LIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW!

1114
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:05,460
Alright. Say hello to everyone. One, two, three. Hello, everyone. We are STAYC.

1115
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:12,510
I used to sit in the front, but now I'm on the stage.

1116
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:15,410
I'm more nervous than I thought, and it feels different,

1117
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,950
especially performing in front of the Guiders.

1118
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:29,270
-This is probably the performance I've been most nervous about this year. I don't even remember how I did.
-Really? You did very well.
-Did everyone enjoy it?

1119
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:38,540
There are a lot of people here. We are going to perform GPT next. Has anyone heard it?

1120
02:07:38,930 --> 02:07:45,400
A lot of people raised their hands. If you can sing, sing with us. Everybody, we'll perform it for you now.

1121
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:33,450
It's getting hotter and hotter at the finals live. Thank you STACY and team for performing "Teddy Bear" and your new song "GPT" for us.

1122
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:42,470
The iQIYI global idol talent show, Starlight Boys Final Round, which is being broadcast live,

1123
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:45,090
is heading towards its end.

1124
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:54,360
Next is a special stage prepared by the trainees for everyone.

1125
02:11:55,110 --> 02:12:00,360
It contains their love and gratitude towards all the Guardians all over the world.

1126
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:08,750
What is this story that they want to convey to the Guardians?

1127
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,030
Let's take a look now.

1128
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:12,270
LIGHT NOW,

1129
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:13,330
RIGHT NOW.

1130
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,380
Let's practice

1131
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:33,470
What's wrong with you?

1132
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:40,320
-What is that?
-Woah!

1133
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,560
-How could there be such a thing?
-What is this?

1134
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,250
-What is this?
-What's that?

1135
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:54,550
-What is this?
-What is this?
-Have no clue.

1136
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:59,290
-There is such a thing.
-This.
-What is this?

1137
02:12:59,290 --> 02:13:02,190
There seems to be a letter.

1138
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:09,030
-Actually, I wrote a letter to each of you.
-You?
-Impossible.
-Absurd.

1139
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:18,180
-There seems to be something written here.
-Whoa, SHAO ZI HENG.
-Whoa, SHAO ZI HENG.
-SHAO ZI HENG to SHAO ZI HENG.
-I'm about to cry.

1140
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:22,930
Hello, SHAO ZI HENG.

1141
02:13:23,030 --> 02:13:24,500
SHAO ZI HENG.

1142
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:27,530
This must be my fan.

1143
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:47,020
They must have left us a support message. Let’s open them, read them,

1144
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:51,650
-and reply to them.
-Replying to them sounds great.

1145
02:13:51,650 --> 02:13:55,920
-Then I'll read mine first.
-Okay.
-Hello, JUN HYUK Oppa.

1146
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:02,140
Ever since you became the leader of MIRAE, I've always liked you. I'm a fan of your group, NOW.

1147
02:14:02,140 --> 02:14:03,950
When I heard your dream of debuting as an idol

1148
02:14:03,950 --> 02:14:12,820
with "Starlight Boys," the thought of seeing you shine on stage

1149
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:15,950
makes me very happy.

1150
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:22,860
Don't be discouraged. Showcase an even cooler and more dazzling stage! I'll always root for you. I love you.

1151
02:14:25,870 --> 02:14:33,110
Hello, ZAI. I'm a fan from Malaysia. I was deeply charmed by you from the beginning of this show.

1152
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:38,900
Your performance of "Hard Carry" was just amazing. Your dance moves were powerful and explosive.

1153
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:42,030
I can see that you've put a lot of effort into it.

1154
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:45,830
I hope this letter will bring you warmth and support.

1155
02:14:46,810 --> 02:14:48,400
Ah, SHAO ZI!

1156
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:49,870
Thank you...

1157
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:58,670
for not giving up on your dreams. Thank you for working so hard so you could stand before us. You're the shining Polaris of the Signal Song.

1158
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:04,250
Thank you for being the sun in my dark life of my senior year.

1159
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:09,760
I sincerely hope that HAN GYUL can radiate his charm on more stages.

1160
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:17,380
It must be very hard to go all the way to now. I sincerely hope that you must shine on the stage and make the debut.

1161
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:24,400
Thank you for filling my life with happiness. Thank you for saving me in my dark days.

1162
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:28,180
PENTOR's voice, whether it's singing or talking,

1163
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:30,970
It can comfort our hearts every day.

1164
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:36,120
Pursuing your dream is a wonderful thing.

1165
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:39,210
Your passion, dedication and talent are dazzling.

1166
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:44,980
There is one same sentence in the three letters.

1167
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:46,930
You are my No. 1.

1168
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:49,310
You are my number one.

1169
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:52,330
In my heart, You're the most handsome number one.

1170
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:57,260
Thank you so much for thinking that I'm the best.

1171
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,150
I just want to say that I will keep working hard

1172
02:15:59,150 --> 02:16:03,510
to be the number one in everyone's heart.

1173
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:08,450
We need to be grateful

1174
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:13,480
and give them our reply. I think it’s better to write it down.

1175
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:15,340
Okay.

1176
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:19,400
Let's write our heartfelt feelings to our fans.

1177
02:16:43,309 --> 02:16:47,760
Thinking about it makes me happy too.

1178
02:17:12,959 --> 02:17:15,299
My angelic Guardians,

1179
02:17:15,299 --> 02:17:18,610
I miss you. I love you all. I love you.

1180
02:17:18,719 --> 02:17:23,690
Guardians, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you all.

1181
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,110
Guardians.

1182
02:17:25,059 --> 02:17:27,469
I love you all so much.

1183
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:41,780
-Thank you.
-I love you guys.
-Thank you. I love you.

1184
02:17:39,959 --> 02:17:41,770
-I love you.
-I love you.

1185
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:45,670
Guardians, love you all the time. Let's stick to the end together.

1186
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:26,830
Yes, I'm glad to see that the Starlight Boys' stages are warm gifts for the Guardians.

1187
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:36,160
The Trainees on the stage today look particularly dazzling, as if Starlight Boys and their Guardians become each other's light.

1188
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:43,170
All right, see you later, trainees. Please go under the stage.

1189
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,960
This is Starlight Boys' Final Performance.

1190
02:22:51,140 --> 02:22:54,260
That's all for the stages the trainees prepared.

1191
02:22:55,510 --> 02:23:02,190
The Light Up that will determine whether the Starlight Boys will debut has just been completed.

1192
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:07,940
Later, the most shining moment will be revealed at the final ranking announcement ceremony.

1193
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:10,600
All debut members will be revealed.

1194
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:14,610
Guardians, would you please accompany us to the end?

1195
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:22,380
In the past 100 days, the Trainees chased after their dreams.

1196
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:27,250
After today, this long journey will be over.

1197
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:38,200
In the past 100 days, they may have experienced fierce competition, bitter pain, and setbacks in the Starlight Academy.

1198
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:45,080
Sharing true friendships while fighting alongside each other, I'm sure this has been a very precious memory for the trainees.

1199
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:49,550
This is not too long till the new starting point starts again.

1200
02:23:49,550 --> 02:23:52,490
It's been a special time for the trainees.

1201
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:53,470
Everyone,

1202
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:54,660
you must be curious, right?

1203
02:23:58,650 --> 02:24:01,870
The last travel story of the Starlight Boys.

1204
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:04,020
It'll be

1205
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:05,120
revealed now.

1206
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:05,030
I'll teach you to brush your teeth.

1207
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:06,890
From the bottom.

1208
02:25:06,890 --> 02:25:09,340
Brush like this.

1209
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:11,120
On top.

1210
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:12,710
Don't laugh.

1211
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:15,750
If you brush like this, it's bad for your teeth.

1212
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:19,090
You have to brush in circular motions.

1213
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:37,510
Today is the day to Starlight Boys MT.

1214
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:39,090
MT?

1215
02:25:41,370 --> 02:25:44,110
Okay.

1216
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:53,740
And there are corresponding benefits according to the principle of first come, first served.

1217
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:55,100
First come, first served?

1218
02:26:02,250 --> 02:26:08,420
ZAI.

1219
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:09,800
Let's go. Let's go.

1220
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:12,360
Where are you going?

1221
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:15,310
Didn't you hear the announcement? First floor.

1222
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:46,090
What?

1223
02:26:57,910 --> 02:26:59,600
One, two, three, four.

1224
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:02,550
Let's go.

1225
02:27:02,980 --> 02:27:04,210
Let's go.

1226
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:06,200
Over there.

1227
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:11,590
This.

1228
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:15,770
What is that?

1229
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:19,160
Really?

1230
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:25,210
-Where are we going that we have pocket money?
-There doesn't seem to be much money in my envelope.
-Mine feels quite empty too.

1231
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,810
Because there are no coins in it.

1232
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:30,110
What's going on?

1233
02:27:31,370 --> 02:27:33,350
But Team P.D.B came earlier.

1234
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:36,020
What?

1235
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,530
This is bad!

1236
02:27:47,370 --> 02:27:51,650
I haven't put on my shoes yet!

1237
02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:53,550
I must choose a thick one.

1238
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:56,770
-I have chosen.
-I have made my choice.

1239
02:27:57,510 --> 02:27:58,420
Let's choose this.

1240
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:06,150
-I feel like it'll be fun today.
-The moment we open this, the fortune of our day will be decided. We are playing the real Life Game right now.

1241
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:09,870
The two latecomers are here.

1242
02:28:09,870 --> 02:28:11,450
LINGQI and SHAO ZI HENG.

1243
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:19,110
-What did you bring? What did you bring?
-I brought snacks for everyone.

1244
02:28:18,910 --> 02:28:21,740
-Oh.
-I hope it's "Empty!"

1245
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:24,310
Okay.

1246
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:27,580
-Goodbye
-200,000 won. That's great.

1247
02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:29,870
My belly is showing.

1248
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:36,520
-Is this all of us?
-We're all here.
-Light Now, Right Now. Okay I'm going to open it.

1249
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:43,990
That's legendary.

1250
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:48,190
-Why?
-What is this? What is this?

1251
02:28:49,950 --> 02:28:55,800
-Wait. I saw it.
-What is it?

1252
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:56,500
Yeah, just one.

1253
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:57,800
HAN GYUL, how much do you have?

1254
02:28:58,060 --> 02:28:59,660
Why must I tell you?

1255
02:28:59,910 --> 02:29:03,060
-Mind your own business.
-He is very sensitive now.

1256
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:10,630
-JUN HYUK!
-1000 won!

1257
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:12,720
Did any draw KRW 200,000?

1258
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:27,700
KRW 200,000.

1259
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:35,130
HE XI LONG is the Polaris!

1260
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:36,910
Polaris!

1261
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:44,190
-Now we will announce the MT teams.
-Please.

1262
02:29:44,190 --> 02:29:45,680
Is it Team "MILLIONAIRE"?

1263
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:50,110
-HE XI LONG. HE XI LONG, please.
-Okay.
-Then I’ll join you too…

1264
02:29:52,010 --> 02:29:57,220
Everyone has stickers on your envelopes, right?

1265
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:04,440
XI LONG.

1266
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:05,590
XI LONG, what are you?

1267
02:30:23,150 --> 02:30:27,390
-We're fine.
-It's okay. We can live well without money.

1268
02:30:30,970 --> 02:30:33,710
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1269
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:48,270
DA EUL, you look so ample on camera.

1270
02:30:48,270 --> 02:30:51,630
I am AA, AA!

1271
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:53,070
-Always Ample.

1272
02:30:53,070 --> 02:30:58,360
-What will we do today?
-Have a pork belly party or something.

1273
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:01,410
I hope it snows today.

1274
02:31:01,410 --> 02:31:02,710
I want to have a snowball fight.

1275
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:07,300
Wait a moment.

1276
02:31:07,330 --> 02:31:09,230
It could be the market.

1277
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:10,590
It sounds so fun.

1278
02:31:10,590 --> 02:31:11,430
The market!

1279
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:26,380
We're almost there.

1280
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:28,760
Is it really a market?

1281
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:45,530
-Watermelon, watermelon.
-Watermelon.
-I haven't been to such Korean markets.

1282
02:31:45,490 --> 02:31:47,640
Korean traditional market.

1283
02:31:52,180 --> 02:32:01,330
-So cute.
-It's only KRW 3,900?
-Buy one as your pajamas.
-XI LONG, let's wear a team uniform.
-Yeah, yeah.

1284
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:05,920
-Give it to me.
-Let's go.
-Give it to me.

1285
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:13,900
-Here you go, and another KRW 1,000 note.
-Thank you.
-Everyone gets one.
-It's so good to have a lot of money.

1286
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:16,510
DONG HWA, it suits you.

1287
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:20,070
Doesn’t it match the color I’m wearing now super well?

1288
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:25,760
Shall we take a commemorative photo here?

1289
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,630
What can we do with KRW 1,000?

1290
02:32:31,630 --> 02:32:33,830
KRW 1,000 won. If we beg, I think we can have one bite.

1291
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:37,220
KRW 1,000. It's possible to ask for a portion worth KRW 1,000 won here.

1292
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:38,530
It's trotters!

1293
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:43,190
It looks delicious.

1294
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:47,910
It's really delicious.

1295
02:32:47,910 --> 02:32:55,290
This is the charm of the market. Let's buy one of each and eat on the way.

1296
02:32:55,290 --> 02:33:03,200
-Can we have one for 3,000 won?
-There's no rice cake for 2,000 won, right?
-There's no rice cake for 2,000 won?

1297
02:33:04,650 --> 02:33:07,780
Now that we've filled our stomachs with snacks,

1298
02:33:07,890 --> 02:33:14,420
-we're going to eat the main dishes now.
-Let's go there.
-Fried chicken. Let's go.

1299
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:15,380
Hello.

1300
02:33:15,380 --> 02:33:24,560
-How much do we have left?
-About 170,000 to 180,000 won.
-That's a lot.
-We can spend 80,000 won.
-How about six? Or five?
-Good Luck, Good Luck, go for it.

1301
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:30,910
-Enjoy it, guys.
-Thank you for the yummy food!

1302
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:36,750
-Delicious, delicious.
-Is it good?
-So good.

1303
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:49,000
-We have three more.
-Yeah.

1304
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,070
-Excuse me, how long will it take for the rest to come out?
-Other people collected it already.

1305
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:59,200
-Wow! Really?
-Really?

1306
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:01,220
Say it again.

1307
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:04,970
We'll be fine.

1308
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:09,460
It's okay, we can live well without money.

1309
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:20,290
-It must be delicious.
-Human beings need to use our brains.

1310
02:34:21,930 --> 02:34:28,880
-The other team is eating fried chicken.
-They bought buy fried chicken there?
-SHAO ZI HENG, they're frying fried chicken, right?

1311
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:36,460
-Four, please. Four for takeaway.
-Two have been served already.
-Well, give us the rest.

1312
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:49,350
Pretend to be pitiful.

1313
02:34:49,350 --> 02:34:50,470
Pretend to be pitiful.

1314
02:34:50,470 --> 02:34:52,420
I’m so excited.

1315
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:55,960
No.

1316
02:34:55,970 --> 02:35:02,530
-Let's go get them.
-They're really...
-Go get them, go get them!
-Let's go get revenge.

1317
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:04,270
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1318
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:05,250
This is KRW 10,000.

1319
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:06,670
-Is this KRW 10,000?
-Yes.

1320
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:10,110
I won't let them go.

1321
02:35:10,310 --> 02:35:12,390
Where are they?

1322
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:20,930
Mmm. Delicious.

1323
02:35:26,010 --> 02:35:29,370
-Run!
-Have you ever seen someone who looks like this?

1324
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:34,150
-No! -No? No?
-It should be over there. -Run/
-Really?

1325
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:36,600
Be careful not to hit things.

1326
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:44,950
Where are they?

1327
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:46,950
Where did they go?

1328
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:54,210
-They're in the bus!
-Ah, seriously...
-They're eating.

1329
02:35:55,070 --> 02:35:59,090
They're all almost here. They're all here.

1330
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:04,710
-Get them, get them, get them!
-Stuff everything in your mouth! Stuff your mouths!

1331
02:36:05,350 --> 02:36:07,490
You've gone too far, haven't you?

1332
02:36:07,490 --> 02:36:16,540
-We only ate two and you took three of them?
-This is too much, really.
-What are you doing?
-We're done. Take it.

1333
02:36:17,110 --> 02:36:22,170
-That's too much.
-Whose idea is this? Whose idea is this?
-SHAO ZI HENG.

1334
02:36:22,170 --> 02:36:23,970
Is it you? Is it you?

1335
02:36:24,070 --> 02:36:34,980
-Is it you?
-For the plot.
-For the plot? You wanted to eat fried chicken.
-You just want to eat.
-Anyhow, we have to live with this money. So, we did it our way.

1336
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:41,420
-This is...
-Okay. This is...
-It's not against the rules.
-I understand how your team feels.

1337
02:36:41,420 --> 02:36:43,710
We're going to start a war now.

1338
02:36:43,710 --> 02:36:49,960
-It's war from now on. It's war from now on.
-But thanks to you, we enjoyed the food.
-Thank you.

1339
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:56,670
-Get off.
-Get off. Let's go.

1340
02:36:56,670 --> 02:37:01,860
-Let's go.
-This is great.

1341
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:13,120
-That's great.
-LINGQI. Come on.

1342
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:17,470
-What are you doing?
-Hello.

1343
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:20,450
This is nice.

1344
02:37:23,390 --> 02:37:26,270
Starlight Boys' MT.

1345
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:32,530
Can we go in?

1346
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:34,130
Marketing!

1347
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:39,860
What marketing. This is a Membership Training*.
(*T/N: Something like orientation.)

1348
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:46,130
-Wow.
-That's nice.
-Like a restaurant.

1349
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:47,340
It's big.

1350
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:09,460
-Hey, there's a massage chair!

1351
02:38:10,030 --> 02:38:13,450
-Sleep for a night?
-I...
-There's a third floor.

1352
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:25,180
MIN JAE? MIN JAE?
Barbecue, barbecue, barbecue, barbecue

1353
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:26,950
Is this a warm place?

1354
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:42,990
-Wow, I haven't done this in a long time.
-It's warm. The water's warm.

1355
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:47,730
-I feel like I'll spend all my time here. Really.
-Good, good. I like it here.
-It's warm.

1356
02:39:02,770 --> 02:39:04,150
-Swimming pool.
-It's so warm here.

1357
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:09,250
So warm.

1358
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:28,870
Why am I so ugly?

1359
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:35,410
ZAI, what happened to your hair?

1360
02:39:35,410 --> 02:39:40,010
It looks like modern art.

1361
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:43,970
Here we go.

1362
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:17,620
Life is so beautiful. I can do this all day.

1363
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:20,630
This tickles.

1364
02:40:24,010 --> 02:40:25,270
That's right.

1365
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:28,300
I kept watching this over the break.

1366
02:40:42,030 --> 02:40:45,860
-Let's eat now.
-Let's eat, let's eat.

1367
02:40:52,490 --> 02:40:54,140
-Meat, meat.

1368
02:40:57,510 --> 02:41:02,950
-Meat.
-There are meals and drinks.
-There must be kimchi.

1369
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:06,060
Pork belly.

1370
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:09,810
We will now start the game that determines your dinner.

1371
02:41:14,670 --> 02:41:21,880
-Hello, everyone. I'm the host of the "Protect the Ingredients" game, HONG SUNG MIN.
-Yes, I'm MC MIN JAE.

1372
02:41:23,810 --> 02:41:28,210
-Come on!
-You must be hungry, right?
-Yes.

1373
02:41:28,210 --> 02:41:32,170
If you lose the game, you have to get an ingredient removed from here.

1374
02:41:32,170 --> 02:41:42,690
-If you make a mistake, you might go home after eating ramen.
-That's not bad.
-No.
-Not bad.

1375
02:41:42,690 --> 02:41:48,220
-That's not bad.
-Yes. But if you all succeed in one go,

1376
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:53,070
you can take all the ingredients on the table.

1377
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:55,450
There are a total of two games.

1378
02:41:55,510 --> 02:41:58,310
-"Be In Sync" game and...
-That's hard.

1379
02:41:58,310 --> 02:42:01,180
-"Relay Drawing" game.
-That's hard, too.

1380
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:11,260
The person that will decide which game Team Good Luck and Team Star will play is our first-place Polaris, trainee SHAO ZI HENG. Please come forward.

1381
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:14,840
Which one do you want to choose?

1382
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:17,390
"Be In Sync" game.

1383
02:42:19,170 --> 02:42:26,200
-Okay, trainee SHAO ZI HENG, you chose "Be In Sync" game.
-Okay. Let's start the "Be In Sync" game of Team Star.
-Okay.

1384
02:42:29,390 --> 02:42:33,820
First one, basketball. 1, 2, 3.

1385
02:42:35,240 --> 02:42:39,240
Angry. 1, 2, 3.

1386
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:43,970
This is considered failed.

1387
02:42:51,960 --> 02:42:54,870
My heart is going to explode.

1388
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:57,390
Your heart.

1389
02:42:57,720 --> 02:43:03,410
Let's take a look at the first hint.

1390
02:43:03,570 --> 02:43:05,300
Calm down. Good luck.

1391
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:06,730
Here we go. HE XI LONG. 1, 2...

1392
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:12,860
HE XI LONG. 1, 2, 3...

1393
02:43:12,860 --> 02:43:14,710
3...

1394
02:43:16,390 --> 02:43:19,470
1, 2, 3...

1395
02:43:24,270 --> 02:43:33,690
-Totally failed.
-Failed.
-Speaking of HE XI LONG, it must be this.
-Let me show you.
-Show us.

1396
02:43:33,690 --> 02:43:45,820
♫Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me♫
-This is the correct answer.
-Why is LEE DA EUL do this?
-Why did LEE DA EUL do this for the word HE XI LONG?
-Height. Height. Height.

1397
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:47,970
Two, three.

1398
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:56,770
What?

1399
02:43:56,770 --> 02:44:11,440
-Should I remove the sausage?
-How about removing the sausage?
-Let’s remove the delicious sausages.
-Bye.

1400
02:44:14,910 --> 02:44:17,050
Let's see the next keyword.

1401
02:44:17,380 --> 02:44:23,780
Come on. Rock, paper, scissors. One, two, three.

1402
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:27,470
Two, three.

1403
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:33,910
Men always put out rocks!

1404
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:41,560
-Men always put out rocks!
-These are our older brothers. Don't blame them.

1405
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:48,410
-They are the oldest. Don't blame them.
-They are older. Stop it.
-My desire dropped suddenly.

1406
02:44:48,410 --> 02:44:50,490
-I'm really sad.
-Let's remove the fruit.

1407
02:44:50,490 --> 02:44:55,330
-Does anyone eat fruit?
-No.
-The fruit is like dessert.

1408
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:58,390
Focus.

1409
02:44:58,740 --> 02:45:02,240
Idol. 1, 2, 3.

1410
02:45:04,550 --> 02:45:05,990
3.

1411
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:12,790
YOO JUN.

1412
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:23,920
Didn't he just say idol?
Idol.
Singer.
So we need to remove this ingredient.
No lettuce.

1413
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:29,090
-Lettuce.
-Lettuce, OUT.

1414
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:35,650
Then...

1415
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:42,240
-Next, let's start the next round.
-Let's make it simple.

1416
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:49,020
Here's the hint. Proposal. 1, 2, 3.

1417
02:45:49,030 --> 02:45:52,280
Please don't move
Don't move. Don't move.

1418
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:58,060
Two hands, two hands, two hands. One hand!

1419
02:45:58,060 --> 02:46:06,080
-What is this?
-I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready. Like this.

1420
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:15,700
-My gosh.
-Anyone can see that CONGB is giving flowers. PENTOR is giving a ring.
-Hurry up, send him away.

1421
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:21,480
-What should I do?
-Is the one wearing a vest from your team?
-Because he’s in our team.

1422
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:27,980
-Nice.
-Gosh, this is so difficult.

1423
02:46:28,530 --> 02:46:33,880
-Hey! Think about it. Please stop thinking.
-I'll face my back to everyone.

1424
02:46:34,030 --> 02:46:39,560
Ah, okay. All right. Very well.

1425
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:46,080
Starlight Boys. One, two, three.

1426
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:47,770
Three.

1427
02:46:48,930 --> 02:46:52,990
-Wait... HAN GYUL.
-He's right. He's right.

1428
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,850
Just turn around?

1429
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:00,910
Just turn around.

1430
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:04,910
Okay, then,

1431
02:47:04,910 --> 02:47:07,420
Then Team Star did it!

1432
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:10,480
The meat is still secured.

1433
02:47:14,470 --> 02:47:17,130
Good luck team chose

1434
02:47:17,130 --> 02:47:19,790
seven people "Relay Drawing" game

1435
02:47:19,830 --> 02:47:21,570
Read the hint card.

1436
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:30,940
Just show it in the drawing way. The first six draw.

1437
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:34,610
The last person can guess the lyrics.

1438
02:47:34,610 --> 02:47:41,400
You can't write, but you can write numbers. You only have 3 seconds.

1439
02:47:43,590 --> 02:47:45,350
What? 3 seconds?

1440
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:50,110
-One, two, three. This is really not good.
-It's really objective.

1441
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:57,570
-It's not a lie, right?
-Is it so hard?

1442
02:47:57,570 --> 02:48:04,080
-Is it okay from the beginning?
-It's really too hard, really.

1443
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:08,190
-This is absolutely impossible to guess.
-Why? Why?

1444
02:48:08,270 --> 02:48:15,880
-JUN HYUK, if you guess it right, I will treat you to beef.
-Really? Okay, okay.
-At the beginning, write down how many words there are.

1445
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:19,130
OK.

1446
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:22,070
Let's start the first attack game.

1447
02:48:22,070 --> 02:48:24,830
-The first prompt is...
-We believe in DONG HWA.

1448
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:31,390
This is really difficult.

1449
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:39,580
-Ready, set, go.
-Is it normal if I can't guess?
-Yes.

1450
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:46,080
Ready, set, go.

1451
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:50,620
One, two, three.

1452
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:55,680
One, two, three.

1453
02:48:55,680 --> 02:49:04,200
One, two, three. Next!

1454
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:07,770
One, two, three. Stop! Stop!

1455
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:12,470
-Two, three, stop! Stop!
-There's no way he can guess.

1456
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:17,570
Please check.

1457
02:49:17,630 --> 02:49:19,830
-All right, six words.
-Five, four, three, two.

1458
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:29,980
-What is this?
-What did you draw?
-It feels like a house.

1459
02:49:29,980 --> 02:49:32,660
He suddenly begins to explain

1460
02:49:32,770 --> 02:49:35,890
Is this a ball? A soccer?

1461
02:49:35,890 --> 02:49:39,150
-Soccer. Soccer.
-Something like that.

1462
02:49:39,150 --> 02:49:41,260
Gym.

1463
02:49:41,260 --> 02:49:44,020
School.

1464
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:54,640
Almost there. No way.

1465
02:49:54,640 --> 02:50:01,910
-No way. What school?
-The correct answer is
-Sports High School.
-Wrong.

1466
02:50:01,910 --> 02:50:04,260
The correct answer is...

1467
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:08,680
Starlight Academy.

1468
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:13,340
I told you I would never guess it.

1469
02:50:13,590 --> 02:50:17,120
-Where are the stars?
-This is the star.

1470
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:19,560
I didn't draw it well. This is the dormitory.

1471
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:24,370
Since you know it now, you can see it right?

1472
02:50:24,370 --> 02:50:26,450
I don't see it at all.

1473
02:50:26,450 --> 02:50:33,300
-I don't see it at all.
-Since they got the first prompt "Starlight Academy" wrong,

1474
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:39,950
-pick an ingredient to remove.
-But we don't eat fruits anyway. Let's remove the fruits.
-Fruits. Desserts. This.

1475
02:50:39,950 --> 02:50:46,080
In my opinion, after eating meat, we'll be full and there are other desserts, so...

1476
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:52,690
-Remove the canned food? I think that's the best choice.
-How about the canned food?
-Okay, okay, okay.

1477
02:50:52,690 --> 02:50:54,750
Let's move on to the second question right away.

1478
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:55,540
Let's go.

1479
02:50:55,750 --> 02:50:57,330
The second question

1480
02:50:57,340 --> 02:50:58,420
is this.

1481
02:50:57,350 --> 02:51:00,610
-That's it.
-Not bad, not bad.
-Wait a minute.

1482
02:51:04,090 --> 02:51:08,410
-This isn't easy.
-Everyone looks upset.

1483
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:10,120
Let's begin.

1484
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:12,850
-Next.
-Time's up.

1485
02:51:13,080 --> 02:51:18,900
1, 2, 3.

1486
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:28,810
-1, 2, 3, next.
-Please pass it.

1487
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:37,320
-What is that? What are you drawing?
-1, 2, 3.

1488
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:45,330
-It's great.
-It’s a pretty good drawing.
-I think I can guess the answer.

1489
02:51:45,350 --> 02:51:47,650
JUN HYUK, please confirm.

1490
02:51:58,890 --> 02:52:02,510
Please.

1491
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:04,730
That's the one.

1492
02:52:04,730 --> 02:52:07,530
3 2 1.

1493
02:52:07,810 --> 02:52:10,760
Eliminated.

1494
02:52:11,020 --> 02:52:15,780
-2, 1.
-Final Stage.

1495
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:21,890
-No.
-You go here. You go here.
-Get out!

1496
02:52:21,890 --> 02:52:24,490
Two characters.

1497
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:29,930
-Two characters, on the 28th, "Starlight Boys."
-Debut! Debut!

1498
02:52:33,450 --> 02:52:37,730
-You're really bad at this.
-Final performance.

1499
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:39,760
Team Good Luck, which ingredients are you going to remove?

1500
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:41,230
You want seafood?

1501
02:52:41,330 --> 02:52:44,810
I don't think we have to have it.

1502
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:47,020
Team Good Luck chose the raw fish.

1503
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:52,660
Don't give up now. Starting from the third question, it will be easier. EDEN, please turn around.

1504
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,850
This is the third question.

1505
02:52:54,860 --> 02:53:01,110
Ready... set, go! One, two, three. Next!

1506
02:53:01,130 --> 02:53:07,030
1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

1507
02:53:07,310 --> 02:53:11,070
1, 2, 3.

1508
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:13,290
The more I draw, the less it looks alike.

1509
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:15,220
1, 2.

1510
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:17,390
2, 3.

1511
02:53:19,510 --> 02:53:34,740
One, two, three.

1512
02:53:34,740 --> 02:53:36,470
-Please confirm.
-I'm turning around.

1513
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:39,670
Something big has happened.

1514
02:53:39,670 --> 02:53:45,580
You had time to draw right?

1515
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:49,970
-What kind of painting is this?
-What is this?
-How could I know?

1516
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:55,770
-To the third..
-I drew a microphone. What did you draw? A seat?

1517
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:57,570
Wait, it's three syllables?

1518
02:53:57,570 --> 02:54:03,040
It seems to be filming.

1519
02:54:07,410 --> 02:54:09,800
Is this a table?

1520
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:16,250
It feels like there's food on it.

1521
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:19,470
Ah! Ah!

1522
02:54:19,470 --> 02:54:20,990
Please! Please!

1523
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:23,010
Please! Please!

1524
02:54:24,630 --> 02:54:27,650
Interview!

1525
02:54:28,580 --> 02:54:30,750
EDEN is correct!

1526
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:37,450
Wow, he actually guessed it right.

1527
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:39,530
Who drew this podium?

1528
02:54:40,560 --> 02:54:48,950
-ZAI!
-Kopiko! Kopiko! Kopiko coffee candy.

1529
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:50,060
-Like this, the mission of fighting for ingredients is over.
-Let's go party, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1530
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:05,750
Let's start cooking.

1531
02:55:05,750 --> 02:55:08,030
Start cooking.

1532
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:10,660
What should we do?

1533
02:55:10,660 --> 02:55:12,990
Set these up first.

1534
02:55:12,990 --> 02:55:15,990
Nine.

1535
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:19,750
-Ten.
-Like this.

1536
02:55:20,160 --> 02:55:24,490
I'll wash the vegetables.

1537
02:55:24,550 --> 02:55:25,810
Brother.

1538
02:55:27,380 --> 02:55:29,510
Wait.

1539
02:55:29,510 --> 02:55:31,490
Please step aside. I just need to wash my hands.

1540
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:40,630
How can you wash it with hot water?

1541
02:55:40,630 --> 02:55:42,930
Are you washing vegetables with hot water?

1542
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:48,780
-You need to wash it with cold water.
-Wow, it's so cold.

1543
02:55:48,780 --> 02:55:50,490
It hurts.

1544
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:54,550
-What are you gonna make? Army stew?
-No, no.

1545
02:55:54,550 --> 02:55:57,690
-What are you gonna make?
-I want to make Doenjang Soup.

1546
02:55:59,830 --> 02:56:06,420
-MIN JAE, should I cut the zucchini thicker or thinner?
-Just adequately.
-Adequately.

1547
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:15,320
-But we don't have minced garlic. So we need to prepare it ourselves.
-I'll dice it up.

1548
02:56:28,050 --> 02:56:33,040
But we don't have MSG, there's nothing available.

1549
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:42,240
There's such good seasoning here, what are we doing here, kids? It will taste very different.

1550
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:45,050
Just a little. Stop.

1551
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:48,670
Taste it after stirring it.

1552
02:56:48,750 --> 02:56:49,830
How is it now?

1553
02:56:50,400 --> 02:56:52,170
How is it?

1554
02:56:54,510 --> 02:56:58,550
-Wow.
-Let's end it after this. We're done.

1555
02:57:00,450 --> 02:57:01,460
Ah, it's so cold.

1556
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:03,780
-But the fire is too small.
-The fire is too small.

1557
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,990
No, just adding some salt is all right.

1558
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:25,420
Press hard.

1559
02:57:26,430 --> 02:57:33,860
-Are you a coward?
-Why are you so scared?

1560
02:57:38,400 --> 02:57:39,500
Okay, okay.

1561
02:57:39,550 --> 02:57:42,940
I'm scared. I...

1562
02:57:48,030 --> 02:57:52,780
Put it on the side. It's too heavy. So the fire is small.

1563
02:57:54,770 --> 02:58:03,300
-Not bad, not bad.
-Use this.

1564
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:05,010
ZI HENG, don't you think there's something wrong?

1565
02:58:05,010 --> 02:58:07,870
-What?
-Don't you think you're different from me and ZAI?

1566
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:17,000
Your hands are stained with blood.

1567
02:58:30,180 --> 02:58:31,340
Ah, stupid.

1568
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:33,070
This is really cooked now.

1569
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:49,590
-Ah, stop pretending.
-It's really hot.

1570
02:58:49,750 --> 02:58:51,000
OK, ZAI.

1571
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,150
Oh, so big.

1572
02:58:54,430 --> 02:58:55,530
Maybe...

1573
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:00,230
Cheers.

1574
02:59:03,340 --> 02:59:04,230
Is it not hot?

1575
02:59:04,410 --> 02:59:06,540
It's really delicious.

1576
02:59:11,560 --> 02:59:15,470
I think it's fine now.

1577
02:59:17,870 --> 02:59:20,700
It looks really delicious.

1578
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:26,980
Let's go. Let's go. ZAI.

1579
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:28,890
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

1580
02:59:28,890 --> 02:59:30,410
I'm going to dig in.

1581
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:38,910
Cheers, cheers.

1582
02:59:39,690 --> 02:59:42,790
Fighting.

1583
02:59:44,310 --> 02:59:46,430
I want it, I want it, I'm a pig.

1584
02:59:56,500 --> 02:59:57,710
Ah, so tasty.

1585
02:59:57,710 --> 02:59:59,230
It's so delicious.

1586
03:00:03,910 --> 03:00:08,750
-The meat is really delicious.
-Delicious.

1587
03:00:22,630 --> 03:00:23,910
How was your day?

1588
03:00:23,910 --> 03:00:29,340
So happy. It's because there's no conflict between teammates.

1589
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:32,950
Everyone's together. I feel really great.

1590
03:00:32,950 --> 03:00:37,480
I feel like before, we were just staying in the dorms all the time.

1591
03:00:37,480 --> 03:00:39,780
But this group outing feels…

1592
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:43,090
Like a boys' high school vibe…

1593
03:00:43,090 --> 03:00:46,740
I find it amazing how close everyone has become.

1594
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:49,060
-So who are you closest to?
-Me?

1595
03:00:49,850 --> 03:00:50,820
It's me.

1596
03:00:51,240 --> 03:00:58,740
-I've gotten closer to everyone except for SHAO ZI HENG.
-Me too!
-Just a joke.

1597
03:00:58,740 --> 03:01:03,900
-I've gotten closer to everyone.
-What's most difficult for me is

1598
03:01:04,330 --> 03:01:05,540
dorm life.

1599
03:01:05,540 --> 03:01:08,810
-Dorm life?
-Yeah.

1600
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:10,860
Honestly,

1601
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:20,750
I was a little scared to suddenly moving into a dorm together with someone I just met for the first time. I need some time to warm up to others. First of all, our living habits are different.

1602
03:01:20,750 --> 03:01:22,320
Is it all settled now?

1603
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:28,020
It's all settled. Now, it's because we're gotten so close, that I actually

1604
03:01:28,210 --> 03:01:31,000
want to live together for a long time.

1605
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:36,860
-Was it summer when we applied for this?
-It was summer.

1606
03:01:36,910 --> 03:01:39,920
Do you remember when we signed up here?

1607
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:42,350
It's so vivid, completely!

1608
03:01:42,350 --> 03:01:50,040
-Compared to back then, what's different? Or is it the same?
-Ah, there's just so much.
-There's really so much!

1609
03:01:50,040 --> 03:01:51,470
I...

1610
03:01:51,700 --> 03:01:52,770
Well...

1611
03:01:52,970 --> 03:01:55,940
During my first interview for this show…

1612
03:01:55,940 --> 03:01:57,310
My Korean was really…

1613
03:01:57,940 --> 03:02:04,580
-so well back then.
-It didn't seem… that great, though.
-No, just a little… Back then, it was really…

1614
03:02:04,580 --> 03:02:10,280
-It was at the same level as a native Korean…
-No.

1615
03:02:10,410 --> 03:02:17,360
-I really spoke well back then.
-But now, my Korean has gotten worse. This is the biggest change.

1616
03:02:17,360 --> 03:02:24,330
-My desires got stronger.
-Your desires?
-When I first came here, my desires…

1617
03:02:24,330 --> 03:02:27,590
They were there, but not that much. But then...

1618
03:02:27,590 --> 03:02:32,900
After all, it is a survival audition show. While filming, the desires started to form.

1619
03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:37,010
-So you developed more ambition and determination?
-Yes…
-That's a good thing.

1620
03:02:37,010 --> 03:02:39,530
I've regained a little self-esteem.

1621
03:02:39,530 --> 03:02:41,170
I think I found my confidence

1622
03:02:41,170 --> 03:02:45,550
coming here.

1623
03:02:45,550 --> 03:02:47,930
I started by preparing by myself.

1624
03:02:48,030 --> 03:02:50,690
I was a little held back.

1625
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:56,040
But now, I've done many performances with many friends.

1626
03:02:56,170 --> 03:02:57,510
It seems to have made me gradually

1627
03:02:57,510 --> 03:03:01,780
find my courage back.

1628
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:03,070
At first, I was also a bit...

1629
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:05,870
a bit too impatient.

1630
03:03:05,910 --> 03:03:09,070
I felt like I've to quickly show that I'm good.

1631
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:10,230
Like

1632
03:03:10,230 --> 03:03:12,450
I needed to gain recognition as soon as possible…

1633
03:03:12,660 --> 03:03:14,900
I was in a rush before.

1634
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:16,190
But now...

1635
03:03:16,510 --> 03:03:18,620
I'm still ambitious.

1636
03:03:18,970 --> 03:03:22,290
But I'm increasingly calm, actually.

1637
03:03:22,290 --> 03:03:23,380
It's good.

1638
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:25,050
Do you feel relaxed now?

1639
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:31,320
-Today is really a nice day. I really didn't think about anything today. I just had fun.
-Did you feel uncomfortable when the fried chicken was taken away?

1640
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:38,220
That's also because I was very relaxed, so I complained.

1641
03:03:40,670 --> 03:03:44,210
What is this?

1642
03:03:44,210 --> 03:03:50,460
Are we about to do an evaluation here?

1643
03:03:50,460 --> 03:03:57,220
- No, if it goes over 30 seconds, you have to dance.
-Do I have to dance? Here…?
-What? Dancing here?

1644
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:59,030
-What?!
-Three, two, one!

1645
03:04:00,140 --> 03:04:03,240
That sound...

1646
03:04:06,830 --> 03:04:11,530
-Hello.
-Hello.

1647
03:04:11,530 --> 03:04:15,710
What?

1648
03:04:20,950 --> 03:04:23,070
Oh my God, so ugly.

1649
03:04:23,030 --> 03:04:26,030
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. No!

1650
03:04:26,030 --> 03:04:27,210
Hello.

1651
03:04:37,010 --> 03:04:39,660
Why do you look so young?

1652
03:04:40,030 --> 03:04:45,560
I didn't have makeup on at that time.

1653
03:04:45,560 --> 03:04:47,620
You're so cute.

1654
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:52,710
I'm from Vietnam.

1655
03:04:52,810 --> 03:04:55,690
-So... So chubby!
-Hello, I'm PENTOR.

1656
03:05:00,990 --> 03:05:02,350
Oh, PENTOR.

1657
03:05:02,820 --> 03:05:07,380
Did you smile today?

1658
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:09,890
If not...

1659
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:11,510
I

1660
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:15,280
will become everyone's smile.

1661
03:05:16,430 --> 03:05:18,620
So cute.

1662
03:05:18,770 --> 03:05:22,500
Hello, I'm YOO JUN of BAE173.

1663
03:05:22,500 --> 03:05:30,940
-Please take care of me.
-YOO JUN.
-You're the same.
-YOO JUN is the same as four years ago.
-Yes.

1664
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:40,370
Today.

1665
03:05:40,560 --> 03:05:43,860
LEE DA EUL.

1666
03:05:44,030 --> 03:05:49,510
What's with the hair?

1667
03:06:04,870 --> 03:06:08,720
DA EUL, what year was that?

1668
03:06:08,880 --> 03:06:10,500
Please get out, please.

1669
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:12,380
Play the next one.

1670
03:06:14,750 --> 03:06:17,030
Uh.

1671
03:06:19,830 --> 03:06:22,610
No!

1672
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:29,320
Hello, my name is XIN CHE and I am 17 years old.

1673
03:06:36,520 --> 03:06:38,620
What would you say is your greatest charm?

1674
03:06:39,550 --> 03:06:42,910
I'm a little good looking.

1675
03:06:42,910 --> 03:06:45,660
You are good looking. What are you afraid of?

1676
03:07:09,830 --> 03:07:14,610
-You danced well.
-Is that a shoulder pad?

1677
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:19,010
Oh no!

1678
03:07:26,590 --> 03:07:29,150
His secret's been revealed.

1679
03:07:36,420 --> 03:07:40,270
Hi, I'm LINGQI from the Fantasy Boys.

1680
03:07:40,270 --> 03:07:44,150
-He looks like a baby.
-He really looks like an idol.

1681
03:07:44,150 --> 03:07:47,510
-What's your position?
-I am...

1682
03:07:47,740 --> 03:07:50,150
Visuals.

1683
03:07:50,150 --> 03:07:56,260
What's your favorite part of your face?

1684
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:59,910
-My eyes.
-Why? Why?

1685
03:07:59,910 --> 03:08:03,810
-Like this.
-Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

1686
03:08:03,810 --> 03:08:07,620
I'm usually a little...

1687
03:08:07,790 --> 03:08:14,500
-a little cute.
-A little cute.
-LINGQI is cute.

1688
03:08:14,500 --> 03:08:17,310
-Please look at the camera.
-All right.

1689
03:08:17,310 --> 03:08:26,820
Hello, I MIN JAE of BAE173. I'm 21 years old, born in 2004.

1690
03:08:26,820 --> 03:08:33,100
-Who are you?
-You were so handsome at that time.

1691
03:08:33,150 --> 03:08:35,230
He's not my friend.

1692
03:08:35,230 --> 03:08:39,330
Most people get handsome when they go on a show. Why did we

1693
03:08:39,330 --> 03:08:42,390
become like this?

1694
03:08:51,750 --> 03:08:55,350
-What is this?
-Wow, really.

1695
03:08:55,350 --> 03:08:58,230
My charm point?
Exactly the same as now.

1696
03:08:58,230 --> 03:08:59,370
My whole body.

1697
03:08:59,430 --> 03:09:05,940
-My physique is good. It's not bad.
-What?

1698
03:09:07,430 --> 03:09:09,910
-Please introduce yourself.
-ZAI!

1699
03:09:17,660 --> 03:09:24,650
-Yes, what's with the warning?
-Hello, everyone. I'm ZAI.
-What's something you're confident in?

1700
03:09:25,030 --> 03:09:26,320
Probably dance.

1701
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:35,510
So is there anything you're not good at?

1702
03:09:35,650 --> 03:09:37,010
My singing.

1703
03:10:10,290 --> 03:10:13,070
ZAI's so cute.

1704
03:10:13,070 --> 03:10:16,670
-ZAI's so cute like this.
-Why are you so cute?

1705
03:10:23,960 --> 03:10:29,700
Have you been doing interviews all day before coming here?
So your hair was this short back then?

1706
03:10:29,700 --> 03:10:33,250
It's my eighth year since debuting.

1707
03:10:33,380 --> 03:10:38,350
-I want to show less skin.
-In the end, you still showed it.

1708
03:10:38,350 --> 03:10:43,410
-In the end, you still showed it.
-Now I want to showcase controlled sexiness.

1709
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:58,160
That's way too much skin.

1710
03:10:58,160 --> 03:11:01,800
-JUN HYUK, it's dad.
-JUN HYUK, it's dad.

1711
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:02,750
Son.

1712
03:11:14,510 --> 03:11:17,170
JUN HYUK, it's dad.

1713
03:11:17,170 --> 03:11:18,940
JUN HYUK, it's dad.

1714
03:11:18,940 --> 03:11:20,410
This time,

1715
03:11:20,410 --> 03:11:25,520
I'm proud to see you on the show and how hard you work.

1716
03:11:25,970 --> 03:11:27,110
Son.

1717
03:11:27,390 --> 03:11:31,550
I never thought that we'd… communicate like this.

1718
03:11:32,710 --> 03:11:37,150
Watching your performance on stage…

1719
03:11:37,150 --> 03:11:39,400
I'm very happy.

1720
03:11:39,400 --> 03:11:40,840
You're doing great.

1721
03:11:40,840 --> 03:11:44,280
I think my son is old enough to be independent.

1722
03:11:44,980 --> 03:11:50,210
I hope you have a strong heart and can keep going on.

1723
03:11:51,380 --> 03:11:52,760
You can do it.

1724
03:11:53,510 --> 03:11:54,780
You can definitely do it.

1725
03:11:55,710 --> 03:11:56,940
Good luck, my son.

1726
03:11:57,110 --> 03:11:58,180
I love you.

1727
03:11:59,300 --> 03:12:06,090
-Hello, PENTOR. This is your grandma.
-And your mom.
-Are you doing okay?

1728
03:12:06,210 --> 03:12:15,240
Playing in the snow every day should be fun. We're watching you together every day and voting for you all the time.

1729
03:12:15,240 --> 03:12:17,880
I want to give my child a gift.

1730
03:12:17,770 --> 03:12:19,980
XI LONG.

1731
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:21,600
How are you?

1732
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:23,720
We miss you.

1733
03:12:24,950 --> 03:12:27,170
We saw you on the show.

1734
03:12:27,240 --> 03:12:31,080
You've been working so hard, holding on for your dreams.

1735
03:12:31,080 --> 03:12:33,040
In our eyes,

1736
03:12:33,070 --> 03:12:35,790
you are the brightest star on this stage.

1737
03:12:46,150 --> 03:12:48,110
Hello, ZAI.

1738
03:12:48,110 --> 03:12:49,710
I miss you.

1739
03:12:49,710 --> 03:12:53,880
You were afraid of ghosts and didn't dare to sleep alone when you were little. I didn't expect that you

1740
03:12:53,910 --> 03:12:58,670
can now go to Korea alone to chase his dreams…

1741
03:12:58,670 --> 03:13:00,210
and stand on stage.

1742
03:13:00,710 --> 03:13:07,150
Mom knows that when you decide to do something, you will give 200% of your heart and effort.

1743
03:13:07,150 --> 03:13:10,060
So, no matter the outcome,

1744
03:13:10,120 --> 03:13:12,720
you're amazing. Really.

1745
03:13:12,660 --> 03:13:14,150
HAN GYUL!

1746
03:13:14,370 --> 03:13:18,630
It's been three months since you've been in there.

1747
03:13:18,860 --> 03:13:21,280
You've had it difficult.

1748
03:13:21,280 --> 03:13:22,400
My son.

1749
03:13:22,490 --> 03:13:26,530
Just know that everyone in the family is rooting for you.

1750
03:13:26,640 --> 03:13:29,790
Your family is your best support, right?

1751
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:35,450
I hope your efforts so far will yield good results.

1752
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:37,080
Also,

1753
03:13:37,080 --> 03:13:43,600
my son, you can do it. I always say you're always the best man to me.

1754
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:51,240
You're the most perfect. I've never seen such a perfect man like you in my entire life.

1755
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:59,180
Who are you?

1756
03:14:07,650 --> 03:14:10,340
It's Dad.

1757
03:14:10,340 --> 03:14:12,820
Son, this is Dad.

1758
03:14:12,820 --> 03:14:16,210
How are you?

1759
03:14:16,420 --> 03:14:21,660
Dad hopes that YOO JUN will always be happy.

1760
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:23,360
Also,

1761
03:14:23,570 --> 03:14:29,240
although there are hard and tiring times, there will always be someone behind you protecting you like a tree.

1762
03:14:29,340 --> 03:14:32,550
Don't forget dad's here.

1763
03:14:32,550 --> 03:14:34,040
My son.

1764
03:14:34,040 --> 03:14:37,670
I love you.

1765
03:14:41,570 --> 03:14:46,020
We are HONG SUNG MIN's family.

1766
03:14:46,020 --> 03:14:58,260
Hello, Sungmin. I watched the show. The first and second rap tasks, which you had never done before, must have been very challenging for you. But seeing how you didn't give up and pushed through to the end…

1767
03:14:58,260 --> 03:15:08,150
…was so touching and admirable. For the things you want to do in the future, all of us will do our best to cheer you on. Don't stress too much about your rankings.

1768
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:20,810
I hope you have fun with your friends. To us, you are number one. HONG SUNG MIN, keep it up.

1769
03:15:53,630 --> 03:16:01,750
The iQIYI Global Idol Audition, Starlight Boys, which is broadcasting live, is now about to announce the final rankings.

1770
03:16:01,980 --> 03:16:08,470
Of the 18 trainees you're seeing now, only 9 trainees

1771
03:16:08,470 --> 03:16:12,120
will get to realize their dream of debuting through the Guardians' choices.

1772
03:16:16,870 --> 03:16:19,490
At the end of this starry journey,

1773
03:16:19,490 --> 03:16:20,880
what will be the TOP 9 line up

1774
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:25,440
of POLARIX?

1775
03:16:25,990 --> 03:16:31,600
The final

1776
03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:33,280
Ranking Announcement of "Starlight Boys."

1777
03:16:33,440 --> 03:16:39,170
Because it is the Final Performance, countless fans around the world have cast 'Light up' votes for the birth of this global idol group.

1778
03:16:40,660 --> 03:16:42,290
We received a total

1779
03:16:42,980 --> 03:16:47,100
of 9,745,302 votes.

1780
03:16:50,160 --> 03:16:53,530
Because it is the last time, everyone's enthusiasm for voting is also very high.

1781
03:16:53,600 --> 03:16:57,410
I sincerely thank all the Guardians who support them.

1782
03:17:01,340 --> 03:17:10,780
Guardians, can Trainees you support today enjoy the joy of debut? And, which Trainee will get the first place to become the most shining center?

1783
03:17:10,790 --> 03:17:12,970
I hope you can stay tuned until the end of it.

1784
03:17:21,730 --> 03:17:26,050
Then Starlight Boys, the long-awaited Final.

1785
03:17:26,270 --> 03:17:28,280
The final ranking announcement ceremony

1786
03:17:28,280 --> 03:17:29,640
starts now.

1787
03:17:51,310 --> 03:17:55,000
Let's start with the eighth place trainee.

1788
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:58,520
The trainee called, please come to the front of the stage.

1789
03:18:18,430 --> 03:18:20,340
The eighth place trainee...

1790
03:18:29,310 --> 03:18:33,730
Speaking of enthusiasm and ambition, the first person who comes to mind is this Trainee.

1791
03:18:33,730 --> 03:18:37,640
He's a trainee with both dance and singing skills.

1792
03:18:46,470 --> 03:18:50,440
Although he perfectly presented a powerful performance with abundant energy,

1793
03:18:50,440 --> 03:18:55,010
this trainee is normally full of smiles and playful energy.

1794
03:19:08,480 --> 03:19:10,090
Starlight Boys.

1795
03:19:10,090 --> 03:19:12,350
The 8th place trainee.

1796
03:19:19,110 --> 03:19:22,370
Is YANG DONG HWA. Congratulations!

1797
03:19:49,250 --> 03:19:56,550
Trainee YANG DONG HWA received 415,097 votes and is at 8th place.

1798
03:19:59,430 --> 03:20:13,740
When others tired of hard practice, YANG DONG HWA made atmosphere of the Practice Room become clearer and friendship between the Trainee has become deeper. And this period of time, he has been a strong support for the players.

1799
03:20:13,740 --> 03:20:17,260
Let's look forward to his performance as a member of POLARIX too.

1800
03:20:18,290 --> 03:20:20,290
Let's hear a few words from him.

1801
03:20:26,060 --> 03:20:28,920
Hello, I'm YANG DONG HWA from "Starlight Boys."

1802
03:20:28,970 --> 03:20:31,910
Hello, I'm YANG DONG HWA. Hello, my name is YANG DONG HWA.

1803
03:20:34,360 --> 03:20:35,510
First

1804
03:20:36,640 --> 03:20:41,550
A lot of things have happened in this period of time that felt both long and short.

1805
03:20:42,020 --> 03:20:43,410
Actually, I...

1806
03:20:43,630 --> 03:20:47,810
At the beginning, I didn't rank very high, so I thought I couldn't make a debut.

1807
03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:49,460
That's what I thought.

1808
03:20:49,460 --> 03:20:51,850
Thanks to the unfailing support of Guardians,

1809
03:20:52,070 --> 03:20:54,190
I can receive the gift of making a debut.

1810
03:20:54,280 --> 03:20:57,910
I really appreciate it and it's my pleasure.

1811
03:20:57,910 --> 03:20:59,510
Thank you, Guardians.

1812
03:21:05,420 --> 03:21:07,790
And for us,

1813
03:21:07,790 --> 03:21:09,370
you did your best.

1814
03:21:09,760 --> 03:21:16,010
I want to say thank you to the screenwriters, all the staff and PDs who worked hard together.

1815
03:21:20,610 --> 03:21:22,470
And my

1816
03:21:23,640 --> 03:21:25,570
beautiful lady, my mother.

1817
03:21:27,100 --> 03:21:29,140
I want to tell my family that,

1818
03:21:29,140 --> 03:21:32,130
thanks to them, I survived this long journey.

1819
03:21:32,870 --> 03:21:36,080
My activites as part of Starlight Boys...

1820
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:38,470
My activities... Activities?

1821
03:21:38,550 --> 03:21:42,590
While this time ends here, but in the future,

1822
03:21:42,590 --> 03:21:48,840
I hope we will be together for a long time with this new start. Guardians, I love you.

1823
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:59,120
Trainee YANG DONG HWA, congratulations. What would be your most memorable moment on "Starlight Boys"?

1824
03:22:00,340 --> 03:22:01,800
I think it's now.

1825
03:22:02,300 --> 03:22:03,630
Okay.

1826
03:22:03,960 --> 03:22:11,920
You'll be debuting as you've always wished. What's something that you want to do after your debut?

1827
03:22:19,470 --> 03:22:21,850
What should I do first?

1828
03:22:21,850 --> 03:22:23,990
There should be a lot of things you want to do.

1829
03:22:24,700 --> 03:22:26,360
I think, first of all...

1830
03:22:32,590 --> 03:22:35,390
I want to meet the fans outside one more time.

1831
03:22:35,470 --> 03:22:41,200
Yes, now more fans can see Trainee YANG DONG HWA's handsome stage performance.

1832
03:22:41,250 --> 03:22:46,340
Congratulations, Trainee YANG DONG HWA. Please go to the seat with your ranking written on.

1833
03:22:46,740 --> 03:22:48,010
Thank you.

1834
03:23:00,830 --> 03:23:08,990
Trainee YANG DONG HWA is so strong that he can provide us with perfect sing performance. The charm he'll demonstrate after the debut is worth looking forward to.

1835
03:23:08,990 --> 03:23:10,670
I hope you can be like a fairy tale until the end

1836
03:23:10,670 --> 03:23:13,990
and present cool performances with strong passion and enthusiasm.

1837
03:23:29,390 --> 03:23:31,410
The seventh place trainee.

1838
03:23:40,830 --> 03:23:46,200
Each idol team has vocals and main dancers.

1839
03:23:46,200 --> 03:23:52,570
This trainee was not satisfied with just one role. He extended his role.

1840
03:23:55,430 --> 03:23:58,730
Perhaps among the Trainees who entered the final round,

1841
03:23:58,730 --> 03:24:02,330
none of them is not close with this Trainee.

1842
03:24:02,750 --> 03:24:06,060
He is the mood-setter who makes the practice room

1843
03:24:06,060 --> 03:24:07,600
an enjoyable place.

1844
03:24:15,440 --> 03:24:18,310
The final 7th Place Trainee of Starlight Boys...

1845
03:24:36,810 --> 03:24:39,330
It's ZAI. Congratulations.

1846
03:25:11,960 --> 03:25:19,220
ZAI places 7th place with 562,335 votes.

1847
03:25:23,820 --> 03:25:30,970
With outstanding dance skills, he left a deep impression on the Guardians. With rap and vocals involved, he's shown many sides of him developing.

1848
03:25:30,970 --> 03:25:39,130
In particular, he left a deep impression by finding his confidence back even after making a mistake, continuously developing himself. I'm sure Guardians have been very touched too.

1849
03:25:39,130 --> 03:25:41,900
What kind of side will he show after debuting? Let's look forward to it.

1850
03:25:42,130 --> 03:25:45,340
Let's hear a few words from you first.

1851
03:25:51,030 --> 03:25:53,890
Before I thank everyone,

1852
03:25:54,180 --> 03:25:55,820
I want to first thank

1853
03:25:55,930 --> 03:25:57,050
my mother.

1854
03:26:05,300 --> 03:26:07,310
Actually, I...

1855
03:26:07,860 --> 03:26:10,790
I am a child who doesn't behave good.

1856
03:26:10,950 --> 03:26:12,460
But...

1857
03:26:12,600 --> 03:26:14,400
No matter what I want to do,

1858
03:26:14,510 --> 03:26:15,830
she will

1859
03:26:15,830 --> 03:26:17,200
be very supportive of me

1860
03:26:17,230 --> 03:26:19,670
and keep telling me

1861
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:22,090
I hope what you do

1862
03:26:22,930 --> 03:26:24,420
is what you want.

1863
03:26:25,380 --> 03:26:27,460
And I feel today,

1864
03:26:28,230 --> 03:26:30,940
I can make you proud.

1865
03:26:33,710 --> 03:26:34,990
Also.

1866
03:26:37,310 --> 03:26:38,890
Alright, thank you.

1867
03:26:38,950 --> 03:26:40,960
To all the fans here

1868
03:26:41,150 --> 03:26:43,040
and the people who have supported us,

1869
03:26:43,720 --> 03:26:44,990
We

1870
03:26:44,990 --> 03:26:46,610
will continue to work hard and do our best.

1871
03:26:46,630 --> 03:26:47,550
Thank you.

1872
03:26:50,370 --> 03:26:52,870
All right, congratulations to trainee ZAI.

1873
03:26:53,810 --> 03:26:57,300
There are trainees who haven't been named yet.

1874
03:26:57,300 --> 03:26:59,920
Who do you want to debut with most?

1875
03:27:04,550 --> 03:27:07,130
ZAI, ZAI!

1876
03:27:10,280 --> 03:27:14,920
-Please wait a bit for the translation.
-JUNJUN, LEE JUN HYUK.

1877
03:27:16,790 --> 03:27:21,050
He said he wants to debut with the trainee LEE JUN HYUK.

1878
03:27:21,660 --> 03:27:23,110
Yes.

1879
03:27:23,510 --> 03:27:27,850
Will trainee ZAI's wish come true?

1880
03:27:27,990 --> 03:27:30,080
We're looking forward to it.

1881
03:27:30,080 --> 03:27:35,350
Say a word to your precious fans who have always supported you.

1882
03:27:37,990 --> 03:27:40,540
I will make a good breakthrough.

1883
03:27:40,540 --> 03:27:41,670
And,

1884
03:27:42,380 --> 03:27:44,030
you can

1885
03:27:44,240 --> 03:27:45,310
trust me.

1886
03:27:45,310 --> 03:27:46,190
Thank you.

1887
03:27:47,430 --> 03:27:52,990
All right, congratulations on your debut. Trainee ZAI, please go to the debut seat with your ranking on it.

1888
03:27:57,270 --> 03:28:05,510
Yes, Trainee ZAI not only lights up himself but also others. The journey at Starlight Boys has not been easy.

1889
03:28:05,510 --> 03:28:13,420
The debut is a great reward. I hope you can grow up to be a popular star on the world stage as a global idol.

1890
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:28,990
Next, the 6th place Trainee.

1891
03:28:37,990 --> 03:28:42,870
He has both the charm of a man and the refreshing vibes of a teen.

1892
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:46,720
Spanning a variety of styles and always remaining a favourite among the Trainees,

1893
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:08,700
he challenges himself more than anyone to make sure his idol debut reattempt doesn't end with regrets.

1894
03:29:08,700 --> 03:29:11,530
This Trainee has always been struggling and striving fiercely.

1895
03:29:25,310 --> 03:29:28,070
Starlight Boys' 6th place trainee.

1896
03:29:43,860 --> 03:29:45,090
The final

1897
03:29:45,090 --> 03:29:47,420
6th place trainee is...

1898
03:29:47,960 --> 03:29:51,040
Trainee HAN GYUL! Congratulations!

1899
03:30:06,400 --> 03:30:12,720
Trainee HAN GYUL received a total of 676,040 votes and finished 6th place.

1900
03:30:17,210 --> 03:30:26,130
Whenever other trainees are tired and feel lost, they'll look for HAN GYUL, who will spend the whole night with them together, sympathizing and talking with them.

1901
03:30:26,130 --> 03:30:35,300
Sure enough, many trainees are celebrating HAN GYUL's debut. Now, as a member of POLARIX, I hope you'll continue leading the team with more exciting performances.

1902
03:30:35,300 --> 03:30:37,030
Let's hear a few words from him.

1903
03:30:37,240 --> 03:30:40,080
Hello, I'm HAN GYUL.

1904
03:30:44,440 --> 03:30:45,590
First,

1905
03:30:46,560 --> 03:30:48,040
the Guardians

1906
03:30:48,090 --> 03:30:53,580
who truly love and encourage me

1907
03:30:53,590 --> 03:30:54,730
and

1908
03:30:55,230 --> 03:30:57,450
my family,

1909
03:30:57,450 --> 03:30:58,870
including my mother,

1910
03:30:58,980 --> 03:31:00,730
my eldest brother, second brother,

1911
03:31:00,730 --> 03:31:05,850
sisters-in-law and nephews, thank you very much.

1912
03:31:08,190 --> 03:31:09,130
Also,

1913
03:31:10,870 --> 03:31:13,730
although I don't look very nervous,

1914
03:31:13,730 --> 03:31:16,360
I can be more nervous than you think.

1915
03:31:16,360 --> 03:31:18,630
So I usually try not to show it.

1916
03:31:18,650 --> 03:31:20,990
I'm still nervous.

1917
03:31:21,470 --> 03:31:24,080
Anyway, I'm really...

1918
03:31:25,790 --> 03:31:28,930
I've always been challenging something.

1919
03:31:30,230 --> 03:31:31,290
A place like this...

1920
03:31:33,660 --> 03:31:35,790
This is the first time I've come to somewhere this difficult.

1921
03:31:36,320 --> 03:31:40,450
Having defeat this, I feel very good.

1922
03:31:40,450 --> 03:31:41,880
I also feel a little...

1923
03:31:42,630 --> 03:31:44,030
unreal.

1924
03:31:45,210 --> 03:31:46,270
Now too...

1925
03:31:46,410 --> 03:31:48,890
In my future, there are still

1926
03:31:48,940 --> 03:31:51,380
many paths

1927
03:31:51,380 --> 03:31:54,730
that I can take that are hidden, so I'll find my way well

1928
03:31:54,790 --> 03:31:56,880
and keep advancing in

1929
03:31:57,160 --> 03:31:58,890
this long journey.

1930
03:31:59,050 --> 03:32:00,880
I hope in the future,

1931
03:32:01,220 --> 03:32:05,350
everyone can continue to support me, HAN GYUL.

1932
03:32:05,550 --> 03:32:07,180
Guardians. Thank you.

1933
03:32:07,620 --> 03:32:10,050
Trainee HAN GYUL,

1934
03:32:10,050 --> 03:32:18,110
you said that those who engaged in the Starlight Boys knew about true happiness. If you measure it with a happiness index, how many points do you get today?

1935
03:32:20,200 --> 03:32:21,170
First,

1936
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:23,710
I'm

1937
03:32:24,020 --> 03:32:27,020
100% happy.

1938
03:32:27,250 --> 03:32:29,640
And I'm very nervous.

1939
03:32:30,600 --> 03:32:33,060
I think fifty-fifty.

1940
03:32:33,060 --> 03:32:39,380
Yes, because this is your last debut, your future road should be very different, please say a word.

1941
03:32:41,670 --> 03:32:44,580
Although I don't know

1942
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:47,090
who will be in the group with me,

1943
03:32:48,870 --> 03:32:50,620
I'll try my best to become someone

1944
03:32:50,620 --> 03:32:53,160
who can guide our group well.

1945
03:32:53,380 --> 03:32:54,440
Thank you.

1946
03:32:54,990 --> 03:33:02,100
Trainee HAN GYUL who has always been showing his amazing side taking on challenges. Congratulations on your debut. Please move to the debut seat.

1947
03:33:04,760 --> 03:33:12,730
Trainee HAN GYUL, while it will be difficult to toss away this period of time to the back of your head and start anew,

1948
03:33:12,730 --> 03:33:19,660
writing down this amazing conclusion by debuting, I hope this will become a precious moment for trainee HAN GYUL too.

1949
03:33:19,660 --> 03:33:27,990
From now on, you won't be a trainee, but a global artist who will be out to touch the world. I will be cheering for you.

1950
03:33:51,070 --> 03:33:52,770
The trainee in 5th place

1951
03:33:56,240 --> 03:34:00,390
is known for his beautiful smile.

1952
03:34:01,220 --> 03:34:05,720
It is said that when trainees go to this trainee when they're struggling or sad,

1953
03:34:05,720 --> 03:34:08,030
they'll feel much better.

1954
03:34:30,410 --> 03:34:33,290
The first impression he gives off is a trendy and manly guy.

1955
03:34:33,290 --> 03:34:37,770
This Trainee showed a kind of reverse charm in the in the practice room.

1956
03:34:37,860 --> 03:34:42,820
The powerful performance on the Final stage today is also remarkable.

1957
03:34:48,450 --> 03:34:51,630
The Trainee of the Starlight Boys ranked fifth

1958
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:10,010
is Trainee PENTOR. Congratulations.

1959
03:35:18,790 --> 03:35:25,780
Trainee PENTOR received a total of 693,895 votes to occupy the fifth place.

1960
03:35:31,590 --> 03:35:38,810
Trainee PENTOR is not just good. From his charming performances on the stage to the vocal,

1961
03:35:38,810 --> 03:35:44,870
he really is suitable for different stages. What will he be like in POLARIX? I am already looking forward to it.

1962
03:35:44,870 --> 03:35:52,220
I hope he can become a shiny idol that illuminates the hearts of Guardians all over the world. Let's listen to what he wants to say first.

1963
03:35:55,010 --> 03:35:57,810
Hello, everyone. I'm PENTOR.

1964
03:36:00,750 --> 03:36:01,750
It's just...

1965
03:36:02,020 --> 03:36:13,170
I was so nervous that I forgot everything I thought about. Actually, I just have a lot of people I want to thank, and I'll take this opportunity to do so.

1966
03:36:13,170 --> 03:36:20,850
First of all, I want to thank my family, my friends, and my brothers and sisters.

1967
03:36:20,850 --> 03:36:23,550
It also includes

1968
03:36:23,550 --> 03:36:24,940
my actor friends at T-POP.

1969
03:36:24,990 --> 03:36:32,040
All the T-POP artists who have supported and promoted T-POP from day one to today.

1970
03:36:49,490 --> 03:36:51,750
Congratulations.

1971
03:36:51,950 --> 03:36:57,070
-We...
-There's more I want to say.
-Please go ahead and say all you want.

1972
03:36:57,200 --> 03:37:00,980
-I'm sorry.
-Please go on.

1973
03:37:01,760 --> 03:37:10,160
Next I'd like to thank my agency. Thank you, Insight Entertainment.

1974
03:37:10,250 --> 03:37:15,400
Thank you for acknowledging my ability, always hearing my voice,

1975
03:37:15,930 --> 03:37:17,910
and respecting my choices.

1976
03:37:17,910 --> 03:37:22,470
Thank you so much to all the contestants in this program.

1977
03:37:22,860 --> 03:37:29,470
Whether I'm happy or sad, they always accompany me and encourage me.

1978
03:37:29,510 --> 03:37:31,480
And...

1979
03:37:31,480 --> 03:37:35,850
All the Guiders,

1980
03:37:35,850 --> 03:37:38,480
MCs, and PDs.

1981
03:37:38,480 --> 03:37:43,560
Everyone here

1982
03:37:43,780 --> 03:37:45,150
has always been

1983
03:37:45,320 --> 03:37:46,580
taking good care of me.

1984
03:37:46,580 --> 03:37:49,880
So thank you very much.

1985
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:53,270
Yes, congratulations.

1986
03:37:54,970 --> 03:37:57,920
And what's also essential is

1987
03:37:58,070 --> 03:38:00,590
My Guardians.

1988
03:38:00,900 --> 03:38:08,010
"I'm so lucky that I have you." This sentence remains true, because I am really lucky to have you here.

1989
03:38:08,010 --> 03:38:19,720
You're the reason I'm standing here, and I know every vote isn't easy. Thank you very much, and I will not let you down in the future. I will keep trying.

1990
03:38:19,720 --> 03:38:28,640
I won't let you down, and I will continue to work hard. No matter what's up there, be it the Polaris or the unpredictable future, I will soar up there.

1991
03:38:22,840 --> 03:38:28,690
Be it the Polaris or the unpredictable future, I will triumph and soar over them.

1992
03:38:29,080 --> 03:38:30,510
I hope

1993
03:38:30,510 --> 03:38:31,870
on my new path,

1994
03:38:31,870 --> 03:38:36,160
you will be with me to accompany me to the end. Thank you, everyone.

1995
03:38:38,540 --> 03:38:45,650
All right. Trainee PENTOR who will be on a bigger stage, congratulations. Please go to the seat with your ranking

1996
03:38:45,650 --> 03:38:47,670
and take your seat.

1997
03:38:49,230 --> 03:38:50,190
Thank you.

1998
03:38:57,980 --> 03:39:03,370
Trainee PENTOR always illuminates the show with his bright smile.

1999
03:39:03,370 --> 03:39:11,810
In his new group, I'm sure he'll remain a bright ray of sunshine. I hope he'll stay true to his roots and grow into a cool artist who conveys hope.

2000
03:39:11,810 --> 03:39:13,200
Congrats on your debut.

2001
03:39:39,350 --> 03:39:43,010
Next, I'll reveal the trainee who will debut in 4th place.

2002
03:39:52,430 --> 03:40:01,840
The first time we met, he seemed to lack confidence, but through continuous efforts, he showed his unlimited development possibilities.

2003
03:40:21,030 --> 03:40:26,760
The more we know, the more attractive the Trainee is. His first impression seems a little cold, though.

2004
03:40:26,760 --> 03:40:31,630
His nonsensical and mischievous behaviors have led to love from many trainees.

2005
03:40:39,830 --> 03:40:42,610
The Trainee of Starlight Boys ranked fourth...

2006
03:41:06,750 --> 03:41:08,390
The fourth trainee

2007
03:41:09,710 --> 03:41:12,750
is Trainee XIN CHE. Congratulations.

2008
03:41:26,780 --> 03:41:33,340
Trainee XIN CHE gained the fourth place with a total of 882,415 votes.

2009
03:41:47,580 --> 03:41:56,250
Trainee XIN CHE hasn't been trained as an idol, so he was chosen as the Trainee who has gained the most growth among Starlight Boys' Trainees.

2010
03:41:56,250 --> 03:42:03,680
Thanks to his natural appearance and hard work, he has become one of the debut members. Let's listen to what he's going to say.

2011
03:42:19,380 --> 03:42:23,790
Ah, first of all, I want to thank...

2012
03:42:23,790 --> 03:42:36,450
Over the past four months, every Guardians has watched me make progress bit by bit. Thank you for your support, thank you

2013
03:42:36,450 --> 03:42:39,050
for your trust in me.

2014
03:42:39,050 --> 03:42:40,990
And then, and then.

2015
03:42:40,990 --> 03:42:42,450
And then I want to...

2016
03:42:42,450 --> 03:42:43,460
And then, and then.

2017
03:42:43,460 --> 03:42:45,590
And then I also want to thank

2018
03:42:45,800 --> 03:42:47,870
myself. That is...

2019
03:42:47,870 --> 03:42:56,000
I have this courage to step on this stage and start a new life for myself.

2020
03:42:56,000 --> 03:43:06,760
Then I also want to thank every Guider for their comments, allowing me to improve. I also have to thank

2021
03:43:06,770 --> 03:43:09,940
every staff member just took care of me and then...

2022
03:43:09,940 --> 03:43:11,440
Thank you so much

2023
03:43:11,440 --> 03:43:15,950
to all the trainees who have been with me for the last few months, and then...

2024
03:43:15,950 --> 03:43:17,310
um,

2025
03:43:17,310 --> 03:43:18,480
thank you, guys.

2026
03:43:18,500 --> 03:43:19,640
Thank you, guys.

2027
03:43:29,270 --> 03:43:35,860
Please make a heart gesture to all the Guardians who voted for you by looking at our cameras with love.

2028
03:43:36,460 --> 03:43:38,250
Can you show your love to them?

2029
03:43:48,870 --> 03:43:52,410
Oh, it's a pity to see it only once.

2030
03:43:53,170 --> 03:43:55,930
Right? It's too bad that we can only see it once.

2031
03:43:56,250 --> 03:44:01,870
How would it be if you use the ending pose to express today's mood? Please show it.

2032
03:44:02,380 --> 03:44:04,240
Ending pose.

2033
03:44:04,270 --> 03:44:05,520
Your mood now.

2034
03:44:14,440 --> 03:44:16,130
Ending pose, ending pose.

2035
03:44:16,150 --> 03:44:19,630
What ending pose? What ending pose?

2036
03:44:26,210 --> 03:44:27,330
Okay.

2037
03:44:28,610 --> 03:44:30,970
Let us look forward to more ending poses in the future.

2038
03:44:30,970 --> 03:44:38,700
Congratulations on the debut, XIN CHE. Please sit on the seat of the fourth place given to you by the global Guardians.

2039
03:44:45,480 --> 03:44:52,570
I was impressed by the way XIN CHE wanted to show their hidden ambitions in the First Ranking Announcement Ceremony.

2040
03:44:52,570 --> 03:44:58,130
He handsomely kept his promise to his fans and trained hard to prove himself onstage.

2041
03:44:58,130 --> 03:45:04,720
Together with the POLARIX members, XIN CHE will surely shine brighter in the future. All the best, and congratulations!

2042
03:45:32,550 --> 03:45:34,830
Next is the 3rd place trainee.

2043
03:45:44,540 --> 03:45:51,120
It's said that this trainee, while taking on the challenge of becoming an idol, he's been through many obstacles and doubts.

2044
03:45:52,090 --> 03:45:58,770
Though it doesn't seem impossible, he managed to make it to the end, making his fans very happy.

2045
03:46:11,930 --> 03:46:18,500
He takes good care of even people around him. He's a very caring trainee.

2046
03:46:32,950 --> 03:46:34,270
The trainee

2047
03:46:34,270 --> 03:46:35,450
in 3rd place is...

2048
03:46:42,830 --> 03:46:44,220
Who could it be?

2049
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:51,750
The trainee in 3rd place is...

2050
03:46:58,270 --> 03:47:01,020
It's XU SHI HUAN! Congrats!

2051
03:47:09,830 --> 03:47:16,930
XU SHI HUAN came in 3rd place with a total of 1,431,896 votes.

2052
03:47:35,450 --> 03:47:42,210
With unremitting efforts, Trainee XU SHI HUAN has finally turned uncertainties into a remarkable success.

2053
03:47:42,210 --> 03:47:47,970
How will he meet his fans after his debut? I'm really looking forward to it. Let's hear how he feels now first.

2054
03:48:19,450 --> 03:48:22,670
Hello, everyone, I am XU SHI HUAN of Starlight Boys.

2055
03:48:22,790 --> 03:48:25,910
Hello, everyone, I am XU SHI HUAN of Starlight Boys.

2056
03:48:25,920 --> 03:48:26,830
Yeah.

2057
03:48:29,420 --> 03:48:32,170
Ah, first of all,

2058
03:48:32,170 --> 03:48:33,690
I want to thank...

2059
03:48:45,210 --> 03:48:48,150
I want to thank myself for never giving up.

2060
03:48:48,310 --> 03:48:52,050
And I want to thank...

2061
03:48:52,070 --> 03:48:53,990
the 20-year-old...

2062
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:56,250
Who was maybe

2063
03:48:57,290 --> 03:49:01,030
a little rebellious and too bold

2064
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:03,830
to came into Korea alone to become a trainee.

2065
03:49:10,060 --> 03:49:14,110
Thank you for holding on to this dream at the age of 24.

2066
03:49:18,550 --> 03:49:20,310
Also.

2067
03:49:22,630 --> 03:49:24,020
Thank you to every Guardian.

2068
03:49:28,850 --> 03:49:31,180
Thank you for all your 'Light Up'.

2069
03:49:31,370 --> 03:49:33,410
Also...

2070
03:49:34,150 --> 03:49:39,570
It could be because this universe is too big, or it could be because we are too small.

2071
03:49:42,460 --> 03:49:46,710
The corner that belongs to us might still be a dark one.

2072
03:49:46,870 --> 03:49:47,930
Of course...

2073
03:49:48,760 --> 03:49:50,630
Because of your 'Light up' votes,

2074
03:49:50,630 --> 03:49:51,490
I

2075
03:49:51,490 --> 03:49:57,580
want to be the one to illuminate the galaxy in your universe.

2076
03:50:00,290 --> 03:50:01,800
And...

2077
03:50:03,150 --> 03:50:11,500
And thank Starlight Boys Crew, Guiders, and staff. Thank you very much

2078
03:50:11,920 --> 03:50:13,630
And...

2079
03:50:14,980 --> 03:50:19,020
Thank each of you for your love and every question.

2080
03:50:19,090 --> 03:50:22,070
And then what I want to say is

2081
03:50:22,730 --> 03:50:32,510
I will choose my own life, I will light up my own sky, and I will make it shine forever.

2082
03:50:35,380 --> 03:50:39,870
Thank you, everyone. And I have a request.

2083
03:50:41,280 --> 03:50:45,260
Maybe I only showed a fraction of myself in this program.

2084
03:50:45,460 --> 03:50:52,270
I would like to ask you to give me another chance so that I can make today my new beginning.

2085
03:50:52,300 --> 03:50:55,610
Give me another chance so that you can know me better. Thank you.

2086
03:50:58,750 --> 03:51:05,990
-I'm Trainee XU SHI HUAN, thank you.
-Congratulations, Trainee XU SHI HUAN.

2087
03:51:05,990 --> 03:51:11,600
-He made his debut as he wished.
-Thank you all.
-Please move to the debut seat immediately.

2088
03:51:16,870 --> 03:51:19,100
Yes, Trainee XU SHI HUAN.

2089
03:51:20,700 --> 03:51:28,040
Because of the desire for the stage, he has been trying his best to grow up in an orderly way until his successful debut.

2090
03:51:28,040 --> 03:51:32,830
Let's hope that he will work harder and improve as part of POLARIX.

2091
03:51:32,830 --> 03:51:37,500
Global idol, XU SHI HUAN, we're all rooting for your future.

2092
03:52:04,750 --> 03:52:07,370
Are you with us for this

2093
03:52:07,370 --> 03:52:10,920
moment of Starlight Boys' final ranking announcement where a global idol group is created?

2094
03:52:11,090 --> 03:52:17,130
There are now six confirmed members. Now there are the 1st, 2nd and 9th place

2095
03:52:17,130 --> 03:52:19,590
left to be announced.

2096
03:52:22,550 --> 03:52:26,420
Who will be the trainee to come in 1st place

2097
03:52:26,420 --> 03:52:29,670
and debut with the global idol group POLARIX?

2098
03:52:32,260 --> 03:52:33,600
From now on,

2099
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:35,030
I'll call out the names

2100
03:52:35,150 --> 03:52:37,080
of two candidates

2101
03:52:37,080 --> 03:52:38,380
for 1st place.

2102
03:52:48,590 --> 03:52:51,610
Starlight Boys Final Ranking Announcement Ceremony.

2103
03:52:51,780 --> 03:52:52,920
He is the first Trainee candidate

2104
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:58,890
who will debut as a global idol being the most dazzling center.

2105
03:53:32,300 --> 03:53:33,810
The first candidate

2106
03:53:44,630 --> 03:53:46,490
is Trainee SHAO ZI HENG.

2107
03:54:00,870 --> 03:54:02,280
The second candidate is...

2108
03:54:25,070 --> 03:54:27,650
Trainee LEE JUN HYUK.

2109
03:54:55,410 --> 03:54:58,310
Between Trainee SHAO ZI HENG and Trainee LEE JUN HYUK,

2110
03:54:58,310 --> 03:55:03,840
who will sit on the dazzling Polaris seat?

2111
03:55:13,030 --> 03:55:18,520
Let's welcome the two candidates for the first place trainee to the front of the stage.

2112
03:55:45,850 --> 03:55:52,020
The two Trainees ended the long dream journey of Starlight Boys and landed on the Debut Group list with dignity.

2113
03:55:52,020 --> 03:55:56,370
During this period, the two Trainees have shown their handsome friendship while competing with each other.

2114
03:55:56,370 --> 03:56:00,580
Which Trainee will be honored as No.1 today?

2115
03:56:00,580 --> 03:56:03,410
Guardians, let us anticipate the result.

2116
03:56:26,930 --> 03:56:31,490
First of all, Trainee SHAO ZI HENG and Trainee LEE JUN HYUK, congratulations on your debut.

2117
03:56:34,380 --> 03:56:43,770
Now that your debut has been confirmed, you must be happy. There has been many Guardians who have taken an interest in you two and giving you a lot of support.

2118
03:56:53,070 --> 03:57:02,240
Let's talk in turns. On the final ranking announcement ceremony, trainee SHAO ZI HENG, standing as the 1st place candidate, how do you feel?

2119
03:57:07,630 --> 03:57:08,760
I'm so nervous.

2120
03:57:12,800 --> 03:57:14,780
No matter what the result will be,

2121
03:57:15,470 --> 03:57:22,400
I will not forget my roots, and I will always go forward to the position I want.

2122
03:57:22,470 --> 03:57:23,630
Charge up there.

2123
03:57:27,590 --> 03:57:30,100
And next, trainee LEE JUN HYUK.

2124
03:57:30,100 --> 03:57:34,720
There must be a lot of thoughts flashing through your mind right now. How are you feeling?

2125
03:57:38,220 --> 03:57:39,090
First...

2126
03:57:46,380 --> 03:57:47,810
To be honest,

2127
03:57:48,240 --> 03:57:49,610
once again,

2128
03:57:49,680 --> 03:57:51,320
I debut.

2129
03:57:51,670 --> 03:57:54,570
I'm really happy to be just the candidate like this.

2130
03:57:54,780 --> 03:57:58,080
Becoming the candidate for the first place

2131
03:57:58,660 --> 03:58:00,270
makes me very happy.

2132
03:58:02,230 --> 03:58:03,510
Yes.

2133
03:58:03,510 --> 03:58:09,800
This is really the most exciting moment, and now it's time to announce the choice of the global Guardians.

2134
03:58:18,580 --> 03:58:24,730
As the first Polaris of Starlight Boys, Trainee SHAO ZI HENG has captured the hearts of global Guardians.

2135
03:58:24,730 --> 03:58:36,080
On the previous ranking announcement ceremony, he won the first place with overwhelming superiority. In order to become an idol that fans are proud of, SHAO ZI HENG wants to debut as the first place trainee. Can his wish

2136
03:58:36,080 --> 03:58:38,430
be realized today?

2137
03:58:45,880 --> 03:58:48,080
And Trainee LEE JUN HYUK.

2138
03:58:48,540 --> 03:58:56,320
Although your idol activities have received a lot of love from fans, you became a trainee again and challenged Starlight Boys

2139
03:58:56,320 --> 03:58:58,080
with the goal of becoming a global idol.

2140
03:58:58,230 --> 03:59:05,920
With your unique desire to win and perfectionism, you showcased legendary performances and have always received high praises from the Guardians.

2141
03:59:28,360 --> 03:59:32,260
The number one Trainee chosen by Guardians around the world.

2142
03:59:32,600 --> 03:59:35,920
Who will it be?

2143
03:59:36,410 --> 03:59:41,860
The 1st place trainee who will be active as the brightest center of this group.

2144
03:59:41,860 --> 03:59:44,170
I will be announcing it now.

2145
03:59:50,600 --> 03:59:53,630
iQIYI global idol audition "Starlight Boys,"

2146
03:59:53,640 --> 03:59:58,980
there will only be one center who will be active as POLARIX's center.

2147
04:00:05,940 --> 04:00:08,680
The final champion of "Starlight Boys."

2148
04:00:30,930 --> 04:00:32,900
It's trainee SHAO ZI HENG!

2149
04:00:52,290 --> 04:01:00,000
Trainee SHAO ZI HENG came in 1st place with a total of 2,144,491 votes.

2150
04:01:02,130 --> 04:01:14,700
SHAO ZI HENG's drive to realize his dream is really admirable. On the stage, he gives his all for his skills to be recognized. Off the stage, he is really loved by his friends with his cheerful and lively personality.

2151
04:01:14,700 --> 04:01:16,770
Truly deserving as the Polaris.

2152
04:01:16,850 --> 04:01:27,210
It is said that wherever Trainee SHAO ZI HENG is, there will be constant laughter. I hope that you can continue leveraging your energetic role as the center of the POLARIX members.

2153
04:01:31,470 --> 04:01:33,570
Okay, congratulations.

2154
04:01:33,570 --> 04:01:37,910
Trainee SHAO ZI HENG won the first place. Let's hear how he feels right now.

2155
04:01:41,650 --> 04:01:42,950
First of all,

2156
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:46,910
I want to tell my brother,

2157
04:01:46,950 --> 04:01:49,850
no matter what, we have always been on good terms.

2158
04:01:50,680 --> 04:01:53,340
I'm his good younger brother. He's my good big brother.

2159
04:01:53,470 --> 04:02:02,670
-We've been very close.
So we...
None of us is like enemies.

2160
04:02:04,150 --> 04:02:05,910
I love them all.

2161
04:02:08,190 --> 04:02:10,690
And I want to say

2162
04:02:10,710 --> 04:02:12,850
First of all, I want to thank

2163
04:02:12,900 --> 04:02:15,780
the fans around the world who voted for me.

2164
04:02:16,670 --> 04:02:20,550
You've worked hard. I know you've been working hard to vote for me.

2165
04:02:25,270 --> 04:02:28,720
Then I would like to thank the Staff of iQIYI

2166
04:02:29,700 --> 04:02:35,300
for giving me such a great stage to showcase my dance and music.

2167
04:02:36,250 --> 04:02:37,740
I'm really very thankful.

2168
04:02:38,320 --> 04:02:40,050
I also want to thank

2169
04:02:40,390 --> 04:02:41,500
the Guiders

2170
04:02:41,500 --> 04:02:42,530
for always being...

2171
04:02:42,530 --> 04:02:43,500
They are

2172
04:02:43,500 --> 04:02:44,880
really...

2173
04:02:45,020 --> 04:02:49,320
Every time they see me, they're full of smiles.

2174
04:02:49,320 --> 04:02:50,380
That is...

2175
04:02:50,810 --> 04:02:53,660
Your smiles gave me a lot of strength, really.

2176
04:02:55,050 --> 04:02:56,820
And actually...

2177
04:02:57,440 --> 04:02:59,780
Two months...

2178
04:03:00,120 --> 04:03:02,540
Two months ago before I came here,

2179
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:09,630
I didn't know if I was going the right way.

2180
04:03:10,850 --> 04:03:12,900
I always thought it was my...

2181
04:03:14,150 --> 04:03:17,310
Taking this path was always my obsession.

2182
04:03:17,980 --> 04:03:19,860
But I don't think so now.

2183
04:03:21,630 --> 04:03:23,000
I have you.

2184
04:03:23,360 --> 04:03:25,270
I really want to say thank you.

2185
04:03:25,330 --> 04:03:27,470
You're helping fulfill my dream.

2186
04:03:28,090 --> 04:03:33,930
So I want to tell you that I will continue to work hard and I will do my best on every stage.

2187
04:03:34,470 --> 04:03:35,730
Trust me.

2188
04:03:36,360 --> 04:03:39,140
We will create a new era.

2189
04:03:39,330 --> 04:03:40,610
We will

2190
04:03:41,670 --> 04:03:44,120
be at the top of the industry.

2191
04:03:49,880 --> 04:03:56,410
Yes, with the support of Guardians around the world, SHAO ZI HENG debuted as the proudest number one.

2192
04:03:56,410 --> 04:04:01,150
Is there anything you want to promise your fans?

2193
04:04:19,470 --> 04:04:21,140
I will promise that

2194
04:04:27,550 --> 04:04:29,720
I don't want to be

2195
04:04:30,180 --> 04:04:32,990
someone who just does

2196
04:04:34,880 --> 04:04:40,020
many things as it is. I want to be someone who can bring everyone positive energy.

2197
04:04:40,610 --> 04:04:50,530
I hope that my presence can give you happiness, even if it's just a little bit, at work or at school,

2198
04:04:50,740 --> 04:04:55,130
I hope I can bring you some strength. Like a fan told me last time

2199
04:04:55,460 --> 04:04:58,350
that I'm their little sun.

2200
04:04:59,150 --> 04:05:02,060
In fact, in fact, I feel that it is actually for me...

2201
04:05:02,060 --> 04:05:04,930
It was very touching, because I think...

2202
04:05:05,380 --> 04:05:06,860
Since I was a kid, I've been able...

2203
04:05:08,400 --> 04:05:11,060
I've always wanted to be able

2204
04:05:11,070 --> 04:05:15,470
to give others strength and a bit happiness.

2205
04:05:17,510 --> 04:05:20,620
But now I feel like I did it because you guys are here.

2206
04:05:22,970 --> 04:05:28,680
The first place of Starlight Boys belongs to Trainee SHAO ZI HENG. Congratulations.

2207
04:05:31,700 --> 04:05:41,260
Then the runner-up, Trainee LEE JUN HYUK, who received a total of 1,532,218 votes.

2208
04:05:41,280 --> 04:05:49,410
In the process of dreaming of becoming an idol, he came to Starlight Boys when he lacked confidence in himself and found his original aspiration and strengthened his belief.

2209
04:05:50,270 --> 04:05:59,030
Because he did not give up and sticked to the end, he not only made a successful debut, but also got the second place. Please share your thoughts with the Guardians around the world.

2210
04:06:01,870 --> 04:06:02,980
First,

2211
04:06:02,980 --> 04:06:09,280
what ZI HENG said is so good that I don't know what to say.

2212
04:06:09,280 --> 04:06:14,980
To the director of Starlight Boys, PD director, and the makeup and hair teacher who did a lot of work behind the scenes, the staff, and all the teachers Staff...

2213
04:06:14,980 --> 04:06:21,240
Many thanks to all the people behind the scenes for their help.

2214
04:06:21,240 --> 04:06:24,200
And all the Trainees of Starlight Boys.

2215
04:06:24,320 --> 04:06:25,700
Really.

2216
04:06:26,360 --> 04:06:29,410
I want to tell you that everyone has worked hard.

2217
04:06:30,100 --> 04:06:31,680
Also...

2218
04:06:31,940 --> 04:06:35,190
My friends, thank you for supporting me.

2219
04:06:35,390 --> 04:06:37,460
Mom, Dad.

2220
04:06:39,630 --> 04:06:41,790
I'm making my debut again.

2221
04:06:58,280 --> 04:06:59,070
Really...

2222
04:07:00,550 --> 04:07:04,430
I came to "Starlight Boys" thinking it's my last chance.

2223
04:07:04,590 --> 04:07:08,240
To the Guardians who made my dream come true, I am very, very.

2224
04:07:08,380 --> 04:07:09,820
thankful to you all.

2225
04:07:11,510 --> 04:07:14,150
Really, one thing I can promise you is that

2226
04:07:14,270 --> 04:07:18,210
our team will put on performances

2227
04:07:18,210 --> 04:07:21,520
without regrets after our performance.

2228
04:07:21,530 --> 04:07:23,310
I can do it.

2229
04:07:23,310 --> 04:07:25,050
And...

2230
04:07:25,370 --> 04:07:27,320
SHI YING from MIRAE.

2231
04:07:28,610 --> 04:07:30,910
Thank you for coming to cheer me on.

2232
04:07:34,850 --> 04:07:36,300
In the future,

2233
04:07:36,910 --> 04:07:38,390
I'll be a member of POLARIX.

2234
04:07:38,860 --> 04:07:40,920
I'll grow better.

2235
04:07:41,840 --> 04:07:42,930
Really.

2236
04:07:42,930 --> 04:07:44,370
We'll be active

2237
04:07:44,510 --> 04:07:46,060
without regrets.

2238
04:07:46,110 --> 04:07:48,220
Also. I...

2239
04:07:48,790 --> 04:07:49,940
ZAI.

2240
04:07:49,940 --> 04:07:51,600
With ZAI.

2241
04:07:51,600 --> 04:07:54,950
We always talked about debuting together.

2242
04:07:55,400 --> 04:08:02,830
We talked about this every night, but being able to debut with ZAI, I'm very happy.

2243
04:08:03,030 --> 04:08:04,770
Once again,

2244
04:08:04,930 --> 04:08:09,970
to the Guardians who've voted for me. Thank you so much.

2245
04:08:12,760 --> 04:08:13,570
All right.

2246
04:08:14,380 --> 04:08:20,260
Trainee LEE JUN HYUK has realized his dream of debuting again. What side of you will you be showing to your fans

2247
04:08:20,260 --> 04:08:21,640
in the future?

2248
04:08:25,490 --> 04:08:26,940
Just like now,

2249
04:08:26,940 --> 04:08:37,020
-I'll be the one who guards you by your side, thank you.
-Congrats, 2nd-place LEE JUN HYUK, please move to the debut seat with your ranking.

2250
04:08:50,640 --> 04:08:57,860
The all-rounded trainee LEE JUN HYUK always put on great performances and received the enthusiastic support of Guardians around the world.

2251
04:08:57,860 --> 04:09:06,130
To step on the cool stage without regret, I hope you keep developing and shine as a global idol after your debut.

2252
04:09:46,710 --> 04:09:50,340
All right, Trainee SHAO ZI HENG,

2253
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:55,010
please move to the most dazzling Polaris position.

2254
04:10:03,350 --> 04:10:13,240
Although Trainee SHAO ZI HENG has maintained at the top, he did not stop where he was but overcame the struggle with his loneliness to secure the first place.

2255
04:10:13,240 --> 04:10:19,520
Now that he has met the handsome members, he has the courage to accept the challenge and pursue bigger dreams.

2256
04:10:19,520 --> 04:10:22,410
Cheer for you and wish you can turn out to be an international artist.

2257
04:11:03,110 --> 04:11:10,200
So far among the Starlight Boys, eight Trainees have realized their dreams. Now there is only one seat left

2258
04:11:10,200 --> 04:11:12,130
in POLARIX.

2259
04:11:13,910 --> 04:11:22,060
Among the 10 Trainees who have not yet been named, only one Trainee has been chosen by the Guardians to debut as an international idol.

2260
04:11:25,030 --> 04:11:28,300
The last trainee chosen by the Guardians.

2261
04:11:28,530 --> 04:11:30,360
Who on earth is it?

2262
04:11:37,460 --> 04:11:38,510
First,

2263
04:11:38,580 --> 04:11:40,110
the candidates

2264
04:11:40,480 --> 04:11:41,610
for the 9th place.

2265
04:11:41,750 --> 04:11:43,940
We'll reveal all 4 of them.

2266
04:11:48,420 --> 04:11:52,650
These are the candidates for the 9th place.

2267
04:12:01,220 --> 04:12:02,950
Trainee YOO JUN.

2268
04:12:17,400 --> 04:12:20,110
Trainee HONG SUNG MIN.

2269
04:12:34,600 --> 04:12:37,490
Trainee LEE DA EUL.

2270
04:12:49,560 --> 04:12:51,380
Trainee DUAN XING XING.

2271
04:13:05,320 --> 04:13:09,560
Like this, the four candidates have been announced.

2272
04:13:18,460 --> 04:13:21,730
Trainee YOO JUN.

2273
04:13:21,950 --> 04:13:25,780
Trainee HONG SUNG MIN.

2274
04:13:27,260 --> 04:13:31,840
Trainee LEE DA EUL.

2275
04:13:32,780 --> 04:13:36,540
Trainee DUAN XING XING.

2276
04:13:38,350 --> 04:13:43,520
Only one of these four trainees

2277
04:13:43,520 --> 04:13:46,330
is the last TOP 9 member

2278
04:13:46,330 --> 04:13:48,190
who can realize his dream of debut.

2279
04:13:56,090 --> 04:14:00,470
Now Trainees should be very nervous.

2280
04:14:00,470 --> 04:14:04,990
Let me talk to each of them before I announce the ninth member.

2281
04:14:12,770 --> 04:14:16,230
First of all, Trainee YOO JUN, how are you feeling right now?

2282
04:14:17,030 --> 04:14:19,560
My mood now...

2283
04:14:22,010 --> 04:14:26,350
I'm so nervous, I think my heart is about to explode.

2284
04:14:37,070 --> 04:14:37,830
Are you crying?

2285
04:14:38,240 --> 04:14:42,000
I feel a little sad after seeing my friends.

2286
04:14:42,000 --> 04:14:46,600
Ah, I'm in a good mood now, although I'm also very nervous.

2287
04:14:46,600 --> 04:14:51,070
First of all, I'm already grateful to be a candidate.

2288
04:14:51,590 --> 04:14:53,780
And, really...

2289
04:14:56,020 --> 04:14:58,510
I hope it's me.

2290
04:14:58,510 --> 04:15:00,050
Thank you.

2291
04:15:03,840 --> 04:15:09,610
That's right. Trainee HONG SUNG MIN is there anything you really want to say right now?

2292
04:15:10,680 --> 04:15:12,860
Really.

2293
04:15:13,440 --> 04:15:20,700
Thank you so much to the fans who've supported me up till now.

2294
04:15:23,730 --> 04:15:24,860
It's really...

2295
04:15:24,860 --> 04:15:25,990
No.

2296
04:15:26,250 --> 04:15:28,850
I mean, no matter what the result is,

2297
04:15:28,850 --> 04:15:37,220
I learned a lot in this time and met a lot of great people.

2298
04:15:37,510 --> 04:15:40,310
It was an amazing

2299
04:15:40,310 --> 04:15:43,210
and fantasy-like time. Thank you.

2300
04:15:43,550 --> 04:15:45,820
Thank you.

2301
04:15:47,580 --> 04:15:48,790
Yes.

2302
04:15:48,790 --> 04:15:52,940
Trainee LEE DA EUL, what are you thinking right now?

2303
04:15:53,710 --> 04:15:57,870
I'm not thinking about anything now.

2304
04:15:58,010 --> 04:15:59,690
Truly.

2305
04:16:01,470 --> 04:16:06,900
I can't imagine that I can come to this far today.

2306
04:16:07,300 --> 04:16:09,810
Truly.

2307
04:16:09,990 --> 04:16:12,310
Now my heart is beating very fast.

2308
04:16:13,350 --> 04:16:18,340
My mood is very complicated. First of all, it's too...

2309
04:16:18,510 --> 04:16:21,240
Everyone who has supported me in coming this far,

2310
04:16:21,240 --> 04:16:24,110
I want to say thank you.

2311
04:16:24,350 --> 04:16:25,530
Really.

2312
04:16:25,530 --> 04:16:31,340
I'm only here today thanks to everyone's love.

2313
04:16:32,290 --> 04:16:33,280
Yes.

2314
04:16:33,310 --> 04:16:35,770
Finally, Trainee DUAN XING XING.

2315
04:16:36,670 --> 04:16:39,540
If you have anything to say, please say it.

2316
04:16:41,530 --> 04:16:44,740
I might have quite a lot to say.

2317
04:16:47,810 --> 04:16:50,990
Firstly, coming to "Starlight Boys,"

2318
04:16:50,990 --> 04:16:52,620
I thought

2319
04:16:53,270 --> 04:17:01,750
I'm really here for the stage. So the ranking isn't the most important for me.

2320
04:17:01,760 --> 04:17:03,590
Having a stage for me is enough.

2321
04:17:03,590 --> 04:17:04,470
Also...

2322
04:17:04,470 --> 04:17:07,680
Oh, really, I think I've a lot to say. Please wait for me. I'm sorry.

2323
04:17:09,210 --> 04:17:11,320
Because it seems like I...

2324
04:17:12,370 --> 04:17:15,670
Standing in this place today, I feel like I was brought back

2325
04:17:15,940 --> 04:17:18,900
to one night, three or four years ago.

2326
04:17:20,460 --> 04:17:21,840
And...

2327
04:17:22,550 --> 04:17:28,900
It was as if the words we had shouted together to the sky had just sounded beside our ears.

2328
04:17:29,370 --> 04:17:35,140
And the fireworks we watched together on New Year's Eve, and the buried summer.

2329
04:17:36,140 --> 04:17:43,520
In the past three or four years, I have really experienced too many things. Seems that many things have changed, but they may not.

2330
04:17:43,950 --> 04:17:51,360
I was lucky enough to read a letter from a fan two days ago, in which he said he's supported me for three or four years.

2331
04:17:51,360 --> 04:17:59,640
In the past three or four years, there have been a lot of ups and downs. He said that only when we have experienced it personally,

2332
04:17:59,640 --> 04:18:01,350
to really be empathetic.

2333
04:18:01,350 --> 04:18:02,710
So I think...

2334
04:18:03,260 --> 04:18:04,770
I'm really grateful to you, everyone.

2335
04:18:04,770 --> 04:18:07,590
And even so, he's still...

2336
04:18:09,290 --> 04:18:10,720
still recalling.

2337
04:18:10,720 --> 04:18:12,470
I also miss...

2338
04:18:13,830 --> 04:18:18,130
The stories that remained of that cold winter.

2339
04:18:18,260 --> 04:18:22,570
I also miss that on May 8th, 2021,

2340
04:18:22,570 --> 04:18:26,460
my fans hung the highest star at the gate of the big factory for me.

2341
04:18:27,710 --> 04:18:30,590
It was as if I truly understood it in that moment.

2342
04:18:30,650 --> 04:18:33,960
I just understood that this is your love for me.

2343
04:18:34,260 --> 04:18:36,960
And what I want to say is that I still love you.

2344
04:18:37,890 --> 04:18:39,270
I wish that

2345
04:18:39,790 --> 04:18:42,620
I can still stand on the stage

2346
04:18:42,700 --> 04:18:47,660
to showcase myself as I wish, and bring everyone good performances.

2347
04:18:49,230 --> 04:18:50,820
Yes, I can make it.

2348
04:18:50,820 --> 04:18:53,310
And, ah, I've talked too much, I think.

2349
04:18:53,310 --> 04:18:55,790
One last thing, I hope...

2350
04:18:56,110 --> 04:18:58,560
I've never been afraid of

2351
04:19:00,110 --> 04:19:01,600
a long path full of obstacles.

2352
04:19:02,030 --> 04:19:05,290
But what I hope more is that we can

2353
04:19:05,430 --> 04:19:07,170
walk in the sea of stars,

2354
04:19:07,170 --> 04:19:08,590
achieve what we want,

2355
04:19:08,680 --> 04:19:10,060
and stay with each other day and night,

2356
04:19:10,380 --> 04:19:14,560
until it's dawn. Thank you. Please remember I'll shine.

2357
04:19:15,860 --> 04:19:18,470
Thank you, everyone.

2358
04:19:19,450 --> 04:19:25,920
Yes. Everyone has been practicing diligently. At this moment, they must be very eager.

2359
04:19:25,950 --> 04:19:32,110
The 100-day journey finally ends. It's time to announce the last lucky boy.

2360
04:19:40,480 --> 04:19:47,220
First of all, I would like to announce the 12th place trainee, who failed to debut.

2361
04:20:09,690 --> 04:20:12,120
The 12th place trainee is

2362
04:20:12,870 --> 04:20:15,700
Trainee HONG SUNG MIN.

2363
04:20:32,710 --> 04:20:36,740
It's a great pity that Trainee HONG SUNG MIN is in the 12th place.

2364
04:20:36,990 --> 04:20:42,640
During this period of time, HONG SUNG MIN  unreservedly show his charm as a hexagonal idol, and worked really hard.

2365
04:20:42,640 --> 04:20:48,180
I hope your second dream journey with Starlight Boys will become a precious memory.

2366
04:21:05,030 --> 04:21:08,570
Next is the 11th Trainee.

2367
04:21:11,510 --> 04:21:16,840
Next is the final 11th place trainee.

2368
04:21:28,670 --> 04:21:30,550
Trainee DUAN XING XING.

2369
04:21:44,810 --> 04:21:48,230
The 11th place trainee is DUAN XING XING.

2370
04:21:50,000 --> 04:21:56,220
During this period of time, he has been a very trustworthy member, and has taught the trainees a lot.

2371
04:21:56,220 --> 04:22:04,460
On all positions, trainee DUAN XING XING has worked really had to showcase stable and good performance.

2372
04:22:05,420 --> 04:22:07,770
Thank you.

2373
04:22:12,780 --> 04:22:19,080
After the announcement of the 12th and 11th places, there is only one place left.

2374
04:22:19,720 --> 04:22:23,470
Between the trainees YOO JUN and LEE DA EUL,

2375
04:22:24,230 --> 04:22:27,160
only one of the two trainees

2376
04:22:27,160 --> 04:22:29,510
will debut as a global idol.

2377
04:22:39,190 --> 04:22:44,710
Just like the Trainees waiting for the results, our Guardians should also be very nervous.

2378
04:22:44,780 --> 04:22:47,820
So now I'm going to announce the final results.

2379
04:22:53,110 --> 04:22:54,450
International icon.

2380
04:22:54,960 --> 04:22:57,220
The last member of POLARIX,

2381
04:22:57,260 --> 04:22:59,150
the ninth trainee.

2382
04:23:14,420 --> 04:23:21,910
The difference in votes between the ninth and tenth place trainee

2383
04:23:22,030 --> 04:23:24,390
is about 30,000 votes.

2384
04:23:45,190 --> 04:23:46,640
The ninth place trainee of Starlight Boys

2385
04:23:46,750 --> 04:23:51,680
chosen by the global Guardians to debut is

2386
04:23:59,710 --> 04:24:02,470
Trainee LEE DA EUL. Congratulations.

2387
04:24:14,440 --> 04:24:19,880
The total number of votes Trainee LEE DA EUL received was 277,835.

2388
04:24:19,880 --> 04:24:23,720
Finally, he shall debut as the 9th place. Please come to the stage.

2389
04:24:47,810 --> 04:24:56,420
Trainee LEE DA EUL has been working tirelessly day and night to show fans more of his growth. I believe the Guardians around the world have also seen this potential and been moved by him.

2390
04:24:56,420 --> 04:25:03,630
During this period of time, LEE DA EUL showcased his potential through his performance of various styles. He's a trainee that makes you look forward to his future work

2391
04:25:03,630 --> 04:25:06,490
and his shinier more vibrant self on stage.

2392
04:25:06,520 --> 04:25:08,190
We will be cheering you on.

2393
04:25:09,010 --> 04:25:16,040
Trainee LEE DA EUL who is now the final debut member, he should be happier than anyone else now. Please tell us how you feel.

2394
04:25:32,370 --> 04:25:35,270
Hello, I'm trainee LEE DA EUL.

2395
04:25:38,520 --> 04:25:39,810
I...

2396
04:25:39,950 --> 04:25:42,540
really didn't think I would get this far.

2397
04:25:42,540 --> 04:25:44,570
I really didn't expect this.

2398
04:25:46,240 --> 04:25:48,220
Here, I'm always...

2399
04:25:48,490 --> 04:25:51,310
On this show, I realized that

2400
04:25:51,380 --> 04:25:55,230
there's really so much I've to improve on.

2401
04:25:55,640 --> 04:25:59,270
I deeply felt that I'm really inadequate.

2402
04:25:59,640 --> 04:26:02,450
Still, really.

2403
04:26:02,910 --> 04:26:04,090
Like this.

2404
04:26:04,320 --> 04:26:05,810
On this position.

2405
04:26:06,070 --> 04:26:13,220
I really appreciate being here with candidates and performing on the final stage with trainees.

2406
04:26:13,890 --> 04:26:18,570
Thank you very much for giving me such a precious 9th place.

2407
04:26:20,870 --> 04:26:21,950
Really.

2408
04:26:22,430 --> 04:26:26,060
As the ninth place, I won't hold everyone back.

2409
04:26:26,060 --> 04:26:28,820
I'll continue to work hard.

2410
04:26:32,740 --> 04:26:33,790
Also,

2411
04:26:42,610 --> 04:26:43,860
It's really you.

2412
04:27:16,740 --> 04:27:19,010
I'll definitely show you a better side of me.

2413
04:27:19,010 --> 04:27:20,110
Thank you.

2414
04:27:22,570 --> 04:27:28,210
The last member of the global idol group, POLARIX, i s LEE DA EUL.

2415
04:27:28,280 --> 04:27:31,380
Finally, to our trainees.

2416
04:27:31,390 --> 04:27:33,170
Will you say something?

2417
04:27:35,950 --> 04:27:39,120
Our trainee friends.

2418
04:27:40,120 --> 04:27:42,520
You've worked hard.

2419
04:27:44,380 --> 04:27:47,910
I really learned a lot coming here.

2420
04:27:48,040 --> 04:27:50,380
With my shortcomings,

2421
04:27:50,380 --> 04:27:54,110
how much more I can improve, and...

2422
04:27:54,780 --> 04:27:57,850
looking at the other contestants,

2423
04:27:59,120 --> 04:28:00,250
really,

2424
04:28:00,250 --> 04:28:03,900
I wonder how long I've to practice to reach their level.

2425
04:28:04,500 --> 04:28:08,990
But just knowing that I'll be with them, really,

2426
04:28:09,070 --> 04:28:10,420
this is a moment

2427
04:28:10,450 --> 04:28:12,980
I don't think I'll ever forget.

2428
04:28:14,610 --> 04:28:16,650
Although the position seems too far away from me,

2429
04:28:17,280 --> 04:28:20,620
I will stay with the trainees so as not to be a drag on them.

2430
04:28:20,660 --> 04:28:23,810
I'll keep moving forward. Thank you.

2431
04:28:23,810 --> 04:28:25,470
Okay. Congratulations.

2432
04:28:25,500 --> 04:28:30,010
Please go to the debut seat with your precious memory.

2433
04:28:30,240 --> 04:28:31,290
Thank you.

2434
04:28:34,990 --> 04:28:40,520
Trainee LEE DA EUL has been training himself. It must have been difficult.

2435
04:28:40,520 --> 04:28:43,610
He always works miracles.

2436
04:28:43,610 --> 04:28:49,030
Now, he can move forward to bigger dreams with his reliable debut members.

2437
04:28:49,040 --> 04:28:55,020
Hopefully, many of the things he learned here will serve as a good springboard for future POLARIX events.

2438
04:28:55,030 --> 04:28:56,820
Congratulations on your debut.

2439
04:29:55,130 --> 04:29:58,590
At the announcement ceremony of the final ranking of the Starlight Boys, the 10 place is

2440
04:29:58,830 --> 04:30:04,030
Trainee YOO JUN, who received 247,729 votes.

2441
04:30:04,480 --> 04:30:11,100
Though it's a pity you missed the chance to debut, you're a trainee who has worked harder than anyone else and grown a lot.

2442
04:30:12,300 --> 04:30:22,340
While YOO JUN's starry journey ends here, I think this will be a new start. Keep working hard and I hope to see you on a big stage.

2443
04:30:22,340 --> 04:30:32,020
I believe that Guardians all over the world will cheer for you. Today, while you didn't make it to the debut line up. You've been very cool and worked very hard.

2444
04:30:33,270 --> 04:30:35,390
Please give him a huge round of applause.

2445
04:30:53,740 --> 04:30:58,750
Like this, with "Starlight Boys," with all the love and support from Guardians all over the world,

2446
04:30:58,750 --> 04:30:59,910
POLARIX is formed.

2447
04:31:00,330 --> 04:31:05,660
The final nine debut members have been selected. Congratulations, everyone.

2448
04:31:07,490 --> 04:31:09,660
And to the trainees who unfortunately

2449
04:31:09,950 --> 04:31:16,300
failed to make their debut despite their efforts to pursue their dreams during this period, you've really worked hard.

2450
04:31:16,300 --> 04:31:19,550
I look forward to meeting you again on a bigger stage in the future.

2451
04:31:25,180 --> 04:31:32,760
Then please say hello to the fans for the first time as the Polaris members born today.

2452
04:31:32,760 --> 04:31:35,070
Please come to the stage together.

2453
04:32:02,840 --> 04:32:06,350
Nine stars that are about to stand on the world stage and shine brilliantly.

2454
04:32:06,350 --> 04:32:11,980
Let's expect the POLARIX members to grow into a global idol team.

2455
04:32:17,480 --> 04:32:24,320
Guardians now witness today's nine teenagers who are about to start a new journey to realize their dream of debut.

2456
04:32:24,320 --> 04:32:25,730
Give them more care and love.

2457
04:32:36,120 --> 04:32:40,390
Say hello to everyone, POLARIX members.

2458
04:32:40,470 --> 04:32:42,620
