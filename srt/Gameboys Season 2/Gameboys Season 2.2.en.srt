00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:14,312
Pearl, is that you?

3
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:18,567
Baby!

4
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,819
Don't open it yet.

5
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:23,071
Wait for me.

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,698
Baby!

00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,870
What are you doing here?

00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,123
Hi, love birds.

10
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,669
What are you doing here?
You're not even wearing a face mask...

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,380
Sorry, I left it in the car.

12
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:41,214
But,

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,467
I'm negative, OK?

14
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:46,553
My mom insists that
we get tested every week.

15
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:48,096
So?

16
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:50,474
Why are you here?

17
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:51,808
You have some nerve to...

18
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:56,855
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,608
Baby, I'll just lay him down.

20
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,777
What's wrong with you, Terrence?

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,280
Right here!

22
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,059
Why is he here?

23
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,685
I don't know, baby.

24
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:37,646
We'll ask him when he wakes up.

25
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,066
Baby, I really didn't know.

26
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:43,401
Am I being evicted?

27
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,694
Am I in the dog house?

28
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:46,530
Baby, will you leave me here outside?

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,864
Baby, how can you do that to me?

30
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:49,449
- What are you talking about?
- Baby!

31
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,744
This is for that mestizo frog.

32
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:57,165
You're really something.

33
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:58,792
You act all grumpy, but really...

34
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,837
I'm not pretending to be grumpy.

35
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,588
Because I really am!

36
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:06,216
You are.

37
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:08,343
But deep down, you're a soft boy.

38
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:10,053
Whatever.

41
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,490
Baby!

42
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,034
Stop it.

43
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,035
What?!

44
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:18,496
Let's go back to what we were doing.

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,333
You still want to watch a movie?

46
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,001
No, I mean...

47
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,711
we were about to get naked.

48
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:27,380
Stop it.
We have to mind our guest.

49
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:31,134
Well, I'm also just a guest here anyway.

50
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:32,260
Baby!

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,845
You're not just a guest.

52
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,139
This is your home.

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,516
Everything that I own

54
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,101
is yours, too.

55
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,480
You're so crass!

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,900
You make everything sound naughty.

57
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:49,986
So how you you want me
to do it, baby?

58
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,529
You're such a jerk!

59
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,408
I'm kidding, baby.

60
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,787
I thought you were going
to kick Terrence out.

61
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:02,499
So you think I'm that inconsiderate?

62
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,169
I may be grumpy, but I can be caring too.

63
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:09,547
I never said you weren't.

64
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:12,634
I'm sure it must be hard for you.

65
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:15,553
That's why I'm so proud of you, baby.

Really?

69
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,439
When did you ever get drunk?

70
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,233
All you ever drink is chocolate milk.

71

Let's just clean up.

74
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:45,292
But first, you have to do this.

75
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,378
What are you up to?

76
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:50,338
Come on.

77
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:51,881
Please?

78
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,634
Fine.

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,071
My baby.

80
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,865
You're so weird.

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,200
I could get used to waking up with this view.

82
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,849
Really?!

83
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:53,985
Good morning!

84
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,945
You were quite drunk.

85
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,113
Let's eat!

86
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,366
I probably won't join you.

87
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,241
Hey, baby.

88
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:02,452
Baby! Good morning!

89
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,496
I saw what you posted earlier.

90
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,331
You're such a jerk.

91
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:08,541
Sit here, baby.

92
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,334
Okay.

93
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,669
Come on! Let's eat!

94
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,349
Looks yummy!

95
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,850
It's so good!

96
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,399
Come on, dig in!

97
00:06:32,774 --> 00:06:34,150
Gav, no need.

98
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,070
I've bothered you guys enough.

99
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:41,282
My baby cooked so much food.

100
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:44,577
Come on, let's eat.

101
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,045
This one's for you.

102
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:56,840
Thanks.

103
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:59,050
Go on.

104
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,433
What happened?

105
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,227
By the time we saw you,
you were already throwing up.

106
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:11,980
Baby, that's gross. We're still eating.

107
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,231
Sorry.

108
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:15,442
I don't know what happened.

109
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,610
I was just driving.

110
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,947
Then the next thing I knew,
I was just standing outside your door.

111
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,866
So you were drunk driving?

112
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:24,242
You're an idiot...

113
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,285
No, I wasn't.

114
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:30,415
I was already here when
I started drinking.

115
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,001
I realized

116
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,295
I had nowhere to go.

117
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,464
So...

118
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,716
I drank too much.

119
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:41,759
You don't have anyone else?

120
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,819
Come on. Let's just eat.

121
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:02,864
Get some eggs.

122
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:03,990
You're always fasting.

123
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,158
Eat up.

124
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:08,828
Come on. Don't be shy.

125
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:11,039
Feel at home.

126
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:26,221
Here you go.

127
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:27,889
Here's my bar snacks.

128
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,724
Bar snacks?

129
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:30,767
This, baby.

130
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:32,685
Come on, baby.

131
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:33,853
Whatever.

132
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:44,614
Are you sure it's all right for me
to stay here?

133
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,908
Of course!

134
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:49,661
If my baby doesn't want you here,

135
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,704
trust me, you'll know.

136
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,457
So what happened?

137
00:08:58,545 --> 00:08:59,879
I came out to my dad.

138
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,055
I knew this was going to happen.

139
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,351
He was not going to take it well.

140
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:18,982
But I couldn't keep living like this.

141
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:21,734
As expected,

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,404
he kicked me out.

143
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:27,740
The next thing I knew,

144
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:30,076
I was here at your doorstep.

145
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,454
I don't know why.

146
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,916
I guess I had nowhere else to go.

147
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,752
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,422
I dragged you into this mess.

149
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,299
Come on.

150
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,551
I'm your friend.

151
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:49,762
I know you're struggling.

152
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,973
Who else could you run into?

153
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,684
We're your friends.

154
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,604
Gav is right.

155
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,401
It wasn't easy for you to come out.

156
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:06,654
Actually, it was brave for you to come out.

157
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,783
You know, when my parents
found out about me,

158
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:12,785
I ran away.

159
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,747
But your parents accepted you.

160
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,419
Yeah.

161
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,132
Fortunately.

162
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:38,519
But I understand why you had
to leave home.

163
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,188
It's hard.

164
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:43,858
To be trapped at home when
you're not accepted.

165
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,985
All my life,

166
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,695
I felt like I had to beg

167
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,530
for validation.

168
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,157
And now,

169
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:55,536
they're disappointed in me.

170
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,705
That's how it is.

171
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:02,085
No matter how hard I try,

172
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:05,713
I will never be good enough for them.

173
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:13,221
You know, I realized

174
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:19,143
apart from my parents' acceptance,

175
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:26,150
I needed to accept myself.

176
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,278
But it's so hard to do.

177
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:34,200
It really would be nice to get
our parents' approval.

178
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:38,871
But you don't need their approval
to be who you are.

179
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:42,917
We can be our own validation.

180
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,503
You know?

181
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:49,006
We can just be good enough
for ourselves.

182
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:55,054
Wow, baby.
I'm so proud of you.

183
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,642
Come on, I just repeated what
my mom told me.

184
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,478
Honestly,

185
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:05,148
I'm still a work in progress.

186
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:08,568
But like her Highness says,

187
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:10,695
patience is...

188
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,740
a virtue.

189
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:19,370
We'll get there.

190
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:22,248
Gav, Cai...

191
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:24,041
Thank you.

192
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,086
You don't know how much
you've helped me.

193
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:30,423
I don't think I deserve your kindness.

194
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,008
Here you go again.

195
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:34,177
Telling us you don't deserve our kindness.

196
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:38,765
Maybe I'm a work in progress, too.

197
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,602
We're all the same.

198
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,270
It's okay.

199
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:47,064
Here.

200
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:47,982
Cheers!

201
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:48,816
Thank you.

202
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:49,859
Baby.

203
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:50,568
Cheers.

204
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,230
Baby, where's Terrence?

205
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,899
He passed out on the couch.

206
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,150
Didn't even make it
to the guest room.

207
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,359
He's so drunk.

208
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,529
I gave him a blanket
and a pillow.

209
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,365
Leave that for tomorrow.

210
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:03,993
It's okay.

211
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,245
Are you tired?
Go ahead and sleep.

212
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,164
I'll stay up a bit later.

213
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,424
What?

214
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:25,306
Baby, what are you doing?

215
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,693
May I dance with you, baby?

216
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,196
Alone this time?

217
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,448
Really?

218
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,620
May I?

219
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:51,165
My baby is so romantic.

220
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,426
Get used to it.

221
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:05,596
I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.

222
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,108
Thank you, baby.

223
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,944
For what?

224
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:22,530
Nothing.

225
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,199
You're so understanding.

226
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,537
You allowed Terrence to stay here.

227
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:32,581
We're supposed to be here

228
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,127
to spend time together,
just the two of us.

229
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,922
It's not a big deal, baby.

230
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,050
I understand.

231
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,301
I mean,

232
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,054
I went through the things
he went through.

233
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:51,976
You gave him good advice.

234
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:55,896
I'm sure he really appreciates it.

235
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:56,981
I hope...

236
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:59,817
he feels lighter somehow.

237
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,154
I know what it's like.

238
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,323
It so hard to come out,

239
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,035
to yourself, to your parents.

240
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:12,455
So much uncertainty.

241
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,126
But I'm glad I did.

242
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:19,712
You know why?

243
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:22,048
Why?

244
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,717
It makes me grateful

245
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,053
to be where we are now.

246
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,974
And now I can really say

247
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,435
that I'm unafraid.

248
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:36,771
And I'm proud of who I am.

249
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:44,320
I'm proud of you, too.

250
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:53,370
But do you know what I'm
really happy about?

251
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,415
What?

252
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:59,335
I opened myself up to you.

253
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:04,507
I became more open to my mom
and my siblings,

254
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,676
and I'm able to love

255
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:10,513
without fear,

256
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,473
without restrictions.

257
00:18:18,104 --> 00:18:19,271
What is it?

258
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,940
What are you thinking about?

259
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,735
You're such a romantic.

260
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:54,802
What now?

261
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:58,097
Are you just going to stare at it?

262
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:01,600
What?

263
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,395
Can't I just appreciate my property?

264
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,065
Come and get it, baby.

265
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:27,960
Nice one, baby.

266
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,254
Shh... stop it.

267
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:36,635
Baby...

268
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,971
Why are you laughing?

269
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:40,973
I'm ticklish, baby.

270
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:43,225
Go on.

271
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:52,568
Baby, cut it out!

272
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:54,903
Sorry, I'll stop.

273
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:58,657
Promise, I won't laugh.

274
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:08,042
Baby, come on.

275
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:11,462
I'm a bit woozy, so stop acting up.

276
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:12,963
But it feels so good.

277
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:15,507
Terrence might hear us.

278
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:16,759
It's so embarrassing.

279
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,302
He's already asleep.

280
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:20,095
Come here.

281
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:23,265
There....

282
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,851
There...

283
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:27,895
Right there...

284
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,693
What's wrong, baby?

285
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:37,404
Baby?

286
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:40,824
I'm so drunk.

287
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:44,244
We're so drunk.

288
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:49,083
OK.

289
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,125
You want me to take the lead?

290
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,960
No, baby.

291
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,297
I just thought it's our first time.

292
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:59,885
We probably shouldn't be under
the influence of alcohol.

293
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,178
Right?

294
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:02,888
Shouldn't our first time be special?

295
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:04,890
Huh?

296
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:08,936
What we have is special, isn't it?

297
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:10,813
Come on. Let's just do it.

298
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:12,314
It'll be good.

299
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:14,733
I'll make you feed good.

300
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:15,776
Let's just stop.

301
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,111
- Baby.
- Baby, I'll do a good job.

302
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,695
Baby, stop it.
- Baby.

303
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:21,782
Baby, please.

304
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:24,410
Dad!

305
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,037
Dad, I'm sorry, dad!

306
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:30,332
Dad!

307
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,009
Dad!

308
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,804
Dad, I'm sorry, dad!

309
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:45,973
Sorry if I like boys.

310
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,224
Dad!

311
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,477
Mom, please.

312
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:52,521
Don't send me away, please.

313
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:53,439
Terrence...

314
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:56,567
Dad!
- You're having nightmares, Terrence.

315
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:58,485
Dad!
- Terrence!

316
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:04,533
Are you OK?

317
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:08,036
I'll get him a glass of water.

318
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:28,098
Look...

319
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,978
I know…

320
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:38,901
I know that what you're going
through is difficult.

321
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,655
Gav and I are just here for you, OK?

322
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,450
OK?

323
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:15,562
Baby, you're still asleep?

324
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,731
You said you'd be here
in fifteen minutes.

325
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:19,525
We were going to exercise,
remember?

326
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:21,151
Just go on without me.

327
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:22,819
I'm still sleepy.

328
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,780
Baby, come on.

329
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:29,326
Promise I'll join you tomorrow, okay?

330
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:31,787
But you'll feel lazy again tomorrow.

331
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:34,831
We have to exercise regularly.

332
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,460
OK. Give me five minutes.

333
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,671
Five minutes? Really?

334
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:44,299
OK, ten minutes just to be sure.

335
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,425
Ten minutes?

336
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:47,219
Just to be sure.

337
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,805
I still have to wash my face.

338
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:50,973
OK, baby.

339
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,349
I miss you.

340
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:53,517
Come on!

341
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,560
See you!

342
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:00,023
Stop it, Gav!

343
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:03,193
Cairo, why haven't you gotten up yet?

344
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,989
Hi, Ma. Good morning.

345
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:10,117
Are you giving my son-in-law
a hard time?

346
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:13,120
"Son-in-law"?

347
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,039
I was about to get up when you called.

348
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,875
Really? I don't believe you.

349
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:20,544
Ma, why did you call?

350
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:24,172
I need to tell you something.

351
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,342
What is it?

352
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:46,278
Is this…

353
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:01,627
Hey.

354
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,254
Gav?

355
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:07,174
I thought I was already lost!

356
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,469
Monster, I mean, master...

357
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,304
What are you doing here?

00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:13,532
Thank you, my Gav, for loving me.

362
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:15,158
My words don't rhyme.

364
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,500
The days feel so short.

365
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,293
Am I really leaving?

Baby, look!

368
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:48,316
I thought we are going to work out?

369
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,613
Just a little push, OK?
You can do it!

370
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:54,614
Push, baby!

371
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:56,616
- We'll be back for you, OK?
- See you, Cai!

372
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:57,534
Baby!

373
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,327
Baby, what's wrong?

374
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:01,288
It's so frustrating

375
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,500
that I have to force myself to fit in.

376
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,003
I'm your boyfriend, right?
