00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,000
Come on, guys!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,733
Oh yeah, I still got game.

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:11,700
Hang on...

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,066
We already have 800 live viewers!

5
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,966
Thank you so much, guys!

6
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,100
If we reach a thousand,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,100
I'll give you some freebies.
Promise!

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,833
So, don't be shy
to give me some stars.

9
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,600
Support my gaming channel, please!

10
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,200
What the...

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,033
What a pro move!

12
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:35,700
Looks like I'm going to lose...

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
Baby, put on your shirt!

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,233
Why, baby? Do I look terrible?

15
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:43,266
Shut up! I'm on live stream!

16
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,566
Baby…

17
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,200
Baby...

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,400
- Go away, baby—
- But I can't get enough of you!

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,266
Crazy!

20
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,433
My viewers might get turned off!

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,533
Look, baby!

22
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:02,400
- I already have a thousand live viewers!
- See! I told you!

23
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,466
Hi, guys!

24
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:06,533
CaiReel Nation, how are you doing?

25
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,233
CaiReel Nation? What's that?

26
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,300
They're our supporters, baby!

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,133
- You mean ‘my' supporters?
- Go ahead.

28
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,600
- Ask them if they don't want me here.
- They don't care. They're only loyal to me.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,066
Am I right, guys?

30
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,266
- Seriously?
- Yes!

31
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,533
- For real?
- Yes!

32
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:22,800
OK, CaiReel Nation,

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,066
if you want me to leave already,
click the ‘angry' emoji.

34
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,400
You know the drill, guys!

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,266
- Click ‘angry'
- Click 'angry'! Go!

36
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,833
If you want me to kiss my baby,
click the ‘heart' emoji.

37
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,466
- Hey!
- What?

38
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,900
Go, go!

39
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,600
Do you see those emojis, baby?

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,066
That's a lot of hearts!

41
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:45,233
- The angry emojis are just about to appear!
- But it's nothing compared to my love for you.

42
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,966
Wait for the angry emojis!

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,833
Come on! Your viewers might think
that you can't keep your word.

44
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,666
Think about your 1,200 viewers.

45
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:56,666
What now?

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,433
Fine! Just a smack on the cheek, OK?

47
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,800
Sure, let's have the main event later.

48
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,266
You're such a jerk!

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
There you go!

50
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:09,766
Baby!

51
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,800
Baby! Yes!

52
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,266
Baby!

53
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,866
Do that again and you're dead!

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,766
Stop it, baby!

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,200
(IATF to announce new quarantine regulations
is the numbers of COVID-19 positive cases rise)

56
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:43,800
Yuck! You're so gross!

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,133
Let me wipe it.

58
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,566
It smells so bad!

59
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,833
Do you even brush your teeth?

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,333
Baby!

61
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,033
You're being a pest, baby!

62
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:18,448
(Business operations allowed in ECQ, MECQ and GCQ areas
but public encouraged to stay at home.)

63
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:24,566
Baby!

64
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,066
That's disgusting!

65
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm in the middle of a game!

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
(Gameboys Season2)

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,000
(Episode 1: Hi, Lovebirds)

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,066
Just relax, baby. Leave that to me.

69
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,300
But baby, I want to help you.

70
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:31,333
Let me cut the veggies.

71
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,400
But baby, do you know how?

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,733
Of course.

73
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,100
OK.

74
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:38,500
Baby?

75
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,533
Baby!

76
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,666
OK.

77
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:46,233
Let's get to work.

78
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,633
Nice, you're doing good.

79
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,666
Nice!

80
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,900
What happened?

81
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,400
Why are you crying?
- Silly!

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,200
You didn't even tell me
that this can make me cry.

83
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,166
OK, stay there…

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,833
Here, wear this.

85
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,266
Go.
- Idiot.

86
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,066
What are you doing?

87
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:31,466
I'm sorting whites and coloreds
before washing them.

88
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,400
Is that how it should be?

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Is this yours?

90
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,700
Yes.

91
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,600
Hey! You're such a perv!

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,766
Why? I was just checking!

93
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,433
It's my used boxers!

94
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,233
So it's yours?

95
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,533
Yes! You bugger!

96
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,566
Hey, baby! Give it back to me!

97
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,300
That's mine!

98
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,700
You're so nasty!

99
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,366
Will you help me do the laundry?

100
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:54,933
Will you help me do the laundry?

101
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,766
OK, I will!

102
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,733
Are we good?
- OK.

103
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,666
Give me a kiss!

104
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't want to!
- Fine!

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,733
Ouch!

106
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,166
OK, fine!

107
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,233
Give it back to me, baby!

108
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,066
Let's stop this!

109
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,666
I've had enough.

110
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,600
OK.

111
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,466
You're so annoying!

112
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,133
Ouch!

113
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,266
Smells nice, baby.

114
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,766
(Hanging our clothes but my baby left me hanging.)
Baby?

115
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,166
(Hanging our clothes but my baby left me hanging.)
What the?!

116
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,166
You know what, I'm done with this!

117
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,466
Hold on, baby!

118
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,500
Baby!

119
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,300
Are you tired, baby?

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,433
Yes, but not too tired.

121
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,100
Do you do this everyday?

122
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,833
Yes, but not in one day.

123
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,866
I only do the laundry once a week.

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,866
Did you like it, baby?

125
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,100
Am I now fit to be a husband?

126
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:08,166
It's not even a requirement.

127
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,333
I know.

128
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:16,066
Baby, I'll give you my share
for groceries, OK?

129
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,400
No need, baby.

130
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,133
Just save it up for a new computer.

131
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,900
I'll take care of our expenses.

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,133
I'm embarrassed.

133
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,533
Let me share the expenses with you.

134
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,033
We'll do that once we start living together.

135
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,133
But for now,

136
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,533
let me take care of you.

137
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,033
I want to take care of you.

138
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,666
If you insist.

139
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,866
I can't change your mind anyway.

140
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,866
OK.

141
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,833
But the day isn't over yet.

142
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,933
What else do we need to do?

143
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,866
You're not yet tired, right?

144
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:11,200
You're being annoying again, baby.

145
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,200
Why? What's on your mind?

146
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Stop it, Gavreel.

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,400
I'll just do some push-ups.

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Count with me, OK?

149
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,900
One… Two…

150
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,766
Baby!

151
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,966
Three… Four…

152
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,766
Stop it, baby!

153
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:28,966
Five…
- Silly!

154
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:29,766
Sex!

155
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:30,866
I mean, six! Six!

156
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:31,866
Six…
Seven…

157
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,600
Idiot!
You're an idiot!

158
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,633
I will miss you.

159
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:45,700
What's with the drama?

160
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,966
I'm just glad that
we have this time together.

161
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:55,266
Good thing your mom allowed you
to stay with me.

162
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,066
Fine.

163
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,900
Are you ready?

164
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,966
Ready for what?

165
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,000
I said I'm fine with cuddling…

166
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,666
and a bit of kissing.

167
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
OK.

168
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:14,900
Oops!

169
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,233
Take a bath first.

170
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,066
Take a bath first!

171
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,166
But baby...

172
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,000
I stink, do I?

173
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,433
Baby, we're both sweaty.

174
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,100
Go and take a bath first!

175
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,466
Fine, let's take a bath together.

176
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,033
No way!

177
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,533
We might end up doing something else.

178
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,100
Well, you have a point.

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,266
OK, I'll go first. I'll be quick, OK?

180
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,400
Baby…

181
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,033
It's your turn, baby.

182
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,366
Baby…

183
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:50,500
Hello, Ma.

184
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,266
Why are you still awake?

185
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,333
Gav makes me restless.

186
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,266
What do you mean?

187
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,466
What are you two doing?

188
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,766
Always do it safely, OK?

189
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:04,000
Ma! What are you talking about?

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I mean, he snores so loud
that's why I can't sleep.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
He's just like your father.

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,133
Really?

193
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,333
How did you deal with it?

194
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,633
Nothing.

195
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,800
I got used to it.

196
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,433
But now,

197
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm longing for that sound.

198
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,200
You miss him, don't you?

199
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,200
Everyday.

200
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,966
Anyway, let's stop the drama.

201
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,166
How have you been?

202
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you giving Gav a hard time?

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,666
Of course not!

204
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,133
I actually help him do chores.

205
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:53,633
We do things together here.

206
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,633
That's exactly what I was talking about!

207
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:59,033
You don't know how to do chores.

208
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,700
Excuse me, that's not true!

209
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,500
Well, Gav taught me how.

210
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,833
See?

211
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:12,133
You'd only do chores if
it was Gav asking you.

212
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,866
OK, I'm sorry.

213
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,066
Don't worry, once I am back home,

214
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,033
I'll try to help you with chores.

215
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,266
"Try"?

216
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:26,533
Well, I don't want to promise anything.

217
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,933
I miss you, Ma.

218
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:34,200
I miss you, too.

219
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,566
Anyway, it's already late.
Let's get back to sleep.

220
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,033
Don't play games anymore, OK?

221
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,866
I won't, I promise.

222
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:42,533
All right.

223
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,333
Good night, Ma.

224
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,833
Bye. I love you.

225
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,966
Hey, Cai. How are you?

226
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,766
I'm good.

227
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:06,400
Good. Our offer still stands if ever
you change your mind.

228
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,700
You're still welcome in Team Cityscape.

229
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,900
Thank you.

230
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:13,866
I'm still not sure because I'll be
going back to the province.

231
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,733
Really? We can find a way.

232
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,400
Just let me know if you're still
up for it.

233
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,566
OK.

234
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,166
Hi, baby boy!

235
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,933
Hi, your highness! How are you?

236
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Still pretty, as always!

237
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,300
Where is your baby?

238
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,066
Wait, I'll call him.

239
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:44,133
Baby, our girl is here!
Come over here!

240
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,233
Okay, coming!

241
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,466
Faster!

242
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,900
Hello, your highness!

243
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,833
Wow, too busy to join our call?

244
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,333
I just talked to Aunt Myra.

245
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,500
Drop the call and come over here!

246
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,533
No way!

247
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:05,133
I don't want to stand in the way
of your love-making.

248
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,966
You're too much, Pearl!

249
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:11,333
Look, I understand if
you're doing it every hour!

250
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,466
You haven't seen each other
for a long time

251
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,266
and baby boy will have
to go home soon.

252
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,466
Just remember this:

253
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:20,833
Safety first before you thirst.

254
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,000
You're talking too much, girl!

255
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,100
What's wrong?!

256
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,966
It's just normal to...

257
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:35,466
Wait, don't tell me…

258
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:41,333
Well, I mean, it's OK if
you're not yet ready, right?

259
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,200
Love's not all about sex, anyway.

260
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,700
Of course. And I am always willing to wait.

261
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
How about you? How are you?

262
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,066
You're going to tell us something, right?

263
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,200
Hold on, we're still waiting for
another guest.

264
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Who's that guest?
Are we going to be in trouble again?

265
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,533
Of course not!

266
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,066
He's in the waiting room now.

267
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,400
I'll let him in.

268
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,833
Hi!

269
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,233
Hi, girl!
Hi, Gav!

270
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,900
Who is that baby boy?

271
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,033
Such a cutie!

272
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,200
Yes, he is. He's my baby.

273
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,333
He's Cairo.

274
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,833
Hello!

275
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,266
Hi!

276
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:19,500
In fairness, you look good together.
Such cuties.

277
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,566
I wish I also have my own guy.

278
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,733
By the way, let me introduce myself.

279
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:28,500
My name is Achilles,
but you can call me Chill,

280
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,733
spelled as C-H-I-L-L,

281
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,400
but pronounced as ‘kill, '

282
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,766
like ‘Kill This Love.'

283
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:35,733
Kidding!

284
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,866
Since when did you call yourself Chill?

285
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,600
Just now! You've got a problem with that?!

286
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
That's a gorgeous name.

287
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,033
I'm already liking your new baby boy, Gav.

288
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,766
He's way better than your ex,

289
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,466
that jerk and manipulative guy.

290
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,566
Kidding!

291
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,733
Girl, why are you so bitter?

292
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,566
Tell us the story! Spill the tea!

293
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:02,466
No, I'm just kidding.
I just got carried away.

294
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,566
So what now, Pearl?

295
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,566
Have you informed them already?

296
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,900
Not yet.

297
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,433
What is this all about?

298
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:13,566
Pearl and I are planning
to work on a project,

299
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:16,800
a raunchy one.

300
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,500
Kidding!

301
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,166
Basically, we plan to donate tablets
to students.

302
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,400
Wow, that's a good project!

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,766
I agree. What can we help you with?

304
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,066
We already have sponsors,

305
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,233
and we just need help
distributing the tablets

306
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,600
to deserving students.

307
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,400
Count me in!
How about you, baby?

308
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:39,333
Game!

309
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:43,300
All right!
We'll just inform you of the details soon.

310
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,266
Game.

311
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,633
Hold on, I'll just take this call.

312
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,833
OK.

313
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,466
Baby boy, what's up with you and Gav?

314
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,800
(The Collab that nobody asked for. Charot!)

315
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,633
Oh, Chill.

316
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
How to know when you're ready?!

317
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
How to make love?!

318
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,700
How to make someone feel pleasure?

319
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,400
Oh, come on.

320
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,033
Pearl?

321
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,833
Yes, baby boy?

322
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,733
How do you know when you're ready?

323
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,400
Ready for what?

324
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,566
You know...

325
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:58,866
Don't feel pressured to have sex
when you're not yet ready.

326
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,066
You'll know when.

327
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,333
Thanks, girl.

328
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,433
But when you're finally ready,
make sure to enjoy it!

329
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,266
Pearl!

330
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,333
Be careful, baby.

331
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,200
Ready?

332
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,266
Hang on.

333
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,066
What's this?
- Hang on.

334
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,533
Make sure that I won't fall or else...

335
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,100
You already did, baby,
and you fell right in my arms!

336
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,566
You're so corny.
- Don't look!

337
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,900
Hang on.

338
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,700
Walk slowly, baby.

339
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,200
OK…

340
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,766
Slowly, baby.

341
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,366
Are you excited, baby?

342
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,233
What's this for?

343
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,600
We're here.

344
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,933
Surprise!

345
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:55,800
Wow!

346
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,566
It looks nice.

347
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,000
Why aren't you surprised, baby?

348
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,566
Because I already saw you working
on that a while ago.

349
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:13,566
We live in the same house, remember?

350
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,333
I was looking for you earlier.

351
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,333
Why didn't you tell me?

352
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,800
I didn't want to ruin your surprise.

353
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:27,133
My baby doesn't want me
to get disappointed.

354
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,833
Of course!

355
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,700
What is this for, anyway?

356
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:38,366
I promised that I'd date you
after the pandemic, right?

357
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,866
But I couldn't wait any longer.

358
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:46,033
And besides, I know that you
won't be here for long,

359
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,033
that's why I wanted our movie date
to be special.

360
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:54,833
I wanted this moment
to be special, baby.

361
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,733
Thank you, baby, for always
making me feel special.

362
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,133
It makes me feel guilty that
I am not as affectionate as you.

363
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:12,666
Baby,

364
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,466
you're special to me.

365
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,300
OK?

366
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
In your short stay here,

367
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,800
you made me feel special too.

368
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,733
Of course, because I love you.

369
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,400
My baby is crushing on me.

370
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,900
Stop it! You're annoying!

371
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,000
How much did you spend for all these?

372
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:37,766
Not much.

373
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:40,433
I bought that popcorn a month ago.

374
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,766
All right. What are we going to watch?

375
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:44,700
Choose what you want, baby.

376
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,266
Perhaps a horror movie

377
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,100
so you could hug me
when you get scared?

378
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,066
You're being silly again!

379
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,833
Let's just watch a rom-com.

380
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,866
So you could fall deeply
for me, baby?

381
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,266
OK, how about a family movie?

382
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,433
So you could start a family with me?

383
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,566
Fine! Let's just watch a series
or animé!

384
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:03,266
It's up to you, baby.

385
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,900
What's wrong with you!

386
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,566
Hold on.

387
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,366
Hold on, baby.

388
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,633
Pick a movie first.
I'll just take this call.

389
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,733
Sure, go ahead.

390
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,100
If I could have a superpower,
I want to have the power to disappear.

391
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:36,000
The worst thing about this pandemic is that it traps
us in the very situation we tried so hard to avoid.

392
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,800
Does he have a problem?

393
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Thinking what would be my next step.

394
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,833
What is he up to this time?

395
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,866
Baby…

396
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,133
Baby…

397
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,500
Baby! Let's focus on the movie.

398
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,200
I can multitask, baby.

399
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,800
We're outside, someone might see us.

400
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,700
Let's give them a show.

401
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,566
Baby…

402
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:56,166
Someone's at the door.
- What?

403
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,566
Don't mind it.

404
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:01,466
I'm serious, baby.
The doorbell is ringing!

405
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,166
I didn't hear anything.

406
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,466
Baby, let me check it first.

407
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,866
Maybe that's just Pearl.
- Hang on, OK?

408
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:08,333
That girl is so annoying!

409
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,866
Baby!

410
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Just a second!

411
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,800
Pearl, is that you?

412
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:19,866
Baby!

413
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:22,133
Don't open it yet.

414
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,500
Wait for me.

415
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,000
Baby!

416
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,300
What are you doing here?

417
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:32,600
Terrence...

418
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,500
Hi, love birds.

419
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
(Not_Cairo)

420
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
(Cainonymous)

421
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
(Post)

422
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,766
3 days left before I fly to Bukidnon.

423
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm missing you already, baby.

424
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:44,033
Roses are red, violets are blue,

425
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:47,400
Terrence Carreon is an annoying dude.

426
00:28:50,866 --> 00:28:51,866
(Next On Gameboys2)
Good morning!

427
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:52,800
Hey, baby!

428
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,733
Why?

429
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,266
Come and help me out, baby.

430
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,766
Go ahead and eat.
Don't be shy.

431
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,133
I came out to my dad,

432
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:04,566
and he wasn't going to take it well.

433
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,466
So as expected,

434
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,233
he kicked me out of the house.

435
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:10,800
It makes me feel grateful

436
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,566
for what we have now.

437
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:14,466
And now I can really say

438
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,100
that I'm unafraid,

439
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:17,900
and I'm proud of who I am.

440
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm also proud of you, baby.

441
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:25,500
What?

442
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,600
Are you just going to stare at it?

443
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:30,333
Can't I just appreciate my property?
