1
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,435
Baby.

2
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:23,022
Baby.

3
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,109
Come on, let's treat your wound.

4
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,610
I know it's painful.

5
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:35,576
Please? I also brought you dinner.
You should eat first.

6
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,455
Baby...

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,253
I don't understand what happened.

8
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,591
But if you want space,
then I'll give it to you.

9
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:53,719
But let's treat your wound first, baby.

10
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,349
Talk to me when you're ready, OK?

11
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,394
OK, baby?

12
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:11,070
Your dinner and first aid kit
are just here by the door.

13
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,868
I love you...

14
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:21,622
I love you, baby.

(Episode 4 A Welcome Surprise)

17
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:14,883
Terrence...

18
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:16,426
Oh, shit!

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,513
Wow!

20
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,765
I did not expect that.

21
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,101
But that's a welcome surprise.

22
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,185
Stop it!

23
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:26,562
So, can we talk already?

24
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,647
You were avoiding me a while ago.

25
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:31,441
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,696
You don't have to wear clothes if you want.

27
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:37,906
And you're wondering
why I don't talk to you?

28
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,037
OK, point taken.

29
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,623
But please, talk to me already.

30
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,458
Then answer my question.

31
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,043
It's obvious.

32
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,962
I'm here because I wanted to see you.

33
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,630
We know that's bullshit!

34
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,885
I know you've been planning to do this.

35
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,512
You live too far to be
here unexpectedly.

36
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:02,598
Well, that's true.

37
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,642
I really planned to go to Manila
even before we talked.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,771
But going here wasn't part of my plan.

39
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,524
I really wanted to see you.

40
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,734
OK.

41
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,154
OK?

42
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,448
That's all you can say?

43
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,408
Then what do you want me to say?

44
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,163
I don't know. Maybe, a little appreciation, I guess?

45
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:29,416
You did it for yourself and not for me.
Why should I thank you?

46
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,419
And for all we know,
you only went here to see Cairo.

47
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:33,754
What?

48
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,216
I mean, yes, I wanted to see Cairo,

49
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:40,177
but, clearly, you're implying something.

50
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:42,721
I don't know.

51
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,514
You may be planning something bad.

52
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:49,102
Well, I could've asked you the same thing.

53
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,104
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,106
You're still not over Gav, are you?

55
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,568
You don't know what I had gone through

56
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,362
before I got here.

57
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,532
And please, it's so tiring to talk to you.

58
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:07,579
Tiring? What are you talking about?
We've only been talking for a minute.

59
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:09,039
Go away!

60
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:17,214
Yet, it seems like
you still want to be by my side.

61
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,676
We're both only guests here.

62
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:24,054
I would've stayed in
the couch had it been unoccupied.

63
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,556
What? Wait. Why? What happened?

64
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,849
Didn't you hear them?

65
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,061
Hear what? I was asleep.

66
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,437
Nothing! Then just go back to sleep.

67
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,358
Tell me! Come on, just tell me.

68
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,859
Go to sleep!

69
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:38,860
You're so annoying!

70
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:58,338
Maybe, I shouldn't have exploded like that.

71
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:04,136
Cai, I'm sorry again if I'm taking too much space here.
I really don't know where else to go.

72
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,594
Baby, let's replace your pillow with this.

73
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:50,349
This is softer.

74
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,727
Baby...

75
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,399
Are you still mad at me?

76
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:07,240
Not anymore, baby.

77
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,078
How about your wound?

78
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,292
It's just a minor burn.

79
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,047
I already put ointment on it.

80
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:23,924
Good to know.

81
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:31,807
Baby, do you want to talk about it?

82
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,813
I just want to rest.

83
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,066
Let's go inside the room.

84
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:44,569
No need. Let's just stay here.

85
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,695
Are you sure?

86
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:49,157
You might fall on the floor.

87
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,077
But you won't allow me to fall, right?

88
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:54,913
Of course.

89
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:56,957
My muscles will protect you.

90
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,301
Stay here.

91
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,481
Baby...

92
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,941
Yes?

93
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,652
I love you.

94
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:29,990
I love you, too.

95
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,975
What a sweet couple!

96
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:00,353
But you look like fools!

97
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,482
Why stay here when you
have a big bed in your room?

98
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,734
Pearl?

99
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:11,031
You're not dreaming!
There is indeed a goddess in front of you.

100
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,576
Baby...

101
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,662
Baby, wake up

102
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:22,459
Baby, Pearl is here. Baby,
your arm is heavy!

103
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:26,505
Good morning, baby.

104
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:31,510
Wow!

105
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,595
It's the disrespect for me.

106
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,181
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,392
Nothing, I just want to watch you both sleep.

108
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,562
What do you need, girl?

109
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:49,486
You flirty boys!
The audacity to do it in front of me!

110
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,738
You don't want to get up?

111
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:56,243
- Stop it, Pearl! Hurt me, but not my baby!
- Ouch!

112
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:57,994
Still lying down?

113
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,121
We're getting up!

114
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,499
I wish you'll both get stiff necks.

115
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,125
We're getting up! Ouch!

116
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,293
Stop it, Pearl!

117
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:06,336
Baby, let's go.

118
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,630
Come on! I bought breakfast.

119
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,424
You should've told us right away!

120
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,135
Good morning, baby!

121
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:15,345
Good morning!

122
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,388
Where's my kiss?

123
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:27,232
I've been texting you both but I didn't get a reply.
Thought you were inside the room!

124
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:30,068
I'm sorry, Pearl. What's with the visit?

125
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,946
Nothing. I just missed both of you.

126
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,242
Wait, what happened to your hand?
Are you OK?

127
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:40,620
Yes, nothing serious.

128
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:41,997
Are you sure?

129
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:43,665
Yes, Pearl. I'm sure.

130
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,208
OK.

131
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:50,005
What's up with your bitterness?
Is that what you eat for breakfast?

132
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:55,343
And what if I'm bitter? Remember,
bitter melon is still good for the heart.

133
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,846
I like that! You can use it
for your next vlog!

134
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,432
Absolutely! It's your girl,

135
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,891
- Pearl!
- Pearl!

136
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,853
Come on now, let's eat.
I have lots of stories to tell you.

137
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,396
Have you subscribed to her channel, baby?

138
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,901
- Oh my God!
- Pearl!

139
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,946
What is the meaning of this?

140
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:21,286
Gays of the new millennium!
Don't tell me you've already reconciled?

141
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,126
Sort of.

142
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,298
That's good to know.

143
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:36,593
At least my Zoom intervention
led to something fruitful/

144
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,429
But what is Terrence doing here?

145
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,769
He's just staying here temporarily.

146
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,646
And it's OK with you, Cai?

147
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,234
Of course. I don't see any problem with it.

148
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:57,781
Love and peace.
I love that for you, babes.

149
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,576
Hey, Terrence! You didn't even wake me up!

150
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,995
Oh my God! What is happening?

151
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,206
Is that Wesley?

152
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,209
One and only.

153
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,794
It's nice to finally meet you, Pearl!

154
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,172
Well, same!

155
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:20,178
But you really are gays of the new millennium!
You didn't even invite me to sleepover!

156
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,472
I have a lot of new pajamas!

157
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,727
No, Pearl. Wesley didn't plan to be here.
He's just staying in...

158
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:29,354
for only a few days.

159
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,524
Are you OK with it, babe?

160
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,901
Do I even have a choice?

161
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,529
Baby...

162
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,989
Joke! Just joking! Half joke!

163
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,037
Well done!

164
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:51,584
Well done, Mother Superior! You didn't tell me
that you are now running an orphanage here.

165
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,086
Just for a few days.

166
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:57,424
But in times of crisis, us, your own friends,
are more than willing to help you.

167
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,467
Grab a plate and let's start eating.

168
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,345
But, can I just say this...

169
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,182
You really look better in person, Pearl.

170
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,893
You know what...

171
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,770
I get that a lot.

172
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,605
Kidding!

173
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,608
Because of that, you'll get an extra hotdog.
Here you go!

174
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:18,570
Wow! Not just pretty, but kind as well.

175
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:23,867
Stop it! I don't have extra hotdogs anymore.
But I'll take that as a compliment.

176
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,245
Come on, let's eat!

177
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,705
I'll also get some hotdogs.

178
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,629
Do you want my hotdog, baby?

179
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,926
Tell me if it hurts, OK?

180
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,386
It won't hurt.

181
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:45,305
Be careful.

182
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:47,640
Ouch!

183
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:48,975
- Sorry!
- Now it hurts.

184
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,894
I told you so. I'm sorry.

185
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,357
I'll blow on it to ease the pain.

186
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,080
You're liking this, aren't you?

187
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,211
Baby... Thank you.

188
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,338
No biggie.

189
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,506
No, baby.

190
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,635
Thank you because you
always put up with me.

191
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,847
I'm always grumpy and emotional.

192
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,475
Yet, you always try to put up with me.

193
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:34,145
Baby, I'm not putting up with you, OK?

194
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,647
I understand you.

195
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:41,277
I, too, have my moments,

196
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,030
but maybe it's because we're still young.

197
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,241
But, do you know the good thing behind it?

198
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,701
What?
We can grow together.

199
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,040
You have such long patience.

200
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,378
Do you know what else is long, baby?

201
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,089
It doesn't seem like it.

202
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,050
Do you want proof?

203
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,677
Hey! There you go again!

204
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,597
I'm seriously explaining
but you're answering me with jokes.

205
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:10,598
Because I feel challenged.

206
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:14,310
Baby! Focus, please.
I want to apologize to you properly.

207
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:15,728
That was already OK with me, baby.

208
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,647
Baby.

209
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,773
It's not OK.

210
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:27,490
I know I shouldn't have acted that way.

211
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,661
I should've told you the truth.

212
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,165
What I really felt.

213
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,334
I should have shared it with you.

214
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,503
I'm really sorry, baby.

215
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:48,803
I also missed the fact that
you were already feeling out of place.

216
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,347
Not really.

217
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,519
OK, kind of...

218
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:58,187
I don't know.

219
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,483
Obviously, I don't like doing household chores.

220
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,237
I don't even like working out.

221
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,868
But, I enjoy it whenever we do things together.

222
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,831
I like it when you introduce yourself to me more,

223
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,502
because we only started online.

224
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,342
So, I feel glad whenever
I discover something new about you.

225
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,263
I'm sorry, too, baby.

226
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,476
I didn't know that you find
value in those things.

227
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,520
You know me,

228
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:45,693
I like being of service to you.

229
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,780
Cooking for you.

230
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,658
Making you laugh.

231
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:54,619
I'm happy when I make you happy.

232
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,010
I'm happy because you're my boyfriend.

233
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,890
Soon to be husband.

234
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,936
Ask permission from Mama first!

235
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,773
Well, we can call her now.

236
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,655
Baby...

237
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,187
What the hell?!

238
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:04,689
Why?

239
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,482
There's so much space around!
Stop getting near me!

240
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,404
Because I want to be close to you,
isn't it obvious?

241
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,365
And isn't it obvious? I don't want
to do anything with you.

242
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:19,120
Come on, I'm making an effort here.

243
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:20,830
That is what you're good at.

244
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,834
Why does it sound like a bad thing?

245
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:28,129
Do you think what you did
was a good thing?

246
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,925
Let me make it up to you.

247
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:35,303
I can't stand us being like this.

248
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,182
I don't hear an apology.

249
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:45,271
You want me to apologize
for being honest?

250
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:48,066
No! For leading me on!

251
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,942
You flirted with me like you really cared.

252
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,361
But when I entertained you,
you told me you weren't ready yet?

253
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,530
And then you just disappeared.

254
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:58,367
Now you'd show up like
nothing happened?

255
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,289
OK, I'm sorry, I messed up.

256
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,582
You led me on!

257
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,877
Can we just forget about it
and be real friends this time?

258
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,337
I can't believe you.

259
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,384
This is me saying sorry.
I really want us to be OK.

260
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:17,053
You're so stupid for a genius.

261
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,431
You look so sexy when you're mad.

262
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:22,475
I'm not playing this
game with you again.

263
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:24,560
Calm down, Mr. Boredom.

264
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,895
What do you want?

265
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,277
What are you doing?

266
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:34,695
Is this what you want?

267
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,615
What?

268
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,372
Is this what you want?

269
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:54,715
Baby.

270
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,384
What? Things are heating up!

271
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:57,426
Silly!

272
00:18:57,635 --> 00:18:58,636
Let's watch them!

273
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:00,304
Come on.

274
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:01,222
What?

275
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:04,976
It's Achilles.

276
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:06,477
Go ahead. Answer it.

277
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,820
Hi, baby boys!

278
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,113
Hi, Achilles!

279
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,197
What's up?

280
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:20,116
Nothing much.
Is it a good time to call?

281
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,701
Sure.

282
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:24,412
We're just avoiding something.

283
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:27,582
What is it? Tell me!

284
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,250
Baby!

285
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:32,086
What?

286
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:34,046
You might overshare.

287
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:38,301
Come on, spill the tea!
I'll listen. What is it?

288
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,928
No, I mean, you're like Pearl, so nosy.

289
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:45,641
Nosy? Maybe the right term is
'well-informed'.

290
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,644
It's hard to fall for fake news
nowadays! Kidding!

291
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,272
Don't worry,
you'll know about it soon enough.

292
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,190
All right.

293
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:57,236
So, Cai, Gav, are you available to join
our event?

294
00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:01,574
Pearl told me that
you do video coverage, Cai.

295
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,326
Is it OK if I assign you that task?

296
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:04,911
Yes, of course.

297
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,164
Thank you! You, too, Gav!

298
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:11,959
Join us, OK? Pearl and I need more help.

299
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,923
Sure, even if my task is to
just babysit my baby.

300
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,676
Seriously?!

301
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:23,262
Right in front of my salad!?

302
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,555
Sorry.

303
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,349
Why are you laughing?

304
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:27,892
You've seen the video, too?

305
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:29,769
I knew it!

306
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:31,729
It's just a meme, right?

307
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:35,566
Please, it's fine,
there's nothing wrong if you've seen it.

308
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,610
Anyway, I should hang up.

309
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,946
You guys are making me envious.

310
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:42,156
Go already. Bye. I also need to eat.

311
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:43,950
- Bye, Achilles!
- Bye!

312
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:44,951
See you!

313
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,369
Bye!

314
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:47,411
See you!

315
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:52,875
I'll give you one star.

316
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,294
Reason? Happy couple!

317
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:57,004
Not that I'm bitter.

318
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:58,172
It's just self-care.

319
00:20:58,381 --> 00:20:59,006
Kidding!

320
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:07,473
I'm seen-zoned again.

321
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,183
Is this is my destiny?

322
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,727
I thought you were going to call?

323
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:14,855
The sun is already up.
Did you forget about me? Kidding!

324
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,776
Oh. Sorry. I was in another call.

325
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:21,696
With whom? Your new boyfriend? Hehe.

326
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:23,906
Achi... Sorry.

327
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:28,953
Looks like everyone has already moved on.
I need to move on as well

328
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,122
And this is how I move on.

329
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:54,603
So, what happened a while ago?

330
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:59,692
I knew you'd asked about it.

331
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,614
You should've seen the look on your faces.
You looked like lovers.

332
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,742
No, we're not.

333
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,204
So what was that? Just catching up?

334
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,541
Nope. We were actually fighting.

335
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:21,630
Wow! That's how intense you two fight?

336
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:26,135
I know what it looks like, but it's really not.
After he led me on?

337
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:31,390
Oh, so something happened? When? How?

338
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:42,943
Doesn't matter. The bottom line is, he flirted with me
when he wasn't even interested in me.

339
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:50,993
I don't even know why that guy is here.
Did Cai tell you why?

340
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:01,962
Hang on, I'm coming!

341
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:07,510
Aunt Susan...

342
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,887
Who else would it be?

343
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,308
No need!

344
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:17,228
You know we're in a pandemic,
we need to observe social distancing.

345
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:20,022
Baby, is that the item I ordered?

346
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,151
Who is he?

347
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,531
Why are you letting strangers
inside the house?

348
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:32,410
He's Cairo.

349
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:34,203
Hello.

350
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:38,290
He's my friend.

351
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
(Not_Cairo)

352
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100

353
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
(Post)

354
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:43,230
Oh yes! I'm your friend. I'm just your friend!

355
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:46,901
- St. Jolina Magdangal,
Patron Saint of the friendzoned.

356
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:55,201
There's a lot to know more about Gav.

357
00:24:55,367 --> 00:25:00,706
Even in relationships. Good thing
I still have a few weeks with my baby.

00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,506
You were flirting with Pearl the other day.

360
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:12,384
Maybe that's why Gav was furious
because you also tried to flirt with Cai.

361
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,971
Wow, I've built such a bad reputation.

362
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,557
You know what, baby, I've realized...

363
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:22,520
we don't really need to
come out to everyone we meet.

364
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:30,986
Maybe we should only come out to the people
who matter most in our lives.
