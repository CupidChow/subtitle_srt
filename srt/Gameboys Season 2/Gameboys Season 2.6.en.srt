1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:04,128
I respect those who respect me.

2
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,630
I tried to respect you

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,591
because you're older than me,
and you're Gav's aunt.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,302
But I've had enough of your insults.

5
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:16,807
I only care about Gavreel's welfare!
Is there something wrong with that?

6
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,226
Gav...

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:25,315
If you don't want to be lectured,
then fix yourselves!

8
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,650
We're doing just fine.

9
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,944
I'm not sure about you.

10
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:33,782
How dare you answer back!
You're so rude!

11
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:35,951
What now, Gav?

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,039
Are you just going to let your
friend disrespect me?

13
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,957
He is not my friend!

14
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:42,958
Good for you!

15
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:03,145
He is my boyfriend.

16
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,774
What did you say?

17
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,400
I said...

18
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,611
He is my boyfriend!

19
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:12,529
What?!

20
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,827
You don't know what
you're talking about, Gav.

21
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:22,039
You're the one who is
clueless about me, about us!

22
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:25,876
Grandma Cora raised me well,
that's why I always respect you.

23
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:29,171
I had to put up with your insults
even though it hurts.

24
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,592
But I won't let you
do the same to my baby.

25
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,552
Did you just call him baby?

26
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,970
Yes, I did! He's my baby!

27
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:43,143
You don't know what
you're talking about, Gavreel.

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,439
Aren't you afraid of God?

29
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:52,736
Please don't use God's name
to perpetuate your hate.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,321
You will regret this,

31
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,033
that you refused to listen to me.

32
00:01:58,617 --> 00:01:59,827
Now answer me,

33
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:03,539
what's really the point
of your relationship?

34
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:06,416
You're just playing house!

35
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:12,089
You both know that
your relationship is going nowhere.

36
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:17,344
Because you cannot get married!

37
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,806
But what about your husband, Uncle Rody?
He slept with another woman, right?

38
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,851
Your son Enzo knocked up a girl
and abandoned her.

39
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,769
Did you hear anything from me?
Nothing!

40
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,771
- I never said a word!
- Gavreel!

41
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,691
Don't you dare drag them into this.

42
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,902
You don't know what my family
went through!

43
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:40,242
Why are you fighting for him?
What's the point?

44
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:43,453
Aren't you going to America soon?

45
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,997
To be with your Aunt Myra, right?

46
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:48,250
You're leaving, baby?

47
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,044
Why didn't you tell me?

48
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,756
It's not for you to decide!

49
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:00,679
You're so selfish.

50
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:06,268
Your Aunt Myra is sick, Gavreel.

51
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,897
Her husband left her alone.

52
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:14,443
Can't you understand
how miserable she is?

53
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:19,781
Aunt Myra is sick?

54
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,746
She doesn't want you to know.

55
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:33,212
But I had to say it,
aafter what I heard from you.

56
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:35,964
Gavreel,

57
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:41,386
she has stage 3 cancer.

58
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:53,148
Think about what's important to you.

59
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:02,449
Baby...

60
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,410
Baby...

61
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,039
Baby...

62
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:11,959
Baby...

63
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,043
Baby...

64
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:16,004
Baby.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,500
(Gameboys 2)

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,000
(Episode 6 Bad News)

67
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,118
Baby.

68
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:33,874
Baby.

69
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,460
Here's your coffee.

70
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,960
Free at last.

71
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:13,807
Good morning.

72
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,235
What a beautiful day.

73
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:27,863
That's really random.

74
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:29,865
No, it's not.

75
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,701
It's a beautiful day because

76
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,953
I'm with you,

77
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,539
and finally, Aunt Susan is gone!

78
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:39,916
But mostly because I'm with you.

79
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,170
Do you think that's a compliment?

80
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:48,717
Well, I just know that
this day will be great.

81
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,599
So...

82
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,727
So...

83
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:03,940
This coffee tastes good.

84
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,110
This coffee tastes good.

85
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,863
Why are you copying me?

86
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,284
Because you don't say what you
really want to say.

87
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,955
Why? What do I want to say?

88
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,712
Fine!

89
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,507
I'll say it for both of us.

90
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:32,010
We're mutually attracted to each other.

91
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,431
And you want to find out the next step.

92
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,811
OK, fine!

93
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,439
That's all I have to say.

94
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:46,858
How about you?
What do you want to say?

95
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,031
You know what,
you're such a tease!

96
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:09,798
Speak your heart out

97
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,426
and what it truly desires

98
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:19,349
Because if you won't,

99
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:24,312
you might miss your chance on me

100
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,275
Hi! Good morning!

101
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,276
Hi!

102
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:16,781
Oh! What do we have here?

103
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,162
Speaking of beautiful...

104
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,249
Oh, you're talking about me?

105
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,667
Who else would it be?

106
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,252
Don't mention it!

107
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,421
Thank you, I appreciate your compliment,

108
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,508
but I'll appreciate you more
if you'll help me carry my stuff.

109
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,344
- OK.
- Sure.

110
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,471
So where are my babes?

111
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,931
They're inside.

112
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,228
Let's do this.

113
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,230
What's that, baby?

114
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,023
Shhh...

115
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:52,359
- What did you cook?
- Just wait and see.

116
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,653
- Let me see.
- Alright.

117
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,322
Are you ready, baby?

118
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:57,906
Go!

119
00:10:58,907 --> 00:10:59,908
It's hot!

120
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:10,627
Sautéed hotdog in ketchup
sauce with pineapple tidbits.

121
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,046
In short, Gav's hotdog.

122
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:15,882
What's that?

123
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:17,801
It's Gav's hotdog.

124
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,638
Do you want to taste Gav's hotdog?

125
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:22,889
I heard you the first time.

126
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,226
I was curious about what
you were cooking ealier.

127
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,812
Now, I'm not even
sure if I can eat that.

128
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,563
But why, baby?

129
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:33,316
Gav's hotdog
is delicious, I promise.

130
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:34,901
Do we still have cereal?

131
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:35,985
What's wrong, baby?

132
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,363
I'll just have powdered chocolate
and rice for breakfast.

133
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:40,532
What? That's weird, baby!

134
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,700
Ouch! That hurts!

135
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:46,371
And powdered chocolate on
top of rice isn't weird. It's delicious!

136
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,790
Baby...

137
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,918
Once you taste Gav's hotdog,

138
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,672
you'll forget your name. Promise.

139
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,842
Good morning, babes!

140
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,926
Good morning, your highness!

141
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,302
Pearl, good morning!

142
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:01,928
Hi!

143
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,096
Let's go.

144
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,765
Is that Gav's hotdog?

145
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,267
- It is!
- Gav's hotdog!?

146
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:09,644
Yes! That's Gav's
special recipe, right?

147
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,855
Come on, try it!

148
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,735
So have you tasted Gav's hotdog?

149
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,653
Of course! And it tastes good!

150
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,780
- Solid!
- I told you so, baby.

151
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,157
Whatever.

152
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,951
Did you run away
from your house, Pearl?

153
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,206
Nope. We need to prepare
for our fundraising event.

154
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:33,501
It was supposed to be at my house,
but Dad didn't want many people at home.

155
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:36,129
So he said he'll just
pay for our swab tests.

156
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,798
Is it OK if I join?

157
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:41,760
Of course! Just prepare a dance number.

158
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:48,808
Or actually, I may just put you in auction,
at least it's for a good cause!

159
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:53,354
Guys, you might want
to taste my hotdog.

160
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:54,689
Game!

161
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:56,316
Me first!

162
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:57,692
- Let my baby go first.
- OK.

163
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:01,196
Be careful, baby!

164
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,106
Ouch!

165
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,654
We have muscles,
but we still lack creativity.

166
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,032
I think we need help.

167
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,243
Your balloons are so expensive.

168
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,745
The seller should have
inflated these already.

169
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:16,414
They're eco-friendly, so that will do.

170
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,125
Girl.

171
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,545
Girl, SOS!!!

172
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:26,007
What's up? Seems like you
want to tell me something.

173
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,514
I'm worried about Gav.

174
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,018
Look at him, he looks so happy.

175
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:41,272
How much more if he's sad?!
You might have a heart attack.

176
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,108
Girl, I'm serious.

177
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,235
Oh, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,154
OK, tell me what happened.

179
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:55,328
Aunt Susan visited us.

180
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,332
I get it! I don't like her, too!

181
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,876
She's bad news!

182
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,127
Yes! Super bad news!

183
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,964
But do you know that
Gav is leaving for the States?

184
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:10,176
Will he push through with it?
Last I heard, he didn't want to.

185
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:14,305
So it's been his plan all along?

186
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:20,812
Yes, ever since his grandma died,

187
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:24,399
his Aunt Myra has always wanted
to fly him to New York.

188
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:27,276
I heard about Aunt Myra.

189
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:30,279
But he never told me
he's leaving.

190
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,782
That's because he doesn't want to.

191
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:36,494
Aunt Myra has been convincing Gav

192
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:38,538
because she feels responsible for him.

193
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,164
She never got the chance to return here.

194
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,751
But before the pandemic,

195
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,920
Gav already prepared everything.

196
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:51,009
He only needed a plane ticket and
he was good to go.

197
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:54,721
But the pandemic happened?

198
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:58,933
No.

199
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,269
You happened.

200
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,967
But that's not the bad news.

201
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,055
Aunt Susan told us that

202
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,848
Aunt Myra is sick.

203
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,268
Oh my God!

204
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:48,441
That's not how he copes.
He hides it when he's stressed.

205
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:51,152
Just like when his grandma died.

206
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,321
That's why I'm worried!

207
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,075
How about you?

208
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,204
How do you feel about
the whole situation?

209
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:41,160
Hi! It's your girl, Pearl!

210
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,246
Welcome to my VG live!

211
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:47,125
As you can see, this is the mini stage
for our fundraising event

212
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,669
for the benefit of our online learners.

213
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:50,711
Awesome, right?!

214
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,965
So guys, open your purse.
You'll be entertained,

215
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,550
and you can help as well!

216
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:58,177
Are you ready to hear me sing?

217
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,303
No!

218
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,931
Really? I already have bashers?

219
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,308
You're giving me vertigo! Stop it!

220
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,476
- Hello!
- Hello!

221
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:07,770
It's not your turn yet!
Wait for me to call you!

222
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,439
This is a VG live.
This isn't a talent show!

223
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,774
We're just excited.

224
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:12,859
It isn't obvious!

225
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,110
Sorry, Pearl.

226
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,194
Apology accepted!

227
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:16,988
Wait, let's read the comments.

228
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,447
Here, let's read this one:

229
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:22,577
"Wow, CaiReel! Thanks, your highness!"
You're welcome!

230
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:24,495
Of course, it's my responsibility

231
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:28,332
since I'm the president of
CaiReel Nation— Cavite chapter!

232
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,086
Don't worry, we all got
negative swab test results,

233
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:33,629
and we're just at home.

234
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:38,301
Wait, someone is wondering
why you're here.

235
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:39,927
Because this is my house?

236
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,846
Silly!

237
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:45,141
I mean, invite our
viewers to our event.

238
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:48,561
Guys, watch out for our
surprise for all of you!

239
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,438
What surprise are you
talking about, baby?

240
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,522
It's a surprise!

241
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,191
And what's all this commotion about?

242
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,859
Oh my God, Chill!

243
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,277
Calm down, it's just me.

244
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,279
Wait, wait, wait, say hi!

245
00:19:58,487 --> 00:19:59,447
Hello!

246
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,657
Our special guest has arrived!

247
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,828
Actually, we still have a lot of surprises
for you on Saturday, so watch out!

248
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,205
Bye!

249
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,879
What took you so long?
We've been waiting for you!

250
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:18,507
I waited for my swab test result!
Good thing it was negative.

251
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:22,011
Pearl told us that you'll
help us improve our set?

252
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:28,601
I think all of you need
to take another swab test

253
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,895
because you've lost your taste.

254
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:32,688
Kidding!

255
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,733
What you did was OK,

256
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,652
we just need to redo everything.

257
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,613
Just kidding!

258
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,075
What do we need to do?

259
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,660
I'll do whatever you want.

260
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,912
In fairness to you,
you're such a trouper.

261
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,997
I just need to be busy.

262
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,458
Do we have other guests?

263
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,681
Pearl, did you set me up?

264
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:09,475
What set up are you talking about?

265
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,519
What is Terrence doing here?

266
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:12,478
You didn't know?

267
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:14,146
I thought you're friends
on Screentime?

268
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,315
Didn't you see his posts?

269
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:17,608
No, because I blocked him.

270
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:23,072
What? I didn't know, I'm sorry.
You never told me about it.

271
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:25,533
I'm sorry, Pearl, but I have to go.

272
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:26,826
What?

273
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:27,702
Wait...

274
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:29,495
OK, I understand.

275
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,706
Baby, what's happening?

276
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:33,332
I have no idea.

277
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,583
Don't touch me!

278
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,627
Stop it, guys!
You might hurt each other!

279
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:37,336
Can you just talk calmly...

280
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:38,337
I got this!

281
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,548
OK, fine.

282
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:41,841
Achilles, talk to me, please!

283
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:43,259
We don't have anything
to talk about, Terrence.

284
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,636
- Achilles!
- Terrence, I get it, OK?

285
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,681
It's just that I'm not emotionally
prepared for this encounter.

286
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,765
I just want to explain.

287
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:52,101
And what? Make me feel pathetic again?

288
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:03,321
Gavreel!

289
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,075
Just let him be.

290
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:09,702
Let me be?

291
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,038
Calm down, guys!

292
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:13,748
What a way to invalidate
my feelings, Terrence!

293
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,627
Think about what's important to you.

294
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:31,223
- Oh my God, Gav!
- Baby!

295
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:32,433
Baby!

296
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:34,268
Baby!

297
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:35,478
Gav!

298
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:36,771
Baby!

299
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,647
Gav!

300
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,954
Gav.

301
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:57,625
Gav, what's wrong?

302
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,501
Hey, Gav!

303
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,543
Where are you going?

304
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:01,128
Baby!

305
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:03,130
Baby!

306
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:05,091
Hold on, baby!

307
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,177
Where are you going?

308
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,262
Baby!

309
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,600
I don't know!

310
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:16,435
I'll join you!

311
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,815
Baby, please just let me be.

312
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:22,024
No, I won't!

313
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:26,112
Baby...

314
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:27,905
No!

315
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:30,783
You can ignore me all you want,

316
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,702
but I just want to be with you, baby.

317
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:35,079
OK?

318
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:39,333
I won't let you go through your struggles alone.

319
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:42,044
Baby, please?

320
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:48,175
Baby...

321
00:25:58,097 --> 00:26:01,100
"Not all wounds are visible and sometimes

322
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,394
the unseen ones are more agonizing

323
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,854
than the ones that bleed."

324
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:18,867
If I could stop the world from spinning
just to spend more time with you

325
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,452
I would.

326
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,040
Come on now.

327
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,709
(Next On Gameboys 2)
Alright. Let's go.

328
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:34,383
Masc fo masc? So predictable.

329
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,926
Is it wrong to have a preference?

330
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:38,178
You call it preference?
You're judging us!

331
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:39,763
Oh, because you like
a certain type?

332
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:41,098
Because you hate a certain type!

333
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,641
Particularly femmes, right?

334
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,310
Please just let him be.

335
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,061
You let go my hand when...

336
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:48,147
Because I was going to talk to him, OK?
Not because he saw us.

337
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:48,772
Sure?

338
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,524
Why is it like nothing
I do will ever be right?

339
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:51,734
Uhm...

340
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:52,985
I'm busy.

341
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:54,236
I'm sorry.

342
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:00,242
By the way, you forgot to
pay the electricity bill.

343
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:01,910
Baby, I thought you
already paid for it?

344
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:03,412
I forgot. I'll just pay...

345
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,998
OK, I'll pay for the grocery and
half of the electricity bill.

346
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:06,707
No need.

347
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:07,917
It's embarrassing to ask
from your Mom.

348
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,169
Why would it be? It's normal.

349
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:11,237
But baby, we already talked
about this, right?
