1
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,067
Should I unblock this idiot?

2
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:31,405
No! Chill!
Don't be a hopeless romantic.

3
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:41,665
Before you go...

4
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,502
Can I say something?

5
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:49,131
What is it this time, Terrence?

6
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,717
Anybody can fall for you.

7
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:56,847
Maybe the timing wasn't right for us.

8
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:58,932
Whatever!

9
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,268
Do you think you're going to
fool me with a face like that?

10
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:11,945
Girl, SOS!

11
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:15,324
Go ahead, sis!

12
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:21,163
Guys, watch out for our
surprise for all of you!

13
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:22,956
What surprise are
you talking about, baby?

14
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:23,999
It's a surprise!

15
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,501
And what's all this
commotion about?

16
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,419
Oh my god, Chill!

17
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,589
Wait, wait, wait, say hi!

18
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:31,840
Hello!

19
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,259
Our special guest has arrived!

20
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,347
Actually, we still have a lot of surprises
for you on Saturday, so watch out!

21
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,599
Bye!

22
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:46,897
Let's go.

23
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,651
30 more minutes, please?

24
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:52,027
You might fall asleep.

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,780
That's what I want to happen.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,032
Then why did you even volunteer for Pearl?

27
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:00,536
Fine.

28
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,247
Just help me get up.

29
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,289
OK.

30
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,590
Do you want me to carry you?

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,801
Can you?

32
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:16,969
But do you want me to?

33
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:19,555
Come on.

34
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:34,820
Are we really going to do this now?

35
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:36,196
You're hesitating.

36
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:41,952
No, I'm not. I thought we
were just flirting around.

37
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:43,579
We are.

38
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,498
OK then.

39
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,250
But it depends on you.

40
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,627
You're such a tease.

41
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,254
You don't want to kiss me?

42
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,465
I wanna kiss you.

43
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,928
I wanna kiss you and do things
with your body, respectfully.

44
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,099
OK, but...

45
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,268
Let's just kiss for now.

46
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,931
Enough. I might not be
able to control myself.

47
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:48,894
Too bad.

48
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,396
Do you still need my help?

49
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,900
No need. I can manage.

50
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,109
OK.

51
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,494
But...

52
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,621
You may hold my hand.

53
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:16,672
Actually, what you did was OK,

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,715
we just need to redo everything.

55
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,426
Just kidding!

56
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,473
What do we need to do?
I'll do whatever you want.

57
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,809
In fairness to you,
you're such a trouper.

58
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,769
I just need to be busy.

59
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,146
Oh, we still have other.

60
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:47,786
Pearl, did you set me up?

61
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,622
What set up are you talking about?

62
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,582
What is Terrence doing here?

63
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,168
You didn't know? I thought
you're friends on Screentime?

64
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,296
Didn't you see his posts?

65
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,797
No, because I blocked him.

66
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:04,136
What? I didn't know, I'm sorry.
You never told me about it.

67
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:06,471
I'm sorry, Pearl,
but I have to go.

68
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,973
What?

69
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:08,974
Wait!

70
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,392
OK, I understand.

71
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,435
Don't touch me!

72
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:13,645
Stop it, guys!
You might hurt each other!

73
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:14,646
Can you just talk calmly?

74
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:15,522
I got this!

75
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,649
OK, fine.

76
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:18,650
Achilles, talk to me, please!

77
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,235
We don't have anything
to talk about, Terrence.

78
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:21,737
Achilles!

79
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:22,779
Terrence, I get it, OK?!

80
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,866
It's just that I am not emotionally
prepared for this encounter.

81
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:26,742
I just want to explain.

82
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,784
And what?

83
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,077
Make me feel pathetic again?

84
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,579
No, I won't.
Why would you say that?

85
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:31,788
What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:33,874
Hey, what's going on?

87
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:35,083
Wes, I'll just talk to him.

88
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:35,792
Of course.

89
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:37,586
What?

90
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,254
Masc for masc? So predictable.

91
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:41,840
OK, I don't know you.

92
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:42,799
No, you don't.

93
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,510
But what's your
problem with masc?

94
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,178
Wes.

95
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,889
I don't have a problem
with masc or straight acting gays,

96
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,892
but fine, just so you know,
I don't like masc for masc gays.

97
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,061
OK, I get where you're coming from.

98
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,397
I am not saying I am one,
but everyone has a type.

99
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:58,815
Is it wrong to have a preference?

100
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,693
Preference? You call it preference?
You're judging us!

101
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,487
Oh, because you like a certain type?

102
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:06,365
Because you hate a certain type!
Particularly effem, right?

103
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,241
But why are you assuming
that we are masc for masc?

104
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,369
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to Terrence.

105
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,828
Why so sensitive, girl?

106
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,163
Wes, please, just let him be.

107
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:14,289
Let me be?!

108
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:18,543
What a way to invalidate
my feelings, Terrence!

109
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:21,171
I don't want to invalidate your feelings,
I just don't want to fight.

110
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,464
Calm down, guys!

111
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,800
You are offending each other!

112
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,218
Tell them that!

113
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,182
- Oh my god, Gav!
- Baby!

114
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:34,518
Baby!

115
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:36,561
Gav!

116
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,105
Gav!

117
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:38,772
Gav!

118
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,940
- What's wrong?
- Baby!

119
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,108
Where are you going?

120
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,317
- Hey, Gav!
- Pearl...

121
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,800
(Gameboys 2)

122
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,700
(Episode 7 No Matter What)

123
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,670
Girl, are you OK?

124
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,547
I just need some space to breathe.

125
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,717
OK. I'll just get something.
Stay here.

126
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:49,926
- OK.
- OK.

127
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:57,726
Come with me!

128
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,521
Hold on, what's your problem?

129
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,983
Take a seat.

130
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,739
I don't know what's wrong
with you and Terrence,

131
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:14,242
but Terrence and Achilles
used to be friends.

132
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,204
It's obvious that
they have a misunderstanding.

133
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,206
I think we should let them talk first.

134
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,170
OK.

135
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,216
What's a good food to eat?

136
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,510
What?

137
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,929
I got hungry because
of what happened.

138
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:37,140
I didn't expect it.
I thought we'd just be having fun.

139
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,353
It took all my spiritual energy to hold
back and not to meddle.

140
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,813
I think you did the right thing.

141
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,859
What's your zodiac sign?

142
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:49,110
Huh?

143
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:50,862
Huh? Hotdog!

144
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:57,244
My god, I cringe at myself!

145
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,080
You know what, you're cute.

146
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,041
Thanks! Among other things!

147
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,543
So what's your zodiac sign?

148
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:05,961
Virgo.

149
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,508
Oh, that's why.

150
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,428
Why? What does it mean?

151
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,764
Nothing. Do you know how to cook?

152
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,976
On second thought,
let's just order online.

153
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:25,021
OK, sure.

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,565
Let's use your phone.

155
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:31,278
Why do I feel like you're only saying
sorry just to feel good about yourself?

156
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,283
That's unfair. I'm saying sorry
because I want us to be OK.

157
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:39,494
What if I don't want to make peace
with you, would you still apologize?

158
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,997
Yes, I will always apologize to you.

159
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,542
Can you tell me why I'm mad at you?

160
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,752
What do you think?

161
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,838
I'm sorry, I stood you up.

162
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,882
I know what I did was wrong.

163
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,722
"Anybody can fall for you."

164
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,807
"Maybe the timing wasn't right for us."

165
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:03,727
What?

166
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,687
Those were your words, Terrence!

167
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,439
You know, I was ready to move on.

168
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:09,316
I was ready to become your friend again.

169
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,192
But why did you have
to say those words?

170
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:16,281
I was stupid to believe what you said.

171
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,282
But I meant it.

172
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,868
You were just bored
and had no one to talk to

173
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,995
that's why you thought
of flirting with me.

174
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,914
I meant every word
I said that night.

175
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,750
Maybe if'

176
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,336
If you had not met that other guy,

177
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,254
you would have fallen for me?

178
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,551
You know what, Terrence,
I don't want to be your plan B, OK?

179
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,347
Maybe I'd be happier for
you in the future, but for now,

180
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,767
I'll have to think about it.

181
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,312
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,316
OK.

183
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:05,705
Are you OK, sis?

184
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:06,873
Yes, of course!

185
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,083
Are you sure?

186
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:10,335
You want me to drive you home?

187
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,129
No need, girl!
We're professionals here.

188
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,343
I won't be wasting my swab test
nor my time for a guy.

189
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,429
- Truly!
- You know me.

190
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,231
Hey, Chill, have you
seen Gav and Cai?

191
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,150
They're not yet around, that's why
I decided to crash their kitchen.

192
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,445
We're used to you
being a gatecrasher.

193
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,697
Kidding!

194
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,490
You're such a bitch.

195
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,742
Where did they go?

196
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,079
Maybe they went to a quiet place.
We've been too noisy.

197
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:47,872
That's better.

198
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:51,292
If they decide to go back here,
tthey'll be sleeping in the couch.

199
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,586
But aren't we the ones
who are just sleeping over?

200
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,923
Excuse me?
I won't sleep on the couch.

201
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,425
No, no, no!

202
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:01,344
I might catch the remains
of their love-making.

203
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,096
And you won't catch from their bed?

204
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:07,016
We replaced the beddings and
disinfected the room, right?

205
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,768
Oh, that's why.

206
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:09,561
Right.

207
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:19,404
I feel bad for Gav. It was my
first time seeing him like that.

208
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:22,449
Yes, he is going through tough times.

209
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,618
Damn, it's so hard to be
happy. Kidding!

210
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:28,163
Drama queen!
You know what, you're just hungry.

211
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,707
Speaking of hungry, I'll look for food. Wait.

212
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:31,499
Alright.

213
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,174
Looks like they haven't
gone to the grocery yet.

214
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,177
Let's just order online.
That's what I do when I'm hungry.

215
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:46,598
Oh my god!

216
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,183
Flashlight, flashlight!

217
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,855
What, do I look like a ghost?

218
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:58,485
Nope. You're gay and you know it!

219
00:12:58,526 --> 00:12:59,569
You know it, girl!

220
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,988
Go, sis! No, do it this way.

221
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,406
How?

222
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,617
- There you go!
- Fabulous!

223
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:37,649
Baby.

224
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,360
Baby, look!

225
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:42,946
Look at the view.
Wake up, baby.

226
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:44,405
Baby...

227
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,865
What's wrong, baby?

228
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,075
Take a look.

229
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,369

Come on, stop fooling around.

245
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,289
Stop it!

246
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:28,361
Thank you, baby.

247
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:33,783
For what, baby?

248
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,829
You insisted on coming
here with me.

249
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,457
Who taught me to be insistent?

250
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,010
I get so sad at home because
it's so quiet and I'm all alone.

251
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:57,849
Now it's rowdy back there.

252
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:04,022
That's why I ran away because

253
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,941
I want to process
what's happening.

254
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,445
Don't think about it
for now, baby.

255
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:15,533
I'll accept whatever
your decision is.

256
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:16,909
OK?

257
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,455
But we're partners, baby.

258
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,415
I always have to consider
what you feel.

259
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,465
Your Aunt Myra needs you, baby.

260
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:37,847
We don't even know if Aunt Susan
was telling the truth.

261
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:42,185
She just wants to take
over our business.

262
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:47,065
Aunt Myra never told me anything
about her condition.

263
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,989
Maybe you need to talk
to Aunt Myra first.

264
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,326
What do you think?

265
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:04,165
It's best to hear it
straight from her.

266
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,796
Why do I feel like you want
me to leave?

267
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,506
I didn't mean it that way.

268
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,593
I just want to let you know

269
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,096
that I would understand

270
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,973
if you really have to leave.

271
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,019
I'm also leaving, right?

272
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:27,146
I'm going back to our province.

273
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,107
It's not the same, baby.

274
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,943
We already have a plan, right?

275
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:35,196
I'll visit you in your
province every month.

276
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:41,786
You'll just finish college and then
you'll ask for your mom's permission

277
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,248
so you can go back here.

278
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,334
How will that happen if I'm in New York.

279
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:51,045
We can still make a new plan.

280
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:57,135
Easy for you to say.

281
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,512
What?

282
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,514
Of course not, baby.

283
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:10,189
I knew from the start that this
is just temporary.

284
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:15,069
In the morning when I wake up

285
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:17,029
and see your face,

286
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:21,159
it just makes me so happy.

287
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:26,164
My favorite time of the day is
when we eat together.

288
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:28,958
I don't like sleeping next to someone.

289
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:34,630
But I'll miss your loud snores, for sure.

290
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,842
This isn't easy for me, baby,
I don't want you to have a hard time.

291
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,605
That was so sweet, baby.

292
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,774
I am madly in love with you, baby.

293
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,695
You sure are.

294
00:19:58,821 --> 00:19:59,864
How about you?

295
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:10,625
Let's talk about our plans after
I make a call to Aunt Myra.

296
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,274
Yes!

297
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,236
What are you doing?

298
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:52,917
Tired?

299
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,128
Kind of.

300
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:58,047
Alright, let's take a break first.

301
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,098
Last night...

302
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,015
What?

303
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,728
You let go of my hand...

304
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,771
And?

305
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,526
You let go of my hand
when he saw us...

306
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:19,902
Yeah, Achilles.

307
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:24,865
I let go of your hand because
I was going to talk to him, OK?

308
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:26,826
Not because he saw us.

309
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:28,619
Sure?

310
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,330
What do I feel like
I did something wrong again.

311
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:32,665
I didn't say that.

312
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,250
But you were implying it.

313
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,876
When will I ever be right?

314
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,383
OK, I admit it.

315
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:45,136
I'm sorry if you felt that way,

316
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,805
and I'm sorry because
I was overthinking things.

317
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,975
OK, you made bad decisions before.

318
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:52,893
I mean, we all do it.

319
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,229
But it doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

320
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:58,816
The most important thing is
you tried to patch things up.

321
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,529
Thank you. I needed to hear that today.

322
00:22:06,073 --> 00:22:09,660
So, last night was interesting.

323
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:14,248
It was. I'm sorry for
dragging you into this.

324
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:21,464
No, I'm sorry because I meddled.
But I hope you can still fix things up.

325
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,674
I hope so, too.

326
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,488
Hi...

327
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,076
I'm busy.

328
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:58,667
Don't worry, I'm not here to argue.

329
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,921
I just want to apologize.

330
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:06,592
I'm sorry...

331
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:09,845
For butting in last night.

332
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:13,682
I felt like I made things
worse for you and Terrence.

333
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,065
I'm sorry, too. I said many things
that were uncalled for.

334
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,568
You just got carried
away by your emotions.

335
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,112
I was.

336
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,448
I don't know what's up
with you and Terrence,

337
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:38,707
but I can tell you that he's a great guy.
That's why I was defending him.

338
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:43,504
I know he is. I was just really
hurt by what I saw.

339
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:48,134
He was so depressed when
I last talked to him.

340
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:50,886
But last night, he was so happy.

341
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:56,183
Well, maybe we can relate
to each other.

342
00:23:56,725 --> 00:24:00,062
I ran away from our house because I couldn't stand my parents.

343
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:03,023
Terrence was kicked out of their house after coming out.

344
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:05,734
Oh my god, I'm sorry! Sorry.

345
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:08,779
Don't be. You weren't
aware of it, anyway.

346
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,157
I was just worried about him.

347
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:15,953
But more than anything,
I think we became each other's friend.

348
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,331
For sure, you know him
better than I do.

349
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,751
It wouldn't hurt if
you'll have more friends.

350
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:27,089
You know that I like Terrence
more than a friend, right?

351
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,678
Yes, but I'm not here
to convince you to forgive him

352
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:34,096
or be friends with him again.

353
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:36,265
It's still up to you.

354
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,310
Well, I'm glad that he
has you as a friend,

355
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:43,272
because frankly, I don't know if
I'm the best person to be his friend.

356
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:48,903
I always take the
things that he does personally.

357
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,446
I also always put meaning in them.

358
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:52,907
And that's not how
to be a good friend, right?

359
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,326
I agree, I understand.

360
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:58,829
But thank you for reaching out.
I really appreciate it.

361
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:00,873
Thank you for listening.

362
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:05,544
OK, enough with the drama.
Just help me with these.

363
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:06,837
- OK.
- Just count all of them.

364
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:08,589
Sure, game.

365
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:36,450
Nice parking, baby.

366
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,618
Baby!

367
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:44,875
Wow, my baby is
such a gentleman.

368
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,918
How are you both?

369
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,419
I miss you, Your Highness!

370
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,631
I miss you, too, baby boy.

371
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:53,801
I'm sorry for running away.

372
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:58,389
I didn't worry that much.
I know you're safe with each other.

373
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:03,352
What happened to
the confrontation?

374
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,312
Don't worry about it!

375
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:06,855
I hope they can still patch things up.

376
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:09,817
It's hard to pick sides, to be honest.

377
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:10,442
Let them be.

378
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,653
They are grown-ups,
they know what to do.

379
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,238
Let's take some rest first, baby.

380
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:22,621
By the way, I paid for
the electricity bill first.

381
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,416
I also went to the grocery.

382
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,378
You guys were so busy flirting around,
you forgot to run your errands.

383
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:33,507
Baby, I thought you
already paid for it?

384
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:36,927
I forgot. I'll just pay you later.

385
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:38,178
No rush.

386
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:41,098
OK, I'll pay for the grocery
and half of the electricity bill.

387
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,725
No need.
You're saving up, right?

388
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,604
It's fine, baby. Mom has just
sent me some cash.

389
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,938
It's embarassing to ask from her.

390
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,940
What? That's just normal.

391
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,442
But baby, we already
talked about this, right?

392
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,195
Guys, relax! Don't tell me you'll
fight over this thing?

393
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,155
Nope.

394
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:57,781
We usually talk this way.

395
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,783
OK.

396
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:01,952
I thought I was going
to be a referee again.

397
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:09,501
OK, baby, the electricity bill is already
included in the rental fee of our tenants.

398
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:12,046
Do you want to chip
in for the groceries instead?

399
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,216
OK, sure.

400
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,636
I love you.

401
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:19,845
I love you, too.

402
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:22,765
Let's go and take some rest.

403
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:28,228
Where's my 'I love you'?
I paid for the bills, right?

404
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,065
- I love you, Pearl.
- I love you.

405
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:34,360
Drama queens!
Go ahead and take some rest.

406
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,321
I know you'll still be
doing something else.

407
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:05,808
Baby, I'll be outside.

408
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,643
Just call me if you need me.

409
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,645
This won't take long.

410
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:11,397
I know.

411
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,237
Hi, Gavreel!

412
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:19,446
Hi, Aunt Myra.

413
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:23,867
What's with the face?

414
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,994
Aunt Myra...

415
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,129
That's why I didn't want
to let you know.

416
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,007
Look at you.

417
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:43,554
So handsome and yet,
you can't even smile at me.

418
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:47,141
Why didn't you tell me?

419
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:55,941
Because I don't want you
to worry about me.

420
00:28:57,317 --> 00:29:00,446
I don't want you to go here
just because you feel sorry for me.

421
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:03,073
I don't want to play the pity card.
No way.

422
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,494
I would've wanted...

423
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:11,790
You to decide for yourself
on why you would move here.

424
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,170
I don't really know.

425
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:19,673
I wasn't aware because
I always missed your calls.

426
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,302
I know the reason why.

427
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:35,272
But I'm not asking you to come here
to take care of me.

428
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:41,487
In fact, I want to take care of you
while I still can.

429
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,824
I owe your parents a lot,

430
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:48,494
and I haven't been with you
for a long time,

431
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:50,287
so I want to make it up to you.

432
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,749
You always took care of me.

433
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:57,294
But I can still do more if you'll let me.

434
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:04,426
I hope I'm not asking too much,
sweetie pie.

435
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:06,720
But please...

436
00:30:07,596 --> 00:30:09,515
Can you come and live
with me here

437
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:12,267
in New York?

438
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:05,028
We weren't raised to be cowards.

439
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:07,948
Go for it, baby!

440
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:16,290
Few days left with my baby.

441
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,750
Let's make each day count.

442
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,340
What's wrong?

443
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,969
(Next On Gameboys 2)
It's just that the distance is becoming real now.

444
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:32,306
What did I tell you
about long distance relationships?

445
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:35,309
Baby.

446
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:38,103
Baby, in 10 years,
where do you think we'd be?

447
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,608
I'm sure you'd be an
international pro-gamer by then.

448
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:44,359
Our five children would be so lucky.

449
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,319
Five?!

450
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:51,742
I'm sorry, sis.

451
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:52,826
Why?

452
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:56,288
I might be the reason why
Terrence met Wesley.

453
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,205
Seriously, girl?

454
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,166
How could you do that to me?!

455
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:02,336
Why don't you want to leave?

456
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:04,046
You already know why
I don't want to leave!

457
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:05,923
- Baby, I'm going home to the province.
- Because I want to be with you.

458
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:07,132
I don't want to leave you.
