00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:05,504
Stop it, Gav!

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,382
Cairo, why haven't you gotten up yet?

3
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,469
Hi, Ma. Good morning.

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:15,597
Are you giving my son-in-law
a hard time?

5
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,267
“Son-in-law”?

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:21,520
I was about to get up when you called.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,356
Really? I don't believe you.

8
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,191
Ma, why did you call?

9
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,653
I need to tell you something.

10
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,157
What is it?

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,826
Did you get swabbed already?

12
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,748
Not yet.

13
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:43,625
I'm still looking for a cheaper option.

14
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,085
That's good to know.

15
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,337
I might be able to do it tomorrow...

16
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,884
Wait, what's this all about?

17
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,928
Good thing you haven't yet.

18
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:57,931
You don't need to.
It's expensive.

19
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,558
What do you mean?

20
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:06,732
Your Aunt Leni needs to be with
your Uncle Jessie in Baguio.

21
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:09,109
They might stay there for a while.

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,195
So what now?

23
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:17,868
I just want to tell you that you
can stay there longer

24
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,828
until your Aunt Leni comes back.

25
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:23,499
Please deal with our real estate broker.

26
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,501
I thought there was something wrong.

27
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,879
I was already excited to go back home!

28
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,006
I'm already missing you!

29
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,967
Stop pretending.

30
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:37,304
I know you want to stay there longer.

31
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,682
Yes, Ma, I really do.

32
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:45,104
I get to spend more time with Gav.

33
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,107
We get to know each other more.

34
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:53,862
That's why I want to make the most
of this chance.

35
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,489
Thank you, Ma.

36
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,907
All right.

37
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:59,785
Just do what I told you to do.

38
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,246
Sure, Ma. Don't worry about it.

39
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:05,374
I'm going to hang up now.
Let's talk again soon.

40
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:06,959
Bye, Ma. I love you!

41
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,128
I love you, too.

42
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:11,755
Baby!

43
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:13,298
Five...

44
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,634
Just a few more reps.

45
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,970
- Seven...
- Seven!

46
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,400
Baby!

47
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:15,319
Get up!

48
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,196
Baby!

49
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,031
Come join us!

50
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,116
We weren't able to work out last night.

51
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:22,826
I don't want to!

52
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:23,911
Just go on with it.

53
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,330
Hi, Cai. Good morning.

54
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:27,456
Good morning.

55
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,082
Why are you working out this early?

56
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,501
Early? You woke up late.

57
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,629
Go and have your breakfast, then.

58
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,255
Let's do it together.

59
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,341
Let's work out together?

60
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,842
No! Eat breakfast!

61
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:40,010
Annoying.

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,221
We already had breakfast.

63
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,430
OK.

64
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,349
We're almost done.

65
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,560
One more set and then we can
take a bath together.

66
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:49,937
Idiot!

67
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:53,815
Go and tire yourselves out.
I'll just eat.

68
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:56,026
OK, baby. Catch you later!

(Gameboys Season2)

70
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,976
Veggies agin?

71
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,395
Gross.

(Episode 3 Feel At Home)

73
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,534
Hi, baby.

74
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,411
Did you see my surprise for you?

75
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,872
Yes, I did. Thank you, baby.

76
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:33,457
It's cute.

77
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:34,791
Just like you.

78
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,376
Idiot.

79
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:41,673
I like that, too, but I dip it
in soy sauce.

80
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,967
But Gav said you like ketchup.

81
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,053
Yes.

82
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,264
But you prefer cereal over it?

83
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:51,183
It's not like that.

84
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:54,561
You know that I don't eat veggies, right?

85
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,979
Right, I forgot.

86
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,982
Even eggplant with eggs?

87
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,359
Especially that.

88
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,361
What's wrong with eggplant with eggs?

89
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,862
That's yummy, you know.

90
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,697
Yes, it is. I promise.

91
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:06,948
Why don't you taste it?

92
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,452
OK, fine. I'll eat it.

93
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:13,330
If this doesn't taste good,
you'll see.

94
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,290
No need. I'll just cook hotdog
and eggs...

95
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,126
I said I'll eat it.

96
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:20,670
OK, baby.

97
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,964
If you two say so.

98
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,226
Baby...

99
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:36,603
What's wrong? You don't like it?

100
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:37,396
Why...

101
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,481
Why does it taste...

102
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,690
like meat?

103
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,401
Because it has meat in it.

104
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,527
- For real?
- Yes.

105
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:45,695
Delicious!

106
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:47,656
I told you so.

107
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:51,159
I had the same reaction when I tasted it.

108
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:55,080
I know that you don't eat veggies,
that's why I put ground meat in it.

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,834
Actually, it was Terrence's idea.
He helped me cook it.

110
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,837
I already know the recipe.

111
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:06,007
But Gav's recipe is better
because Gav cooked it with love.

112
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,635
- Right?
- Build me up some more!

113
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,637
I'm the best wingman!

114
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:12,472
Go away.

115
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:14,683
You don't have to watch me eat.

116
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,604
You might want to talk to someone
while you eat.

117
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,274
Why don't you take a bath first?

118
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,192
You guys stink!

119
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:26,445
You're too much, baby.

120
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,904
We'll take a bath together, right?

121
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:30,073
I didn't say yes to it!

122
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,534
Show some respect to our guest.

123
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,829
Don't worry about me.
Just do your thing.

124
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,456
He's fine with it.

125
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,124
Drop it, baby.

126
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:42,627
Let me eat in peace,
Angel of Peace.

127
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,798
Fine, let's go take a bath then.

128
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:47,549
Come on, Terrence.

129
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:48,341
What!?

130
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,850
I said we'll take a bath, separately.

131
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,314
Yes, as you should.

132
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,065
OK.

133
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,901
- We'll go ahead, baby.
- Bye.

134
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:06,526
OK.

135
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,162
It's faster if you'd let me do it.

136
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,998
We might break the dishes.

137
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,625
No, let me do it.

138
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,507
OK. I'll just hang out with my baby.

139
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:30,884
Baby...

140
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:33,303
Baby...

141
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,599
I'll just go livestreaming.

142
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,894
Baby, you haven't even taken
a bath yet.

143
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,480
They won't smell me, anyway.

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,442
Save that for later.
Let's hang out first, please?

145
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:50,362
What else do you want?

146
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,531
You already have my full attention.

147
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,283
Thank you, baby.

148
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,203
Are we going to clean the house again?

149
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,538
I'm down for it.

150
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,456
Finish the dishes first.

151
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:03,917
Why do you know a lot of chores?

152
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,002
It isn't obvious, right?
He seems like a rich boy.

153
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,213
My nanny was strict.

154
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:12,259
She made sure that I'd learn chores.

155
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,427
I see.

156
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:17,722
My mom doesn't want us
to meddle with chores

157
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,433
since we only mess up things.

158
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,978
That's not gonna change
my love for you, baby.

159
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:23,853
Idiot!

160
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,938
Just kidding.

161
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,065
I like serving you, baby.

162
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,775
Stop being cheesy!

163
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,987
I'm asking you to teach me
so I won't be a burden to you.

164
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:35,574
But you were never a burden to me.

165
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,576
Unless you'd lie on top of me again.

166
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,285
Shut up!

167
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,078
Can't you have a bit of shame?

168
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:41,079
I'm actually proud of it.

169
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,832
You guys are so cute.

170
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,837
See. He said we're cute.

171
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,723
I'm sorry, Aunt Myra.
I'm in a middle of something.

172
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:02,017
I'll just call you back.

173
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,229
Good evening, Sir Vic.

174
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,858
I'd just like to follow up on your rent.

175
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,693
Thanks.

176
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:46,186
Hi, baby.

177
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,688
This is nice.

178
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:49,898
You smell so good.

179
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:51,691
Shh, baby.

180
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,361
Wait, baby.

181
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:59,532
Baby, can I enjoy this moment without you
throwing punchlines, please?

182
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:01,660
OK.

183
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,418
Baby...

184
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,712
I have something to tell you.

185
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,176
You're scaring me.

186
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:21,054
No. I just spoke with mom…

187
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,931
And?

188
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:25,058
She asked if...

189
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,435
I already had my swab test...

190
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,020
What did she say?
Was she upset?

191
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,398
Are you leaving me soon, baby?

192
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,983
- Stupid. Listen to me first.
- You're leaving me?

193
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:35,610
- Listen first.
- Tell me.

194
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,278
- OK?
- So what did your mom say?

195
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,656
She said...

196
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:45,537
that I should just stay here
while Aunt Leni is still in Baguio.

197
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:46,996
Could you say that again?

198
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:48,623
I'm not sure if I heard it right.

199
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:49,541
I said...

200
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,961
since Aunt Leni is still in Baguio,

201
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:55,255
I'm staying here longer.

202
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:57,799
So that means...

203
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,343
It means we get to spend
more time together...

204
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,344
Yes!

205
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,141
Hey, baby!

206
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,059
Wait, baby!

207
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,686
You're so annoying!

208
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,479
Ouch!

209
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,106
That hurts!

210
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,483
Baby, wait!

211
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,776
Baby, stop it!

212
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:18,737
Just say the safe word, baby.

213
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,947
Stupid.
We don't have a safe word!

214
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,823
We don't?

215
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:22,240
We don't!

216
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,032
Great!

217
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:23,742
Ouch!

218
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:27,245
Gav, Cai! What happened?

219
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,540
Shit, sorry! Go on!

220
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,294
No, it's fine. We're OK.
Gav was just being playful.

221
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,588
Baby, shall we get inside the room?

222
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,464
You wish!

223
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:39,758
I just wanted to ask

224
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,011
if I can already marinade the meat.

225
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,263
I almost forgot. That's a good idea.

226
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:47,056
Are you fine with it, baby?

227
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,266
Yes, that sounds delicious.

228
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:51,269
I just needed to ask for
your permission first.

229
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,313
You don't have to.
Feel at home.

230
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,981
Let me help you.

231
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,500
If I could have a superpower,
I want to have the power to disappear.

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,600
The worst thing about this pandemic is that it traps
us in the very situation we tried so hard to avoid.

233
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,098
Is he okay?

234
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,000
(Terrence Carreon)

235
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,100
(Hey, you busy? I just need someone to talk to.)

236
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,400
(Terrence Carreon)

237
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,952
I see. Playing hard to get, huh?

238
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
(Wesley Torres)

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,700
Thinking what would be my next step.

240
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
(Terrence Carreon posted a new photo)

241
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Thank you Gavreel and Cairo for saving me.

242
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,936
Where are you?

243
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:17,272
Where is this?

244
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,940
Work out day!

245
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,525
Let's wake up my baby!

246
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,693
He's already late.

247
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:22,861
Baby...

248
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,362
Baby, hey, wake up!

249
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,991
I thought we're going to exercise?

250
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,660
- What time is it?
- 6 AM!

251
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,079
Say hi to them.
Hello!

252
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:38,042
Wow, you're now serious about
working out, baby.

253
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,628
Of course.

254
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,673
Come on, give me a kiss.

255
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:48,011
Baby, the camera's recording!

256
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,846
Stop it!

257
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:51,598
Baby, enough!

258
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,641
Go change.

259
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:56,144
Baby, stop!

260
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,187
It's still early. Maybe we can have
a warm up session here.

261
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:00,732
Crazy! Terrence is waiting for us.

262
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:01,774
I found you, Terrence.

263
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:02,775
Baby, Stop it!

264
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,319
I'll stop recording.

265
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,653
They might flag this content.

(DEPARTURE DATE)

269
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,669
What a beautiful day!

270
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:22,754
Good morning!

271
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,713
Hi!

272
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,800
Baby!

273
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:29,093
Are you OK?

274
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,347
Do you want to take a break?

275
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:33,473
- No.
- Are you sure?

276
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:34,265
Yes, baby.

277
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:34,807
OK.

278
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,435
He said he's OK.

279
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,395
Let's do it.

280
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:40,313
Jogging!

281
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,868
Baby!

282
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:03,336
- My baby along with Terrence will demonstrate—
- Hi!

283
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:07,966
- How to fry a fish. Am I right?
- Hi!

284
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,133
Game!

285
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,301
OK.

286
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,512
Be careful, baby.

287
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:13,680
Can you do it?

288
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,722
Of course.

289
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:17,350
Be careful with the boiling oil.

290
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,105
I'm OK.

291
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,856
There you go.

292
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,233
Wow!

293
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,903
Now let's watch Terrence.

294
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:30,321
Doing it like a master chef!

295
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,447
Of course!

296
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:32,949
Too easy for him.

297
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,243
Wow!

298
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:38,579
Good morning!

299
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,415
Hi!

300
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,834
Ten minutes left, baby!

301
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,546
Ten minutes? It felt like an hour!

302
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,965
No, that was just 20 minutes.

303
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,091
Let's take a break first.

304
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,051
- But baby...
- Just push a little bit more.

305
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,219
You can do it!

306
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,721
- Push, baby! Push!
- Come on! Push!

307
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,431
Go ahead, I'll just catch up.

308
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:57,557
Are you sure, baby?

309
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:58,725
Promise, baby.

310
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:01,060
- All right, we'll go ahead.
- See you, Cai!

311
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,563
I love you, baby!

312
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,277
Baby, come join us!

313
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,778
I'm good, just do your thing.

314
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:12,530
Let's go!

315
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,281
I'll join you later.

316
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,741
I insist.

317
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:15,867
What?

318
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,244
Come on, baby.

319
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:19,996
- Go.
- Fine.

320
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:22,915
Up...

321
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,543
Go on.

322
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:26,669
- Up!
- Ouch!

323
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:28,629
- Ouch!
- What's happened, baby?

324
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,673
I'm having cramps, baby.

325
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:32,300
- It's painful!
- Cai, relax.

326
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,342
Breathe, OK?

327
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:36,804
Inhale through your nose,
exhale through your mouth.

328
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:53,529
Is this…

329
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,128
Hey.

330
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:12,006
Gav?

331
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,967
I thought I was already lost!

332
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,220
Monster...

333
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,387
Master...

334
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,098
What are you doing here?

335
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,272
Hey, where have you been?

336
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:29,357
I couldn't catch up anymore.

337
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,275
I wish I didn't run too far.

338
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:32,527
What's wrong, baby?

339
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,945
I bumped into this clown.

340
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,612
What?

341
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:35,905
I mean, we have a visitor.

342
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:38,616
Hi, boss!

343
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,785
Master! What are you doing here?

344
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,703
Oh god, it's a long story!

345
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:44,997
Hey, hello!

346
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:45,915
Hi.

347
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,628
You know each other, right?

348
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,088
- Yes.
- No.

349
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,506
Which is which?

350
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:01,222
We were at Pearl's Zoom session, remember?

351
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,142
But we don't really know each other.

352
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,103
How did you know my address?

353
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:08,729
His brother London gave it to me.

354
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:09,856
But why are you here?

355
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,149
How did you get here?

356
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,317
And no offense, but I think
you should quarantine first.

357
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,986
Stay away from him, baby.

358
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,654
Hold on, calm down!

359
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:19,782
OK, we were quarantined after I got to
the airport.

360
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:23,161
I got my test results and it's negative,
so I was allowed to go.

361
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:27,165
OK, I'm sorry,
but what brings you here?

362
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,459
It's not that I don't want to see you.

363
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:34,630
I thought you were in Bukidnon.

364
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,842
Let me get some rest.
I'm tired.

365
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:40,219
I want to fix my things first.

366
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,805
So where's my bedroom?

367
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:50,104
I already gave the vacant room
to Terrence.

368
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:52,231
Unless you're OK to be
roommates with him?

369
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,025
- No!
- Sure!

370
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:00,740
Looks like he doesn't want to, Master.

371
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:05,286
So I'll be sleeping on the sidewalk then.

372
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:08,247
Well, it's not like I'm paying rent.

373
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,499
Go ahead, use the room.
I'll just sleep on the couch.

374
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,295
Come on, I just told you that
I am Covid-negative.

375
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,631
Here's the result. Look!

376
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:21,010
It's up to you, guys.
Just figure it out.

377
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,847
Gav, I need to tell you something.

378
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:26,224
Yes, thanks for reminding me.

379
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,433
Let's go.

380
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,233
Boss...

381
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,360
Aren't you happy to see me?

382
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,569
Master!

383
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,404
Of course, I am.

384
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:41,322
How are you?

385
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,531
- I'm fine.
- What's up?

386
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:57,046
Hey.

387
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,091
Hey.

388
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,476
Sleep beside me?

389
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:22,071
Sure?

390
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,787
So it would be crispier.

391
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,748
Yeah, perfect.

392
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,252
Wow.

393
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:42,550
It seems like you are preparing a lot.

394
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:44,927
Because you have a visitor, baby.

395
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,680
Don't mind him.

396
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,931
He's not picky.

397
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:49,974
It's a welcome dinner,

398
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,601
so he won't back out from
our drinking session.

399
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,981
Do you want to put it here?

400
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:58,983
I might get burned.

401
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,318
Which one is better?

402
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:01,944
It's up to you.

403
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:04,238
This one looks better.

404
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,407
But that one looks nice, too.

405
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:07,616
Nice.

406
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,537
I'll help you out.

407
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,080
No need, baby.

408
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,541
Just relax and leave this to us.

409
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,169
So I'm just your taster?

410
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,922
Why do you always talk
about ‘tasting, ' baby?

411
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:23,257
Stupid!

412
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:26,010
I'm almost done.

413
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,720
You still have to cook the noodles.

414
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,138
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

415
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,098
I'll just clean up first.

416
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,393
Baby, I also know how to cook noodles.

417
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:37,229
I know that, baby.

418
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:41,692
Just relax.
We can handle this, OK?

419
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:43,986
Where's the salt and pepper?

420
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:45,488
It's there. Just get it.

421
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:47,198
All right. Here?

422
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,158
Yes.

423
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:59,001
Baby, looks like the chicken is already burnt.

424
00:22:59,001 --> 00:22:59,835
Let me see.

425
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:02,213
Where...

426
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,172
Ouch!

427
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,382
Shit, it hurts!

428
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,384
Baby! What happened?

429
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,344
Did you get burned, Cai?
- Let me see!

430
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:10,304
Let me see. What happened...

431
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:12,264
Don't touch me!

432
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,183
Baby, are you angry?

433
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:15,518
No!

434
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:17,895
Then why are you shouting?

435
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,939
Because I'm pissed!

436
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:21,482
Ouch!

437
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:22,983
Baby...

438
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:26,529
- What's wrong, baby?
- I hate myself!

439
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,824
I hate myself for feeling this way.

440
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:32,201
But I can't help it.

441
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,912
I feel ashamed for acting this way.

442
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,337
Baby, I don't understand.

443
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,341
So do I.

444
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,802
But I know that I'm the one you love.

445
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:53,013
I know that the two of you are not
doing anything wrong.

446
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:56,183
I just can't help but feel jealous.

447
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,521
What are you jealous of?

448
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:02,815
You said it yourself.
You're the one I love.

449
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,818
I'm jealous of your friendship
with Terrence.

450
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:10,156
That no matter what I do,

451
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:14,118
I can never match what you
and Terrence have.

452
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,328
It's frustrating,

453
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:19,457
that I have to force myself into it.

454
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:23,335
But I am your boyfriend, right?

455
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,756
So I feel ashamed because
I shouldn't feel this way.

456
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,426
Baby...

457
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,095
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:37,391
I didn't mean to make you
feel that way.

459
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,651
I know.

460
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:50,946
Baby...

461
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
(Not_Cairo)

462
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
(Cainonymous)

463
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
(Post)

464
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:55,761
I want to say bad words.

465
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,687
But you are the best, Mom.

466
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:10,025
I have one more month with my baby.

467
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,197
Baby,

468
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,742
(Next On Gameboys2)
please talk to me when you are ready, OK?

469
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:19,868
Terrence!

470
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:21,120
Oh, shit!

471
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:23,789
Wow.

472
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,583
I did not expect that.

473
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,460
You have a huge amount of patience, baby.

474
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,754
Do you know what else is huge?

475
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:32,089
It doesn't seem like it.

476
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,340
Do you want proof?

477
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,509
Stop it, baby!

478
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,177
- Oh my god!
- Pearl!

479
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:39,722
What is the meaning of this?

480
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:42,224
Hey, Terrence!
You didn't even wake me up.

481
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:44,476
Oh my god! What is happening?

482
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,186
But can I just say this:

483
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:48,022
You are more gorgeous in person, Pearl.

484
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,275
I get that a lot.

485
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:55,112
No, Pearl. Wesley's visit was unplanned.

486
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:56,780
Are you OK with this, babe?

487
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,324
Do I have a choice?

488
00:26:58,782 --> 00:26:59,742
Baby...
