1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:02,626
Hi, Ma.

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:06,088
Do you already have
a schedule for your swab test?

3
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:07,548
Yes, I do.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,008
OK, that's good to know.

5
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,719
Your brother London said he'll be
the one to book you a flight.

6
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,390
Ma, can I just book it on my own?

7
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:21,395
All right. Your Grandma's birthday
falls right after your quarantine.

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:23,272
She's excited to see you.

9
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:25,733
I know.

10
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:29,862
What's wrong?

11
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,072
Do you want to stay longer?

12
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,993
Have you informed Gav already?

13
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,162
Let me talk to him.

14
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:43,042
No need, Ma. I haven't told him yet.
He's also going through a lot right now.

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,378
Is that so? Is it why you're sad?

16
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:48,505
Because...

17
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,925
He's also leaving, Ma.

18
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,677
Leaving for?

19
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,472
New York.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,849
You mean the street
in the metro?

21
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,476
Stop it, Ma.

22
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:03,187
I was just trying to make you laugh.
You look so serious.

23
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:06,398
Because I am!
This isn't a laughing matter.

24
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:09,860
What did I tell you about
long distance relationships?

25
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:12,196
Yes, I remember what you said.

26
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,573
We already talked about it.

27
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:17,159
We're used to talking
through video calls, anyway.

28
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:22,623
But because of the time difference
and the need for a passport and a visa,

29
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:24,500
it becomes difficult?

30
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,337
It's just that the distance
is becoming real now.

31
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:31,590
He's OK with me going
back to the province.

32
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,050
We already have a plan.

33
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,803
But then, he needs to leave.

34
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:39,098
His aunt is sick.

35
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:40,808
Oh my...

36
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:42,601
How is he?

37
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,479
He's not yet sure of leaving.

38
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:51,276
But don't worry, I won't let him stay
just because of me.

39
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:55,072
How about you?
How do you feel about it?

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,284
I don't mind him leaving, Ma.

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,079
But I still feel sad.

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,376
I won't be able to hug him,

43
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,838
to touch him... feel his...

44
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:13,423
Feel his what, Cairo?
Tell me, Cairo. Feel Gav's what?

45
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,676
His love!

46
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,844
Oh, really?

47
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:19,930
You're at the right age.

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,851
Just always use a condom
for your safety.

49
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,601
Ma!

50
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,814
Why? That's what your
Dad used to tell London.

51
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,483
Whatever. I have to go. Bye.

52
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:35,529
All right. Bye, baby!

53
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,364
Ma!

54
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,033
OK, fine. Bye.

55
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:45,372
Baby!

56
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,629
Aunt Myra...
This is Aunt Myra.

57
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:53,380
Hi, Cairo!

58
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:54,506
Hello, Aunt Myra.

59
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:58,844
My nephew really chose well.

60
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:01,680
Your baby looks gorgeous, Gavreel.

61
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:05,100
He's also kind and grumpy.

62
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,394
You don't have to say that!

63
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:08,478
See, I told you so.

64
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,315
Oh, to be young and in love.

65
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,526
I wish I had that kind of love.

66
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:21,200
Well, I thought I had once, but you know
how it went, right, Gavreel?

67
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,622
That's why I hope you
cherish that kind of love.

68
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,333
A love that is worth fighting for.

69
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,336
Don't be too melodramatic.

70
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,297
Gav is worth fighting for.

71
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:40,135
You, too, baby. And you know that.

72
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,056
Now that's what I want to
hear from the two of you.

73
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,100
How do they say it?

74
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:49,603
'I wish the same for me'?

75
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,313
Yes, you're right.

76
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,522
I wish the same for me.

77
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,024
I'll just go to the restroom, baby.

78
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,442
Aunt Myra, I'll just go to
the restroom.

79
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,527
Be nice to my baby, OK?

80
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:58,487
Silly!

81
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,322
I can't promise.

82
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:01,365
Come on...

83
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:02,783
Go ahead.

84
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,419
So, now that Gav is away, do you want to
hear any embarassing moments from him?

85
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,508
No need, Aunt Myra.
He does embarassing things everyday.

86
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,719
Well, that's also true!

87
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,432
You know, my nephew
loves you very much.

88
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:34,356
And even from here, I can feel that
you also love him as much.

89
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,234
I'm sorry for being emotional about it.

90
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:38,944
But...

91
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,196
This is...

92
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:46,159
My last chance
to take care of Gav.

93
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:51,415
Please take care of
him for me, OK?

94
00:04:52,749 --> 00:05:01,174
I owe him a lot. I really want to
make it up to him, but...

95
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,175
Aunt Myra...

96
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,637
We can both take care of Gav.

97
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,098
Yes, of course.

98
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:15,522
By the way, how's your Mom?
I also want to...

99
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,108
Aunt Myra?

100
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,152
Are you OK?

101
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,029
Aunt Myra!

102
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,697
Gav!

103
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:24,698
Gav!

104
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,700
Gav, come over here!

105
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,492
Aunt Myra!

106
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,411
What happened?

107
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:30,787
Aunt Myra...

108
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,124
Aunt Myra, are you OK?

109
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:34,916
Yes, I am.

110
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:41,381
I just got a glass of water
because my throat is itchy.

111
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,592
Are you sure you're OK?

112
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,638
Yes, of course. I'm very much OK.

113
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,390
That's good to know.

(Episode 8 No Matter What 2)

116
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:47,697
Baby?

117
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:48,907
Yes?

118
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:52,953
In 10 years,
where do you think we'd be?

119
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,958
Is this a job interview, baby?
Would I get health benefits?

120
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,460
No, you won't! Just answer me!

121
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:02,546
10 years?

122
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,255
Yes.

123
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:09,719
You'd be an international
pro-gamer by then,

124
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:17,727
with a team and
a gaming empire of your own.

125
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,312
Empire?

126
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,605
Empire.

127
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,648
For real?

128
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:22,399
Of course!

129
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:23,233
You're so sweet!

130
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,528
Well, as for you,
you'd have your chain of restaurants.

131
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:31,992
Yours would be the best
not only here but also abroad.

132
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,160
- Abroad?
- Yes.

133
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,788
Wow, our five children
would be so lucky.

134
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:39,833
Five?! In 10 years?!

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,709
Yes.

136
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,752
Baby, I don't want
to have kids yet.

137
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,881
I want to be your
only baby for a long time.

138
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,427
Baby! Why would you be
jealous of our children?

139
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,221
OK, fine.

140
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:54,389
15 years.

141
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,267
OK, that'll do.

142
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:01,938
Are you OK with five children?

143
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:05,567
Yes. I know why you want
to have a lot of children.

144
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,032
Because you'll be a great dad.

145
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:15,744
Are you sure?

146
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:17,245
Yes.

147
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,711
I want them to call me Tatay.

148
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,380
And then they'll call you Daddy.

149
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:32,344
But baby, I want them to call me Papa.
Why did you choose Daddy?

150
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:36,431
So they can say,
'choke me, daddy!'

151
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,641
Idiot!

152
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,267
You're an idiot!

153
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:42,062
'Choke me!'

154
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,199
Baby...

155
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:55,659
Yes?

156
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:59,788
What did you tell Tita Myra?

157
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,085
Let's sleep, baby.

158
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,882
Baby, just tell me.

159
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,347
Let's not talk about it, baby.

160
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:18,348
But why?

161
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:24,187
I've been through a lot these past few
days. I just want to breathe first.

162
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:30,819
OK, fine.

163
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:43,707
I love you.

164
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,209
I love you.

165
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,789
Hi Tita, I hope you are feeling better.

166
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:31,338
Please don't worry about Gav, I'll handle it.

167
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:44,434
Achilles...

168
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,226
- You scared me!
- What's up?

169
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:48,855
This is part of my diet plan, OK?

170
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,482
OK.

171
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:07,123
You're still sexy even
if you don't go on a diet.

172
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:08,958
Seriously?

173
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,085
I'm not kidding.

174
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,128
Are you still mad at me?

175
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,005
Not anymore.

176
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:18,426
So, you're accepting my apology?

177
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,012
You know what, Terrence,
I appreciate your apology.

178
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:24,140
But sometimes, I feel like you
are over compensating.

179
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:27,018
That's why it seems like you're
saying things you don't mean.

180
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,397
But I was sincere when
I apologized to you.

181
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,985
I know you are, but sometimes, I just find
your extra effort questionable.

182
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:39,114
Though I admit, I also said
things that I didn't mean.

183
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:41,199
Like what?

184
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:44,703
I don't really believe that
you are a masc for masc type.

185
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,996
I only said that just to hurt you.

186
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,792
So I guess, I also owe you an apology.

187
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,672
You're forgiven. You know that
I can never be mad at you.

188
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:59,676
See! That's what I was talking about!
You're over-promising again!

189
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:06,141
I can't get mad at you for so long.
Is that acceptable?

190
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:08,184
Better.

191
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:10,854
Are you making one for me?

192
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:12,313
Do you want some?

193
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,858
You wish! Make your own sandwich!

194
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,157
Coffee...

195
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:27,203
Thank you.

196
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,846
So...

197
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,222
So...

198
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,146
I am thinking...

199
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:54,481
You're thinking...

200
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:58,860
I talked to the landlady
from my old apartment.

201
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,403
OK, and?

202
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:04,073
She told me that I can
move back again.

203
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,453
But since I don't get financial support
from my parents, maybe...

204
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,246
Are you asking me to move in with you?

205
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,042
That's not what I said.
I was just thinking if I'm...

206
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:35,480
I guess that's a yes?

207
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,981
Of course, that's a yes.

208
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,542
There you go.

209
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,647
Girl...

210
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:21,359
Are you sure you're giving up?

211
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:24,821
It's not giving up, girl.
It's letting go.

212
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,240
Yeah, right!
That's the same thing.

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,242
Then you're gonna
go cry in the corner.

214
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,411
I feel like I'm addicted
to heartbreak.

215
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,289
That's not the Achilles that I know.

216
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:38,167
But what should I do?
I don't want to beg for love.

217
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,794
I still have my pride, you know.

218
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,713
Are you sure?

219
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,968
You know what, someone once told me,
"Love rewards the brave."

220
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,512
You won't achieve anything
if you remain a coward.

221
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,764
That's a nice quote!
I'll have that tattooed on my body.

222
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,600
Seriously? That's your concern?

223
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:59,230
OK, fine. I'm giving up, but that
doesn't mean that I'm a coward.

224
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,483
I think it takes a brave heart to find
acceptance in your heart;

225
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:04,652
to accept that he
doesn't really like me.

226
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:10,074
But of course, I am no saint.
For sure I'd still feel bitter about it.

227
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:17,832
I'm proud of you, girl. I really hope
you find the right guy for you.

228
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,752
Do you want me to
hook you up with someone?

229
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,462
I am good at matchmaking,
I promise!

230
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:27,467
I think you'll like
my friend, Fonzy!

231
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,178
Stop it! I'm still reeling
from a heartbreak.

232
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:32,388
My heart is smashed to pieces.

233
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,141
It's like you want to keep kicking
then spitting on it.

234
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:40,229
Stop overreacting! But when you're
ready, let's go boy hunting.

235
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,397
Alright.

236
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:50,865
I'm sorry, sis.

237
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,033
Why?

238
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:56,162
I might be the reason why Terrence
hooked up with Wesley.

239
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,538
Seriously, girl?

240
00:15:58,331 --> 00:15:59,582
Seriously, girl?

241
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:00,750
I can explain!

242
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,170
How could you do that to me!
I thought we were family!

243
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,595
In fairness!

244
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:13,680
That's good acting!

245
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,600
How about you?
How's your love life?

246
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:28,569
I'm at peace, Achilles. I'm at peace
with the fact that I will grow old alone.

247
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,324
I'll just adopt dogs, cats,

248
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,661
and rats.

249
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:43,167
I'll just learn how to do cross stitch
and how to crochet bedsheets and curtains.

250
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,337
Isn't that Rufa Mae's iconic line?

251
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:47,839
You know it, girl!

252
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,718
Stop fooling me!
I know you have a healthy sex life.

253
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,511
Then why did you ask if
you already know the answer?

254
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:54,262
Can I touch it?

255
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,263
Touch my what?

256
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,433
Your hand! For some good luck.

257
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:07,442
Saint Pearl, the ever sexy,
please bless me.

258
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:11,195
Girl, you don't need my blessing,
you need a miracle!

259
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,613
And you find that funny?

260
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,034
You're mocking me!

261
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,744
I hope you choke.

262
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:19,871
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:55,073 --> 00:18:00,411
Hello, Sir Vic, will you be
able to pay your rent?

264
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,040
I'm sorry, Gav.
I just got back to work.

265
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,417
The pandemic made it
really hard for me.

266
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,464
When will this pandemic ever end?

267
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:21,224
They might cut off our electricity
and water supply.

268
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,809
I used up all my savings
to pay for the bills.

269
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:26,437
I'm really sorry.
I will look for ways to pay you.

270
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:28,147
Maybe you can ask the other tenants first.

271
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,192
I already called Ms. Christine.

272
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:35,029
Her daugther is sick,
that's why I couldn't force her to pay.

273
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:38,491
Is that so? OK, I'll let you know once
I find a way to pay you.

274
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:39,784
OK.

275
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,169
Baby...

276
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,008
What's wrong, baby?

277
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:03,891
I'll just pay for the water and
electricity bills. Leave them up to me.

278
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:08,813
No need. I already told
you that I'll take care of it, right?

279
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,065
But how?

280
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,776
I'll find a way.

281
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,822
Please accept my offer.

282
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:22,535
It will make your life easier.
It's fine with me.

283
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,122
Where will you get the money, baby?

284
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:30,293
If you'll ask from your
Mom, then forget it.

285
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,295
No.

286
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:37,675
I have my own savings, remember?
That's enough to pay for the bills.

287
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,553
But how will you
buy your gaming computer?

288
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,725
You've been saving up for it,
it's a waste to use the money for the bills.

289
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,518
What's wrong? It's my savings, anyway.

290
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:52,315
Don't be such a pest, baby.
I said I can handle it.

291
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:58,821
It's no big deal to me.
I just want to lessen your burden.

292
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,033
Well, it's a big deal to me because
it's my responsibility.

293
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,409
Stop meddling, baby.

294
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:07,955
Meddling? I am concerned about you!

295
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,501
Your debts are piling up but
you can't even lower your pride!

296
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,296
Whatever.

297
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,840
You're just overreacting.
Suit yourself.

298
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,134
Hey!

299
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,345
Hey!

300
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:24,430
I'm not overreacting! You're the one
who's avoiding the problem!

301
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,681
You're the one who
doesn't want to confront it!

302
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,017
You'd only act on it when it's too late!

303
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,560
Everything is fine!

304
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,772
Everything will only be
fine if you accept my offer!

305
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:36,442
I don't want you to spend your savings.
This isn't your responsibility.

306
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,527
But you, you are my responsibility.

307
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,822
See, that's what's wrong with you.
You think you need to do everything for me!

308
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,407
You told me to feel at home, right?

309
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:46,494
Then I can decide what do with this home!
Unless you didn't mean your words.

310
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,871
I meant those words.
Why are you upset?

311
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:51,540
Because you don't want to tell
me how you really feel!

312
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,042
Is this still about the bills?

313
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,752
Why don't you want
to be with Aunt Myra?

314
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,171
Why are we talking about her?

315
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,050
I've already decided, OK?

316
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:05,805
Don't walk out on me, Gav!

317
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,182
Gav, don't leave!

318
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:09,850
Gav!

319
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:12,561
Gav!

320
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:14,605
Why do you want me to leave?

321
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:16,107
Why don't you want to leave?

322
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:17,608
You already know why
I don't want to leave!

323
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,276
Baby...

324
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,944
- Because I want to be with you.
- I'm going home to the province.

325
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,405
- I don't want to leave you.
- We can't stay in your house forever.

326
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,906
- But I'll visit you in the province, right?
- And you know that!

327
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:26,200
- We have a plan!
- What will you do in the province?

328
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,993
I don't know yet.

329
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:30,746
That won't cut it. Do you think we'll
survive those uncertainties?

330
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,373
But I am happy when I'm with you.

331
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:34,333
- Gav, please be realistic.
- Aren't you happy when you're with me?

332
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:35,293
This is my personal decision.

333
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,836
Gav, your Aunt Myra is sick.

334
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:39,213
She said she's OK
and she understands.

335
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:42,425
You know she only said that so you
won't feel bad about your decision.

336
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:43,884
Why do you make me feel
like I made the wrong decision?

337
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:46,762
Baby, my Dad died
without even talking to me.

338
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:50,016
You know that I still regret
what happened until now.

339
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:52,226
I don't want the same
thing to happen to you.

340
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:55,271
Is it wrong for me to choose you?

341
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,367
Am I wrong for choosing you?

342
00:22:58,834 --> 00:22:59,794
Baby...

343
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,216
I love you so much.

344
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,972
But I hope you choose
yourself this time.

345
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,106
Your debts are piling up.
You can't even pay for your car loan.

346
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:24,610
You're too kind to bug
your tenants to pay.

347
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,408
Are you saying that I'm a failure?

348
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:37,915
No, baby. My point is, you need help.

349
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,712
What I'm saying is
you need help, baby.

350
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:48,717
And your Aunt Myra also needs you.

351
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,387
For sure, she'll be able to help you.

352
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:52,596
OK?

353
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,850
You don't have to be alone here.

354
00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,937
How about you?

355
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,774
What about us?

356
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:08,112
Baby...

357
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:11,782
We're just going to different places.

358
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:14,493
We're not breaking up.

359
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:23,043
We're used to having video calls, anyway.
We even got through this pandemic.

360
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:30,926
We'll get through this.
And we will see each other again.

361
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:35,890
I'll visit you in the province.

362
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:42,021
And I'll visit you in
New York, hopefully.

363
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:54,366
To be honest,
I'm also afraid of the future.

364
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:59,788
I really want to see Aunt Myra.

365
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,503
But I am afraid of what's going to
happen if I choose her.

366
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:09,757
I understand.

367
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:14,053
I also have my fears.

368
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,099
But that's the reason
why we're together, right?

369
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:28,817
We'll always be here
for each other.

370
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:33,572
That's why I love you.

371
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,493
Thank you for
making me strong, baby.

372
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:42,206
And you make me strong, too, baby.

373
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:53,968
This is crazy.
You might miss me in no time.

374
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:55,886
It's impossible not to.

375
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:09,525
I love you, baby.

376
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:15,781
I love you...

377
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,035
No matter what.

378
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:24,039
No matter what.

379
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:39,555
Baby...

380
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:02,870
Rain or shine, nothing can stop us!

381
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:03,996
So let's do this!

382
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:08,584
Your donation of any amount
can help a lot of students.

383
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,961
Again, check the details below.

384
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,171
Thank you!

385
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:13,339
Okay, so,

386
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,134
As the president of CaiReel Nation,

387
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:20,179

Guys, sorry for disturbing
your alone time together.

455
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:20,552
Sorry for intruding your space and
eating some of your food.

456
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,888
But thank you for
being so accommodating.

457
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:26,975
No worries, it was a lot of fun!

458
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:29,186
There were no boring days, right?

459
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:31,521
If you're worrying about their
honeymoon, then worry not!

460
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:34,774
Girl, it was really mind-blowing!

461
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:37,861
How did you know?

462
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,321
Weren't you able to hear them?

463
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,615
I thought there was a dog fight!

464
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:48,246
That's why you snuck
out of your room!

465
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:49,956
You guys are just envious!

466
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,502
I admit, I've been stuck
in dry season.

467
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,338
Seriously? That bad?

468
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:58,048
That's crazy!

469
00:36:58,256 --> 00:37:00,050
You may leave now
so we can continue.

470
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,051
Jerk!

471
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,642
Thank you, Cai.

472
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:15,857
- Master!
- Boss!

473
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:17,025
Gav, thank you.

474
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:33,833
Thank you.

475
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:45,887
Look, baby, he's so dramatic!

476
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:49,099
Don't worry about it.

477
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,748
Your highness.

478
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:19,587
I love you, babes!

479
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:20,797
I love you!

480
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:42,944
Come on, guys!

481
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:05,675
Wait!

482
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:07,302
Let's take a selfie!

483
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:08,303
Game!

484
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:10,972
One… two… three!

485
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:12,390
Smile!

486
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,500
No Goodbye. Just see you later.

487
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,900
(Origin: Manila, Destination: Bukidnon / New York)

488
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,006
Baby!

489
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:46,925
May I kiss your hand, baby?

490
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:50,220
So sweet!

491
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,561
Cheers!

492
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:09,906
You're rude!

493
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,493
I was just kidding!

494
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:15,995
Hang on...

495
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:43,231
Write me a letter and
I'll also write you one.

496
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,233
Can't we just e-mail it?

497
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:46,985
Or post it on Screentime.

498
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:50,864
No, baby. We need to put it
in a time capsule.

499
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:54,451
My baby is so romantic.

500
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,828
So we're not going to read it yet?

501
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,746
Not yet.

502
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,498
We'll read it in the future.

503
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,208
And when will that be?

504
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,085
I don't know.

505
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:05,962
At the perfect time?

506
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:08,298
OK, baby.

507
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:11,801
At the perfect time.

508
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:14,614
Baby, if you'll stop me
from leaving, better do it now.

509
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:16,074
Silly!

510
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,952
We've already talked about this, right?

511
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,330
You'll go straight
to the international airport,

512
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,873
while I'll take the domestic flight.

513
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,586
Did you tell the driver to
pass through the back gate?

514
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:31,089
Yes, so you can take the front gate.

515
00:42:32,507 --> 00:42:33,508
OK.

516
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:36,344
Don't look back, OK?

517
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,889
Even if I'll just give
you a flying kiss?

518
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:41,891
Yes.

519
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:46,396
You might not be able to keep
yourself from running after me.

520
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:48,231
I'm sure you'll do the same.

521
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,817
Of course I would.

522
00:42:53,194 --> 00:42:55,196
That's why we have to do this, baby.

523
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:00,326
Can I hug you?

524
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:22,265
- Ouch. Enough, baby!
- I won't let you go!

525
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:24,017
Baby! Come on.

526
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,144
Wait, baby. Enough.

527
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,363
No looking back.

528
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:40,825
No more crying.

529
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:45,997
One…

530
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:49,042

I said there's no looking back!
Why are you still here?

Someone might see you.

Will you marry me?

572
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:22,213
Seriously?

573
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:30,429
I know it looks silly because
I only have this cheese ring for now.

574
00:47:32,473 --> 00:47:34,267
But I'm serious, baby.

575
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:37,395
I want to marry you.

576
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:55,037
Seems like you don't want to.

577
00:47:55,204 --> 00:47:56,706
Why did you eat it?!

578
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:57,915
Because you don't want to.

579
00:47:57,915 --> 00:47:58,541
Spit it out!

580
00:47:58,749 --> 00:48:00,251
- I'm already chewing it!
- Spit it out!

581
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:01,794
I already swallowed it!

582
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:07,091
You ruined my plan, baby.

583
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:16,183
Wow! You're just walking
out on me?

584
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:21,314
And then you'd tell
me that I ruined your plan? Wow.

585
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:31,449
What now? Why did you go back?
What do you want this time?

586
00:48:37,788 --> 00:48:43,127
Baby, I was planning
to propose to you.

587
00:48:47,214 --> 00:48:51,719
I wanted it to be special.
I asked Pearl for help.

588
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,516
But you ruined my plan.

589
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,108
For real?

590
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:08,819
Of course.

591
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:13,282
These are my parents' rings.

592
00:49:16,118 --> 00:49:18,579
When they had a civil wedding.

593
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:25,711
My Grandma gave it to me.

594
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,505
Ever since I was a kid,

595
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:32,093
I already knew that I'd give this
to the one I will love forever.

596
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:53,072
Baby...

597
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:58,577
Baby...

598
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:02,373
Will you marry me?

599
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,383
Yes, baby. Yes!

600
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:32,653
How about you, baby?
You didn't answer my question.

601
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:36,532
Will you marry me...

602
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:40,995
Baby...

603
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:47,626
There's no need to ask.
Of course, I will marry you.

604
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:02,641
Angel2000?

605
00:51:03,267 --> 00:51:04,435

606
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:05,644
