1
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:06,672
I'm coming, hang on!

2
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:12,678
Aunt Susan?

3
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,555
Who else would it be?

4
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:21,895
No need! We're in a pandemic,
we need to observe social distancing.

5
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:24,690
Baby, is that the item I ordered?

6
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,028
Who is he?

7
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:33,323
Why are you letting strangers inside the house?

8
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,119
He's Cairo.

9
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:38,704
Hello.

10
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:42,958
He's my friend.

11
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:48,797
Oh...

12
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:51,008
Your friend.

13
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,179
You've chosen your friends well.

14
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,475
You kind of look alike.

15
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:02,561
By the way...

16
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:06,315
Can you help carry my stuff?

17
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:07,733
I really have to pee.

18
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:10,569
Excuse me.

19
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,406
Please be careful with the eggs.

20
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,242
Don't break them, OK?

21
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:23,791
Baby...

22
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:25,042
Baby?

23
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:26,794
I thought I was just a friend?

24
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,464
I'll explain myself later.

25
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:31,965
OK.

26
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,050
Friend!

27
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,051
Come on, baby.

28
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,595
Baby, don't get mad!

29
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,930
Why did you lie?

30
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,600
Last I checked,
you were proud that I'm your baby.

31
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:46,105
But when it comes to your folks,
I'm just your friend?

32
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:49,358
Baby, I'm proud of you,
and you know that.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,653
It's just that Aunt Susan can be difficult.

34
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:55,114
I don't think she'd understand.

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,032
Besides, she won't be here for long.

36
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,492
I don't want us to get in trouble.

37
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:00,536
OK?

38
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:01,912
Baby...

39
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:02,871
Baby...

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,123
OK, fine!

41
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,708
I still don't get it, but fine!

42
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,254
Thank you, baby.

43
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:11,964
You're welcome...

44
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:14,383
Friend!

45
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:15,592
Baby...

46
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:17,344
Baby!

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,500
(Gameboys 2)

48
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:04,558
Baby...

49
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:05,767
What?

50
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,000
(Episode 5 Chip On The Shoulder)

51
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,941
Leave it, I'll fix those myself.

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,861
Have you guys eaten yet?

53
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:16,862
Not yet.

54
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,578
What's wrong?

55
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,831
Don't worry.

56
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:35,255
I came from our church's conference
and they swabbed us twice.

57
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,633
That's why I thought of dropping by.

58
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,594
Is that so?

59
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:41,386
Yes.

60
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:42,638
What brings you here?

61
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:49,353
Your Aunt Myra asked me to.
I also brought your favorite coconut pie.

62
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,355
Hand it to me.

63
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,648
Here you go.

64
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,150
For you.

65
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,027
Thank you.

66
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:01,448
Gav...

67
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,369
I heard you weren't answering
your Aunt Myra's calls.

68
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:09,790
She's worried about you,
especially during this pandemic.

69
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:13,335
I kept on missing her calls.
I'll just call her later.

70
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:15,003
Yes, you should.

71
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:20,133
Also, I dropped by your apartment units.

72
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,594
Why is Vic still there?

73
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:26,348
He's always late
with his rent. right?

74
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:29,351
Your Grandma Cora had a difficult time
dealing with him.

75
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:32,437
He does pay when he is able.

76
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,773
He's just having a hard time
because of the pandemic.

77
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:39,069
Gav, that won't cut it.

78
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:42,281
We're all hit hard by this pandemic.

79
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:43,991
OK.

80
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,286
By the way, do we have rice already?

81
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:48,996
I'll cook.

82
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:50,038
Let me do it, baby...

83
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,665
Bro...

84
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,667
Let me do it, bro.

85
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,087
He'll do it.

86
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,924
You got a good friend.

87
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:06,305
Wait, do you let girls inside this house?

88
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:10,309
No, that's never going to happen.

89
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:11,351
Why do you say so?

90
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,607
Because of the pandemic.

91
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:19,484
We're after our safety.

92
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,114
Right.

93
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,576
You have a point.

94
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,505
Wait up, Terrence.

95
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,215
Why do you keep chasing me?

96
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:44,092
Because I might get lost!

97
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,471
Hey, Mr. Boredom!

98
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,388
Stop calling me that!

99
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,603
OK, but you can call me
Seven-Incher anytime.

100
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:56,146
You think you're funny?

101
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,440
OK, just let me
catch my breath first.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,483
You know what, I don't get you.

103
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,109
Why are you such a flirt?

104
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:05,489
Ouch!

105
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,366
I said I just wanted to breathe first.

106
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,242
You were flirting with
Pearl the other day.

107
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:13,372
Maybe that's why Gav was furious
because you also tried to flirt with Cai.

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,875
Wow. You really think I have
a bad reputation, right?

109
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:20,128
Cai is just a happy crush. Nothing else.

110
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:23,090
And Pearl is really gorgeous.

111
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,467
Can't I giver her a compliment
in a harmless way?

112
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,470
And if I were to flirt with anyone here,

113
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,347
I would admit that someone...

114
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,349
would be you.

115
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,185
And that's because I...

116
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,019
Because?

117
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,564
Maybe because I...

118
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:41,691
I like you.

119
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:42,734
Déjà vu.

120
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,988
What?

121
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,617
I heard those words before.

122
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:53,078
You already told me that and
yet here we are.

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,835
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

124
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,756
I deserve this kind of treatment
because of what I did to you.

125
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:09,177
But don't I deserve a second chance?

126
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,181
OK, but you're not ready
to commit, right?

127
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,436
That's why you have an alter account,
so you can flirt with anyone!

128
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:26,778
I have an alter account because
I can't be my true self in the real world.

129
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,370
You know what I'm talking about.

130
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,374
Alter guys don't expect anything from me.

131
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,881
You know that I don't want
to be a doctor, right?

132
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,257
Yes, I do.

133
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:49,676
But you also don't know
what you want, right?

134
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,344
I know I like you.

135
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:55,599
But I don't get the things that
I like just because I like them.

136
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,478
Everything that I have,
all the things that I do

137
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,688
are the choices of my parents.

138
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,441
And that's because of what?

139
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,359
I have an IQ of over 140?

140
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:10,780
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,241
I didn't know what you're going through.

142
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,243
Don't be.

143
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:20,707
I just realized it when my Mom
kicked me out of our house.

144
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,753
Well, that makes the two of us.

145
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,924
You were kicked out as well?

146
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:34,471
I came out to my Dad.
That's what brought me here.

147
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,391
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:44,481
I just find it funny that
we share the same plight.

149
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,191
We're both miserable.

150
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,321
Yes we are.

151
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,912
You know what my Mom told me?

152
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,792
She said that she
just tolerated me when I came out

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,836
because I have a brain that
could find a cure for cancer.

154
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:13,385
And when I dropped out of their
chosen course, suddenly I'm an abomination.

155
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:20,725
I know those are hurtful words,
but I hope you won't take them seriously.

156
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:25,522
It really hurts because
those were my parents' words.

157
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,569
I also got scared when you said
that you were attracted to me.

158
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:34,281
Because I know if I acted
on my feelings for you,

159
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,616
I'd disappoint my parents.

160
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,746
So what now?

161
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:46,543
I dunno. I just realized that
no matter what I do,

162
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,045
I'll never satisfy them,

163
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,755
just because I'm bisexual.

164
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,090
I can relate to that.

165
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:56,052
Why do we always have to prove ourselves
just because we're not straight?

166
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,723
That's why I'm sorry,
because I'm always angsty.

167
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,433
Chip on our shoulders.

168
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,645
OK, chip on our shoulders,
whatever that means.

169
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,065
Search it on Google, stupid!

170
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:13,403
You call me stupid? So why did
you panic when I said I liked you?

171
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,364
Stop overthinking, OK?

172
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,533
We can take things slowly.

173
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,827
We can take our time
to know each other, right?

174
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,789
Don't worry. I won't ask
you to find a cure for cancer.

175
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,878
I shouldn't have told you that.
You might tease me for it.

176
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,589
No, I'm honored that
you opened up to me.

177
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:45,894
It's Gav.

178
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,313
Let's go back?

179
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:49,022
Let's go back.

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,943
Gav

181
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,819
Yes?

182
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:57,155
Why did you set up for five?

183
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:59,157
Do we have guests for today?

184
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,160
Those are for my boarders, Aunt Susan.

185
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,203
Who are they?

186
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,622
And why are they joining us for lunch?

187
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,708
They're staying here,
and they're my friends, too.

188
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,628
OK.

189
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:16,591
Go ahead.

190
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,760
Thank you.

191
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,054
Here they are.

192
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,474
Good afternoon, ma'am.

193
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:25,934
Good afternoon, ma'am.

194
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,310
Good afternoon.

195
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,103
Hello, ma'am.

196
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,146
This is my Aunt Susan.

197
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,065
- Aunt Susan, meet Terrence and Wesley.
- Hello, ma'am.

198
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,360
- Take a seat and join us.
- Thank you.

199
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,240
So you two are...?

200
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,366
Come again?

201
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,951
How are you related to each other?

202
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,205
We are...

203
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,373
Brothers?

204
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:50,500
Because you kind of look alike.

205
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:52,794
No, we're not.

206
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:54,504
We are...

207
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,214
Friends! And classmates!

208
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:57,674
- Am I right, bro?
- Yes, bro.

209
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:03,096
But you and Gav, you don't look alike.

210
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:08,059
I know, because he's a distant relative.
His mom was my cousin.

211
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,061
But I'm close with them.

212
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:11,896
Oh, that's why.

213
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,149
This is delicious!

214
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:21,906
Had I known that your friends are here,
I would have cooked more.

215
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,283
Wait a minute.

216
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,201
Where is your girlfriend?

217
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:28,413
Hey, easy with the food.

218
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:30,248
Don't swallow too fast.

219
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,086
What's wrong?

220
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,338
Is there something wrong with the food?

221
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,424
Did I put too much pepper?

222
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,427
No, it's delicious.

223
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,596
We just can't have enough of it.

224
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,514
They're just famished.

225
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:47,849
Good to know!

226
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:52,437
As I was saying, where is your girlfriend?
What's her name again?

227
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,855
Oh, Pearl?

228
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,148
It's been a long time since we broke up.

229
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:59,736
I'm sorry to hear that.
That girl is beautiful.

230
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:04,407
That's how it is. But we're best
friends now.

231
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,159
That's good to hear!

232
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,244
Do you know what that means?

233
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,955
There's still a chance for
you two to get back together.

234
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:16,711
When I heard that Gav already
has a girlfriend,

235
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,215
I felt so relieved!

236
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,884
Why?

237
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:28,389
You see, when he was a kid,
he was such a softie.

238
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:31,726
We thought he was going
to grow up gay.

239
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,436
Please have more, Aunt Susan.

240
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:34,938
And what if he grew up as one?

241
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:37,732
What do you mean?

242
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:41,319
If a boy as handsome
as him grew up gay,

243
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,904
it would be a disappointment.

244
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:45,365
I remember telling his grandma,

245
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:48,117
"You know what, it's just a phase."

246
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:52,121
Because Gav grew up with
girls as his playmates.

247
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,291
I was glad to be proven wrong
when he had a girlfriend.

248
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,877
Why would it be a
disappointment if he were gay?

249
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,671
There's nothing wrong with being gay.

250
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,924
I didn't mean it that way.

251
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:07,053
In fact, I have a lot of gay friends
in our church.

252
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,556
They are fun to be with!

253
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:15,061
They're such good performers
in church programs.

254
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:21,734
When I need to get my makeup done,
I run to them for help.

255
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,948
By the way, Gav, where will I sleep?

256
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,420
Are you going to stay the night?

257
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,006
Yes. Just for a couple of days.

258
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,614
Here's your pillow.

259
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:14,245
Why did you have to rent out
your grandma's room?

260
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:19,083
Aren't you earning enough
from your other tenants?

261
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:23,171
They begged me to allow them,
but it's only temporary.

262
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:25,006
They're already looking
for a new apartment.

263
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:26,299
Good.

264
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,845
Have you thought about
your Aunt Myra's request?

265
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,766
She has been convincing
you for so long, Gav.

266
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:37,101
Yes, we've talked about it before.

267
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,437
If it were up to me,

268
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:42,941
I want you to be near your family.

269
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:47,320
I don't know what's
keeping you from leaving.

270
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:53,493
If you are worrying about
who's going to take care of this house

271
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:58,915
and the other apartments,
then I'll take charge.

272
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,210
My son Enzo can help me.

273
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:07,423
I think our apartments
need better supervision.

274
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:14,430
All right.

275
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,951
How's Enzo, by the way?

276
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,621
Does he still see his child from
his ex-girlfriend?

277
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,164
Why do you ask?

278
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,501
Nothing. I just thought about it.

279
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,718
I'll go ahead.

280
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:01,811
Note to self:

281
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,939
Don't apologize for being who you are!

282
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,491
Hey, baby boy! What happened?

283
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,998
Where are you, Cai? I saw your post.

284
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,750
Just getting some fresh air.

285
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,585
Relax, OK?

286
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:28,504
I get you, boss. It's so frustrating.

287
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,465
I don't want to go out of our room

288
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,384
because I feel like
she's watching our every move.

289
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,304
That's what I don't understand.

290
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:39,849
Why does Gav have to
pretend in front of her?

291
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,392
I get where Gav is coming from,

292
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:45,938
but that doesn't mean that I'll allow
his aunt to insult us.

293
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:46,981
Calm down, OK?

294
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,483
Let's just give this one to Gav.

295
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:51,986
But why? I also know the feeling
of being in the closet.

296
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,573
I just didn't expect this kind of
reaction from Gav.

297
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:56,949
Why is he putting up with her?

298
00:17:57,158 --> 00:18:00,787
He was the reason why I came out!

299
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,706
And his aunt is going to stay here for days!

300
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:07,835
I support you and Gav, but I'm not
leaving this room

301
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,545
and I won't eat with you guys

302
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:10,755
while she's here.

303
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,090
You're being supportive by doing that?

304
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:13,508
Yes!

305
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:17,804
I might not be able to control my temper.
That would be a bigger problem.

306
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,722
You have a point.

307
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:27,188
OK.

308
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:31,192
Gav...

309
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,487
We can't sleep together.

310
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,323
But why, baby?

311
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:42,995
Your aunt might see us.

312
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,832
You're right, baby.

313
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,584
Thank you.

314
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:51,963
For doing this for me, baby.

315
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,719
You can always talk to me about it, baby.

316
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:07,145
I don't know why I reacted that way.

317
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,816
It's like I felt something
inside me and I got scared.

318
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,860
What happened, baby?

319
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,367
When I was a kid,

320
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:23,411
Aunt Susan paid us a visit.

321
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,831
She told grandma that
she'd bring me to church.

322
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,708
Grandma said yes.

323
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,169
When we got to the church,
do you know what happened?

324
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:32,378
What?

325
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,589
They prayed over me like
I was possessed by a bad spirit.

326
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,841
- What?!
- I was so young back then.

327
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:42,054
I heard them say that I'd go to hell
just because I'm gay,

328
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,724
and that made me hate myself.

329
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:48,853
I'm sorry, baby.

330
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:52,815
I didn't know you went through that.

331
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:57,695
Baby...

332
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,073
You know what,

333
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:03,826
I thought I was past it.

334
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,457
My grandma showered me with love.

335
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,127
She made me feel that

336
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:14,962
there was nothing wrong with me.

337
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,757
And there's nothing wrong with being gay.

338
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,346
I was happy then.

339
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,686
My grandma allowed me to be who I am.

340
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:39,153
But when I saw Aunt Susan again,

341
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,032
the bad memories came rushing back.

342
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,456
Baby, I'm so sorry.

343
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:55,002
Don't worry.

344
00:20:57,296 --> 00:21:00,258
We'll get rid of your bad memories.

345
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:01,884
All of them...

346
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,223
And then we'll replace them
with happy and gay memories.

347
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:09,934
For real, baby?

348
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,728
Let's start making new memories, baby!

349
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,981
You're being naughty again!

350
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,400
Just kidding, baby.

351
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:26,242
You know what, baby, I realized that

352
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,788
we don't really need to come out to
everyone we meet.

353
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,833
Straight people don't come out, anyway.

354
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:39,171
I mean, yes, I came out to my Mom,

355
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,633
but that's because I wanted to
let her in my life.

356
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,760
That's why I also came out to you.

357
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:55,146
Maybe we should only come out to
the people who matter most in our lives.

358
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,651
That's why Aunt Susan

359
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:10,369
doesn't deserve to know
the real you, OK?

360
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:15,541
She doesn't deserve the privilege of us
coming out to her,

361
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:20,296
because we don't want to let her
in our lives, anyway.

362
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:22,340
Agree, baby.

363
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:27,845
Baby!

364
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:46,215
Stop it!

365
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:57,560
Ouch!

366
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,941
Ouch! Stop it!

367
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,575
Where are your boarders?

368
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,743
Won't they be joining us for dinner?

369
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,663
No, they won't. They ordered take out.

370
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:21,125
Such rich kids!

371
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:25,421
You know what,
I smell something fishy.

372
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:26,839
What do you mean?

373
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:30,009
I think they are not really friends.

374
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,969
I think they are something else.

375
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:35,431
Your food tastes so good, Aunt Susan!
Always a hearty meal!

376
00:24:35,806 --> 00:24:36,682
- Right?
- Really?

377
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,310
I'll give you my recipe.

378
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,394
Yes, please.

379
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:42,354
But don't change the topic.

380
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:45,441
I'm really suspicious of those two.

381
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,235
I think they're doing something
horrifying in their room.

382
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,030
Horrifying?

383
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:51,989
Like...

384
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:53,699
Spirit of the Glass?

385
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:56,869
- Yes! More horrifying than that.
- Horrifying indeed!

386
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:58,829
Charot!

387
00:24:59,038 --> 00:24:59,955
What?

388
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:02,917
What kind of word is that?

389
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:08,589
Stop using that word, Gavreel,
others might think you're-...

390
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,924
What's wrong?

391
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,177
'Charot' only means 'joke.'

392
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,345
It's not a swear word.

393
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:17,264
Just don't use that word.

394
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:19,266
And stop changing the topic!

395
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:23,812
I know those two are doing
something indecent in that room.

396
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:26,524
Well, that's none of our business.

397
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:27,650
Why not?

398
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:30,236
What if they are going disgusting things?

399
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,446
That's too mean.

400
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:36,325
This is your grandma's house.

401
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:40,663
Shouldn't we respect
her memory, Gav?

402
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:44,500
And Gav, please be mindful next time.

403
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,419
Choose your friends wisely,

404
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,256
because you might end up like them!

405
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,007
End up like what?

406
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:54,260
Why do you keep butting in?!

407
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,095
I just like asking questions.

408
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:59,515
- I've noticed that!
- Let's just eat. The food is getting cold.

409
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,059
- Come on, let's eat.
- You know what, Gav,

410
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:05,271
I only say what's best for you.

411
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,856
What if you become gay again?

412
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:10,150
Do you know what would be wise?

413
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,823
I'll take you both to church
and have you talk to Pastor Eddie.

414
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,033
I can't take this anymore.

415
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,785
- Why?
- Please, Cairo...

416
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:20,911
What's happening?

417
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,913
What now, Gav? Are you just
going to tolerate this?

418
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:28,586
She is insulting you and you just want
us to keep quiet?!

419
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:31,046
What are you saying?
I'm not insulting you!

420
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:33,757
I just want to help you!

421
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,385
With all due respect, Aunt Susan,

422
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,513
we don't need your help.
There's nothing wrong with us.

423
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:42,057
Look how rude you are!

424
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:44,602
You have no respect!

425
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,563
I respect those who respect me.

426
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:52,943
I tried to respect you because you're older
than me, and you're Gav's aunt.

427
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:55,738
But I've had enough of your insults.

428
00:26:55,738 --> 00:27:00,117
What's wrong with that?
I only care about Gavreel's welfare!

429
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,661
Gav...

430
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:08,792
If you don't want to be lectured,
then fix yourselves!

431
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:10,210
We're doing just fine.

432
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:12,421
I'm not sure about you.

433
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:17,134
How dare you answer back! You're so rude!

434
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,470
What now, Gav?

435
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:23,182
Are you just doing to let
your friend disrespect me?

436
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,392
He is not my friend!

437
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:26,393
Good for you!

438
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,039
He is my boyfriend.

439
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,089
What did you say?

440
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,383
I said...

441
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,593
he is my boyfriend!

442
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:01,613
I give 2 points to vote
Aunt Susan out of the house.

443
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:03,449
It’s quite obvious, right?

444
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,786
And then 1 point still for Aunt Susan.

445
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:16,253
Hugging you tightly, baby.

446
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,800
(Next On Gameboys 2)

447
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:27,347
Do you want to taste Gav's hotdog?

448
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:29,850
Good morning, babes!

449
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,935
Is that Gav's hotdog?

450
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,145
Gav's hotdog!?

451
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:43,197
Oh my God, Chill!

452
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,239
We have other guests?

453
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:48,494
Pearl, did you set me up?

454
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:50,996
Set up? What are you talking about?

455
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,707
- Achilles! Talk to me, please!
- We don't have anything to talk about.

456
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:56,543
- Gav!
- Baby!
