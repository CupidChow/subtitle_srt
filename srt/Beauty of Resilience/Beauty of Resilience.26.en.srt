00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,370
You came at the right time.

00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,380
Settle an argument for us.

6
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,540
This guy.

7
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,100
He said my cooking was bad.

8
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,260
Why do you mention cooking again?

9
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,220
I was wrong.

10
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,140
I just admitted

11
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,820
that I said something wrong, right?

12
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,820
Yi'er.

13
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,260
Do you think this is an apology?

14
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,340
He just brushed me off.

15
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,820
What?

16
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,100
Why isn't it an apology?

17
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,980
What do you want then?

18
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,380
Well...

19
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,820
What do you want me to do?

20
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Stop! Stop!

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,980
Stop arguing, you two.

22
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,579
Then let me try

23
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,100
what exactly the dish

24
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,100
tastes like.

25
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,380
How is it?

26
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,860
Not that bad?

27
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
It's a bit salty.

28
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,500
But

29
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,420
I can feel

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,340
a strong feeling

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,380
in this dish.

32
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,860
Lan Su,

33
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,820
you must like him a lot.

34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,380
There's

35
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,980
cumin and chili on it

36
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,820
which make it rich and spicy.

37
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,220
It's like

38
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,820
strong love.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,340
Besides,

40
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,940
the kitchen is oily

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,780
and muggy.

42
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,380
A beautiful lady

43
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,820
like Lan Su

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,370
wouldn't cook

45
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,000
if she didn't care about you.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,540
That makes sense.

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,340
I see.

48
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,500

49

I know I was wrong.

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,060
I know I was wrong.

52
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,700
Fine.

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,860
I forgive you.

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,820
You forgive me?

55
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,140
By the way, Yi'er.

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,490
I think

57
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,860
you know much about cooking.

58
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,780
Why don't you teach me how to cook?

59
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,940
Cooking is tiring.

60
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,860
It doesn't suit you.

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,100
It doesn't suit you.

62
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,060
How about this?

63
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,820
What do you want to eat?

64
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,579
Leave it to me.

65
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,540
I'll cook for you.

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,260
Yes, leave it to her.

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,090

68
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,340
in the East Kitchen.

69
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,980
She must

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,260
be very good at it, right?

71
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,980
If she cooks,

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,940
then we don't have to do it.

73
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,660
Leave it to me.

74
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,780

75

76
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,780
Fine.

79
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100

Look at that place.

Go ahead.

123
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,220
To hide the Phoenix scent,

a lot of Linglong hearts here.

127
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,100

If you like it,

132
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,580
I'll ask the Master.

133
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,659
I'm afraid she won't sell it.

134
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,020
I'm really sorry.

135
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,260

137

No.

139
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,659
I don't want it.

140
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,340
The medicinal jade is the first dust

141
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,700
from the beginning of the world.

142
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,140
It absorbed the spiritual energy

143
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,220
and became the beautiful jade.

144
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,900
It can heal all the damages

145
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,460
caused by magic.

146
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,580
However,

147
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,340
the medicinal jade has absorbed

148
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,690
too many bloodshed diseases.

149
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,020
It's quite gloomy.

150
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,020

by slapping you own face.

she really wants it,

164
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,659
will you buy it or not?

165
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,210
Yes.

166
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,220
I'll sell you.

167
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,460
And buy a tassel.

your attainment on the talisman

198
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,340
Only the Heavenly Realm thinks that Phoenix is dead

199
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,860
is the end.

200
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,100
If I don't come,

201
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,100
you will hide this

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,820
in your heart,

203
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,220
and pretend nothing has happened?

204
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,580
The past is gone.

205
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
But now Wei Zhi

206
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,980
is right in front of you.

207
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,340
If you have no feelings for me,

208
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,060
why did you let me go

209
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,700
over and over again?

210
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,820
You think too much.

211
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,820
Maybe I'm not good at cultivating,

212
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
so I don't want the Chixiao Sword

213
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,620
to get more blood on it.

214
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,460
But this makes you think too much.

215
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
I don't believe it.

216
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,340
Do you want to prove it?

217
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,700
Tomorrow,

218
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,580
I will marry the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen.

219
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,940
The Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress

220
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,940
grant it.

221
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,820
Let's talk nicely.

222
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,220
Don't lie to me. Don't scare me.

223
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,860
Fine.

224
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,580
That day, I went to Demon Realm.

225
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,500
The lord of the Demon Clan risked his life

226
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,460
to protect you.

227
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,180
He would rather exchange Huarong

228
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,690
and let me bring it back to Heaven Realm.

229
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,740
In this way,

230
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,620
even if you are the Phoenix,

231
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,460
you can't harm the Three Realms.

232
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,420
God is benevolent.

233
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,060
It's good to keep you alive.

234
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,980
That's why

235
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,860
I didn't kill you.

236
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,580
It's just because God is benevolent.

237
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,100
We've been in the Devil Realm.

238
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,500
You're seriously injured.

239
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,820
The days we were in the cottage...

240
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,460
That was just a quick fix.

241
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,980
Just my means.

242
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,220
You regard delusion

243
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,860
as reality.

244
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,860
But you're the Phoenix.

245
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,300
In my mind,

246
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,700
it's so ridiculous,

247
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,740
miserable

248
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,980
and pathetic.

249
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,320
♫Like a withered leaf in the wind♫

250
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,900
♫No one knows who the farewell is for♫

251
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,990

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,980
You lied to me.

♫Entangled with the comic♫

272
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,570

284
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,420
Yan Yue.

285
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,300
Don't hurt her.

286
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,230
Let's make a deal.

287
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,980
Don't trust him.

288
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,500
What deal?

289
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,340
Give me Huarong,

290
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,020
so that I can report to the Heavenly Realm.

291
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,460
Then,

292
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,530
you retreat into Demon Realm with Wei Zhi

293
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,580
and withdraw from the disputes in the Three Realms.

294
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,380
Why?

295
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,740
Because

296
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,500
I want to save Wei Zhi.

297
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,340

This name

380
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,980
doesn't match him at all.

381
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,780
Miss,

382
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,660
come and take a look.

383
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,380
Come and have a look.

384
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Go away. We don't want to see it.

385
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,540
Miss, take a look.

386
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
It’s free to see.

387
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,220
I have all the nice things

388
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,700
from the Heaven Realm and Demon Realm.

389
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,860
Yan...

390
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,460
Numb Guy made it.

391
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,980
I can recognize it at a glance.

392
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,460
You have a unique taste.

393
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,730
Of course.

394
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,980
Thank you, Miss.

395
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,980
Your spiritual power of 5 years

396
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,970
is equivalent to

397
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,780
my cultivation for 300 years.

398
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm rich!

399
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,620
This must be Wei Zhi.

400
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,940
Lan Su.

401
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,140
Do you think

402
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,540
Yan Yue

403
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,980
love Wei Zhi?

404
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,620
I don't know.

405
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,180
It's said that he has no feelings to anyone,

406
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,730
but even if

407
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,900
he had true feelings in the past.

408
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,180
In the end,

409
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,060
he killed the Phoenix

410
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,300
with his own hands.

411
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,380
If he didn't fall in love,

412
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,380
why did I see love

413
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,980
on this puppet?

414
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,690
you can see love

415
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,740
on wood?

416
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,700
Yi'er,

417
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,850
don't coax me.

418
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,020
Of course not.

419
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,900
Just like when I cook,

420
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,700
if I don't put my love

421
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,620
into the food,

422
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,220
then the dishes

423
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,220
will be less tasty.

424
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,060
Cooking is like this.

425
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,980
I believe

426
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,220
any craftsmanship

427
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,700
is the same.

428
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,220
Right?

429
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,650
It does make sense.

430
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,860
But I can't tell

431
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,620
what love

432
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,380
is on this wood.

433
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,460
Or we devils don't understand.

434
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,900
It's too complicated.

435
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,020
Love

436
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,540
is complicated.

437
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,260
Lan Su.

438
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,740
let me ask you.

439
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,700
What is love

440
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,060
for Devil Clan?

441
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,540
The love in the Devil Realm

442
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,380
is very simple.

443
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,460
For example,

444
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,060
If I love someone,

445
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,780
when he's in danger,

446
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,260
I will show up

447
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,380
in front of him no matter what,

448
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,170
or even sacrifice my life

449
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,010
for him.

450
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,780
But the demon clan

451
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,540
has such a long lifespan.

452
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,540
Could it be that

453
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,020
you can sacrifice your lives

454
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,300
for the so-called love?

455
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,780
Why not?

456
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,780
Having a good life is more important

457
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,540
than living long.

458
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,220
But in the Heavenly Realm,

459
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,300
our elders have taught us

460
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,660
that immortality is the most important.

461
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,260
Although the immortals in Heaven Realm

462
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,540
may live long,

463
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,940
there will be

464
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,980
various tribulations.

465
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,060
Among them,

466
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,220
love tribulation is the scariest.

467
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,020
So,

468
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,420
the immortals

469
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,220
regard love

470
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,260
as monster.

471
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
But,

472
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,500
in the Demon Realm

473
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,260
and in the Devil Realm,

474
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
everything I see and hear tells me

475
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,180
that love is precious in the world.

476
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,700
So,

477
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,620
who is right

478
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,060
and who is wrong?

479
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,700
Love,

480
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,740
you need to

481
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,020
try it yourself.

482
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,740
Otherwise,

483
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,860
you'll never know if it's right or wrong.

484
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,020
It seems that

485
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,380
you have a crush on someone.

486
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
Let me guess

487
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,940
who is it?

488
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,140
I'll ask him

489
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
to do a puppet for you.

490
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,300
Lan Su.

491
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,900
Tell me. Who is it?

492
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,940
No one.

493
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
There must be someone.

494
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,420
Huarong was taken away.

495
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,780
I'm no longer a complete Phoenix.

496
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,740
But you are still

497
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,140
the Saintess of our Demon Clan.

498
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,420
What happened to your face?

499
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,220
Nothing.

500
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,740
I'm just h...

501
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,980
happy.

502
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,140
All these years,

503
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,060
I've never been

504
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,220
so happy.

505
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,660
Look.

506
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
I even forgot

507
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,220
how to smile.

508
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,300
You've suffered for so many years.

509
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,540
I'm fine now.

510
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,940
You have to be well too.

511
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,940
Sister.

512
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,740
Welcome home.

513
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,540
From now on,

514
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,780
Wei Zhi will be the Saintess of Demon Realm

515
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,460
and share the dignity with me.

516
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,020
Greetings, Saintess.

517
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,490
Are you alright?

518
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,060
Take care of the people as soon as possible.

519
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,940
Go.

520
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,460
Ming Lang.

521
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,460
Go ahead.

522
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,300
Yes.

523
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,530
Dean.

524
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,370
OK.

525
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,220
Can you hold on?

526
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
We guard with the city.

527
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,860
It's not that easy

528
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
to take us down.

529
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,100
We has ways to resist

530
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,860
the Imperial Advisor's army.

531
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,740
I’m worried about your classmate.

532
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,460
Wei Lingyue.

533
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,220
Her original form is peacock.

534
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,900
She is very powerful.

535
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,700
I can't fight against her.

536
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,220
Dean.

537
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,780
When we

538
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,940
can't resist,

539
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,140
I will send someone

540
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,850
to escort you and the students out.

541
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,180
Silly boy.

542
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,140
Since we're here,

543
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,460
we will stand together.

544
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,700
Right.

545
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,740
Be careful.

546
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,220
Wei Zhi.

547
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,780
After I destroy Gu City,

548
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,540
I don't believe you won't show up.

549
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,220
Mu Nan.

550
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,780
Sister.

551
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,620
I've left the mortal world for a long time.

552
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,260
I guess my mother and brother

553
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
are very concerned.

554
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,780
I want to contact them

555
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,700
and tell them I'm safe.

556
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,780
You are the Phoenix.

557
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,540
Actually you can try

558
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,620
to control the birds

559
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,500
to send you a letter.

560
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,060
Of course.

561
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,010
You're the Saintess of Demon Realm now.

562
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,300
You can do

563
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
whatever you want.

564
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,260
Will the Heavenly Realm find out?

565
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,140
It doesn’t matter

566
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,180
if they don't see you.

567
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,020
Mortals

568
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,660
fear the demons and devils,

569
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,940
but worship immortals.

570
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,620
Actually,

571
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,860
we have never regarded the Mortal Realm

572
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,900
as the target of invasion and attack.

573
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,980
The Heavenly Realm,

574
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,180
unless it involves their interests.

575
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Otherwise,

576
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,940
they wouldn't care about

577
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,380
the rise and fall of the human world.

578
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,940
How about this, sister?

579
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,980
I'll send someone to check

580
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,620
before you leave.

581
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,050
Be gentle.

582
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,700
Ming Lang.

583
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,020
Auntie.

584
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:11,810
[Yu]

585
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,210
I can't help much.

586
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,460
I made some rice cakes

587
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
for you.

588
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,980
Here, auntie.

589
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,300
Here.

590
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,260
Don't say that.

591
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,540
Delicious.

592
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,740
The rice cakes you made is amazing.

593
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,120
[Yu]

594
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,060
Here.

595
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,020
Divide them.

596
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,140
Okay. Here.

597
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,220
Isn't Dean here?

598
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,660
He went to the academy

599
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,220
to teach students in the city.

600
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,420
He said

601
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,460
a scholar can't leave his books for one day.

602
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,700
You want to see him?

603
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,220
It's nothing.

604
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,700
I just want to know

605
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,500
some news about Wei Zhi.

606
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,220
We don't have any news about her either.

607
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,060
But she should be safe.

608
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Don't worry.

609
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,860
Auntie.

610
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,740
Can Gu City

611
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,700
be guarded?

612
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,500
Of course.

613
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,170
What does the tactics book say?

614
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,660
how can you win

615
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,780
if it's unjustify?

616
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,780
You're right.

617
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,740
The people of Gu City

618
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,780
gave us the confidence to guard here.

619
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,060
If we retreat,

620
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,140
it means we give up on them

621
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,460
and our home.

622
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,420
Besides,

623
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,740
you are here.

624
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,460
So many people are with us.

625
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,900
We can't be shaken.

626
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,500
Yes. Don't shake.

627
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,980
Don't shake. Don't shake.

628
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Don't move back.

629
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,780
Don't shake. Don't shake.

630
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,260
Don't shake.

631
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,740
Don't move back.

632
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,140
Don't move back. Don't move back.

633
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,690
It's only been a few days.

634
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
the spiritual power of Saintess

635
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,210
has increased several times.

636
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,900
The Phoenix really deserves her reputation.

637
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,860
It seems that the war to the Heavenly Court

638
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,930
will soon come.

639
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,540
My Lord.

640
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,700
What is it?

641
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,660
Lord Imperial Advisor has sent troops to Gu City.

642
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,740
Gu City is

643
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,700
in critical condition.

644
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,740
I want to go back to Gu City.

645
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
My Lord, Saintess.

646
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,940
Don't worry.

647
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,060
It's just the army of

648
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,540
the Lord Imperial Advisor of Human Realm.

649
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,980
Sent me there,

650
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,900
and I'll turn them into ashes in a minute.

651
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,460
Don't scare elders

652
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,180
with your face.

653
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,860
You go.

654
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,140
You two should rest.

655
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,620
How about I go?

656
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
You Demon Guardians,

657
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,980
it's inappropriate for you

658
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,860
to get involved in the mortal matter.

659
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,460
I grew up in Gu City.

660
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,420
I'm most familiar with that place.

661
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,940
It's easy to hide.

662
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Besides,

663
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,740
my family and friends are there.

664
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,940
Now my hometown is in danger.

665
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,300
Only me can go.

666
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,860
And I have to go.

667
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,460
But there is a war there.

668
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,980
If you go alone,

669
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,460
it's dangerous.

670
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,500
I can do what

671
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,860
Se Ning did.

672
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,900
Saintess’s magic power

673
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,220
is far above us.

674
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,540
A mere human army

675
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,940
is no big deal.

676
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
But the only thing we need to worry about is

677
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,540
that we can’t let people from

678
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,780
the Heavenly Realm know about this.

679
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,460
That's why we can't make it public.

680
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,020
I will hide my trace

681
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,780
and go back.

682
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,530
I want propose a toast

683
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,210
to Wangyue,

684
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,740
it's not only because

685
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,460
you are my daughter,

686
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,620
but you are also a brave warrior

687
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
in Weicang Army.

688
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,620
Commander! Commander! Commander!

689
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,940
What?

690
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,020
You have no confidence in me?

691
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,980
No, no.

692
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,780
My Lord.

693
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,020
My Lord.

694
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,540
The will of the Saintess

695
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,840
is the will of Demon Realm.

696
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,500
From now on,

697
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,540
we'll follow Saintess.

698
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,480
[Gu City]

699
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,620
It's me.

700
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,940
Wei Zhi.

701
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,450
Auntie

702
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,020
lives in this mansion.

703
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,140
Since that day

704
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,300
we escaped from the capital,

705
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,700
everyone is asking about

706
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,540
Where you are.

707
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,300
But no one knows

708
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,660
where you went,

709
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,780
and what happened.

710
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,460
I didn't expect

711
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,700
you to appear today.

712
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,980
I didn't expect

713
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,260
that the Gu family and the Ming family

714
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,620
are far away from trouble.

715
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,380
But the Imperial Advisor still won’t

716
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,380
let you and me go.

717
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,940
If I were a little late today,

718
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,460
I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.

719
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,980
Actually,

720
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,780
the one won't let us go

721
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,140
is Wei Lingyue.

722
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,220
By the way,

723
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,140
Dean and the students are here too.

724
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,700
They're here too.

725
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,420
You should reunite with your family first.

726
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,260
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

727
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,980
Go.

728
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,620
Sister.

729
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,140
You're back.

730
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,940
Mother.

731
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,420
I'm back.

732
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,500
You still know to come back?

733
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,180
You've been gone for so long

734
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,620
without any news.

735
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,260
Why do you come back?

736
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,940
What are you doing?

737
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,210
-Why do you come back.
-Mother,

738
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,980
stop hitting her!

739
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,980
-Mother!
-Why do you come back?

740
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,460
Do you know why the Imperial Advisor

741
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,980
wants to attack Gu City?

742
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,020
He just wants to catch you.

743
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,180
At this time,

744
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,460
you barged in.

745
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,940
You want to die?

746
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,220
I'd rather kill you.

747
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,140
Mother.

748
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,500
Mother!

749
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,820
Mother.

750
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,500
I've dragged you down.

751
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,100
These days,

752
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,620
we both sides have casualties.

753
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,940
But it seems that they are not ready

754
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,260
to launch the main attack.

755
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,060
Maybe

756
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,980
they don't have enough supplies.

757
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,780
I don't think so.

758
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,420
The longer we are trapped,

759
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,980
the less grains and daily supplies

760
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,900
we have.

761
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,860
Once the people are in turmoil,

762
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,580
we'll have to abandon the city.

763
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,940
Without a base,

764
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,820
we'll

765
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,420
be slaughtered.

766
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,060
I think

767
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,420
this is their idea.

768
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,260
Make us

769
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,060
in chaos.

770
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,179
Wei Zhi.

771
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,300
When did you learn the art of war?

772
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,060
People will change since we haven't seen

773
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,180
each other for a long time.

774
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,260
Well,

775
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,980
In your opinion,

776
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
how should we defeat the enemy?

777
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,020
Instead of guarding the city,

778
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,460
we should start an attack.

779
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
If they don't want to fight,

780
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,860
we force them to fight.

781
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
But the enemy is outnumbered.

782
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,180
We have less soldiers.

783
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,980
As the saying goes,

784
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,660
catch the leader first.

785
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,180
Bad news.

786
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,540
Dean, Ming Lang.

787
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,020
The Imperial Advisor has attacked the city.

788
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,780
What?

789
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,750
[Gu City]

790
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,710
[Yu]

791
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,260
Dean.

792
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,890
Ming.

793
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,540
At this point,

794
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,380
why don't you open the door and surrender?

795
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,780
You can protect

796
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,460
the lives of the people in the city.

797
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,830
[Yu]

798
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,460
You didn't listen to

799
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
my advice,

800
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,740
but kept resisting.

801
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,460
Why bother?

802
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:24,820
[Gu City]

803
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,740
Imperial Advisor.

804
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,420
You killed the whole family of Gu

805
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,060
and Lord Ming.

806
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,620
The you killed many people in Wei City.

807
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,180
Everything you did

808
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,860
was conspued

809
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,420
by the officials

810
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,120
[Yu]

811
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,980
and the people.

812
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,050
Now,

813
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,420
you're attacking Gu City.

814
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,340
[Gu City]

815
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,940
Aren't you afraid

816
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,500
that you will be cursed forever?

817
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,980
Dean.

818
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,980
Stop lecturing me.

819
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,300
The authority to write history

820
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,180
belongs to the winner,

821
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,300
not you losers.

822
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,460
This is a battlefield,

823
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,980
not Egret Academy.

824
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,540
Even if you are a saint,

825
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,900
you can't stop

826
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,140
the war.

827
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,820
[Gu City]

828
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,620
Scholar is useless.

829
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,100
Benevolence and morality

830
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,140
can't protect the rebels behind you

831
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,020
or my army.

832
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,590
[Yu]

833
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,860
Only by doing my best,

834
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,660
it can be called benevolent.

835
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,820
You don't understand.

836
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
What you said

837
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,140
is destrying the country.

838
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,660
The real trend

839
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:29,480
[Gu City]

840
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,660
is what the people want.

841
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,580
You don't understan either.

842
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,660
You're harming yourself.

843
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,020
Ming Lang.

844
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,780
Are you still not giving up?

845
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,960
[Gu City]

846
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,380
You knew it.

847
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,180
My purpose

848
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,420
is not your Ming family.

849
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,180
Fight for irrelevant people.

850
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,620
Is it worth it?

851
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,940
My father

852
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,900
couldn't rest in peace.

853
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,580
Lord Imperial Advisor

854
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,340
didn’t mean to kill your father.

855
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,420
You are a smart man.

856
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,380
We are classmates.

857
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,140
Come to our side.

858
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,260
Hand over the remnants of the Gu family.

859
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,320
Gu City will still be yours.

860
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,140
Not only Gu City,

861
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,950
the future will also be ours.

862
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,740
[Gu City]

863
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,140
Look at you now.

864
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,890
If Minister Wei knows about this,

865
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,980
he'll be very disappointed.

866
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,340
Stop talking about

867
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,380
the friendship between us.

868
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,540
Today,

869
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,450
our friendship is over.

870
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
OK.

871
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,290
Let's fight then.

872
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,300
Let's see how much you've improved recently.
