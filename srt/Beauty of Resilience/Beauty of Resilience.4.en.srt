[Episode 4]

4
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,770
Where are the flowers?

5
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,350
Where are the flowers?

6
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,990
Like this.

7
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,020
And turn around.

8
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,860
Like this?

9
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,410
How did you practice it?

10
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,300
Practice on your own.

11
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,340
Brother Ming Lang.

12
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,340
Brother Ming Lang.

13
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,280
Brother Ming Lang.

14
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,140
The red flower you made for Lingyue

15
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,579
is so beautiful.

16
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,200
Can you make one for me?

17
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,579
Okay, let me give it a try.

18
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,680
Here.

19
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,270
-Awesome! -I made it!

20
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,550
I practiced telekinesis.

21
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,380
It's not easy.

22
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,220
Give it back to me.

23
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,060
Come and get it.

24
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,820
Come on.

25
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,510
Stop!

26
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,970
Bao Liang.

27
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,220
-Come on, chase me. -Stop.

28
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,540
Give me the flower!

29
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,060
Faster!

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,510
Give it back!

31
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,100
Give me the flower.

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,710
Who are you?

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,690
I

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,930
came to give you the flower.

35
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,990
What a big rose!

36
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,260
This is even prettier

37
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,190
than the one

38
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,010
Ming gave to Lingyue.

39
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,020
Of course.

40
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,450
This is the prettiest flower

41
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,720
in this academy.

42
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,540
It's the only one.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Really?

44
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,510
The pretty flower

45
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,070
should be given to a pretty girl.

46
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,860
Take it.

47
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,540
How is it?

48
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,970
Its smell...

49
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,950
Why does it smell like rouge?

50
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,700
What?

51
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,420
I said this jasmine

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,470
smells good.

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
But this is a rose.

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,350
They are the same.

55
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,430
They are all ordinary.

56
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,050
Bye.

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,900
Thank you.

58
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,910
Give it to me.

59
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,220
No.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,670
Give it to me.

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,120
Give it to me.

62
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,040
Look.

63
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,900
Give it back to me.

64
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,370
Give it back to me.

65
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Give it to me.

66
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,900
He is such a liar.

67
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,090
Disgusting.

68
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,260
I hate him.

69
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,530
This is for me.

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,409
Good for you.

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,180
Aren't you afraid of being caught by seniors?

72
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,909
Come on. Have a seat.

73
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,580
Have a seat.

74
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,430
We need to ask you

75
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,380
to teach us some skills later.

76
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,220
I'm not qualified

77
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
to do that.

78
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,460
Of all the students

79
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,840
who come to the academy with us,

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,900
Wei Lingyue is the only one

81
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,920
who can teach others skills.

82
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,050
I don't think so.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,310
She might be better than us now.

84
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,220
But we will make progress.

85
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,630
Besides,

86
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,340
who says

87
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,400
the Phoenix must be a female?

88
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,900
Right. Can't it be a male Phoenix?

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,340
Yes.

90
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,840
Ming Lang.

91
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
I think you may be the  Phoenix.

92
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,930
I agree with him.

93
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,220
Any one of us eighteen men

94
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,580
might be the Phoenix.

95
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,960
Bao Liang, it might be you.

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,510
Probably.

97
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,380
Maybe it's me.

98
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,490
A fat phoenix.

99
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,409
You guys

100
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,890
are having a good time here.

101
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,900
Senior.

102
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,810
No need to do this.

103
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,450
Sit down.

104
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,780
Let the senior have a seat first.

105
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,340
Senior, have a seat.

106
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,220
Senior, have a seat.

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,590
You too.

108
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,810
Okay.

109
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,350
It smells good.

110
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,220
You already have something to eat.

111
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,409
Don't you want to drink something?

112
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,220
Well...

113
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,590
I knew you don't have it.

114
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,680
I've brought something nice.

115
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,820
Open and smell it.

116
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,060
This...

117
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,230
Good wine.

118
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,340
Right?

119
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,180
Good wine.

120
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,700
Of course.

121
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,540
If not,

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,100
how can it make you faint so quickly?

123
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,130
The smell of officials.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,540
It's a nasty smell.

125
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,590
A bookworm's smell.

126
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,820
The smell of coppers.

127
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,710
He hasn't taken a shower for a long time.

128
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,650
They are all mortals.

129
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,030
So frustrating.

130
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,110
Miss.

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,860
Please take it.

132
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,220
I've already

133
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,460
seen through your disguise.

134
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,980
I once met humans

135
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,010
disguised as wolves.

136
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,510
But you are the first wolf

137
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,380
disguised as a human.

138
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,380
You can see my tail?

139
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,640
Not only your tail.

140
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,790
Your long ears,

141
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,460
sharp teeth,

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,940
and...

143
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,300
And...

144
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,750
You can really see them.

145
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,850
I don't know how you got in.

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,460
You seem

147
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,820
to be a powerful devil.

148
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,460
However,

149
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,240
no matter how powerful you are,

150
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,590
you shouldn't stay here.

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,600
What are you doing?

152
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,420
It doesn't smell right.

153
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,940
You are so gifted.

154
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,080
How come you are a mortal?

155
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,570
I should warn you,

156
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,500
if you do this again,

157
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,620
I'll get you punished.

158
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,000
I got it.

159
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,809
You have ancestry of devils.

160
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,110
Nonsense.

161
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,580
My parents are humans.

162
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
It's impossible that I'm a devil.

163
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,290
Go away.

164
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,220
It's not that.

165
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,760
Your parents are humans,

166
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,190
but maybe one of your ancestors

167
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,300
was married to a devil.

168
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,410
This explains why you saw through my disguise.

169
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,890
That's so strange.

170
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,180
How could a human be married to a devil?

171
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,650
Legend has it

172
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,070
that in ancient times, men and gods lived together

173
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,820
and could not be distinguished.

174
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,340
It means

175
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,220
that in ancient times,

176
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
humans, devils,

177
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,180
and evil spirits

178
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,790
all live together.

179
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,340
You mortals

180
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,740
find this shocking.

181
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,440
But you should be more open-minded.

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,370
This is actually

183
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,250
quite normal.

184
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,830
I can see evil spirits since I was a child

185
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,690
because one of my ancestors was a devil?

186
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,890
Maybe

187
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,180
our ancestors were family

188
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,750
five thousand years ago.

189
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,880
What?

190
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,400
Even if it is true,

191
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,080
I should warn you,

192
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,290
leave here right now.

193
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,380
Don't look back.

194
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,170
Our Master

195
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,820
is Penglai Immortal Envoy.

196
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,980
Miss.

197
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,820
So you care about me.

198
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,370
I'm so touched.

199
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,740
How about this?

200
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,980
After I

201
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,740
finish my job,

202
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,410
you and I

203
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,920
go back to Devil Realm.

204
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,540
Let's be a couple.

205
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,910
I've wasted my time talking to you.

206
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,090
If you don't believe what I said,

207
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,820
that's fine.

208
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,150
I've already warned you.

209
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,090
Penglai Immortal Envoy?

210
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,350
But he's a High Immortal.

211
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,510
He's much more powerful than Penglai Immortal Envoy.

212
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,810
I'd better avoid him.

213
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,150
What's that smell?

214
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,300
The smell of birds.

215
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,300
Why is there a smell of birds?

216
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,260
It's the smell of the Phoenix.

217
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,810
Well, not really.

218
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,460
It smells

219
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,070
more like a pheasant than the Phoenix.

220
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,940
Why can't I remember

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,230
this smell?

222
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,180
Poor memory.

223
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,270
[Arbor Residence]

224
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,250
[Xinju Hall]

225
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,660
Let's have a short review.

226
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:57,690
Wei Zhi.

227
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,170
Practice "Make something out of nothing".

228
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,220
Everything comes from something.

229
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,060
Something comes from nothing.

230
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,580
The origin of something

231
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,900
is nothing.

232
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,820
Sit down.

233
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,990
Next.

234
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,460
Let me do it.

235
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,430
Everything comes from something. Something comes from nothing.

236
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,340
Show!

237
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,230
This...

238
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,700
Next.

239
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,480
I'll do it.

240
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,180
Look.

241
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,540
What is that?

242
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,820
Is it really a phoenix feather?

243
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,290
Everyone,

244
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
this is

245
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,810
a real phoenix feather.

246
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,450
Phoenix feather?

247
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:43,860
Is she

248
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,570
really the Phoenix?

249
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,750
Amazing!

250
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,230
Phoenix.

251
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,760
What's going on?

252
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,740
Wei Zhi, are you crazy?

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,880
Let go of my sister!

254
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,760
Wei Zhi, what are you doing?

255
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,820
Stop, Wei Zhi!

256
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,740
Stop!

257
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
Stop! Stop!

258
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,820
Wei Zhi.

259
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,210
Let go!

260
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,820
Let go, Wei Zhi!

261
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,500
What should we do?

262
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,460
Let go!

263
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,980
Let go! Let go!

264
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,860
Sister!

265
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,460
Wei Zhi!

266
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,260
Wei Zhi, let go!

267
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,340
Let go of her!

268
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Let go of her!

269
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,220
Let go!

270
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,329
My Lord.

271
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,540
Are you alright?

272
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,920
It's the Sun Devour Body magic.

273
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,869
It is the most sophisticated magic in Heaven Realm.

274
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,980
It seems

275
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,660
I need to pay a visit

276
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,630
to Penglai Immortal Envoy.

277
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,520
My Lord,

278
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,660
don't be impulsive.

279
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
The power of Huarong is weak now.

280
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,600
If we do something rash,

281
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,110
we'll be in danger.

282
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,690
The Phoenix

283
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,270
will be mine.

284
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,660
Lingyue, are you alright?

285
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,030
Sister.

286
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,880
Lingyue.

287
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,430
Be careful.

288
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,460
Sister.

289
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:03,920
Everyone,

290
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,190
go back to your room.

291
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,950
Without my consent,

292
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,780
no one can go out.

293
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,180
Okay.

294
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,700
Sister.

295
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,220
Master.

296
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,780
Please take a look at Lady Lingyue.

297
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,810
Sister.

298
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,900
Sister.

299
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,090
Sister. Sister.

300
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,860
Wei Lingyue is fine.

301
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,360
Take her back

302
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,690
and let her have a good rest.

303
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,510
Okay.

304
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,700
Thank you, Master.

305
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,030
-Okay. -Come on.

306
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,830
Master.

307
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:12,500
Wei Zhi.

308
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,860
Close your eyes.

309
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,860
Here.

310
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,090
Thank you, Ming.

311
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,840
Let me do it.

312
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,510
Ming.

313
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,260
I'll take care of her.

314
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,370
Don't worry.

315
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,380
You can go back now.

316
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,980
Okay.

317
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,550
I'll be at the door.

318
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,620
Call me if you need any help.

319
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,120
Ming.

320
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,700
Master said

321
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,950
my sister is fine now.

322
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,380
Okay.

323
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,880
I...

324
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,790
I'll leave right now.

325
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,900
So much trouble every day.

326
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,350
Get up. Divine Lord is here.

327
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,760
Greetings, God of Red Sun.

328
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,130
Bad news.

329
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,060
I've been

330
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,510
standing here

331
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,590
for thousands of years.

332
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,940
This is only the second time

333
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,290
I've seen the primordial spirit of the God of Red Sun.

334
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,550
The last time I saw it, he went

335
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,100
to Human Realm to undergo his romantic hardship.

336
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,040
Somehow, the war

337
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,070
between Heaven Realm and Demon Realm broke out.

338
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,540
A romantic hardship?

339
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,450
Yes.

340
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,830
It is said

341
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,700
that he had an ill-fated romance.

342
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,040
The war was so bloody.

343
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,500
Though Divine Lord's primordial spirit returned,

344
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,480
his body was badly hurt.

345
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,940
It took thousands of years

346
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,990
for his spirit and body to be recombined.

347
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,960
I don't know

348
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,860
what will happen this time.

349
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,420
Heavenly Emperor.

350
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,460
Divine Lord hasn't been here

351
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,560
for hundreds of years.

352
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,810
The signs of the Phoenix just showed.

353
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't know

354
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,760
why Yan Yue

355
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,850
should be like this.

356
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,660
Is it because he...

357
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,020
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,060
There is something

359
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,840
I've always wanted to know.

360
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,660
Since the matter about the Phoenix

361
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,610
is so important

362
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,390
and so tricky,

363
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,520
why don't you just send troops to handle it?

364
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,340
Why not ask Divine Lord to come back

365
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,680
and let other High Immortals deal with it?

366
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,950
In the three realms,

367
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,670
all beings have their own destiny.

368
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,910
Even High Immortals and divine creatures

369
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,960
are no exception.

370
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,310
The fates of God of Red Sun and the Phoenix

371
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,710
are entangled now because of karma.

372
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,440
It's hard for them to get rid of it.

373
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,230
Sister, you're awake.

374
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,430
Great. You're awake.

375
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,500
How are you?

376
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,730
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

377
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,380
Careful.

378
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,020
Let me do it.

379
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
Are you okay?

380
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,170
Where is Master?

381
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,930
He's not here.

382
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,260
I am so angry because of him.

383
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,700
Wei Zhi is such a bitch.

384
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,460
She went crazy

385
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
and hurt you.

386
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,690
I really don't know

387
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,100
what Master was thinking.

388
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,620
He didn't

389
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,460
get her punished.

390
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,320
He even

391
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,980
healed her wounds.

392
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,130
I got angry when I knew this.

393
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,450
Sister.

394
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,670
What's wrong?

395
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,300
Still comfortable?

396
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,950
Jingyue.

397
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,010
My throat is sore.

398
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,930
Get me some water.

399
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,290
Okay.

400
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,550
Wait a minute.

401
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,520
Okay.

402
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,250
Wei Zhi.

403
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,610
It's you again.

404
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,330
Master.

405
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,600
Master.

406
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,440
Master.

407
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,430
Master.

408
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,900
Master.

409
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,690
Master.

410
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,670
Master, wake up!

411
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,870
Master!

412
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,650
♫Like a withered leaf in the wind♫

413
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,390
♫No one knows who the farewell is for♫

414
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,580
♫Your words made me heartbroken♫

415
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,960
♫The image of the previous life is in the mirror♫

416
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,560
♫At sunset, I slept with candles lit on♫

417
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,930
♫But I can never stop missing you♫

418
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,760
♫Forever♫

419
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,060
♫I can still remember your eyebrows♫

420
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,170
Master!

421
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,310
♫Our fates remain unchanged♫

422
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,250
♫Our love stories♫

423
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,710
♫Were repeated again and again♫

424
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,590
♫It's like nirvana♫

425
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,100
♫Why give up immortality for love♫

426
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,840
♫May our vows be there forever♫

427
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,210
So you're still alive.

428
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,710
♫You made twelve attics and five cities disappear♫

429
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,440
I should leave now.

430
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,360
♫We are now in the dream of love♫

431
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,560
Was Wei Zhi really possessed by a demon?

432
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,810
Of course.

433
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,140
She even attacked Wei Lingyue.

434
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,860
If she hadn't been possessed by the demon,

435
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,550
she wouldn't have been able to do that.

436
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,950
So why

437
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
does the demon

438
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,120
hate Wei Lingyue so much?

439
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,460
The demon

440
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,980
attacked Wei Lingyue

441
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,220
because she is really the Phoenix?

442
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,520
Isn't this obvious?

443
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,220
My sister

444
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,540
is the Phoenix for sure.

445
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,020
Really?

446
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,700
No way.

447
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,460
I know.

448
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,540
It should be true.

449
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,320
Let's go.

450
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,820
[Jinx. Silly Pig.]

451
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,840
What do you want?

452
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,180
Master was hurt because of you

453
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,460
and you almost killed my sister.

454
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,780
How dare you

455
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,540
still be here?

456
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,700
Are you

457
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,200
going to kill us all?

458
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,060
That's right.

459
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,180
I'm not.

460
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,600
Come on.

461
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,300
Call your demon friends

462
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,300
and ask them to attack us.

463
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,290
Stop!

464
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,800
What do you want?

465
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,210
This...

466
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,400
How dare you push me!

467
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,980
You jinx!

468
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,660
I'll kill you today!

469
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,980
Sister.

470
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,140
Today I have to

471
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,900
teach her a lesson.

472
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,760
Forget it.

473
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,700
Wei Zhi didn't do it on purpose.

474
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,810
She was possessed by the demon.

475
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,910
How should I blame her?

476
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,720
Lady Lingyue,

477
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,180
I'm really sorry.

478
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,970
Shut up.

479
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,460
Sister.

480
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,780
You are being too nice.

481
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,540
At this time,

482
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,700
how can you forgive her?

483
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,020
There are so many people in the academy.

484
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,860
Why was only she

485
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,020
possessed by the demon?

486
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,710
It makes sense.

487
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,980
Are you okay?

488
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,560
Do you want to have a rest?

489
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,740
Let me help you.

490
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,670
Everyone, attention.

491
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,010
Wei Zhi

492
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,000
has been acting weird since childhood.

493
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,020
Whoever gets close to her will be unlucky.

494
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,490
In the past,

495
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,260
we thought

496
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,580
she has some sort of mental disease.

497
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,830
But now

498
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,500
I believe

499
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,580
she's a born jinx.

500
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,610
In my opinion,

501
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,390
she has long been

502
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,370
bewitched by the demon.

503
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,180
So let me warn you,

504
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
if you do not want to die,

505
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,580
you must stay away from her.

506
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,220
Why was only she

507
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,980
possessed by the demon

508
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,700
Right.

509
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,740
She's a jinx for sure.

510
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,220
What Jingyue said might be true.

511
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,420
Whether she's a demon or not,

512
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,380
we'd better stay away from her.

513
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,460
Stay away from her.

514
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,460
Yes.

515
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,730
Grandpa!

516
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,340
Mother, don't hit Sister.

517
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,020
Why did you stop me?

518
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
It is because of her

519
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,970
that your father and grandpa died

520
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,340
before you were born.

521
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,190
Because of her,

522
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,680
we have such a miserable life.

523
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,460
Did Grandpa

524
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,980
and Dad lose their lives

525
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,070
because of me?

526
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,000
Master.

527
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,650
Do you really believe

528
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,190
you as mortals

529
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,460
can withstand

530
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,360
the demons' magic?

531
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,000
You

532
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,040
dare to give it a try?

533
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,500
Wei Zhi now

534
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,690
has no demon aura in her at all.

535
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,320
She's like any of you.

536
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,870
She is mortal.

537
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,230
The demons caused such big trouble this time.

538
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,070
We are all victims.

539
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,000
Wei Zhi is no exception.

540
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,070
From now on,

541
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,470
you need to,

542
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,020
first,

543
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,140
be united.

544
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,690
Don't bully others.

545
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,860
When you go out, go with your friends.

546
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,480
Second,

547
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,930
remain alert.

548
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,780
Report to me

549
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,570
if you find anything suspicious.

550
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,390
Okay.

551
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,870
Okay.

552
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,620
Let's take a day off.

553
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,900
Wei Lingyue,

554
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,270
come with me.

555
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,290
Wei Lingyue,

556
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,900
from today,

557
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,630
you will not live in your dorm.

558
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,010
You'll be living here.

559
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,250
This is...

560
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,500
This barrier

561
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,639
allows mortals in

562
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,820
but prevents demons from being here.

563
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,389
You are safer here.

564
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:37,900
Master.

565
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,730
Am I the only person living here?

566
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,620
You need special protection now.

567
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,250
Thank you, Master.

568
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,290
Master.

569
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,489
Why did the demon attack me?

570
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,929
Am I really the Phoenix?

571
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,340
I don't know.

572
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,550
You just need to behave yourself.

573
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,630
When the time comes,

574
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,150
we'll know.

575
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,730
Go in.

576
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,980
Okay.

577
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,650
Show up now.

578
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,010
It burns!

579
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,430
Nice.

580
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,810
My tail...

581
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:51,770
Well.

582
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,270
Divine Lord,

583
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,180
you are not showing

584
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,620
much respect to me.

585
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,790
You are a devil

586
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,610
who sneaked into my academy.

587
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,360
I didn't throw you out

588
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,790
because I respect Devil King.

589
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,000
In that case,

590
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,290
will you

591
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,660
do me another favor?

592
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,260
Please.

593
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,830
The academy was attacked by demons.

594
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,320
I can't let you

595
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,720
cause any more trouble.

596
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,590
If you insist on staying here,

597
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,740
I don't mind

598
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,940
killing you.

599
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,370
No need to do that.

600
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,100
I'll leave right now.

601
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,240
Well.

602
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,170
Please.

603
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,300
You can't see me.

604
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,820
You can't see me.

605
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,960
You can't see me.

606
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,100
Lady Lingyue,

607
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,010
I'm Wei Zhi.

608
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm here to apologize.

609
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,050
Lady Lingyue.

610
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,540
I made you some soup.

611
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,450
It's still warm.

612
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,620
Please let me in.

613
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,470
I'll leave after I give you the soup.

614
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,560
Lady Lingyue.

615
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:38,980
Are you still

616
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,290
mad at me?

617
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,150
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,780
I'm really sorry.

619
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,210
When we were in Wei Mansion,

620
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,450
you were the only person who was nice to me.

621
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,080
You helped me at the coming-of-age ceremony.

622
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,700
In this academy,

623
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,110
you still help me and speak for me.

624
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,350
But I made you injured.

625
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,400
I'm really sorry.

626
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,860
Dean.

627
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,780
What are you doing?
