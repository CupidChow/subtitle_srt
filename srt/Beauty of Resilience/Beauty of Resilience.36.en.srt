00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,060
has now bared its fangs.

193
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,580
We can't sit back and wait for our death.

194
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,740
We must protect ourselves.

195
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,860
That's what I think.

196
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,700
Good boy.

197
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,940
You've indeed matured.

198
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,910
The Three Realms have changed.

199
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,450
The Devil Realm and the Demon Realm

200
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
now share a common fate.

201
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,740
If we continue

202
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,060
running away like this,

203
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,940
there will come a day

204
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,340
when we have nowhere to stay in.

205
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,580
That would truly be waiting for death.

206
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,700
Ou Ya.

207
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,220
From now on,

208
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,340
I will entrust the Devil Realm

209
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
to you.

210
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,940
This...

211
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,220
I'm old now.

212
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,700
The Devil Realm

213
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,980
needs a new Devil King.

214
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,460
Remember.

215
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,460
The identity of the Devil King

216
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,650
doesn't imply

217
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,420
having the power to do as you please.

218
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,490
But more importantly, it's about

219
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,340
the responsibility you carry on your shoulders.

220
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
You decide

221
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,060
what you're going to do next.

222
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,220
Assemble the army

223
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,580
and support the Phoenix.

224
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,790
Yan Yue.

225
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,420
Where did you go?

226
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
No matter where you are,

227
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,580
I will find you.

228
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,100
Today, the Demon Clan rises in arms

229
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,860
not for expansion

230
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,220
or dominance,

231
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,100
but in pursuit of the truth

232
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,940
and to uphold justice.

233
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,390
Fight!

234
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,280
Fight the Heaven Realm! Fight the Heaven Realm!

235
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,540
Fight the Heaven Realm! Fight the Heaven Realm!

236
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,820
Fight the Heaven Realm!

237
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,580
This time dust

238
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,220
is the most precious treasure of the Heaven Realm.

239
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,820
If I'm not here,

240
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,340
I'll count on you to protect it.

241
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,060
I will protect the imperial altar.

242
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,220
Please rest assured.

243
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,860
You've recently attained immortality.

244
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,580
I have something to tell you.

245
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,980
The so-called immortals

246
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,980
are the people who reside in the mountains.

247
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,500
The mountain is beautiful

248
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,820
but also lonely.

249
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,300
You have to endure it.

250
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

251
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,340
Heavenly Empress Dowager.

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
The Heavenly Emperor wants to see you.

253
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,100
What should come

254
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,290
will eventually come.

255
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,700
You can leave first.

256
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,940
Yes.

257
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,990
Mother.

258
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,420
What happened to your hair?

259
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,920
Heavenly Emperor.

260
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,860
There are no outsiders here,

261
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,420
you don't have to call me that.

262
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,300
I've always called you that.

263
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,460
Heavenly Emperor.

264
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,820
You entered the time dust

265
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,700
and broke the laws of time

266
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,570
which resulted

267
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,340
in your current appearance.

268
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,460
For the truth...

269
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,290
I don't regret it.

270
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,460
What

271
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,430
do you plan to do?

272
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,210
Can you listen to my advice?

273
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,630
Let go everything

274
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,540
and turn back.

275
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,890
Impossible!

276
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,120
What's the point of talking about this

277
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,760
when things have already reached this point?

278
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,980
I know no one can persuade you.

279
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,420
Through countless timelines,

280
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,700
you've believed you're Divine,

281
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,300
and everything you have done

282
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,369
is in accordance with the will of Heaven.

283
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,560
Everything I've done

284
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,839
wasn't for myself,

285
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,700
but for the Heavenly Court

286
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,930
and the Three Realms.

287
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,760
I'm afraid

288
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,180
you don't even believe

289
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,220
what you just said yourself.

290
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,940
You're determined to cause chaos in the Three Realms

291
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,600
and kill the Phoenix.

292
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,140
And now,

293
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,180
you've actually taken over

294
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,300
your own son's body

295
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,540
and killed

296
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,660
your other son.

297
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,180
Why did you do that?

298
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,540
What other purpose is there

299
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,980
besides seeking immortality?

300
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,700
The Phoenix

301
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,700
can undergo rebirth

302
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,140
because she possesses the only

303
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,010
immortal primordial spirit in this world,

304
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,690
the Huarong.

305
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,500
The Huarong

306
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,060
is a supreme divine object

307
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,700
that helps devils transform into immortals

308
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,980
and help immortals

309
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,940
in ascending to divinity.

310
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,220
From now on,

311
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,900
neither dying nor being born

312
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,380
is the real immortality!

313
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,140
Now,

314
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,020
how can I

315
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,540
willingly go die

316
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,740
when I haven't obtained the Huarong?

317
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,260
I see.

318
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,020
I see.

319
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,130
I want to know

320
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,300
since when

321
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,380
did you cease to be the Heavenly Emperor

322
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,940
admired by the Three Realms,

323
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,980
and my beloved husband?

324
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,510
Since when did you start

325
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,850
violating the heavenly rules

326
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,780
and abandon your morals?

327
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,980
Stop talking!

328
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,500
As long as you keep your mouth shut,

329
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,540
you'll never...

330
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,540
Impossible!

331
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Our marriage

332
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,700
ended

333
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,460
the moment

334
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
you killed our child.

335
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,700
You...

336
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,620
Stop forcing me.

337
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,060
You're the one who's forcing me.

338
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,700
Since I'm in charge of time,

339
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,490
I have the power

340
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,860
to accelerate its passage.

341
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,020
Now Yan Yue's body

342
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,220
has lost its youthfulness.

343
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,860
What’s the point of you taking over it?

344
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,740
Heavenly Empress,

345
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,660
stop using your deceptive methods.

346
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,700
Although you control the time,

347
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,260
you

348
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,620
treat everyone fairly.

349
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,180
If

350
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,860
you accelerate it,

351
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,040
countless seedlings in the Three Realms

352
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,400
will wither before they can bloom.

353
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,260
Many children

354
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,980
will die before growing up.

355
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,840
Can you bear

356
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,380
to be their murderer?

357
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,460
Heavenly Empress.

358
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,020
It seems that your heart

359
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,020
isn't strong enough.

360
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,980
You can't beat me.

361
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,660
Stop your futile resistance.

362
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,870
Just behave obediently

363
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,380
and continue being the Heavenly Empress Dowager.

364
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,660
Won't it be good

365
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,030
to look down on the Three Realms from now on?

366
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,460
I can't beat you,

367
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,460
but I pity you.

368
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,220
You've wasted ten thousand years,

369
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,020
you're still so narrow-minded.

370
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,260
What difference does it make

371
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,060
if you obtain the Huarong and become a Divine

372
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,140
who escapes the Three Realms?

373
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,300
What else

374
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,460
can be sacrificed then

375
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,300
to satisfy

376
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,980
your insatiable greed?

377
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,700
Stop talking nonsense!

378
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,220
I'm warning you.

379
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,460
There's a limit to my patience.

380
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,450
I regret

381
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,880
that I wasted my life

382
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,700
on you.

383
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,660
I know

384
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,460
you won't let go of anyone

385
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,660
who's a threat to you.

386
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,500
Since that's the case,

387
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,780
you don't have to do anything yourself.

388
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,700
I'll leave on my own.

389
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
What are you doing?

390
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,290
No!

391
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,660
All of you said

392
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
that I was wrong.

393
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,460
Even you thought I was wrong.

394
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,420
No.

395
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,420
No!

396
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,060
I did nothing wrong.

397
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,700
I did it for the Heavenly Court,

398
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,500
the Three Realms,

399
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,380
and immortality.

400
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,140
Am I really wrong?

401
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,900
I...

402
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,740
How can I be wrong?

403
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,620
The Heavenly Soldiers have assembled.

404
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,460
I’ve just inspected,

405
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,740
the Heavenly Empress Dowager and Yi'er are not here.

406
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,020
Yi'er is often elusive.

407
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,700
Don't mind her.

408
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,180
But the Heavenly Empress Dowager isn't here either.

409
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,980
She never leaves the Heavenly Court.

410
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,420
You don’t need to concern yourself

411
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,540
with Heavenly Empress Dowager's whereabouts.

412
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,620
Remember.

413
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,380
As the commander of the Imperial Guard of the Heaven Realm,

414
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,220
you must declare war on the Demon Realm.

415
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,020
Okay.

416
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,460
What is the reason for sending troops

417
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,060
from the Demon Realm?

418
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,940
Are you questioning me?

419
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,220
Yan Yue...

420
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,460
Call me Heavenly Emperor!

421
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,640
Okay.

422
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,500
I've always regarded you as my brother,

423
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,020
fighting side by side,

424
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,140
but now you've lost your mind

425
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,060
and are acting recklessly!

426
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,540
Why is that?

427
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,540
You...

428
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,060
are not entitled to ask me any questions.

429
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,780
Okay.

430
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,180
In that case,

431
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,460
I will now ask the Heavenly Empress Dowager

432
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,020
to gather all the elders in the Heavenly Court for a meeting

433
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,540
to discuss whether to impeach you,

434
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
the esteemed Heavenly Emperor!

435
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,020
Qing Huan!

436
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,460
Yi'er?

437
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,380
I was right.

438
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,500
You're really in Yingzhou.

439
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,460
Are you here to catch me?

440
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,780
No.

441
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,620
I'm here to protect you.

442
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,500
How did you get hurt?

443
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,460
It’s Yan Yue.

444
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,060
He went crazy.

445
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,140
He didn't.

446
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,980
That’s not Yan Yue.

447
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,660
The late Heavenly Emperor took over Yan Yue's body

448
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,930
and killed Yan Luo.

449
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,860
He is a monster!

450
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,300
How should I address you?

451
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,230
Yan Yue?

452
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,530
No.

453
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,620
Heavenly Emperor?

454
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,500
If I'm not Yan Yue,

455
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,140
then where is he?

456
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,500
You're absurd.

457
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,220
Just because

458
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,540
of this absurd thought,

459
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,980
are you willing to drag the Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

460
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,220
into a war?

461
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Dragging the Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm

462
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,460
into a war is your ambition.

463
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,210
As for Yan Yue...

464
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,650
I'm sure he's alive.

465
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,050
He must be somewhere

466
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,260
waiting for me to find him.

467
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,540
No matter

468
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,060
what a person changes into,

469
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,900
whether he becomes an immortal

470
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,420
or a demon,

471
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,540
those who really care about him

472
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,380
will definitely find him.

473
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,780
Do you think

474
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,140
you can do it?

475
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,500
Aren't you afraid that the Demon Realm will be destroyed

476
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,980
and the people will suffer?

477
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,260
I'm not afraid.

478
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,860
The Demon Realm is also never afraid.

479
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,420
In that case,

480
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,980
don't blame me.

481
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,180
Try.

482
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,220
Phoenix.

483
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,980
You've brought misfortune to the Three Realms and caused misery to the people.

484
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,300
Let's add

485
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,940
yet another crime.

486
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,900
The Heaven Realm really is despicable.

487
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,460
Luckily the Phoenix is prepared.

488
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,220
The war has begun.

489
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,890
The war between the Heaven and the Demon Realm

490
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,420
is about to begin.

491
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,020
It's too late to tell Wei Zhi the truth.

492
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,620
Wei Zhi.

493
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,140
You must trust Yan Yue.

494
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,490
[Yu]

495
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,460
I will lead the Demon Realm to attack the Heaven Realm.

496
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,740
With this war,

497
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,140
the Heavenly Court will use

498
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,060
the most despicable methods

499
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,980
to attack Gu Cheng

500
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
and everyone around me.

501
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,220
I have established

502
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,740
a defensive array of talismans within the city.

503
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,140
This array

504
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,700
can protect the people from being hurt.

505
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,860
Is this the so-called

506
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,050
love for all beings in the Heaven Realm?

507
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,340
But you made a mistake this time.

508
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,790
I'm no longer the willful and reckless Phoenix

509
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,040
who gets framed by others.

510
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,380
I'm Wei Zhi.

511
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,180
Wei Zhi, who has endured hardships

512
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,300
and experienced the ups and downs of life

513
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,540
to stand here.

514
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,770
Wei Zhi.

515
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,540
I'm fine.

516
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,140
Get rid of him for me.

517
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,620
For Lan Su...

518
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,460
Avenge Lan Su!

519
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,520
You overestimated yourself.

520
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,060
Charge!

521
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,540
Go!

522
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,530
The Huarong

523
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,170
is mine.

524
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,220
Mother.

525
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,080
I have finally learned

526
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,790
to control water today.

527
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,620
Luo,

528
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,620
have you learned to control rain?

529
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,300
Father!

530
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,980
Get lost!

531
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,180
Get lost!

532
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,180
Turns out,

533
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,780
the Heavenly Emperor

534
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,180
took over Yan Yue's body.

535
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,420
Have you thought it through?

536
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,710
When the Huarong leaves the body,

537
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,620
the Phoenix will die.

538
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,780
Is it worth it

539
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,540
to trade your life

540
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,300
for his return?

541
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,900
Yes.

542
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,120
What's wrong?

543
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,510
Where are the weapons?

544
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,460
What is this?

545
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,820
What is that?

546
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,850
What is this?

547
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,410
[Six months later]

548
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,860
Your Majesty.

549
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,980
From now on,

550
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,460
the matters of the Three Realms

551
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,540
will no longer be decided by one person.

552
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,620
Everyone here

553
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,860
has a responsibility

554
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,260
to offer advice and suggestions

555
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,660
for the stability of the Three Realms.

556
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,740
This is a shared governance of the Three Realms.

557
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,020
Su.

558
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
Since Yi'er ascended to the throne,

559
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,780
there has been peace in the Three Realms,

560
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,980
and the Devil Clan has thrived.

561
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,580
This is what you wanted to see.

562
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,380
I inherited the throne of Devil King.

563
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,410
But without you,

564
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,820
the most beautiful Devil Empress

565
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,300
in the Devil Realm,

566
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,560
I have no one

567
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,870
to argue with anymore.

568
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,540
Also,

569
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,300
after that great war,

570
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,940
Yan Yue and Wei Zhi

571
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,020
completely disappeared

572
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,530
from the Three Realms.

573
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,060
Are they

574
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,940
still alive?

575
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,540
Yan Yue?

576
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,210
It's me.

577
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,840
♫It's the fog under your eyes♫

578
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,520
I've always been here.

579
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,830
♫That makes it rain at the Mount Ba♫

580
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:39,680
♫Who will I sigh for in this life♫

581
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,590
♫I will remember the past when we part♫

582
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,540
So, you're here.

583
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,780
I can die without regrets after seeing you again.

584
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,370
♫I've buried my heart in autumn♫

585
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,060
Without you,

586
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,370
life would be meaningless,

587
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,330
♫It's your frown♫

588
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,300
even if it lasted forever.

589
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,410
♫That brings the sorrowful clouds♫

590
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,660
Wei Zhi.

591
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,340
Wait for me.

592
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,970
♫Who will I meet in this life♫

593
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:04,080
♫Sadness or joy are predestined♫

594
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,080
♫Love and hatred made me suffer a lot♫

595
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,040
♫What's the date of the Palace in the sky♫

596
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,120
♫I'm only waiting for you♫

597
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,640
♫To appear in my dreams♫

598
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,780
♫The courtyard is lush with sycamores♫

599
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,760
♫It only hopes that one day♫

600
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,960
♫There'll still be a phoenix to roost♫

601
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:36,460
♫I'm still looking for you until the falling flowers return with spring♫

602
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,020
♫I'll love you till my life ends♫

♫I'm still looking for you until the sound of hooves fades with the strings♫

604
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,860
♫I hate that there's no time to meet♫

605
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,020
♫I'm still looking for you until the sun stains the clouds♫

606
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,440
♫Like a duckweed waiting to be married♫

607
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,780
♫I'm still looking for you♫

608
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,480
♫The Destiny whispers to me that it is hard to find the Netherworld♫

609
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,050
♫My love for you will never change♫

610

Wang Yue,

634
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,540
do you regret

635
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,820
getting married to me?

636
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,350
What will you do

637
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,660
if I betray you?

638
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,110
You won't.

639
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,140
If you betray me,

640
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:22,800
♫I'm still looking for you until the falling flowers return with spring♫

641

and then die with you.

643
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,100
