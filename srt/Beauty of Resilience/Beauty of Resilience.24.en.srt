All I wanted was to serve the country.

152
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,500
How could I collude with the enemy?

153
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,340
That's because

154

Yes.

158
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,580
You're right.

159
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,460
I was wrong.

160
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,580

Don't think I don't know

what you're thinking?

174
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,620
You said you wanted to avenge Father.

175
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,620
In fact, you just want to

176
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,100
take the credit.

177
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,580
It's not like that, Brother.

178
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,100
You misunderstood.

179
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,740

Do you think

183

they will let a demon lead the army?

184

Even you believe such rumors?

185

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,820
Don't you know

188
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,580
whether I'm a demon or not?

189
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm not.

190
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,980
Everyone said that

191
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,180
they saw you turned into a demon.

192

Even if we are siblings,

193
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,460
I still have to kill you.

194
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,820
Maybe, it was you

195
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,340
who colluded with the bastard of Jinghe

196
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,580
and killed Father.

197
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,500
No, I didn't.

198
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,180
I didn't. You killed him.

199
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,820
Brother.

200
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,820
Brother.

201
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,860
She's not what you think.

202
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,700
Shut up.

203
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,820
What brother?

204
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,620
You're just a servant.

205
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,220
Who are you to judge anything

206
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,460
about the Sima family?

207
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,300
Mu Nan is

208
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,700
my sworn brother.

209
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,300
He's not a servant.

210
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,420
Fine.

211
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,340
It doesn't matter anymore.

212
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,980
Father is dead.

213
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Even if you go to revenge on Yan,

214
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,220
Father won't come back from death.

215
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,810
What do you mean?

216
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,330
Aren't you not going to take revenge?

217
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
If I take revenge rashly,

218
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,940
I may die.

219
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Sima Wangyue,

220
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,220
do you really think I'm that stupid?

221
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
Father just died.

222
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,220
But you're weighing the pros and cons here.

223
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,540
You don’t deserve

224
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,420
to be the eldest brother of the Sima family.

225
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,940
Let me out!

226
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,700
Let me out!

227
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,740
Let me out!

228
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,220
Let me out. 
Demon!

229
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,180
Demon! Don't come over!

230
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,859
Stay away!

231
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,260
Commander.

232
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,180
Help!

233
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,780
Help me! Hurry!

234
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,619
She's really a demon!

235
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,660
Close the door!

236
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,030
[Prison]

237
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,020
Demon!

238
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,690
Commander! 
Demon!

239
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,860
There's a demon inside!

240
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,980
Commander. 
There's a demon inside!

241
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,300
[Wei]

242
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,660
Monster!

243
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,700
Commander.

244
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,380
There's a demons inside.

245
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
There's fire on her body!

246
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,460
I know.

247
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,220
On the day Marshal died,

248
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:47,860
the Princess

249
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,780
burned half of the soldiers

250
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,140
with her fire.

251
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,500
Commander,

252
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
don’t be afraid.

253
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,860
The Princess is your sister.

254
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,060
She won't hurt you.

255
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,900
No.

256
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,260
She's a demon.

257
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,980
How could she be

258
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Father's biological child?

259
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,270
[Wei]

260
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,260
How could she be a child

261
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,500
of the Sima family?

262
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,140
Commander.

263
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,700
She is not my sister.

264
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,140
It has nothing to do with me.

265
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,660
It has nothing to do with me.

266
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,220
I was heartbroken

267
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,860
because of my father's death.

268
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,690
What hurts me more is that

269
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,980
Sima Wangyue was the one who killed him.

270
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,540
Well...

271
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,060
I won't hide it from you anymore.

272
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,180
Wangyue's not my father's biological child.

273
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,620
When the two countries were at war,

274
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
her parents were killed by the Wei army.

275
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,460
She was just a baby when Father saw her.

276
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,380
So he adopted her

277
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,140
because she was so poor.

278
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,180
But who knew

279
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,940
she turned to be a threat later.

280
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,890
Exactly.

281
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,660
She colluded with the enemy, Chen Yan.

282
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,220
She didn't do it unintentionally,

283
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,500
but deliberately.

284
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,700
She wanted to

285
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
to avenge her parents.

286
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,420
What kind of bad person is she.

287
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,540
How ungrateful!

288
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
She shouldn't do this.

289
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,460
Take Sima Wangyue here.

290
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,540
Do you believe it?

291
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,740
I don't believe it anyway.

292
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,180
I don't, either.

293
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,740
I think

294
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,500
Wangyue looks like Marshal.

295
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,540
Princess Wangyue

296
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,780
was risking her life in the battle.

297
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,300
It was obviously the Sima family's stype.

298
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,260
That's right.

299
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,450
I saw it with my own eyes.

300
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,500
She is a demon.

301
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,140
How could she be the child of Marshal?

302
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,940
I believe Commander.

303
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,420
Chen Yan killed the Marshal

304
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,460
because of her.

305
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:51,300
[Wei]

306
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,980
Wangyue.

307
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,620
I didn't want to

308
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,140
expose your identity in public.

309
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,220
But you killed my father.

310
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,300
Today,

311
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,940
let's settle this.

312
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,540
You can even ignore

313
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,610
family ties.

314
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,620
I feel sorry for Father

315
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,540
and the Sima family.

316
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,980
Father is dead.

317
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm his son.

318
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,020
Today, we're use our blood

319
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,140
to prove if we're siblings.

320
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,220
If our blood can blend,

321
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,900
I'll take you as my sister.

322
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,460
If not, I...

323
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,380
Cut the crap.

324
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,460
Let's start.

325
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,700
Come up.

326
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,850
[Wei]

327
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,860
Mu Nan.

328
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,900
Sima Zhaoyang.

329
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,220
You did something with the water, right?

330
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,980
Mu Nan prepared the water himself.

331
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
He is always your dog.

332
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,940
He never disobeys you.

333
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,540
Ask him,

334
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,420
if there's anything wrong with the water.

335
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,420
Mu Nan.

336
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Commander.

337
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,380
There's no problem.

338
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,220
The blood test is done.

339
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,680
[Wei]

340
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,540
The evidence is solid.

341
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,740
This demon is not Father's biological child.

342
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,900
Yes, kill her!

343
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,060
Kill this demon!

344
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,980
Avenge Marshal!

345
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,300
Kill this demon!

346
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,540
Kill her!

347
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,020
Kill her!

348
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,300
Kill her! Avenge Marshal!

349
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,740
Kill her! Avenge Marshal!

350
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
She pretended to be a child of the Sima family,

351
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,980
colluded with the enemy and killed my father.

352
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,300
She will be executed.

353
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,060
You lied to me!

354
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,260
You liar! Take him away!

355
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,700
Mu Nan.

356
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,420
You lied to me.

357
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,860
You liar!

358
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,900
Take him down. Don't move.

359
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,780
Liar!

360
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,220
You lied to me.

361
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,780
Sister.

362
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,860
Three days later, it will be the seventh day

363
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,860
after Father's death.

364
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,220
By then, I'll pierce her heart

365
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,700
with thousands of arrows

366
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,780
as a sacrifice to Father's spirit in heaven.

367
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,140
Kill her!

368
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,380
Burn her!

369
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,500
Burn her!

370
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,460
Burn her! Kill her!

371
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,980
Kill this demon!

372
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,420
Mu Nan.

373
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,900
Now everyone knows

374
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,980
Wangyue is a demon.

375
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,780
I want to save her too.

376
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,420
But there's nothing I can do.

377
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,170
A daughter kills her father.

378
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,980
It's a serious crime

379
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,300
for all countries or dynasties.

380
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,780
Chen Yan did it.

381
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,980
It has nothing to do with the Princess.

382
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,420
I saw it with my own eyes.

383
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,700
Commander.

384
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,460
Sister can't be a demon.

385
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,140
Please.

386
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,660

she's not my father's child.

let's do a blood test to prove

392
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,260
that she's not from the Sima family.

393
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
Then I can say

394
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,660
that she's a bastard, and kick her out.

395
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,540

543

wake you up

547
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,620
The Phoenix bloodline has been triggered.

548
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,220
There were thousands of

549

550
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,210
The Phoenix is the demon of the Three Realms.

551
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,180
If we don't kill her as soon as possible,

552
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,540
there will be no peace

553
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,740
in the world.

554
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,380
Once the Phoenix Nirvana happens,

555
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,060
the Three Realms

556
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,900
will be doomed.

557
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,380
As the God of Red Sun,

558
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,650
do you still remember

559
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,380
what responsibility do you have?

560
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,460
It's my destiny

561
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,740

Today, in order to break off my love,

572
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,250
I injected this poison into my body.

573
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,150
If I fall in love again,

574
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,260
the poison will be effective

575
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,780
and I'll die of heartache.

576
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,020
Retreat.

577
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,460
Sister.

578
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,860
I want to save...

579
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,300
Sister.

580
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,659
Isn't this Princess Wangyue?

581
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,139
How did you become a demon?

582
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,179
I heard that

583
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,500
Marshal was killed by her.

584
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,500
And many people were burned to death.

585
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,780
She is not

586
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,300
the daughter of Marshal.

587
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,020
Without Marshal,

588
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:32,980
our city

589
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,060
has long been lost.

590
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,179
You evil demon!

591
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,179
Kill the demon!

592
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,380
Kill the demon!

593
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,620
Kill the demon!

594
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,940
[Wei]

595
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,460
Kill the demon!

596
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,900
Kill her!

597
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,380
Kill her!

598
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,620
Kill her!

599
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,659
Kill her! Kill her!

600
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,820
Demon! Kill her!

601
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,900
Kill her!

602
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,900
Don't blame me for being cruel.

603
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,450
Blame yourself

604
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,140
for loving to show off.

605
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,620
It's your fault

606
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,020
to have a heartless man.

607
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,380
Today is the festival in the city.

608
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,740
We'll execute the demon

609
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,020
to pay tribute to my father

610
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,020
and the heroic spirits of the soldiers.

611
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,180
It's time.

612
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,580
Kill her with arrows shooting her heart.

613
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,060
Kill her!

614
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,140
Kill her!

615
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,940
Kill her!

616
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,300
Kill the demon!

617
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,980
Kill the demon!

618
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
Kill her!

619
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,740
Kill her!

620
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,770
[Wei]

621
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,760
Execute!

622
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,500
What's going on?

623
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,120
[Wei]

624
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,300
♫It's the fog under your eyes♫

625
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,640
♫That makes it rain at the Mount Ba♫

626
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,060
♫Who will I sigh for in this life♫

627
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,890
♫I will remember the past when we part♫

628
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,880
♫I've buried my heart in autumn♫

629
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,540
If I let you down,

630
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,950
♫It's your frown♫

631
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,660
what would you do?

632
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,820
♫That brings the sorrowful clouds♫

633
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,140
You won't.

634
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,980
If you betray me,

635
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,470
♫Who will I meet in this life♫

636
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,140
I'll kill you

637
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,540
and die with you.

638
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,630
♫Sadness or joy are predestined♫

639
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,260
I have no regrets

640
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,340
to die in your hands.

641
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,330
♫Love and hatred made me suffer a lot♫

642
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,480
♫What's the date of the Palace in the sky♫

643
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,500
♫I'm only waiting for you♫

644
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,100
♫To appear in my dreams♫

645
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,330
♫The courtyard is lush with sycamores♫

646
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,250
♫It only hopes that one day♫

647
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,380
♫There'll still be a phoenix to roost♫

648

♫I'm still looking for you until the falling flowers return with spring♫

649
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,780
Saintess.

650
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,500
The Heavenly Realm

651
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,180
has sent Heavenly Soldiers to kill the Phoenix.

652
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,610
♫I'll love you till my life ends♫

653
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,050
The leader, the Red Sun God,

654
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,890
is

655
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,940
Chen Yan.

656
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,500
♫I'm still looking for you until the sound of hooves fades with the strings♫

657
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:05,240
♫I hate that there's no time to meet♫

658
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,330
♫I'm still looking for you until the sun stains the clouds♫

659
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,940
♫Like a duckweed waiting to be married♫

660
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,260
♫I'm still looking for you♫

661
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,970
♫No matter how thick the fog is and how hard it is to find the Netherworld♫

662
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,600
♫My love for you will never change♫

663
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,740
Chen Yan.

664
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,980
I'll ask you one last time.

665
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,140
Have you ever

666
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,540
loved me?

667
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,460
I just went through the love hardship

668
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,060
in the mortal world.

669
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,580
I am no longer Chen Yan.

670
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,580
You

671
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,020
are not Wangyue.

672
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,460
The Phoenix has awakened.

673
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,740
There is no way

674
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,460
for us to live together.
