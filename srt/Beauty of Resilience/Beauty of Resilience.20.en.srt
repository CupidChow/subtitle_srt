[Episode 20]

4
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,820
You are indeed

5
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,100
the soldiers from the capital.

6
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,390
You can't even catch an assassin

7
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,150
with so many people.

8
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,140
Impressive.

9
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,260
You use all your skills

10
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,540
to doubt our people.

11
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,820
Chen Yan.

12
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,010
What did you say?

13
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,780
Nothing.

14
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,060
Just whine.

15
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
Guys.

16
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,980
Search here thoroughly

17
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,100
and carefully.

18
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,540
Like under the quilt.

19
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,260
In the cabinet.

20
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,430
Check it thoroughly.

21
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,540
Chen Yan.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,420
Where did you get this handkerchief?

23
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,660
This is mine.

24
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,370
Any problem?

25
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,260
Did you find

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,140
anything suspicious?

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,130
No.

28
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,660
No.

29
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,700
You may leave.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,940
Yes.

31
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,500
This is the commander's

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,370
personal belongings.

33
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,140
How did you get it?

34
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,980
Staff Mu.

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,250
Why do

36
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,980
I have it?

37
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,940
You should know that.

38
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,780
Don't talk nonsense.

39
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,060
She is noble.

40
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,980
How could she

41
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,060
be secretly dating you?

42
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Tell me the truth.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,540
How did you

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,540
steal it?

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,060
I know.

46
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,260
You are loyal to her.

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,540
But do you think that

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,060
you are out of your depth?

49
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,340
Staff Mu,

50
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,579
you are either blinded

51
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,980
or you were kept in the dark

52
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,060
about many things.

53
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,100
You know

54
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,700
what happened.

55
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,060
Why do you need my answer?

56
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,780
Right?

57
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,579
It's about the reputation of our commander.

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,340
You'd better tell me the truth.

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,420
I think

60
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,340
it's about

61
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,500
Staff Mu's jealousy.

62
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,900
You'd better give me the handkerchief now.

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,340
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

64
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,810
I treat you as a child.

65
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,459
So I won't sink to your level.

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,340
Do you think

67
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,660
I'm a pushover?

68
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,700
Will you give it to me or not?

69
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,380
No.

70
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,260
Besides,

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,460
the beauty's staff

72
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,900
still remains the fragrance.

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,010
Shameless!

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,220
Stop!

75
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,450
Leave us.

76
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,100
Yes.

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,130
Who can tell me what's going on?

78
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,220
Father Marshal was assassinated at the Outpost Battalion.

79
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,460
The assassin ran away.

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,900
People from Jinghe are obstructing.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,100
There is no clue outside the camp.

82
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
What about you inside the camp?

83
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,210
You fought and hurt each other

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,690
at this critical moment.

85
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,370
So ridiculous.

86
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,780
Who started it?

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,240
It was me.

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Give me a reason.

89
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,380
I have nothing to say.

90
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,460
Chen Yan, tell me.

91
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,340
Me?

92
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,460
How would I know?

93
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,340
Weird.

94
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,890
Good.

95
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,659
Since you don't say anything,

96
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,110
we'll follow the military rules.

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,580
[Wei]

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,420
[Wei]

99
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,180
[Wei]

100
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,180
[Wei]

101
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,400
[Wei]

102
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,550
What's wrong with me?

103
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,930
She was angry this time.

104
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,140
And she must be very disappointed in me.

105
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,380
But Chen Yan is shameless.

106
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,780
How can I allow him

107
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,140
to slander her?

108
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,460
But

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,020
why do I feel

110
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,220
something is wrong?

111
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,460
Chen Yan,

112
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,900
You're so insensitive.

113
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,340
How can you sleep?

114
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,700
Get up!

115
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,580
Get up.

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,380
You scared me.

117
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,020
Cut the crap.

118
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,780
You two are really...

119
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,340
Tell me.

120
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,980
Why did you fight with Staff Mu?

121
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,380
Him?

122
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,900
Just like that.

123
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,780
Okay, I got it.

124
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,770
No need to say.

125
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,290
Why not?

126
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,659
What do you know?

127
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,780
I...

128
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,300
Why did you get hurt?

129
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,159
It's so good.

130
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,700
He hurt my arm.

131
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,480
OK.

132
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,060
You came at the right time.

133
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,100
I am the assassin.

134
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,220
I fell into the trap.

135
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,180
Hurry, catch me.

136
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,250
Stop it!

137
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,310
It hurts.

138
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,900
Let's get down to business.

139
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
How is it?

140
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,820
Have you caught the assassin?

141
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,450
Everyone has been checked.

142
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,350
But we found nothing.

143
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,390
We're relieved

144
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,690
to see you are fine.

145
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,260
In my opinion,

146
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,530
you should think of a way

147
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,360
to calm the commander down.

148
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,410
His two most trusted people fought.

149
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,550
It's not my fault.

150
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,740
Fine.

151
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
I'll ponder

152
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,130
on this here.

153
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,460
OK. Go ahead.

154
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,100
We'll keep looking for the assassin.

155
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Let me get you some medicine.

156
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,190
Tell me if you need anything.

157
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,700
Bring some delicious food.

158
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,650
Do it yourself.

159
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,340
Commander.

160
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,250
Why are you here?

161
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,980
Call me Commander.

162
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,860
Commander.

163
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Why are you here?

164
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,700
I want to know

165
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,180
why you

166
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,300
fought with Mu Nan.

167
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,620
It's nothing.

168
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,460
It's not worth mentioning.

169
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
What is it?

170
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,980
I can't tell you.

171
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,300
This is incised wound ointment.

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,120
Use this.

173
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,340
No need.

174
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,980
It's just a flesh wound.

175
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,460
A knife wound is easy to get infected.

176
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,220
Take it.

177
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,700
No need.

178
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,180
I've disinfected

179
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,420
with this liquor.

180
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,860
Such a big thing happened.

181
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,980
You officials

182
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,300
must be very busy.

183
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,420
Don't worry about me.

184
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,580
Let me see

185
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,550
your wound.

186
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,940
The military doctor said

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,870
that opening this

188
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,700
is bad

189
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,340
-Move it.
-for my wound.

190
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
Fine.

191
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,100
But I...

192
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,760
Hurry!

193
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,300
Commander!

194
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,340
We caught the assassin.

195
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,460
Where is the assassin?

196
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,690
The assassin

197
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,300
was caught by General Cao

198
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,620
on his way to Gu City.

199
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,100
He has been imprisoned

200
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,860
in Gu City.

201
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,300
Use it yourself.

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,340
Wait.

203
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,860
Commander.

204
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,100
I want to interrogate him.

205
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,060
General Cao

206
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
has just done interrogating.

207
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,460
Done?

208
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,620
The Marshal was assassinated

209
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,420
in our Outpost Battalion.

210
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,980
He ended it so soon?

211
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,390
Well...

212
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,500
What?

213
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,570
Are you worried about

214
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,220
me interrogating?

215
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,340
General Cao.

216
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,500
I caught him.

217
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,820
I interrogated him.

218
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,580
We have witness and evidence.

219
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,730
Commander.

220
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,860
Do you want to check again?

221
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,300
General Cao, don't misunderstand.

222
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,380
I didn't mean that.

223
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,420
I just think

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,940
this is a serious matter.

225
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,420
Should we wait for the Marshal

226
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,340
to interrogate him

227
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,580
and give us an answer?

228
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,980
We've asked everything.

229
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,100
This man is an assassin sent by Jinghe.

230
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,820
He sneaked in the carriage

231
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,500
for replenishment.

232
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,940
He has been lurking for days.

233
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
We found his knife

234
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,820
and night stalker outfit

235
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,980
in the carriage.

236
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,220
He accepted guilt.

237
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,500
The barracks are heavily guarded.

238
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,220
He could have been hidden

239
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
in the carriage for days.

240
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,740
Well...

241
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,220
you should ask the soldiers in the Outpost Battalion.

242
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
General Cao,

243
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,100
what do you mean?

244
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
Outpost Battalion is on duty day and night.

245
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,740
We dare not slack off at all.

246
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,980
Everyone who entered the Gu City

247
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,060
has been strictly checked.

248
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,820
Now you say

249
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,980
he hid in the carriage.

250
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,980
Go get the coachman.

251
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Coachman...

252
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,820
has been

253
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,700
released.

254
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,060
Released?

255
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
The coachman has served in the military for many years.

256
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,820
He's loyal.

257
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,620
Why is he loyal?

258
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,980
He is my brother-in-law.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,980
He saved my life

260
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,220
on the battlefield.

261
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,220
That's why he is lame,

262
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,330
and becomes the coachman.

263
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,220
I can guarantee with my life

264
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,500
that he didn't know anything

265
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,980
about this.

266
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,180
General Cao.

267
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,500
Assassinating the Marshal is a major crime.

268
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,740
Even if he is your trusted aide,

269
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,820
he is not suspected of colluding with the enemy,

270
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,460
but he is responsible for negligence.

271
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,500
Guards!

272
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,460
Put him in jail

273
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,060
for seven days

274
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,700
as a warning to others.

275
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,340
You!

276
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Go now.

277
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,340
Yes.

278
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,460
General Cao is righteous.

279
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,340
and admirable.

280
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,500
How did you know

281
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,700
the whereabouts of the Marshal?

282
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,810
Do you have a contact?

283
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,230
If you tell me the truth now,

284
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,370
you can get it over with and be dignified.

285
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,220
Otherwise,

286
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,810
don't blame me for being cruel.

287
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,980
Who is that?

288
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Living on the riverbank by the water grass.

289
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,580
You!

290
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,700
-Speciosity.
-Crap!

291
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,070
Scoundrel Sima

292
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,460
is cruel and bloodthirsty.

293
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,000
His two close aides

294
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,920
are troublemakers.

295
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,660
Shut up!

296
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,340
I'll kill you

297
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,700
if you dare to say one more word!

298
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,060
The Emperor of Weicang

299
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,670
is a monstrous ruler.

300
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,980
His mother was a prostitute.

301
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,340
-She has three husbands.
-Liar!

302
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,820
She's full of shit.

303
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,170
He is a beast.

304
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,500
Scoundrel from Jinghe!

305
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,100
scumbag!

306
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,700
How dare you insult the last emperor?

307
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,220
General Cao, you're too impulsive.

308
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,860
He assassinated the Marshal first,

309
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,490
and then humiliated our emperor.

310
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,460
He

311
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,980
will die sooner or later.

312
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,060
Unfortunately,

313
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,180
he got off easy.

314
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,730
He is a scout from Jinghe.

315
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,980
He has important information.

316
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,820
Enough!

317
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,460
A man full of dirty words

318
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,100
can only talk rubbish.

319
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,500
Don't try to

320
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,420
suppress me with official words.

321
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm a barbarian.

322
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,740
If you think it's not right.

323
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
go report to your father.

324
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,820
Come!

325
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,100
Behead the assassin

326
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,340
and hang him at the camp gate

327
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,580
as a warning to others.

328
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,100
Yes.

329
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,280
[Sima]

330
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,880
[Gu City]

331
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,790
[Wei]

332
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,500
Father, why are you out?

333
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
It's windy outside.

334
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,620
Don't catch a cold.

335
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,180
I’m strong.

336
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,700
It's nothing.

337
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,460
Didn't you have a waist injury last time?

338
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,060
You should go back and rest.

339
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,860
This is nothing.

340
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,850
Today

341
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,920
is your first time handling a military case.

342
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,500
Of course I have to come.

343
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,300
It's all General Cao's fault.

344
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,220
He was too reckless.

345
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,700
I wanted to follow the clues

346
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,810
to find out the mole.

347
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
But he...

348
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,100
I heard about it.

349
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,690
But don't worry about it.

350
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,220
You should know

351
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,500
if you want to be a good commander,

352
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,500
you need to learn the top-down approach.

353
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,500
Don't be bothered by the trifles.

354
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
But I can't let him be impulsive.

355
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,090
Yes.

356
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,700
General Cao

357
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,450
was indeed wrong.

358
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,580
But he

359
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,190
is also an excellent general

360
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,040
[Sima]

361
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,060
who is loyal to Weicang.

362
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,690
As for

363
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,820
the mole,

364
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,380
we can investigate it

365
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,620
in secret.

366
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,980
The most important thing

367
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,420
is that

368
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,500
the peace talk halted.

369
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,980
Jinghe sent someone

370
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,460
to assassinate me.

371
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,980
That means their army is weak.

372
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,340
We can seize the opportunity
to start the war.

373
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,340
Father, you mean...

374
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,260
[Wei]

375
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,820
Based on the current situation,

376
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
the war is coming.

377
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,940
We should focus on the overall situation

378
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,810
in terms of tactics, strategy

379
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,420
and people.

380
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,890
General Cao

381
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,840
is reliable.

382
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,220
No matter how many flaws he has,

383
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,380
the war is coming.

384
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,980
It's just a small matter.

385
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,180
Understood.

386
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,180
You have to prepare carefully.

387
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,500
You are going to fight

388
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
on the battlefield.

389
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,310
Yes.

390
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,089
[Wei]

391
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,020
I won't let you down.

392
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,460
Commander.

393
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,390
Commander is here.

394
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,550
Looking at you,

395
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,970
I guess the assassin has been caught.

396
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,920
General Cao has executed him on the spot.

397
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,980
I was too paranoid.

399
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,290
If it weren't for General Cao,

400
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,270
I wouldn't know

401
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,610
how long I would be suspected.

402
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,220
Mu Nan,

403
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,810
apologize to Chen Yan.

404
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,780
I'm sorry.

405
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,980
What?

406
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,830
I didn't hear you.

407
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,860
Sorry.

408
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,860
You should have told me earlier.

409
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,140
I won't take it to heart.

410
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,570
Don't leave. Don't leave.

411
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,550
I was just kidding.

412
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,420
Are you serious?

413
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,860
As the saying goes,

414
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,320
We shall end by understanding one another.

415
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,860
From now on,

416
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
we are good brothers.

417
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,520
How is your injury?

418
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,620
Commander.

419
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
How about

420
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,130
checking again?

421
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,490
That's enough.

422
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,620
Don’t be unreasonable.

423
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,090
Commander.

424
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,680
How about you treat me to a meal?

425
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,180
I really need some nutrition urgently.

426
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,140
OK. Tell me what you want to eat.

427
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,690
Let me think.

428
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,060
Order up, sir.

429
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,790
Please enjoy.

430
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,370
Qi.

431
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,070
You don’t know.

432
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,420
The commander

433
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,900
looks arrogant

434
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,380
with his head in the air.

435
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,300
He didn't respect

436
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,860
us two.

437
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,610
He's targeting me.

438
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,460
Others may not know,

439
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,660
but I do.

440
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Since he came to

441
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,380
be the vanguard of the Outpost Battalion,

442
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,220
you are unhappy.

443
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,700
Am I right?

444
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,460
We all know

445
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,980
what he's capable of.

446
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
But the Marshal really let him lead the army.

447
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,540
What happened?

448
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,220
We failed to capture grains.

449
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,220
Regarding peace talk,

450
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,660
the guards failed their duty.

451
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,620
If it were someone else,

452
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,460
he would have been punished severely.

453
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
But the Marshal

454
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,220
was just covering up for him.

455
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,060
That's why he's lucky.

456
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,020
Besides,

457
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,300
what can you do

458
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,380
when your son did this?

459
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160
So,

460
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,640
don't take it to heart.

461
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,220
-Let's drink.
-Drink.

462
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,260
I don't think

463
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,140
he is cut out for being a general.

464
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,980
If he takes over the position of Marshal,

465
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,980
the Gu City Army

466
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,660
will die sooner or later.

467
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,220
You,

468
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,620
don't worry.

469
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,660
He won't be the Marshal

470
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,180
in the future.

471
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,020
Bullshit!

472
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,380
If it's not his turn, then who is it?

473
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,020
You? Me?

474
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,540
We can't even get any benefit

475
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,580
even if we bleed so many times.

476
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,060
Why don't you understand?

477
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,740
Come on.

478
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,260
She

479
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,060
is not the young master.

480
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,020
She's the young master's younger sister,

481
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,740
Princess Wang Yue.

482
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,220
Qi,

483
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,460
there should be no joke in the army.

484
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,060
Are you serious?

485
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,940
Why would I lie to you?

486
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,700
I followed the Marshal when I was 16.

487
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,460
I watched his son

488
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
to grow up.

489
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,700
This is the young master's younger sister.

490
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,980
Princess Wang Yue.

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,140
Since she is the princess,

492
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,300
the Marshal will definitely spoil her.

493
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,980
Besides, after the war,

494
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,020
she will go home

495
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,740
and take care of her family.

496
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,060
She won't take the position.

497
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,980
A girl?

498
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,380
How dare a girl be so arrogant?

499
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,980
As a man,

500
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,540
how come I let

501
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,320
a young girl

502
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,940
stand above me?

503
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,540
We need to find a way

504
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,980
to teach her a lesson.

505
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,980
Cao,

506
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,940
we're talking about this in private.

507
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,290
You can't tell anyone.

508
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,700
This is going to be a big problem.

509
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,020
Do you hear me?

510
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,460
Brother.

511
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,510
I'm sorry.

512
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,370
You died for me.

513
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,590
One day,

514
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,410
we'll meet each other.

515
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,450
I'll

516
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,620
apologize to you at that time.

517
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,380
Are you still unhappy?

518
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,620
I'm happy.

519
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,320
Are you still denying it?

520
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,860
Are you blaming me

521
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,380
for asking you to apologize to Chen Yan?

522
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
I dare not.

523
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,500
I lost

524
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,660
the handkerchief

525
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,220
when I took a shower.

526
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,860
He just picked it up by accident.

527
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,060
Don't think too much.

528
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,690
I...

529
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,660
I didn't think too much.

530
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,860
I just don't like him.

531
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,380
Strange.

532
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,380
What did he do to you?

533
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,980
I just think

534
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,860
he's not a good person.

535
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,500
And I think

536
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
it's annoying

537
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,740
the way he looks at you.

538
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,180
Are you laughing at me?

539
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,660
Look at you.

540
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,140
You are a warrior in armor

541
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,460
and going into battle.

542
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,220
Why are you still so childish?

543
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,090
I-I'm not childish.

544
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,460
I hate people

545
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
saying me childish.

546
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,900
Yes.

547
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,780
I think Chen Yan is not

548
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,660
a good guy,

549
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,660
because I don't know him well.

550
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,020
But I did it for your own good.

551
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,060
If

552
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,610
I misunderstand him,

553
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,540
you can beat me, scold me and punish me

554
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,660
by then.

555
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,460
But now...

556
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,900
No.

557
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,700
I will protect you,

558
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,010
either now or in the future.

559
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,220
I can't let anything happen to you.

560
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,500
It's done.

561
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,620
Eat it while it's hot.

562
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,690
[Wei] [Sima]

563
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,780
Here is Black Wind Castle,

564
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,300
with river cliff to the east.

565
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
It has a natural barrier.

566
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Plateau to the west, where the cloud intertwined.

567
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,500
If we can take Black Wind Castle,

568
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,230
we can get through

569
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,700
the way to the north.

570
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,500
According to scout's report,

571
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,700
Jinghe replenished reinforcements
of 5,000 soldiers.

572
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,780
They arrived at Black Wind Castle
last night.

573
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,460
The enemy has about 12,000 soldiers

574
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,660
plus the guards.

575
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,460
Other than the soldiers stationed in the Base Camp,

576
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,740
we have around

577
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,060
10,000 soldiers who can go into battle.

578
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,050
Although we don't have more soldiers,

579
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,750
the 5,000 new recruits of Jinghe

580
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,880
have no experience.

581
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,180
Plus, they're not

582
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,310
familiar with the terrain.

583
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,020
If we take this chance to fight,

584
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,050
we can catch them off guard.

585
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,550
Staff Mu.

586
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,190
Is she really a woman?

587
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,900
I don't believe it. How is that possible?

588
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,170
I do.

589
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,230
Look.

590
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,790
Did he ever

591
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,640
pee with us?

592
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,310
No, no.

593
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,800
Who has seen him take a bath?

594
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,840
Right, no one.

595
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,700
By then,

596
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,030
I'll take off his pants.

597
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,510
You?

598
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,830
Can you beat him?

599
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,090
Let alone taking off his pants.

600
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,080
He is so skinny.

601
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,210
I'm not a man

602
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,930
if I can't beat him.

603
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,020
Cao,

604
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,740
you've been here for a long time,

605
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,860
and you are familiar with

606
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,980
the conditions around here.

607
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
What do you think?

608
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,980
Marshal,

609
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
I think

610
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,980
we must fight and we will win.

611
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,380
But if we start a full-frontal attack,

612
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,460
I'm afraid that our losses will be high.

613
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,540
Please enlighten me, General Cao.

614
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,700
The height of the city walls
at Black Wind Castle

615
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,290
is more than 10 meters.

616
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,600
Jinghe army are good at using arrows.

617
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,860
If we start a full-frontal attack,

618
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,380
our losses will be high.

619
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,590
But on the west side of the castle,

620
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
there are mountains crisscrossed.

621
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,690
[Battle Map]

622
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,750
Due to the high terrain,

623
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,460
the relative height of the wall
is only about 6 meters high.

624
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,300
If we pretend to attack the midway
holding the flag,

625
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,300
and attract the defense forces.

626
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And we send soldiers with rope ladder

627
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,020
to rush to the city

628
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,530
from the west side.

629
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,700
Before Jinghe army react,

[Battle Map]

631
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,620
we can climb to the wall,

632
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,020
then the victory will be settled.

633
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Good.

634
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,380
Cao.

635
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Good plan.

636
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,660
Qi,

637
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,220
you're in charge of the midway attack.

638
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,610
Okay.

639
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,740
Leave the west side attack to me.

640
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,810
[Battle Map]

641
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,940
The terrain there

642
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,900
is etched

643
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,840
in my mind.

644
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,950
Good.

645
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,380
General Cao.

646
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,460
The attack on the west

647
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,860
is extremely important.

648
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,420
It's too dangerous for you to be alone.

649
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,460
I'm worried.

650
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,460
How about this.

651
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,860
I'll send Commander Zhaoyang to go with you

652
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,460
and attack the west side together.

653
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,980
Yes.

[Battle Map]

655
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,660
Marshal.

656
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,460
The terrain along the way is complicated.

657
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,020
He’s new here.

658
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,860
Besides,

659
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,980
it’s a narrow escape to attack the city.

660
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,980
Commander,

661
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,980
it's better to stay here.

662
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,380
I'm here.

[Battle Map]

664
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,500
Don't worry.

665

General Cao.

666
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,220
It's because the war is dangerous.

667
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,020
But we are both soldiers of Weicang.

668
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,540
Since we share a bitter hatred of the enemy,

669
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,020
I'm willing to fight with you.

670
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,700
Then I will order Commander Zhaoyang

671
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,890

On the battlefield,

675

I hope you two

can support each other.

677
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,700
Thank you, Marshal.

678
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,700
Let us through.

679
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,240
Enough.

680
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,580
Don't stop us.

681
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,020
The Marshal is discussing military affairs.

682
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,140
No trespassing.

683
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,700
Then we'll wait here.

684
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,900
We want General Cao

to help us.

Yes.

Why did you hurt them?

There must be a reason.

That's why we did it.

Are you afraid of us mentioning it?

just take my head away.

and let us see

whether you're a woman or not.

What? She admits it.

750
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,750
You didn't believe me.

on behalf of Mu Nan,

my own idea.

761
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,300
It has nothing to do with Father Marshal.

Today,

763
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880

to replace the military position

As the Marshal,

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,530
I have an inescapable responsibility.

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,260
But

776
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,260
work together

777
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,700
and fight the enemy together.

778
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,700
After victory,

779
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,780
I will take Wangyue

780
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,620
to see His Majesty and ask for punishment.

781
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
Guards!

782
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,460
Take Wangyue

783
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,300
to Gu City.

784
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,940
Yes.

785
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:13,140
[Wei]

786
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,370
Is it you?

787
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,620
What do you mean?

788
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,660
Tell me all about it.

789
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,220
Did you leak

790
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,340
her identity?

791
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,430
Come on.

792
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,060
Use your brain, OK?

793
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,460
Commander is our boss.

794
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,380
It won't do me any good
to leak her identity.

795
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
Promotion and wealth

796
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,980
will be all in vain.

797
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,260
No good can come of that.

798
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,580
How could I do

799
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,850
such a stupid thing?

800
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,700
You...

801
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,460
think about it.

802
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
Who will benefit

803
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,780
a lot from this?

804
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,020
I didn’t expect our commander

805
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,260
to be a woman.

806
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,020
Yes.

807
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,220
What does our commander

808
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,460
look like

809
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,540
in a girl's dress?

810
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,170
Would she...

811
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,220
Would she be a Heinous woman?

812
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,780
Shut up.

813
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,420
I think

814
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,020
she might be pretty.

815
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,060
It's not of your business.

816
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,460
Chen Yan.

817
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,140
You!

818
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
Keep eating.

819
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,740
Sit down.

820
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,260
What happened to Chen Yan?

821
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,460
That kid

822
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,690
knew about this.

823
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,700
No wonder last time when we were showering...

824
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,460
He Is too scheming.

825
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,679
My brother has been weak since childhood.

826
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,989
so I had to disguise myself as a man

827
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,420
and join the army with my father.

828
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,460
Look.

829
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,900
The general of the enemy on the battlefield

830
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,520
looks handsome.

831
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,350
I don't want to fight after seeing him.

832
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,460
General,

833
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,120
you look young

834
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,230
and extraordinary.

835
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,730
I wonder if you're married.

836
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,719
Enough.

837
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,770
Come out now.

838
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,810
You sneaked out of the Outpost Battalion.

839
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,270
Aren't you afraid of the military rules?

840
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,110
Half of the troops are transferred from the Outpost Battalion,

841
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,510
and will depart with the army tomorrow.

842
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:50,850
That's why I'm here

843
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,409
to entertain you.

844
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,340
Did you carve it yourself?

845
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,450
Of course.

846
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,950
I think

847
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,320
I'll open a wooden workshop

848
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,600
after the war.

849
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,020
What do you think?

850
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,140
Can I get rich?

851
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,660
Not bad.

852
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
Not bad?

853
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,890
Just not bad?

854
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,640
This is mine...

855
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,080
It's already mine.

856
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,430
Don't take it back.

857
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,440
It’s you!

858
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,030
Mu Nan suspects me.

859
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,220
You suspect me too?

860
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,020
Am I that kind of person?

861
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,140
You're right.

862
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,740
I'm your boss.

863
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,280
If you ruin me,

864
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,580
you'll have nothing to gain here.

865
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,250
Although you may not respect me

866
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,660
because I'm a woman,

867
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,480
You don't have to report me.

868
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,820
You think so?

869
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,460
What else can I think?

870
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,660
I never mean to

871
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,820
disrespect you

872
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,060
just because you're a woman.

873
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,540
I don't believe it.

874
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,460
All Men and women have hands.

875
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,460
They fight the world with their own skills.

876
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,620
Why can't women

877
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,840
lead troops?

878
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,740
Do you really think this way?

879
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,680
Of course.

880
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,180
If I were you,

881
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,780
I wouldn't believe the rumors.

882
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,980
I'll talk to the Emperor directly.

883
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,620
Who is talking nonsense here?

884
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,460
Father.

885
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,820
Marshal.

886
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,140
Your name is Chen Yan?

887
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,020
Marshal.

888
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,780
Do you still remember me?

889
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,410
Just because you're new here,

890
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,960
and you've gained some merits,

891
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,310
How dare you talk nonsense here?

892
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,310
Marshal,

893
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,960
I think

894
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,960
the military camp is the fairest place.

895
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,260
We don't judge anyone

896
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,950
by background and gender.

897
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,110
We sacrifice

898
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,430
our lives.

899
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,130
Anyone can make achievements.

900
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,290
If the Gu City Army is not like that,

901
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,830
then I

902
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,160
come to the wrong place.

903
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,940
How dare you say this

904
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,970
in front of me?

905
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,570
Tell me, how should I punish you?

906
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,070
Father.

907
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,880
Chen Yan didn't mean

908
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,510
to contradict you.

909
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,680
Please don't blame him.

910
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,500
What you said just now

911
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,460
is true?

912
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
Marshal.

913
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,300
I'm sincere.

914
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,500
Fine.

915
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,370
I'll let you redeem yourself

916
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,460
and be the vanguard of the west side attack

917
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,380
to assist General Cao in the battle.

918
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
Hurry up and thank the Marshal.

919
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,980
He gave you a chance to make contributions.

920
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,930
Thank you, Marshal.

921
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,130
All right, you may leave.

922
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,390
Wait.

923
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,830
I can't go to the battlefield tomorrow.

924
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,250
Kill more Jinghe soldiers for me.

925
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,140
Father.

926
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,300
I was wrong.

927
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,860
I let you down.

928
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,980
Tell me then.

929
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,210
How do you

930
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,250
let father down?

931
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,180
I was too naive.

932
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,130
I thought it was too simple.

933
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,700
Since I came to Gu City,

934
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,140
I've been making mistakes

935
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,500
and disgraced you.

936
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,940
But do you know

937
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,210
why you made a mistake?

938
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,160
Maybe

939
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,120
women shouldn't join the army.

940
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,810
Do you

941
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,680
really mean it?
