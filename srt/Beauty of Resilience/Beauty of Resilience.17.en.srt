[Episode 17]

4
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
So what the devil said

5
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,579
is true.

6
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,820
I always thought

7
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,060
you were protecting Wei Zhi.

8
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,540
I didn't expect that you want to kill her.

9
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,100
No.

10
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,820
Impossible.

11
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,730
What is this?

12
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,530
That's right.

13
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,780
This is the fragment of Phoenix's spirit.

14
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,060
Hua Rong

15
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,100
has been guarded by us Demon Clan

16
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,660
in secret

17
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
for tens of thousands of years,

18
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,360
waiting for the day

19
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,060
when Phoenix awakens.

20
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,870
Everyone thinks

21
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,420
I want to kill Phoenix.

22
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,180
In fact, they are wrong.

23
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,060
Since ancient times,

24
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,500
Phoenix has been the spiritual leader

25
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,579
of the Demon Clan.

26
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,780
What we need to do

27
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
is to protect her bloodline,

28
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,860
help her achieve Nirvana,

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,980
and let her lead us

30
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,820
to break into the Heavenly Court.

31
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,100
So everything you did

32
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,940
was for the Phoenix's awakening?

33
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,780
Of course.

34
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,329
The one who wants to kill Phoenix

35
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,140
is the Heaven Realm.

36
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,980
Since we're protecting Phoenix,

37
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,380
so whoever

38
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,780
wants to hurt Phoenix

39
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,780
is our enemy.

40
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,700
The first one is

41
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
Yan Yue.

42
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,450
I don't believe it.

43
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,770
When you believe it,

44
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,820
everything will be too late.

45
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,459
Every second

46
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,540
when Wei Zhi and Yan Yue are together

47
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,660
is dangerous.

48
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,260
So,

49
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,660
where is Phoenix?

50
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,780
This is between Wei Zhi and me.

51
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,380
It has nothing to do with you.

52
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,460
I don't want to hurt the innocent.

53
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,020
I advise you

54
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,460
to stay out of it.

55
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,140
It's not up to you

56
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,540
whether I'm in or not.

57
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,220
Ou Ya.

58
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,700
What are you doing?

59
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,260
Wei Zhi.

60
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,220
Do you know

61
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,580
who the person in front of you is?

62
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,900
He is Red Sun God,

63
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,780
the son of Heavenly Emperor.

64
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,580
I know that.

65
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,090
No, you don't.

66
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,450
Red Sun God's enemy is Phoenix.

67
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,380
Killing Phoenix is his mission.

68
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,780
He just wanted to kill you.

69
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,700
Don't talk nonsense.

70
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,340
Wei Zhi, why don't you trust me?

71
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,580
If I hadn't arrived in time,

72
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,580
you would have died

73
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,900
under his Chixiao Sword.

74
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,460
Yan Yue, tell me.

75
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,700
It's not true.

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,980
It's true.

77
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,460
Heavenly Emperor ordered me

78
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,780
to kill Phoenix.

79
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,900
And you,

80
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Phoenix,

81
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,900
are a threat to the Three Realms.

82
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,780
You have caused misery to the Three Realms.

83
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,100
My duty

84
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,140
is to maintain peace in the Three Realms

85
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,260
and

86
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,220
to kill Phoenix.

87
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,580
Besides,

88
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,580
my mother

89
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,020
died because of you.

90
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,700
This is fate.

91
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,780
You can't stop me.

92
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,780
I don't care

93
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,980
if it's destiny or not.

94
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,700
As long as I'm here,

95
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,700
no one can hurt her.

96
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,140
Take Wei Zhi away.

97
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,830
Come with me.

98
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,020
There's no time to explain.

99
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,220
Wei Zhi.

100
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,540
Are you okay?

101

Am I good

104
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,360
as Red Sun God?

105
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,220
So

106
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,820
the power of Red Sun God

107
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,700
is used to

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,060
or if he's dead.

195
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,340
Enough.

196
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,340
You're taking all the medicine

197
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,700
from the mansion.

198
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,820
Are you going to see he die?

199
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Brother.

200
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,220
The prophet said

201
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,700
Ou Ya's feelings for Phoenix

202
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,460
are an irresistible attachment

203
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,980
of the Demon Clan.

204
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,450
His feelings for me are true love.

205
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,590
I just want to confirm

206
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,460
if I've loved the wrong person

207
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,280
for all these years.

208
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,060
All right. You're not loving the wrong person.

209
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,580
He asked His Majesty

210
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,740
to restore his engagement with you.

211
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,820
Really?

212
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,940
What did His Majesty say?

213
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,860
He said

214
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,060
it's up to you.

215
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,580
No wonder they say you can't stop a woman in love.

216
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,740
Ou Ya.

217
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,860
What took you so long?

218
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,700
It hurts.

219
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,220
My injury...

220
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,580
My injury...

221
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,460
For tens of thousands of years,

222
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,820
the Heavenly Clan besieged Phoenix several times,

223
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,340
but they never found Hua Rong in the Demon Realm,

224
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,220
so that it kept awakening.

225
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,700
Now Hua Rong is withering,

226
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,340
which means the Phoenix's spirit is dead

227
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,580
and has no intention of awakening again.

228
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,100
Father,

229
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,340
you don't need to worry about Phoenix's awakening anymore.

230
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
It hurts.

231
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,980
Take it slow.

232
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,590
It hurts.

233
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,620
Don't move.

234
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,500
Su.

235
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,700
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,340
It's all my fault.

237
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,580
I made you worry about me.

238
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,700
It's all in the past.

239
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,860
Everything is fine now.

240
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,860
Tell me.

241
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,100
How did you

242
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,340
escape

243
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,220
from that demon?

244
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
I told him

245
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,220
Wei Zhi's whereabouts.

246
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,980
What?

247
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,860
You betrayed Wei Zhi?

248
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,820
I was so wrong about you.

249
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
I thought you were so smart

250
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,180
and brave.

251
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,980
I didn't expect you to betray her.

252
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,580
Su,

253
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,050
hear me out.

254
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,860
Actually, we were all wrong.

255
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
About what?

256
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,980
The one who wanted to kill Wei Zhi

257
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,340
was Yan Yue.

258
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,220
The supreme lord of the Demon Clan

259
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,420
was to protect her.

260
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,420
Yan Yue?

261
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,940
Yes.

262
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,580
In this world,

263
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,060
only the Red Sun God's Chixiao Sword

264
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,220
can kill Phoenix.

265
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,460
And Yan Yue is Red Sun God.

266
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,060
The supreme lord of the Demon Clan

267
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,500
was to protect her,

268
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,100
so I told him her whereabouts.

269
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,220
That's what happened.

270
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,410
How is Wei Zhi now?

271
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,180
From now on,

272
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,140
Wei Zhi is no longer alive

273
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,380
in this world.

274
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,140
You mean

275
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,300
Wei Zhi...

276
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,140
Yan Yue loved Wei Zhi

277
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,020
and protected Wei Zhi so much.

278
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,700
It turns out to be a lie?

279
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,500
To kill Phoenix

280
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,460
was Yan Yue's duty.

281
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,300
He had no choice.

282
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,380
What are you talking about?

283
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,500
All I know is

284
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,380
he used Wei Zhi's feelings for him.

285
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,940
Where is this heartless man now?

286
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,660
Tell me.

287
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm going to find him now.

288
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,980
I'm going to ask him if he has a conscience.

289
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,530
Su.

290
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,420
Su.

291
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,500
Calm down.

292
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,460
Yan Yue has taken Hua Rong back

293
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,660
to the Heaven Realm.

294
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,660
How could this happen?

295
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,380
Wei Zhi is dead.

296
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,940
You must be very sad.

297
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,500
If you want to go to the Heaven Realm

298
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,660
to avenge Wei Zhi's death,

299
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,420
I will be with you.

300
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,060
If you want to vent your anger,

301
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
or if you want to cry,

302
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,700
I'll be with you too.

303
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,780
Su.

304
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,380
I don't need you to be with me venting my anger.

305
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,220
I don't need you to cry with me.

306
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,460
I just hope,

307
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,500
from now on,

308
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,300
we'll be together every day.

309
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,180
We'll be happy

310
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,780
and laugh together.

311
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,780
Lan Su,

312
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,420
will you marry me?

313
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,220
I've fulfilled my mission.

314
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,780
You don't need to

315
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,300
keep following and monitoring me anymore, right?

316
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
Are you okay?

317
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,220
I'm fine.

318
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,740
Yi'er.

319
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,150
Yan Yue,

320
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,860
why did you kill Phoenix?

321
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,660
No reason.

322
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,670
It was my duty.

323
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,980
All beings are equal.

324
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,700
God is benevolent.

325
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,140
Wei Zhi was indeed

326
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,220
Phoenix in this life,

327
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,980
but

328
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,700
it was not up to her.

329
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,900
She didn't do anything evil.

330
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,700
Why did you kill

331
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,380
a living life?

332
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,460
At this point,

333
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,180
nothing can be changed.

334
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,940
It's useless to say more.

335
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,900
Besides, killing Phoenix

336
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,250
can not only

337
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,020
solve the crisis of the Three Realms,

338
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,220
but also consolidate the position of the Heaven Realm.

339
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,130
You're disappointing me.

340
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,540
It turns out that

341
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,700
you're the most sophiscated one.

342
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,980
After all,

343
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,980
you just wanted to prove yourself

344
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,060
in front of Heavenly Emperor

345
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,460
and enhance your image in front of all beings,

346
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,380
so that you could consolidate

347
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,660
your position as Red Sun God.

348
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,940
You are so hypocritical.

349
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,220
Yi.

350
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,300
You've gone too far.

351
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,140
What Yan Yue did

352
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,620
was the order of Heavenly Emperor.

353
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,860
He had no choice.

354
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,460
I hate you.

355
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
I hate this place.

356
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,660
Your Majesty,

357
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,300
is there anything I can do for you?

358
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,020
We don't need this anymore.

359
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,380
Throw it away.

360
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,260
Your Majesty,

361
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,300
you made this for Heavenly Emperor.

362
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,860
It's a pity if you throw it away.

363
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,220
What are you going to

364
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,850
throw away?

365
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,020
Your Majesty.

366
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,220
What is this?

367
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,420
This is the black sesame I made.

368
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,660
It can replenish energy

369
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,780
and darken hair.

370
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,140
Now Phoenix is dead.

371
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,700
Your Majesty doesn't need it anymore.

372
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,220
You've put your love into it.

373
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,700
Let me try.

374
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,510
Not bad.

375
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,380
My dear,

376
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,420
you don't need to

377
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,220
bother these

378
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,860
folk prescriptions anymore.

379
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,900
From now on,

380
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,980
everything will go back on track.

381
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,740
Yes.

382
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,300
Keep an eye

383
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,140
on Yi'er.

384
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
She'll take your place

385
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,180
sooner or later.

386
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,980
It's not appropriate for her

387
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,980
to behave like this now.

388
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,300
As for Yan Luo…

389
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,940
Yan Luo behaves well.

390
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,060
You don't have to

391
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,390
take responsibility for his actions.

392
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,300
He is also my son.

393
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,620
Let him learn from Yan Yue.

394
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,220
Yes.

395
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,110
Take care, Your Majesty.

396
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,740
Red Sun God,

397
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,280
what brings you here?

398
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,370
Why has this land

399
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,700
become like this?

400
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Yingzhou is the most sensitive place

401
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,060
in the Three Realms.

402
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,900
It has been affected

403
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,260
by the death of Phoenix.

404
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,600
Why don't you

405
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,180
leave it to me?

406
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,900
You?

407
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,140
You're Red Sun God. You're going to farm?

408
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,620
Fine.

409
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,700
Let's begin.

410
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,300
Rain God,

411
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,060
tell me.

412
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,700
What's wrong

413
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,170
with Red Sun God?

414
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,180
He just won an honor

415
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,060
and got rewarded,

416
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
but

417
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,300
he seems

418
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,690
unhappy.

419
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,860
Yan Yue is known

420
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,620
for his poker face

421
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,700
in the Heaven Realm.

422
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,860
How did you know

423
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
whether he's happy

424
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,740
or unhappy?

425
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,940
You taught me.

426
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,060
You can't only look at people with your eyes,

427
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,500
but also experience it with your heart.

428
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,780
Do you think

429
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,620
I'm happy or not?

430
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,260
You're happy when the land is fertile.

431
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,100
If people eat well, you'll be happy.

432
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,460
You'll be happy

433
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,380
if I do a good job at deinsectisation.

434
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,780
Am I right?

435
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,260
You've become smarter,

436
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,660
but Yan Yue is different from me.

437
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,220
Because he has the identity and mission

438
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,260
as Red Sun God.

439
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,540
He can't be happy

440
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,260
for his own happiness.

441
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,780
He can't also be sad

442
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,540
for his own sadness.

443
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Most of the time,

444
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,900
he needs to hide his emotions

445
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,380
and do things

446
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
he doesn't want to,

447
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,060
but he has to do.

448
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,860
So he goes farming?

449
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,460
I don't understand.

450
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,920
You don't need to understand.

451
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:58,730
♫A breeze is rustling through falling flowers. Who's as bright as a painting?♫

452
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:06,040
♫I'm holding myself back. How should I tell you I miss you so much through different lifes?♫

453
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,050
♫I hope I wouldn't have to wake up from the dream and spend winters and summers with you♫

454
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,180
♫However, the past memories came to me and made me anxious♫

455
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:27,990
♫I'm struggling alone in the deep love across the world♫

456
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:35,260
♫There's a glimmer in the past memories that I can't let go♫

457
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,260
♫Even if it's a tribulation of love, I'm willing to take it. I cried to the moon until there's no more tears to shed♫

458
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,950
♫It's hard to choose the love of my life. I miss you, but there's no place to talk about my feelings♫

459
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:55,770
♫I only hate that I was born with my destiny. How can I talk about family?♫

460
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:03,150
♫Everything in the world is fate. Although it's hard to let go of grace and hatred, I can't break my promise♫

461
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,190
♫I won't let people down. I won't betray true love. Let's experience the world together♫

462
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:17,420
♫Time flies. I spent time and prosperity with you♫

463
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:30,050
♫Time flies. I spent time and prosperity with you♫

464
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,980
Are you leaving?

465
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,860
Yes.

466
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,700
It's time to go.

467
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,700
I'll come back

468
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,220
when they ear.

469
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,970
Okay.

470
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,460
Thank you.

471
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,420
Rain God,

472
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,460
this land is refreshed now.

473
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,740
Why aren't you happy?

474
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,260
How did you know?

475
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,630
Your eyes look foggy.

476
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,500
Maybe

477
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,660
I'm worried about Yan Yue.

478
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,650
Yan Yue is Red Sun God.

479
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
In the Three Realms,

480
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,940
his position is only lower than His Majesty.

481
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,660
Why are you worried about him?

482
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,620
Tao,

483
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,220
you're right.

484
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,720
♫The branches' falling made a splash♫

485
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,360
♫There are too many memories♫

486
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,540
I've never seen

487
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,940
such a beautiful scene.

488
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,360
♫It's hard to let go of it♫

489
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,890
No wonder everyone wants to be an immortal.

490
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,700
♫Who answered every word?♫

491
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,740
You just said

492
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,920
being an immortal is boring.

493
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,020
♫I wander around to find him♫

494
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,500
I just realized

495
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,390
♫It has been many years♫

496
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,700
what a beautiful view it is.

497
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,420
It's so beautiful

498
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,650
♫Even if I will die and never come back♫

499
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,740
that I can do anything for it.

500
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,270
♫I'll be with you forever♫

501
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,680
Ordinary mortals

502
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,860
will never see this scene

503
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,220
in their lives.

504
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,470
♫The two ends that can't be cut off♫

505
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,240
You're lucky.

506

♫Only our love is unchanging♫

511
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,060
Maybe I was lucky

512
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,670
♫The two ends that can't be cut off♫

513
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,660
when I was young.

514
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,800
♫I can't see through the dark night♫

515
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,220
Back then, I had everything.

♫The night is so cold that it's hard to keep warm♫

522
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,500
because of me.

523

After that,

524
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,690
I am nothing.

525
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,300
I have nothing.

526
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,540
No matter where I go,

527
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,900
people don't like me.

528
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,060

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,060
Just like the sun,

♫The loneliness that can't be cut off♫

537
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,940

This is the Demon Realm.

Demon Realm?

Have you forgotten?

00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,900
That day

560
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,980
I brought you here

561
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,060
to get rid of Yan Yue's chase.

Don't be afraid.

565

Ou Ya and I

567
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,700
fought our hardest to stop the Fire Attack

568
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,460
and saved you

569
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,260
from Yan Yue's Chixiao Sword.

570
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,500
I don't know about that.

571
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,900
I know nothing.

572
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,610
It's okay.

573
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,500
It's all in the past.

574
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,260
Where's Ou Ya?

575
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,860
Don't worry.

576
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,060
He has returned to the Demon Realm.

577
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,060
But

578
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,020
Yan Yue took Hua Rong away.

579
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,900
Now the Heaven Realm has obtained Hua Rong.

580
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,480
It's hard to restore the power of Phoenix.

581
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,500
But I'm willing to accompany you

582
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,980
to live a peaceful life

583
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,500
in the Demon Realm.

584
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,130
Who are you?

585
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
I am Mu Nan.

586
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,850
I was your closest family in your previous life.

587
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,060
I'm also the one who protects Phoenix.

588
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,460
In my previous life?

589
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,050
Your memories of your previous life were sealed,

590
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,380
but I believe one day

591
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,660
you will remember

592
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,020
everything about me.

593
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,060
In my previous life,

594
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,220
Phoenix was also killed by Red Sun God?

595
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,860
It happened in every life.

596
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
Please get out first.

597
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,460
I want to be alone.

598
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
But your wound...

599
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,500
I told you to leave.

600
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,270
Okay.

601
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,210
What are you doing?

602
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,220
It hurts. Let go.

603
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,940
It hurts. Let go.

604
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,140
Why did you come here again?

605
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,180
You are an immortal from the Heaven Realm.

606
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,900
This is the Demon Realm.

607
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
You shouldn't be here.

608
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm here to see you.

609
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,420
I've heard

610
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,940
about Phoenix.

611
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,500
I know

612
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,730
you must feel sad.

613
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,100
This is maltose from the Human Realm.

614
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,420
When you taste something sweet,

615
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,100
you won't feel that bad in your heart.

616
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,780
Thank you.

617
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,980
Do you want me to chat with you?

618
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,820
No.

619
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,540
How about

620
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,260
you just cry?

621
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,420
When others

622
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,060
feel sad,

623
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,900
if they can cry out loud,

624
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,140
they won't feel that bad.

625
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,740
Where are you going?

626
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,380
Why are you ignoring me again?

627
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,900
Did I say anything wrong?

628
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,820
Come with me.

629
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,280
♫The sunset is just right♫

630
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,090
♫It's like a dream♫

631
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,570
You'll know when you come.

632
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,170
♫If you take the beauty♫

633
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,020
♫In your eyes♫

634
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,170
♫Don't make the love too strong♫

635
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,430
♫How much it entangles♫

636
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,500
♫The thoughts♫

637
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,150
♫The hourglass along your fingers♫

638
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,060
♫Where do we go from here?♫

639
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,530
♫Spread out your palm♫

640
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,660
♫If all your obsessions are empty♫

641
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,180
Try it.

642
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,240
♫Remembering the past♫

643
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,750
♫All that you've given me♫

644
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,670
♫A little more touching♫

645
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,300
♫A little less frightened♫

646
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,150
♫How many times I've been in love♫

647
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,990
♫The more fate plays tricks on me♫

648
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,900
♫The more I sing the praises of love's nirvana♫

649
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,820
Why are all these carved by you

650
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,250
have no face?

651
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,270
♫A wisp of dust and sorrow♫

652
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,250
♫Blow away like the wind♫

653
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,820
I don't know.

654
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,510
♫Who plays on his heart in tears?♫

655
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,430
I've always been like this.

656
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,620
But honestly,

657
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,060
I think

658
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,550
♫I can't help but reach out♫

659
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,540
they will look more vivid

660
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,420
♫To the thoughts♫

661
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,900
and better

662
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,430
♫Don't ask, don't tell♫

663
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,980
if they have the five sense organs.

664
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,330
What do you think?

665
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,000
♫Just hold each other♫

666
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,150
♫Fold a feather of tenderness♫

667
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,460
♫And it's immortal♫

668

♫Believe in love and loneliness♫

669
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,280
♫Learn to be foolish and brave♫

670
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,720
♫It's hard to turn back♫

671
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,860
It's me.

672
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,790
♫Don't say anything. I don't want to listen♫

673
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,390
♫Just hold each other♫

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,610

♫Even if it's a dream♫

681
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm hungry.

682
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,060
Aunt isn't here.

683
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,170
Fortunately, she didn't find out.

684
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,970
Great.

685
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,060
Otherwise, I'll be scolded again.

686
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,580
You're back.

687
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,900
Would you like some water?

688
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,500
How about

689
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,180
I make you some snow fungus soup for you?

690
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,460
It's good for your skin.

691
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
Where else do you want to go?

692
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,900
Your Majesty.

693
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,290
Aunt.

694
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,090
I...

695
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,140
I was wrong.

696
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,820
I won't do it again.

697
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,540
Yi'er,

698
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,340
you are an immortal from the Heaven Realm.

699
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,810
You always come to the Demon Realm

700
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,010
and even get involved with

701
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,140
that supreme lord of the Demon Clan.

702
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,130
How inappropriate!

703
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
From now on,

704
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,950
you are not allowed to leave the Heaven Realm.

705
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,270
You're grounded to reflect on your mistakes.

706
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,050
Your Majesty,

707
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,760
please

708
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,780
don't ground me to let me reflect on my mistakes.

709
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,270
It's so boring

710
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,140
in the Heavenly Court.

711
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,800
I'll be bored to death.

712
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,160
You are my niece,

713
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,870
Yan Yue's fiancee

714
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,380
and the future Heavenly Empress.

715
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,580
You have to watch

716
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,580
your words and behaviors.

717
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,580
I don't want to be

718
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,980
the future Heavenly Empress.

719
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,980
I never thought about

720
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,860
marrying Yan Yue.

721
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,820
I don't understand

722
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,060
why our marriage

723
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,820
was decided since birth?

724
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,740
You married Heavenly Emperor,

725
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,900
and I

726
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,340
will marry Yan Yue.

727
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,060
But no one ever asked

728
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,100
whether

729
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,140
we're willing or not,

730
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,300
and whether we have feelings or not…

731
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,460
This is the rule of the Heaven Realm.

732
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,130
No wonder Phoenix wants to fight the Heavenly Court

733
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,790
and break the rules.

734
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,200
Yi'er,

735
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,050
You're grounded. Reflect on your mistakes.
