4
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,760
You're here.

5
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,620
What should come

6
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,750
will come eventually.

7
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,950
Since the Phoenix Illusion

8
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,280
appeared in the Immortal-Revealing Mirror,

9
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,380
this day

10
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,240
will definitely come.

11
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,850
But I didn't expect

12
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,079
it would come so soon.

13
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,450
Your magic

14
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,730
can only cover the surface.

15
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,710
My aging and death

16
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,270
are inevitable.

17
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,930
Yan Yue has gone to the Human Realm.

18
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,460
Let's wait for his news.

19
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,070
That's the only way.

20
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,560
Sister!

21
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,320
Stop!

22
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,890
Didn't you

23
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,100
go to be the bride of the cripple?

24
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,980
Why are you here?

25
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,500
The engagement is canceled.

26
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,600
Your mother accepted the betrothal gifts from the Chun family.

27
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,660
How could they let you go?

28
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,440
Master saved me.

29
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,450
Master?

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,890
Why did he save you?

31
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,860
I know.

32
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,980
You must have been shameless

33
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,290
to seduce Master and to beg him to save you.

34
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,580
Shameless!

35
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,060
How could you seduce the Master

36
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,260
after seducing Brother Ming Lang?

37
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,660
What's wrong with you?

38
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,580
Sister.

39
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,700
Why are we so unlucky?

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,220
We have

41
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,380
such a vamp by our side.

42
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,230
Wei Zhi.

43
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,070
You're good.

44
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,950
Let's wait and see.

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
You scared me.

46
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,340
Where did you go with Yan Yue today?

47
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,110
I had some problems today.

48
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
Master helped me out.

49
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,280
Problems?

50
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,370
If you had problems,

51
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,430
why didn't you ask me?

52
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm willing to help you.

53
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,690
And I'll be very happy

54
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,630
to help you.

55
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,990
Don't go to…

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,159
Don't go to Yan Yue.

57
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,990
I mean it.

58
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,220
I'm better than Yan Yue.

59
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,140
Really, Wei Zhi.

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,550
I'm better than Yan Yue.

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,659
If you have any problem next time,

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,370
just come straight to me.

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll wait for you here.

64
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,810
Wei Zhi, trust me.

65
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,630
Really, Wei Zhi.

66
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,380
And I'll be more than happy

67
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,460
to help you.

68
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,220
It's true.

69
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,570
Trust me, Wei Zhi.

70
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,620
Su.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,060
Why are you here?

72
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,140
Why am I here?

73
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,900
I should ask

74
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,930
why you are here.

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,580
Why are you

76
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,660
in front of a woman's room?

77
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,600
I...

78
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,220
Well…

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,140
I know Wei Zhi

80
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,140
had a little trouble.

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,340
So I came to check on her.

82
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,790
Wei Zhi is a nobody.

83
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,030
How dare she seduce you?

84
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,610
You were so nice to Wei Lingyue.

85
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,310
I tolerated it,

86
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,070
because she's the Phoenix.

87
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
But what are your intentions

88
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,810
to that woman inside?

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,730
Su,

90
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,120
don't think too much.

91
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,880
Sometimes,

92
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,550
what you see is not always true,

93
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,170
right?

94
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,580
If you don't tell the truth,

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,659
I'll go in and kill her now.

96
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,730
I...

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,070
Actually, I don't understand it myself.

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,140
It's just that

99
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,820
when I can't see her,

100
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,010
I want to see her.

101
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,270
After seeing her,

102
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,950
I want to talk to her

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,050
and follow her.

104
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,460
And I really want to care about her.

105
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,020
-Enough! -I…

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,310
I'm going to skin her

107
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,240
and pull out her tendons now.

108
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,680
I'll let her die a bloody death

109
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,160
so that you can never see her again.

110
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,170
Lan Su.

111
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,810
Lan Su.

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,320
Lan Su, I'm warning you.

113
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,610
Stop messing around.

114
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,940
If you dare to hurt her,

115
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,900
even a hair of hers,

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,330
I won't let you off.

117
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,330
Su...

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,790
Su...

119
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,870
Prophet.

120
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:56,800
How is it?

121
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,800
What did you see?

122
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,909
Ou Ya.

123
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,140
In this world,

124
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,380
if you meet a woman

125
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,210
whom you can't help falling in love with,

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,790
you must do whatever it takes

127
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,490
to keep her.

128
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,520
A woman whom I can't help falling in love with?

129
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,330
And I need to keep her?

130
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,670
Why, Prophet?

131
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,420
If

132
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,060
you can't keep her,

133
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,150
keep her body instead.

134
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,650
If I can't keep her,

135
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,470
keep her body.

136
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,340
Could it be

137
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,030
what the prophet said?

138
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,640
Father,

139
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,400
in the mortal world,

140
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,520
I felt the sense of compassion

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,230
and saved a student of mine.

142
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,330
I changed her fate without permission.

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,900
I know I've violated the heavenly rules,

144
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,080
so I came to ask for your forgiveness.

145
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,110
Is that true?

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,110
Yes.

147
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,000
But what Yan intended was to help the weak.

148
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,110
It was meant good.

149
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,920
Your Majesty,

150
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,480
please be lenient with him.

151
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,230
Yan Yue,

152
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,670
you changed the fate of others without permission

153
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,340
and violated the heavenly rules.

154
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,110
As the God of Red Sun,

155
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,340
you should be an example to all immortals,

156
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,900
but you deliberately break the rules.

157
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,929
If I don't punish you severely,

158
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,400
how can I face the others?

159
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,730
I'm willing to

160
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,030
accept the punishment.

161
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,570
Yan Yue,

162
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,790
I've removed

163
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,670
200 years of your spiritual power

164
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,340
and temporarily sealed half of your cultivation

165
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,440
as a punishment.

166
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,750
If you do it again,

167
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,810
you will be severely punished.

168
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,400
Yes, Father.

169
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,750
How is the search for the Phoenix going?

170
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,140
Your Majesty,

171
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
Wei Lingyue from the Wei Mansion is talented

172
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,990
and extraordinary.

173
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
However, the blood of the phoenix is hidden deep,

174
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,470
we still can't determine.

175
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,740
the Divine Lord will add

176
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,470
questions targeted to the Phoenix's characteristics

177
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,820
in the Mid-Autumn Exam

178
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,840
to sound them out.

179
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,340
I've checked

180
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,580
those questions.

181
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
They are not sharp questions.

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,510
How can we force the Phoenix out with them?

183
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,670
Add this level

184
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,200
to the Mid-Autumn Exam.

185
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,280
Yes.

186
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,900
However,

187
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,860
the Divine Lord has arranged

188
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,680
the test questions.

189
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,950
If we're going to add a level,

190
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,290
should I discuss it with him?

191
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,220
No need.

192
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,950
He's been in the mortal world

193
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,140
for too long.

194
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,650
The mortal world is chaotic

195
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,410
and can disturb one's mind.

196
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,440
As you saw just now,

197
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,800
he broke the heavenly rules

198
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,180
for a mortal.

199
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,290
He can't distinguish the priorities.

200
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,570
We should make a decisive decision

201
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,930
and use this Mid-Autumn Exam

202
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,170
to force the Phoenix out.

203
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

204
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,480
Yan Yue,

205
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,690
try this tea.

206
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,210
It's from the ten thousand year old tea tree from the East.

207
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,860
These years,

208
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,420
the tea production is getting less and less.

209
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,440
All these years,

210
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,040
there have been endless disasters in the mortal world.

211
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,990
Even the emperors, the generals and the lords

212
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,460
don't have good tea,

213
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,140
let alone

214
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,540
the fairy tea from the Heaven Realm.

215
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,370
Are you here

216
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,690
to see me for something?

217
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,640
You're not here just to drink tea with me, are you?

218
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,210
Mother,

219
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,870
I have something

220
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,210
to ask you.

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,640
Go ahead.

222
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,400
Since I went to the mortal world,

223
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,960
I often saw

224
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,360
the future

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,270
of an irrelevant mortal girl.

226
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,420
Is she the student

227
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,280
you saved?

228
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,860
Yes.

229
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,170
In the illusion,

230
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,390
I saw her burning in the fire.

231
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,530
That's why

232
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,950
I had compassion for her

233
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,970
and saved her.

234
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,920
But the illusion is still there.

235
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,040
It seems that this disaster

236
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,830
is not her final fate.

237
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,870
I also

238
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,890
measured her immortal bones many times.

239
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,010
She's just a mortal.

240
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Nothing special.

241
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,190
All the future

242
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,950
is decided by the present.

243
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,890
Whether you're human or immortal,

244
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,210
it's hard to know the past

245
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,160
and face the present,

246
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,550
not to mention predicting the future.

247
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,830
I'm dumb.

248
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,680
Please enlighten me more clearly.

249
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,650
Ever since I took charge of time,

250
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,620
I know time is unmeasurable

251
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,080
and unpredictable.

252
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,940
Those illusions

253
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,340
might not have a special meaning.

254
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,730
Maybe they're just some time dust

255
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,680
that's been omitted.

256
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,680
Okay.

257
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,450
Look at me.

258
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Look at me.

259
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,980
You...

260
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,740
Alright.

261
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,920
Everyone,

262
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,810
three days later,

263
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,450
it'll be our

264
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,720
annual Mid-Autumn Festival gathering.

265
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,180
Besides

266
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,600
the custom of dusting and cleaning,

267
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,170
there is also

268
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,420
an important assessment project.

269
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,190
Master Yan Yue

270
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,950
will tell you

271
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,770
the rules of the exam.

272
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,460
In this Mid-Autumn Exam,

273
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,230
you will be divided to different teams by drawing lots.

274
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,820
The two people

275
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,480
who drew the same constellation will pair up

276
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,900
to take the exam

277
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,290
and to be ranked.

278
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,520
Now,

279
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,180
start drawing lots.

280
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,970
I'll go first.

281
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,030
A Ghost at the very beginning.

282
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,930
It's omninous.

283
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,800
Ming Lang.

284
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,610
What did you draw?

285
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,430
Golden Dragon.

286
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,020
Another Ghost card.

287
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,250
Liu Chang, we're in a team.

288
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,860
Liu Chang.

289
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,700
What?

290
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
We are in a team.

291
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,700
We'll be No.1 in the world.

292
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,580
What are you talking about?

293
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Compete with me.

294
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,220
What do you want?

295
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,580
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,810
It's okay.

298
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,740
It's okay.

299
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,210
[Moonheart Fox, Golden Dragon]

300
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,380
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,980
You're not competent at all.

302
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,620
How dare you!

303
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,200
Wei Zhi.

304
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,420
Here's your card.

305
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,340
Thank you, Lady Jingyue.

306
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,220
The drawing is over.

307
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,030
Those who draw the same constellation,

308
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,750
stand together.

309
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,180
Come on, let's stand together.

310
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,060
Brother Ming Lang,

311
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,580
I've drawn the Golden Dragon.

312
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,460
What about you?

313
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,870
Me too.

314
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,200
That's great.

315
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,570
Please

316
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,830
help me

317
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,690
in this exam.

318
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,230
Moonheart Fox…

319
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,420
Which classmate

320
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,320
draw the same card with me?

321
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,630
Mine is the Moonheart Fox.

322
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,420
It's me.

323
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,380
Wei Zhi.

324
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,410
Let's work hard together.

325
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,580
I'm afraid I'll hold you back.

326
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,430
It's okay.

327
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,790
Let's practice more these days.

328
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,220
During the exam,

329
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,520
you must follow me closely.

330
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,300
That way,

331
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,560
your grades won't be too bad.

332
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Thank you, Lady Lingyue, for not disliking me.

333
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,710
I'll try my best.

334
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,870
Why are you

335
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,320
sneaking around?

336
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,480
Master.

337
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,780
I want to change a team.

338
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,740
My magic is too bad.

339
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,980
I don't want to drag Lady Lingyue down.

340
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,120
It's not fair to her.

341
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,270
Come with me.

342
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,950
Give me your hand.

343
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,790
What magic is this?

344
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,430
It's the Magic of Solar Corona,

345
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,250
coming from the sun.

346
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,460
It's the most invincible defense skill

347
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,900
in the Three Realms.

348
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,550
It can save your life

349
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,600
at the critical moment.

350
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,290
Now,

351
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,860
I'll teach you the spell of the mental methods.

352
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,070
But

353
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,430
I'll only teach you once.

354
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,010
You must listen to it carefully and remember it.

355
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,880
The Golden Sun lights up the heart.

356
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,089
The Purple Air gathers in the mind.

357
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,849
The light from the Dou Constellation

358
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,310
and the Sun

359
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,810
will melt gold and eliminate disasters.

360
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,440
Have you learned it by heart?

361
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,330
Try it.

362
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,160
The Golden…

363
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,390
The Golden what?

364
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,830
-The Golden… -The Golden Sun lights up the heart.

365
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,250
The Golden Sun lights up the heart.

366
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,080
It's my fault.

367
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,060
With your spiritual power,

368
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,220
how is it possible for you to perform

369
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,120
the Magic of Solar Corona?

370
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,290
The spiritual power

371
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,060
is enough for you to perform the Magic of Solar Corona.

372
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,670
Try again.

373

♫The two ends that can't be cut off♫

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,870

Unless the blood of the Phoenix is stimulated.

573
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,240
This is an ancient rumor.

574
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,170
Who has seen it?

575
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,190
In that case,

576
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,160
this exam is totally useless.

577
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,150
The academy educates people.

578
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,810
An exam is needed

579
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,430
to select the talented ones.

580
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,140
How can you say that the exam is useless?

581
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,990
You are right.

582
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,500
The academy is an imperial academy.

583
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,630
The exam is to select talents for the country.

584
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,150
My remark earlier was indiscreet.

585
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,780
It's just that…

586
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,180
I have another question.

587
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,540
In this exam

588
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,190
Among the top 18 students in the Immortal-Revealing Mirror,

589
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,670
do you have anyone you think highly of?

590
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,780
If not,

591
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,360
I have someone

592
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,410
who I think highly of.

593
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,730
The Phoenix is the Chosen One.

594
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,560
No one can decide it.

595
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,020
I will tell His Majesty accurately

596
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,780
what you said today.

597
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,430
Goodbye.

598
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,070
Mother.

599
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,790
Are these

600
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,290
my sister's favorite wild flowers?

601
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,190
I arrange them for myself.

602
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,410
What does it have to do with your sister?

603
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,750
Today is the day for the Mid-Autumn Exam.

604
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,940
Aren't we going to have a look?

605
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,200
No.

606
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,660
There are many people watching.

607
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,830
If someone sees us,

608
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,320
your sister will be implicated.

609
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,330
You're not little anymore.

610
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,170
You should know

611
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,650
what's going on here.

612
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,260
I really hope my sister wins.

613
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,090
You're daydreaming.

614
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,750
As long as your sister can graduate safely

615
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,980
and learn some skills,

616
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,910
in the future,

617
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,320
she won't need to be a servant anymore.

618
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,960
[Xinju Hall]

619
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,490
Parents, welcome

620
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,970
to Egret Academy

621
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,170
to watch the Mid-Autumn Exam.

622
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,380
There will be dangers in this exam.

623
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,050
One careless move,

624
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,060
it will cause damage.

625
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,270
But

626
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,950
please rest assured, parents.

627
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,820
The rules

628
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,830
will allow the trainees

629
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,770
to quit when they are not confident enough.

630
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,900
If anything goes wrong,

631
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,690
the game can be interrupted anytime.

632
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,390
So big!

633
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,970
Students,

634
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,050
please stand at the transfer point by groups

635
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,290
and start the Exam.

636
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,390
What is this place?

637
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,530
Everyone, you're already in the Pagoda of Illusion.

638
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,140
I'm the proctor.

639
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,030
Next,

640
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,110
I will announce the contents of the exam.

641
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,000
The padoda has three floors.

642
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,060
The first floor you are on

643
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,620
is the gathering hall.

644
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,250
Every floor above

645
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,530
will represent one level.

646
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,720
According to the previous draw,

647
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,370
every two of you will be a team.

648
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,060
You need to use what you've learned

649
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,550
and try your best

650
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,900
to pass the three levels of tests

651
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,830
in the Pagoda of Illusion.

652
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,830
Everytime you go up a floor,

653
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,070
the difficulty will increase.

654
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,180
The first team to reach the top

655
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,300
will be the winner.

656
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,680
What you meet in the pagoda

657
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,670
will all be illusions,

658
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,720
but you'll still get hurt

659
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,330
or even get killed.

660
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,740
This...

661
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
This is too dangerous.

662
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,460
Yeah.

663
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,540
How could this happen?

664
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,740
We can't risk our life

665
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,820
just for a competition.

666
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,490
Yeah.

667
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,040
What is this?

668
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,860
That is a flying talisman.

669
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,060
If you encounter a difficulty

670
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,270
you can't overcome,

671
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,420
or if you want to quit the game,

672
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,140
you can crumble this talisman.

673
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,070
Then you can leave this place of illusions safely

674
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,220
and terminate the exam.

675
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,490
But don't forget,

676
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,630
you'll be tested in the groups of two.

677
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,110
If one of people in a team

678
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,440
gives up the game,

679
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,670
the other

680
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,290
will be eliminated therewith.

681
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,850
You can't use it

682
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,900
unless there's absolutely no other way.

683
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,700
This forest is

684
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,780
so dark and scary.

685
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,220
We don't know what's inside.

686
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,020
We give up.

687
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,520
It's too dangerous. We'll give up too.

688
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,700
Another team left.

689
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,610
What's going on? Retreat without a fight?

690
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,870
Shame on you!

691
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,090
Don't mind them.

692
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,300
What's more important? Face or money?

693
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,620
They all received

694
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,540
the bribe from my family.

695
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,460
That's why they quit voluntarily.

696
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,610
Keep your voice down.

697
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,900
We're a team now.

698
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,030
We're on the same boat.

699
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,270
Like my old man said,

700
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,190
why bother to fight so hard

701
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,240
if you can simply solve the problem with money?

702
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,260
Besides, look at them.

703
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,620
Let's clean up some blockers first.

704
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,350
Isn't it good?

705
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,620
But isn't it cheating?

706
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,950
This is not cheating.

707
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,880
Master also said

708
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,600
this is called doing our best.

709
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,820
I guess you've known

710
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,750
how to use the talisman.

711
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,230
But remember,

712
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,790
don't panic when you're in danger.

713
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,460
It's best to quit in time.

714
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:25,980
Lastly,

715
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,580
during the exam,

716
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,969
if anyone break the rules

717
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,150
or injure others by underhand means,

718
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,719
they will be expelled from the illusions immediately.

719
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,920
Now,

720
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,820
the exam begins.

721
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,120
What...

722
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,620
What are we going to do?

723
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,239
If my guess is right,

724
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,020
we have to go through this forest

725
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,010
to pass this level.

726
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,400
That's right.

727
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,110
Before the incense burns out,

728
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,010
[Egret Academy Senior]

729
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,500
if you can walk out of the forest,

730
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,370
you'll be seen as passing the level.

731
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,050
If you haven't left the forest

732
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,260
when time is up,

733
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,300
there will be

734
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,430
unexpected consequences.

735
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,660
Just the duration of a burning joss stick?

736
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,460
Yes.

737
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,230
Let's go then.

738
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,550
Looks like I don't have any places

739
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,380
to spend my money.

740
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,980
Let's go.

741
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,210
Hurry up.

742
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,350
Are you waiting for lunch?

743
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,820
Aren't you coming with us?

744
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,490
No need.

745
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,220
We'll go first.

746
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,320
Do you want to come with us?

747
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,770
Sister.

748
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,310
Let's go together.

749
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,740
Let's go another way.

750
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,540
This way.

751
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,090
Okay.

752
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,350
Okay, let's go.

753
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,790
Let's go.

754
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,690
Come on.

755
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,140
Liu Chang, wait for me!

756
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,540
Why are you running so fast?

757
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,500
This is nothing.

758
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,860
We will be the first to pass.

759
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,230
Liu Chang,

760
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,240
am I seeing things wrong?

761
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,560
What's going on?

762
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:46,840
Look.

763
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,210
Isn't this the man at the door?

764
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,170
What the hell!

765
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,400
Are we joining forces triumphantly now?

766
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,210
Why are you two here too?

767
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,820
Are we lost?

768
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,720
We can't all get lost.

769
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,150
This forest is not simple.

770
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,010
Jingyue.

771
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,420
We can't just walk on

772
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,360
like this.

773
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,420
Where are you going?

774
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,060
Time is running out.

775
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,780
What can we

776
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,620
come up with?

777
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,720
It's better to act quickly.

778
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,700
We can't stay here.

779
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,250
Can you be rational?

780
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,860
Look.

781
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,940
Everyone is here.

782
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,460
We all came back to where we started.

783
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,260
Can't this

784
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,180
reveal the problem?

785
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,700
I don't believe it.

786
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:31,940
The Liu family tradition

787
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,890
is to charge in front.

788
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,770
You...

789
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,370
Liu Chang, wait for me!

790
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,970
Wait, Liu Chang, slow down.

791
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,040
Wait for me.

792
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,960
Can you stop doing this?

793
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,180
Mr. Liu is full of valor and vigor.

794
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,670
He's indeed a descent of a family of generals.

795
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,110
Always charge ahead in the battle.

796
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,750
This is the tradition of our Liu family.

797
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,210
If you keep hiding behind,

798
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,300
how can you call yourself a man?

799
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,900
We don't have much time.

800
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,180
We can only try to go further.

801
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,060
That's the only way.

802
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,240
Let's go.

803
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,460
Let's go.

804
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,940
Let's go. This way.

805
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,350
You're not the senior of the academy, are you?

806
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,950
Nonsense.

807
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,650
Hurry and go find your way out.

808
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,060
I've seen it.

809
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,980
Your true form

810
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,090
is a kid.

811
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,400
Why did you disguise to be my senior?

812
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,830
[The Spirit of the Pagoda of Illusion]

813
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,280
You...

814
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,360
You actually saw my true form.

815
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,600
I'm so excited.

816
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,710
Who are you?

817
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,090
I've been trapped here for thousands of years.

818
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,430
How did you see through me?

819
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,480
Me?

820
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,100
My name is Wei Zhi.

821
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,940
I won't tell you anything else.

822
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,700
Wei Zhi.

823
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,470
What a weird name.

824
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,790
You're lying, aren't you?

825
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,790
I can't see

826
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,560
any spiritual energy in you at all.

827
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,670
What about you?

828
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,630
Are you a tree spirit?

829
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,700
What?

830
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,270
You call me a tree spirit?

831
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,720
Then why are you

832
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,030
trapped in this forest?

833
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,220
I'm the pagoda spirit.

834
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,460
Everything in this illusion

835
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,210
is under my control.

836
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
You won't understand.

837
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,250
No wonder.

838
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,030
No wonder

839
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,860
you're so handsome!

840
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,100
You're totally different from all the other spirits and elves

841
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,260
I met before.

842
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:29,800
Well,

843
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,290
since you're the pagoda spirit,

844
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,860
can you take me out?

845
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,570
No, I can't break the rules.

846
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,500
Well,

847
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
can you

848
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,060
give me some advice?

849
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,340
I said no. No means no.

850
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,880
Think about it.

851
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,980
Aren't you bored

852
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,860
staying here alone?

853
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,940
Don't you want to go out?

854
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Of course.

855
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,790
But I can't get out.

856
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,650
Look at this.

857
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,640
Do you think it can help you?

858
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,070
You can't run out

859
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,200
of this forest.

860
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,150
You can't run out?

861
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,230
Should we fly out then?

862
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,690
Yes!
