[Episode 25]

4
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,100
Have you ever

5
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,260
really loved me?

6
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,160
What happened in Human Realm

7
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,579
was my romantic hardship.

8
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,500
I am no longer Chen Yan.

9
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,420
You

10
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,860
are no longer Wangyue.

11
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,340
The Phoenix has awakened.

12
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,760
There is no way

13
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,340
that we can coexist.

14
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Saintess.

15
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,980
Two against one?

16
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,380
This is not fair.

17
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,380
Yan Yue.

18
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,580
Wangyue.

19
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,780
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,700
I need to protect all beings in the world.

21
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,700
I have no other choice.

22
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,100
Who are you?

23
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,700
Why are you saving me?

24
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,820
Kid.

25
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,140
Time is running out.

26
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Let me ask you one question.

27
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,310
Do you want to save your sister or not?

28
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,980
Yes.

29
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,540
As long as I can save my sister,

30
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm willing to do anything.

31
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Sima Wangyue is the Phoenix.

32
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,540
The Phoenix is an immortal divine creature

33
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,220
that doesn't belong to the Three Realms.

34
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,980
You need to find Huarong,

35
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,350
the fragment of her primordial spirit,

36
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,670
and blend it with her blood

37
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,780
when she is reborn and awake.

38
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,220
Then the Phoenix will reappear.

39
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,260
Really?

40
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,110
That's great.

41
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,770
I'm dying.

42
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,770
I've given you

43
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,700
all my spiritual power.

44
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,900
Because you're a mortal,

45
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,780
the spiritual power

46
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,100
will slowly make you

47
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,700
lose some of your memories.

48
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,720
You only need to remember,

49
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,790
you will be the next Demon Lord

50
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,720
who has vowed to protect the Phoenix

51
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
and make the Demon Clan great again.

52
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,320
Kid.

53
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,990
Can you do it?

54
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,990
I can never repay you

55
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,460
for what you did for me.

56
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,780
I'll do what you asked.

57
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,820
I will keep my promise.

58
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,900
Wangyue.

59
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,220
I will definitely revive you

60
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,220
and make Chen Yan

61
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,900
pay the price.

62
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
That's horrible.

63
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,460
In a few seconds, the Phoenix Fire

64
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,890
burned everything into ashes.

65
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,020
It was not until Heavenly Emperor

66
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,659
ordered Rain God to pour rains

67
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,180
that the fire in Human Realm was put out.

68
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,900
If the Phoenix is to go through nirvana,

69
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,900
it will be a huge catastrophe.

70
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,900
Luckily, no matter how many times she is reborn,

71
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,020
the Red Sun God

72
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,080
will use the Chixiao Sword

73
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,990
to destroy her

74
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,120
and save the Three Realms.

75
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,660
Yan Yue.

76
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,540
What's wrong, Yan Yue?

77
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,420
Sister.

78
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,580
Why is this wound

79
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,060
still not healed?

80
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,030
Father.

81
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,820
Mother.

82
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,820
Is your wound healed?

83
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Almost.

84
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,820
Yan Yue.

85
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,250
You did a good job

86
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,700
to kill the Phoenix.

87
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,300
This pill

88
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,060
can help you recover soon.

89
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
Thank you, Father.

90
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,340
Yan Yue deserves a big reward

91
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,410
for what he did in Human Realm.

92
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,100
Why did you punish him

93
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,820
without telling him?

94
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,700
I wasn't punishing him.

95
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,740
I was helping him.

96
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,460
I will erase all his memories

97
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,100
about his trip to Human World.

98
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,700
In this way,

99
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,820
none of the things about love or hate

100
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,300
that happened between him and the Phoenix

101
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,340
will bother him anymore.

102
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,980
When he can't feel love,

103
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,180
he will have no hate.

104
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,500
Then he can be

105
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
a God of Red Sun

106
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,820
who is strong, selfless and competent.

107
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,420
It's too hard

108
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,330
let go of love.

109
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,460
This is the price

110
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,980
for being a god.

111
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,860
By the way,

112
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,180
what has Yan Luo been busy with lately?

113
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,060
Luo is in Yingzhou.

114
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,060
He

115
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,300
always hides in Yingzhou.

116
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,810
He doesn't care about

117
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,180
other things at all.

118
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,060
As the Heavenly Empress,

119
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,580
you should educate him more.

120
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,580
This is

121
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,700
your responsibility.

122
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,610
To love

123
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,620
all beings in the world

124
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,340
is great.

125
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,420
But to follow one's own heart

126
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,580
and have a carefree life

127
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,460
is also a good choice.

128
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,100
What are you carving?

129
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,300
I just feel I need to carve something.

130
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
But I don't remember

131
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,620
what it should be.

132
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,460
This is today's pill.

133
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,780
Please say thanks to my father for me.

134
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,070
What's wrong?

135
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,300
Does it hurt again?

136
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,740
It is strange.

137
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,860
In the past, my wounds healed easily.

138
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,920
But this time, the wound on the chest

139
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,180
is still not completely healed

140
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,420
even after I took the pills.

141
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,210
Qing Huan.

142
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,300
Do you know

143
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,580
how I got this wound?

144
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,220
You really

145
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,440
can't remember anything?

146
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,460
I tried to remember it.

147
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,340
But nothing came to my mind.

148
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,050
If you can't remember it,

149
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,710
just let it go.

150
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,250
No matter how deep a wound is,

151
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,740
it will heal eventually.

152
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,980
Maybe

153
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,180
it's better for you

154
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,620
to forget

155
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,060
those painful memories forever.

156
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,580
Stop!

157
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,700
Come on. Catch me.

158
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,500
Slow down.

159
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,700
Too slow.

160
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,580
Slow down.

161
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,740
Don't run so fast.

162
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,100
Gu Huaixuan is an idiot.

163
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Gu Huaixuan is an idiot.

164
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,220
Idiot.

165
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Let's go.

166
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,740
What is this?

167
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,450
[Gu City]

168
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,870
[Gucheng]

169
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,620
Sister.

170
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,060
Have you remembered everything?

171
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,580
It's like

172
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,500
I was in someone else's dream.

173
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,860
It's like a nightmare.

174
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,940
You are

175
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Mu Nan.

176
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
If Wangyue knew

177
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,460
you have done so much for her,

178
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,220
she would feel very sorry for you.

179
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,700
Sister.

180
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,580
You're Wangyue.

181
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,700
I do feel sympathetic to Wangyue,

182
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,620
but I'm not her.

183
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,270
Yes,

184
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,460
you are.

185
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,820
If I had Huarong now,

186
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,340
I would put it into your body.

187
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,340
Then you would remember

188
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,580
everything about the Phoenix.

189
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,980
Sister.

190
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,060
Let me take you to another place.

191
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,700
Where are we?

192
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,820
This is Demons Ridge.

193
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,940
It's the place

194
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,980
where demon fighters rest in peace.

195
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,930
Most of them

196
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,740
had never seen the Phoenix before they died.

197
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,100
But they all believed

198
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,460
that one day the Phoenix

199
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,500
would reshape the Three Realms.

200
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,060
Now,

201
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,300
you can give them hope.

202
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,220
This is too much

203
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,100
for me.

204
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,460
Immortals or demons.

205
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,340
The rise and fall of the Three Realms.

206
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,980
They have nothing to do with me.

207
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,420
I'm not Princess Wangyue.

208
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm not your sister.

209
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,060
I'm Wei Zhi,

210
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,820
an ordinary person.

211
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,820
But you are also the Phoenix.

212
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,860
Yan Yue

213
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,980
killed you once.

214
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,100
So this time,

215
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,340
he will try to kill you again.

216
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,740
If you don't wake up,

217
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
and don't resist,

218
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,820
the Heavenly Emperor will order him

219
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,580
to kill you again and again

220
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,980
because that is his destiny.

221
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,580
If Yan Yue meant to lie to me and kill me,

222
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,340
why am I still here?

223
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,620
Why am I still alive?

224
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,060
I have to find him.

225
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,220
I have to ask him.

226
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,460
Even if I must die,

227
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,220
I need to know the reason.

228
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,700
Don't you remember

229
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
what happened to Wangyue?

230
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,500
I'm not Wangyue.

231
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,300
I didn’t expect

232
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,690
that it's me

233
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,220
who made the Formula.

234
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,140
If I die here,

235
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,980
I won't have any regret.

236
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,540
It's been a long time

237
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,700
since our last reunion.

238
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,060
Enjoy yourselves.

239
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,940
You are in charge of the Immortal Realm.

240
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,060
You must be very busy.

241
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,850
Yan Yue has to travel around and fight against

242
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
evil forces in the Three Realms.

243
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,300
It’s not easy

244
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,780
for us to gather together.

245
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,780
Yi'er.

246
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,260
This is your favorite cake.

247
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,140
Try it.

248
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,380
I have no appetite.

249
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,940
Heavenly Emperor. Heavenly Empress.

250
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,660
There are some gifts from Yingzhou.

251
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,020
I know Yingzhou is famous

252
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,460
for its fruits and vegetables.

253
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,220
Are these beautiful plants also from there?

254
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,020
They were grown by Tao.

255
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,900
These flowers are so beautiful.

256
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,500
Yan Yue,

257
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,140
go pick a beautiful flower

258
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,460
and help Yi'er wear it in her hair.

259
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,260
No need his help.

260
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,700
I can do it myself.

261
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,700
Okay.

262
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,900
Let me help you.

263
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,460
So beautiful.

264
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,940
Yes.

265
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,380
People in Human Realm always say

266
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,860
beautiful flowers and the full moon are very precious.

267
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,500
The problem about the Phoenix has been solved.

268
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,140
So your wedding

269
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,540
should be held soon.

270
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,540
This is

271
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,860
my wish.

272
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,780
It's also your mother's.

273
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,900
-That’s right. -I…

274
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,180
I'll arrange it and choose an auspicious time for it.

275
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,180
Yan Yue,

276
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,300
this is

277
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,780
not only about you.

278
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,500
People around the world

279
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,980
will be watching it.

280
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,540
So we cannot put off the wedding

281
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,740
again and again.

282
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,020
Yes.

283
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,220
I understand, Father.

284
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,420
Kitchen God in the East Kitchen,

285
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,860
you are an descendant of the Shiguang family,

286
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,540
and a girl of noble birth.

287
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,180
In the future,

288
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,860
you should be more mature.

289
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,220
I hope you and Yan Yue

290
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,980
will be a loving couple

291
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,460
and stay with each other forever.

292
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,180
My Lord.

293
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,540
Saintess is going to Heaven Realm.

294
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,060
I have agreed.

295
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,780
I want you to go with her.

296
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,180
You must protect her.

297
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,940
If the Phoenix goes to Heaven Realm,

298
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,860
will she...

299
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,780
I have no other choice.

300
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,420
She insisted on going there.

301
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,140
This trip will make her give up hope.

302
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,420
The toxin caused by the Formula

303
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,780
is about to spread to the heart.

304
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,220
It's at death's door.

305
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,260
What about the Phoenix's scent on her?

306
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,980
What should we do with it?

307
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,700
The Devil King

308
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,660
has given me his Youling

309
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,220
which can cover up

310
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,380
the Phoenix scent

311
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,700
on her body

312
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,020
and your demon aura.

313
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,620
But it's still too dangerous.

314
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,060
What if...

315
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,940
Stop.

316
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
As long as she can give up on him,

317
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,460
I'm willing to pay any price.

318
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,420
Even

319
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,860
it's the future of Demon Realm.

320
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,620
I got it.

321
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,940
Please rest assured, my lord.

322
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,460
I will prioritize the safety

323
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,300
of Saintess over mine.

324
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,410
[Xijiao Inn]

325
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,180
Help yourselves.

326
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,740
Let's eat.

327
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,220
Try this.

328
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,790
[Wine]

329
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,940
Your magic

330
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,860
is more and more sophisticated.

331
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,980
You must

332
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,980
feel very confident

333
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,700
of taking over Gucheng.

334
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,380
What are you trying to say,

335
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,500
Lord Imperial Advisor?

336
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,460
I wonder,

337
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,060
of you and Wei Zhi,

338
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,060
who is

339
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,460
more powerful?

340
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,700
Of course my sister is.

341
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,220
Everyone says

342
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,740
the Phoenix is powerful.

343
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,220
But her blood was stimulated only once.

344
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,900
How strong can she be?

345
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,460
If I meet her now,

346
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,210
maybe

347
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,660
it'll be a good chance to kill her.

348
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,300
Will the Phoenix show up?

349
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,940
It's hard to say.

350
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,420
Gucheng belongs to the Ming family.

351
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,980
It is also her hometown.

352
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,220
Saintess Peahen,

353
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,700
seize the opportunity.

354
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Aunt.

355
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,250
These are the best ingredients

356
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,130
I collected in Yingzhou.

357
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,380
There is a saying in Human Realm. That is,

358
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,420
If someone suddenly gives you a gift,

359
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,780
he must want something from you.

360
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,170
Aunt,

361
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,460
I don't want to marry Yan Yue.

362
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,540
Yi'er,

363
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,020
the marriage between immortals

364
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,460
is different from

365
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,260
the marriage between humans.

366
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,140
A human couple are husband and wife.

367
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,140
An immortal couple are cultivation partners.

368
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
For immortals,

369
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,300
to get married is to find a companion

370
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,380
with whom you can spend

371
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,940
your immortal life together.

372
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,860
Have you got it,

373
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,860
now?

374
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,060
I still don't want to marry him.

375
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,420
Yan Yue is so boring.

376
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,420
Even cultivation partners

377
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,900
should have something in common.

378
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,300
They can't be like a turnip and an orange

379
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,540
which are totally different from each other.

380
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,740
It won't work.

381
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,420
If you marry him,

382
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,140
you will be the next Heavenly Empress.

383
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,460
You shouldn't only care about

384
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,450
the romance between a man and a woman.

385
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,020
You need to have love for all beings.

386
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,940
If I don't even love the man

387
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,220
I get married to,

388
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,940
how can I

389
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,220
have love for all beings?

390
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,140
These days,

391
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,260
you secretly went to Demon Realm

392
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,660
and Human Realm many times.

393
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,260
Is there something

394
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,500
you are particularly worried about?

395
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,980
Aunt,

396
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,980
please help me.

397
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,650
I can't.

398
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,500
It's your destiny.

399
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
What destiny this is!

400
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,530
To follow Heavenly Emperor's order

401
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,210
is your destiny.

402
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,700
Yi'er.

403
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,700
What's the matter?

404
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,380
Yan Yue,

405
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,540
I just have one question.

406
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,780
Do you really want to marry me?

407
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,500
It's my father's order.

408
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,060
We have to obey it.

409
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,540
But I don't want to.

410
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,740
It doesn't matter.

411
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,460
Doesn't matter?

412
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,780
After we get married,

413
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,500
we will live separately.

414
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,500
You can do whatever you want.

415
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,930
I won't ask about it

416
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,540
or interfere in it.

417
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,220
In the past,

418
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,740
I thought you were cold.

419
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,860
You were neither good

420
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,650
nor bad.

421
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,260
But

422
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,010
after you came back,

423
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
you changed completely.

424
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,460
Your change made me sacred.

425
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,060
Dean.

426
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,980
Dean. Dean. Dean.

427
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,300
Dean. Dean. Dean.

428
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,620
Dean. Dean.

429
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,500
What are you doing?

430
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,860
We want to go with you.

431
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Yes, let's go together.

432
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,450
Let's go together, Dean.

433
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,380
You should continue to study in the Academy.

434
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,260
But...

435
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,060
We've already known

436
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,700
you're going to Gucheng to help Ming Lang.

437
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,060
He is our classmate.

438
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,260
We are very good friends.

439
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,860
We

440
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,380
should help him.

441
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,060
Yes, let's go together.

442
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,740
Dean.

443
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,140
You said a good man

444
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,780
should be determined to do the right thing

445
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,700
despite numerous difficulties.

446
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,700
Yes, Dean.

447
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,900
Dean, let us go together.

448
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,740
Dean.

449
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,020
Okay.

450
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,860
Good.

451
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,020
With you, the Egret Academy

452
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,420
will flourish forever.

453
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,460
Which direction is right?

454
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,980
Dean, this way. It's a short-cut.

455
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,740
Okay.

456
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,980
Let's go this way.

457
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,460
Okay.

458
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,220
Let's go.

459
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,710
[Outside Yan Yue's Palace]

460
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,460
Is this a barrier?

461
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,500
No.

462
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
This is not a barrier

463
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,860
but a talisman formation.

464
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,980
Talisman formation?

465
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,220
It's different from a barrier.

466
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,420
A barrier is created by magic.

467
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,980
Once the magic disappears,

468
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,140
the barrier will also disappear.

469
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,860
But the talisman formation is different.

470
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,900
There are basic talismans and advanced ones.

471
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,610
The basic talismans

472
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,540
are individual talismans.

473
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,500
An advanced talisman

474
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,860
is a complicated pattern

475
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,980
of many basic talismans.

476
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,260
This formation

477
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,860
is an extremely complicated pattern.

478
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,460
The person who made this

479
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,790
must have very high spiritual power.

480
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,420
Once the talisman formation is made,

481
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,700
it will automatically create defense force.

482
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,780
To break the formation,

483
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,220
we must have its corresponding talisman.

484
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,980
Do you know how to make talismans?

485
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,380
No.

486
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,180
No one in Demon Realm knows.

487
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,380
This formation is so sophisticated.

488
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,900
It's hard for us

489
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,300
to sneak in.

490
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,260
We will find the way.

491
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,980
Why did you agree

492
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,420
to marry Yi'er?

493
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,700
It is

494
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,300
my father's order.

495
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,020
After you came back,

496
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,540
you look like the same as before.

497
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,620
But I always feel

498
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,980
you are a little weird.

499
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,420
Cut to the chase.

500
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,060
Marriage

501
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,060
is also important to the immortals.

502
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,500
I hope

503
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,460
both you

504
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,740
and Yi'er

505
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,860
can have a happy

506
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,420
and carefree life.

507
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,700
You should know

508
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,620
Yi'er and I

509
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,220
have no other choice.

510
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,900
Don't worry.

511
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,420
I won't interfere in

512
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,860
Yi'er's life.

513
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,140
If you need someone

514
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,500
to talk to,

515
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,980
you can come to me.

516
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,060
I'll come to congratulate you

517
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,260
when you are having the wedding.

518
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,010
You're a talisman master?

519
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,850
Don't be nervous.

520
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,740
I mean no harm.

521
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,980
I saw you drawing talismans in the air.

522
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,180
I believe

523
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,980
you can become

524
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,020
a talisman master very soon.

525
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,460
I was too excited.

526
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,180
Sorry.

527
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,260
What is a talisman master?

528
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,780
You know nothing about talisman master?

529
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,620
I was drawing it in the air casually.

530
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,500
I've never heard about

531
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,620
talisman before.

532
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,660
Never heard about it?

533
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,980
That's impossible.

534
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,540
Is there a problem?

535
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,620
The talisman masters

536
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,300
are very rare in the Three Realms.

537
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,540
It seems your have great talent

538
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,660
for making talisman.

539
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,980
This is really amazing.

540
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,500
Wait.

541
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,020
Do you want to

542
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,060
learn the art of talismans

543
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,260
which is about creating and breaking formations.

544
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,540
It's also about attack and defense.

545
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,020
Learning the art of talisman

546
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,980
can be very useful.

547
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,860
I know this is a little abrupt.

548
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,620
That's because

549
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,700
I am a talisman master myself.

550
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,020
I haven't seen anyone

551
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,900
with such great talent as yours for centuries.

552
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,210
I really want you to use your talent.

553
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,140
When you master the art of talismans,

554
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,660
you can break

555
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,940
this kind of formations easily.

556
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,740
Why are you here again?

557
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,310
My Lord.

558
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,260
Don't you have any other place to go

559
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,100
in the Three Realms?

560
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,220
No, I don't.

561
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,490
Now,

562
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,700
shouldn’t you be waiting

563
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,940
for your wedding in Heaven Realm?

564
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,500
You got that news?

565
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,020
I am the Demon Lord.

566
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,060
This is a big event.

567
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,700
Of course I got the news.

568
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Do you think

569
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,620
I should marry Yan Yue?

570
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,020
This is the business of Heaven Realm.

571
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,180
It has...

572
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,980
It has nothing to do with me or Demon Realm.

573
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,460
But I don’t want to marry him.

574
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,460
Both of you are of noble birth.

575
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,900
You're suited to each other.

576
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,180
Won't you make a perfect couple

577
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,700
in the Three Realms?

578
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,380
No.

579
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,140
It's not like that.

580
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,260
They say he and I will be immortal cultivation partners.

581
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,260
But in my opinion,

582
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,460
we are not as free

583
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,980
as you demons.

584
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,300
But you are an immortal.

585
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,300
You shouldn't

586
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,620
stay in Demon Realm.

587
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,620
I knew

588
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,300
you wouldn't let me stay here.

589
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,500
Actually,

590
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
I've been engaged to Yan Yue

591
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,140
for a long time.

592
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,220
At first,

593
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,260
I didn't think

594
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
there was anything wrong.

595
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,060
But now,

596
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,900
I can’t stand it anymore.

597
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,740
I don't want to stay

598
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,700
in Heaven Realm.

599
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,700
Maybe you can go to Devil Realm.

600
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,860
The devils are all free.

601
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,370
You will be happy

602
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,420
if you stay there.

603
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,300
Going to Devil Realm?

604
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,930
Are you helping me?

605
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,620
It's hard to find the entrance to Devil Realm.

606
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,380
If you want to go there, follow me.

607
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Wait for me.

608
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,620
You

609
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,860
go straight

610
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,980
along this path.

611
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,020
When you reach Devil Realm,

612
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,980
find the prince of Wolf Clan, Ou Ya.

613
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,750
With his help,

614
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,020
you can go anywhere you want in Devil Realm.

615
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,460
Here.

616
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,220
Prince of Wolf Clan?

617
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,700
Sounds cool.

618
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,900
Is he your friend?

619
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,770
Or your subordinate?

620
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,900
He's my enemy.

621
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,740
We...

622
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,690
I think we are good friends.

623
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,260
Now I'm planning to run away from my wedding.

624
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,300
This is huge.

625
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
You don't help me.

626
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,260
And now you are pushing me to a stranger,

627
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,220
an enemy of yours.

628
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,460
Can I...

629
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,780
Can I stay in Demon Realm?

630
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,260
It's up to you.

631
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,020
Do you really hate me so much?

632
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,180
I don't hate you.

633
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,300
But

634
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,420
you also don't like me.

635
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,220
Now,

636
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,020
I can understand how you feel.

637
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,100
Lord, some people want to see you.

638
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,260
Who are they?

639
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,780
A group of scholars.

640
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,239
[Yu]

641
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,500
Dean.

642
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,940
What brings you here?

643
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,620
We're here to help you.

644
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,780
We took a short-cut

645
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,659
and left the Imperial Advisor's army

646
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,260
far behind.

647
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,340
Is there

648
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,940
any peaceful solution

649
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,420
except staring a war?

650
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,420
Though Gucheng is at the border,

651
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,340
it is still

652
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,900
a part of Dayu Kingdom.

653
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,660
Every time there is a war,

654
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
the soldiers of Dayu

655
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,740
and other common people

656
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,180
will all suffer.

657
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,540
Dean.

658
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,780
I always remember what you taught us.

659
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,460
I know people will suffer because of the war.

660
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,360
[Yu]

661
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,580
But the Imperial Advisor won't stop.

662
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
It seems that war

663
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,420
is inevitable.

664
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,380
In that case,

665
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,810
your classmates and I

666
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,740
will always

667
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,740
be there for you.

668
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:50,900
[Yan Luo's Palace]

669
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,020
This is the most basic talisman.

670
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,100
Give it a go.

671
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,460
Okay, it doesn't look difficult.

672
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,460
There's no rush. Try again.

673
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,900
Okay.

674
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,850
I made it.

675
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,580
Good.

676
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,060
You've made a basic talisman.

677
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,100
Next, I'll teach you to make a talisman formation.

678
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,540
A talisman formation

679
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,100
is composed of many talismans.

680
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,060
You need to concentrate

681
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,450
on every move.

682
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,970
May I ask

683
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,420
how I should address you?

684
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm in charge of the rain in the Three Realms.

685
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,380
You can call me Rain God.

686
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,580
Lord Rain,

687
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,900
you are teaching me to draw talismans.

688
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,180
So you are my teacher now.

689
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,980
Then you have to master it.

690
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,620
If not,

691
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,060
don't say you are my student.

692
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,660
Try again.

693
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,260
Okay.

694
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,350
[Wolf Cave]

695
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,130
[Wolf Cave]

696
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,300
This is Wolf Cave.

697
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm so angry.

698
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,980
I thought wrong.

699
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,960
[Wolf Cave]

700
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,660
From now on,

701
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,780
I'll never cook for you.

702
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,410
Excuse me,

703
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,730
is Ou Ya, prince of Wolf Clan

704
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,910
living here?

705
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,380
Who are you?

706
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,980
You little devil. Where are you from?

707
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,970
Why are you looking for him?

708
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,060
I'm not a little devil.

709
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,820
I am...

710
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,580
Lan Su.

711
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,010
[Wolf Cave]

712
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,340
Let me finish.

713
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
I was wrong just now.

714
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,180
Please forgive me.

715
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,460
You're Ou Ya.

716
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Who are you?

717
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,180
How dare you!

718
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,020
You cheated

719
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,980
on me again?

720
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,740
No, I...

721
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,380
I'll kill you.

722
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,090
I don't know her.

723
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,100
Let me explain.

724
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,980
Stop. You misunderstood.

725
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,900
Calm down.

726
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,300
Wait.

727
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,020
Ou Ya!

728
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,980
So,

729
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,600
you are Yan Yue's cousin?

730
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,420
Yes.

731
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,460
Now you are here.

732
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,980
Will those immortals be looking for you?

733
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,380
I'm not an important immortal.

734
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,100
I'm just

735
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,620
the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen.

736
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,980
No one

737
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,380
will notice that I left.

738
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,940
The Demon Lord

739
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,340
is quite strange.

740
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,180
He and I

741
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,260
don't talk much.

742
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,540
Why did he ask you to come to me?

743
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,140
Are you two enemies?

744
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,940
Of course not.

745
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,060
He said

746
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,540
you

747
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,020
are a very good guy

748
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,980
who loves making friends.

749
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,780
Really?

750
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,020
So he asked me to come.

751
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,500
What is your position you said just now?

752
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,380
Kitchen God in the East Kitchen.

753
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,980
I'm responsible

754
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,420
for their meals.

755
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,380
It's not important at all.

756
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,860
Those immortals in Heaven Realm

757
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,540
eat nothing.

758
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,860
Very good.

759
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,980
You can be our judge.

760
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,100
He said

761
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,780
the food I made tasted bad.

762
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,900
Why did you mention it again?

763
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,820
I was wrong.

764
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,940
I admit

765
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,530
what I said was wrong, okay?

766
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,500
Yi'er,

767
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,740
do you think his apology is sincere?

768
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,940
He's lying.

769
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,260
Well.

770
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,820
Why do you think I'm not sincere?

771
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,620
What do you want then?

772
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:08,980
Well.

773
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,500
What do you want me to do?

774
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,620
Stop.

775
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,540
Stop quarreling.

776
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,180
Let me try.

777
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,620
I'll tell

778
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,580
how the dish tastes.

779
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,100
How is it?

780
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,620
Is it bad?
