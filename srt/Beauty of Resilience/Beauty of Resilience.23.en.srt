Chen Yan!

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,140
Here.

6
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,540
Have some water.

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,460
Wangyue,

8
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,780
it's been many days.

9
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,100
Don't go there anymore.

10
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,580
Even if he turns into a corpse,

11
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,820
I have to dig him out.

12
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,460
But the generals and the soldiers...

13
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,140
I've told them to withdraw.

14
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,580
Then I'll do it myself.

15
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,380
Wangyue,

16
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,020
just take it as Chen Yan

17
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
was killed

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,100
at the battlefield.

19
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,780
Impossible.

20
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,340
He's not dead.

21
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,020
He must be waiting for me.

22
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,700
He's waiting for me now.

23
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,659
Wangyue,

24
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,780
wake up.

25
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,900
Chen Yan is dead.

26
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,540
He will never come back.

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,820
Wangyue.

28
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
You're awake.

29
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,660
Get up and eat something.

30
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,340
Sister.

31
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Have some food.

Is he really

35
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,020
not coming back?

Marshal,

72
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,820
I sank into quicksand that night.

73
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,660
But I didn't expect that

74
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,700
there was a secret tunnel down below.

75
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,700
That's why

76
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,100
I was able to survive.

77
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,100
Oh, really?

78
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,380
Yes.

79
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,220
It seems to be a secret tunnel dug by people in the past.

80
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,660
One tunnel leads to Gu City.

81
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,220
And the other

82
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
leads to the depths of the desert.

83
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,380
Let me ask you.

84
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,780
What's going on

85
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,580
between you and Wangyue?

we...

88
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,580
How dare you say "we?"

89
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,100
It's a mere waste that I've thought highly of you.

90
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,100
How dare you

91
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,820
covet the apple of my eye?

92
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,500
Father.

93
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,419
It has nothing to do with Chen Yan.

94
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,220
Shut up!

95
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,340

96
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860

to be together with her,

103
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,940
I will die without regret.

104
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,300
Fine.

105
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,500

If you want to kill him, you have to kill me first.

Marshal,

111
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,700
I've died for Wangyue once.

112
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,210
I don't mind

113
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,820
dying again.

114
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,300
Attaboy!

115
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,620
That's what a man should say.

116
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,700
You

117
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,180
deserve my daughter.

118
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,860
Get up.

119
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,180
Silly boy.

120
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,580
Don't you want to?

121
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,220
Hurry and thank Father.

122
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,580

I just want to make it myself.

154

But I really

155
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,100
can't figure it out.

156
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,580
Why don't you take a look?

157
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,460
Let me see.

158
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,220
It doesn't hurt. I'm fine.

159
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
It doesn't hurt?

160
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,060
I know you too well.

161
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,340
You can't bear any pain.

162
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,860
You practiced martial arts when you were little.

163
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,460
Every time you bumped against something,

164
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,100
you just cried out loud.

165
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,060
Your crying was earthshaking.

166
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,580
There was one time when you cried,

167
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,940
the whole mansion was alarmed.

168
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,340
They thought there was a fire somewhere.

169
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,700
But I didn't expect

170
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,460
a man who was afraid of pain when he was little

171
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,220
can fight the battles so bravely

172
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,060
when he grows up.

173
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,820
It's my fault.

174
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,100
I still treat you like a child.

175
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,700
You've grown up

176
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,620
and you're a general now.

177
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,580
Don't worry.

178
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,340
I won't tell anyone about

179
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,580
your embarrassing things.

180
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,930
I won't let you get embarrassed.

181
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,060
Sister,

182
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,620
do you really like Chen Yan?

183
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
Does Chen Yan

184
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,620
like you as much as

185
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,220
you like

186
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
him?

187
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,420
Of course.

188
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,980
He's even willing to die for me.

189
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,060
I think

190
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,220
something

191
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,420
is missing on this.

192
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,700
Is it better like this?

193
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,340
Let me have a look.

194
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,060
Not bad.

195
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,460
It's getting late.

196
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I'll take care of the rest.

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,580
Go back and rest.

198
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,820
I’m off then.

199
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,340
Okay.

200
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,740
Pheasant Skewers.

201
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,860
Crunchy Eggplant with Purple Perilla.

202
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,980
Slimy Secretion of A Hundred Worms.

203
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
Yum, yum.

204
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
It took the bait.

205
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,700
I thought it was some kind of wild animal.

206
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,820
Are you a soldier?

207
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,100
A general?

208
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,060
You can't speak?

209
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
I'm leaving then.

210
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,620
No, no, no.

211
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,300
So you can speak.

212
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,450
M-Miss.

213
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,220
It's dark and windy here.

214
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,500
I don't know who

215
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,580
set this trap here.

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,100
Leave now.

217
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,300
It's dangerous.

218
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,330
Young man,

219
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,060
It's dark and windy.

220
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,340
If I leave,

221
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,180
you will be suspended in this tree

222
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,980
until you die.

223
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,340
It's not bad

224
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,300
to be suspended in a tree.

225
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,700
Are you sure?

226
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,740
There's a forest here.

227
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,420
Over there,

228
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
there is a thousand-year-old pine.

229
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,100
The feng shui is great.

230
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,460
And in front of you…

231
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,220
One, two, three, four, five.

232
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,300
The fifth tree.

233
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,180
It's a 10,000-year-old tree.

234
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,180
There's a dragon vein underneath.

235
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,340
Why don't you

236
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,980
reconsider it?

237
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,300
Forget it.

238
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,420
I don't want to go anywhere.

239
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,820
I'll just die here.

240
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,100
Maybe this is just my fate.

241
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,500
Give me a break.

242
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,580
If you want to die, why did you use that knife

243
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,700
to cut the rope?

244
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,180
Just live well.

245
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,340
Miss.

246
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,060
Miss.

247
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,980
Miss.

248
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,180
Where are you?

249
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,060
Stop looking.

250
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
Go home.

251
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,540
See you.

252
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,460
A few days ago,

253
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,220
why did you avoid me?

254
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,500
I didn't.

255
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,380
The Wei Army has been investigating closely recently.

256
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,620
Really?

257
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,660
Yes.

258
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
You did a good job

259
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,700
about Wangyue.

260
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,660
You know it all?

261
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,500
God bless our Jinghe.

262
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,180
The day you and Wangyue get married

263
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
will be the perfect time

264
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,460
for our surprise attack.

265
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,380
At the time,

266
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,930
you and I

267
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,020
can work together from inside and outside.

268
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,660
We will catch the leader

269
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,020
and get rid of Sima Jin.

270
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,140
What's wrong?

271
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,740
Wei and Jinghe

272
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,420
are sworn enemies.

273
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,620
But the princess

274
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,900
love me wholeheartedly.

275
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,140
I really can't bear

276
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
to lie to her like this.

277
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,420
Don't tell me

278
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,860
you're having some feelings for her

279
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,380
which you shouldn't have.

280
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,220
Wangyue and I

281
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
truly love each other.

282
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,300
Complete your mission well.

283
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,140
I'll pretend I've not heard

284
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,660
those lunatic ravings you said.

285
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,500
Yin,

286
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,380
I can't be

287
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,220
a heartless person.

288
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,180
Can you break your word and forget your benefactor then?

289
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,020
Don't forget who saved you

290
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,980
and gave you dignity.

291
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,220
Now,

292
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,980
you want to betray me

293
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,260
because of a woman.

294
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,300
You're too foolish.

295
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
I understand.

296
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,420
Then think about it.

297
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,620
I gave you your life.

298
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,380
Don't let me down.

299
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,280
This mission is very important.

300
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,500
Must Wei and Jinghe

301
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,980
fight until both sides are ruined?

302
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,900
If you waver

303
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,420
because you hanker

304
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,700
after a woman,

305
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
not only will you ruin

306
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,860
the great opportunity to build a career,

307
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,980
but you will also

308
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,060
let all our efforts go to waste.

309
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,180
I can't do it now.

310
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Yan.

311
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,700
When you succeed and return to Jinghe,

312
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,180
there'll be plenty of noble ladies for you to choose from.

313
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,700
But in my heart…

314
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,220
in my heart,

315
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,260
there is only Wangyue.

316
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,980
Between the woman and your  spiritual debt,

317
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,690
you can only choose one.

318
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,420
I…

319
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,220
Why is it so lively here?

320
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,780
This is the market of Gu City.

321
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,900
Haven't you been here before?

322
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,060
You're busy with military affairs.

323
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,300
You don't have time to shop.

324
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,980
We need to buy some clothes and jewelry for the wedding.

325
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,700
I'll take you

326
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,700
to go shopping.

327
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,860
Let's go.

328
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,540
What do you need, young lady?

329
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,540
I'm just looking around.

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,700

331
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,660
I'll take it.

332
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,780
Five cents.

333
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,300
OK.

334
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500

♫I'm still looking for you until the sun stains the clouds♫

380
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,340
♫Like a duckweed waiting to be married♫

381
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,680
♫I'm still looking for you♫

382
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,460
♫The Destiny whispers to me that it is hard to find the Netherworld♫

383
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,220
If possible,

384
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,540
I wish I could forget everything

385
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,970
♫My love for you will never change♫

386
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,210
and spend the rest of my life with you.

387
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,700
Greetings, Princess.

388
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,220
It's such an honor

389
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,220
to have you here.

390
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,140
Scarves and chains upstairs

391
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,300
and jewelry downstairs.

392
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,220
You can choose whatever you want.

393
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,300
How about this one?

394
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,730
It's not bad.

395
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,500
Boss,

396
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,860
pack this up.

397
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,740
This one. Okay.

398
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,660
OK.

399
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,760
[Jin's]

400
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,500
I heard that he's a spy from Jinghe.

401
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,540
The Jinghe dogs deserve to die.

402
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,460
When will he be beheaded?

403
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,860
I must observe the execution that day.

404
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,660
Kill him! Kill you!

405
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,060
Spy!

406
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,140
It's him.

407
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,220
Kill him! Kill him!

408
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,540
Jinghe Dog, drop dead!

409
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,420
You deserve to die!

410
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,940
Kill him, Jinghe dog, spy!

411
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,540
I want to kill the spy!

412
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,620
Kill him!

413
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
What are you thinking?

414
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,900
Nothing.

415
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,500
Many Jinghe scouts have been caught recently.

416
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,900
But we got nothing from interrogating them.

417
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,140
I wonder

418
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,250
if we'll get any information useful this time.

419
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,740
Let's go.

420
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,300
What are you doing here?

421
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,530
I'm getting you out of here.

422
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,180
If you dare to come in,

423
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

424
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,980
Yin!

425
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm a Jinghe scout,

426
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,380
while you belong to the Gu City Army,

427
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,980
and you're the son-in-law of the marshal.

428
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,420
I can't watch you

429
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,860
die without doing anything.

430
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,060
If my death

431
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,260
can make you come to your senses,

432
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,140
then my death won't be in vain.

433
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,420
Go back to where you belong

434
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,970
and complete your mission.

435
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,380
Let go of your love.

436
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,540
This is my last wish.

437
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:06,330
[Wei]

438
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:22,270
[Wei]

439
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,220
Chen Yan.

440
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,740
What are you doing here?

441
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,900
You haven't asked me

442
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,420
about your marriage with my sister.

443
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,060
Do I need your permission?

444
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,620
You want to fight?

445
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,050
Alright.

446
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,260
No more fighting.

447
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,060
No.

448
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,420
Not enough!

449
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,220
Come again.

450
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,140
Again what?

451
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,290
I can't fight anymore.

452
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,300
I admit that

453
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,260
your martial arts are better than mine.

454
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,500
But if one day

455
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,700
you betray my sister,

456
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,620
I won't let you go.

457
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,300
Who dares to say

458
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,700
he never lets others down?

459
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,780
I don't care if you let others down,

460
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,180
but you can't

461
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,980
let my sister down.

462
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,380
You don't understand

463
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,180
about us.

464
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,700
Why not?

465
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,620
You're good at martial arts.

466
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,620
If one day

467
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,740
I'm gone,

468
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,380
I'll rest assured

469
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,700
to leave Wangyue to you.

470
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,650
What do you mean?

471
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,300
Nothing.

472
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,540
We are all soldiers.

473
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,660
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

474
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,320
Don't worry.

475
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,540
From now on,

476
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,860
as long as I am here,

477
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,740
I won't let anything happen

478
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,980
to Wangyue and you.

479
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
A meteor?

480
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,140
I heard that

481
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,540
if you wish upon a shooting star,

482
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,980
your wish will come true.

483
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,300
When did God ever

484
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,700
grant a wish?

485
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,500
You're right.

486
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,020
It's just some rumor.

487
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,710
[Wei]

488
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,180

489
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,570
[Behead]

490
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,540
[Wei]

491
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,020
The execution is today.

492
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,180
Let's use the enemy's blood

493
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,180
to console our heroes in heaven

494
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
and to pray for victory in the coming battle.

495
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,700
Pray for victory.

496
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,780
Pray for victory.

497
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,860
Pray for victory.

498
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Pray for victory.

499
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,260
Pray for victory.

500
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,890
[Order]

501
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
Decapitation!

502
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,930
[Behead]

503
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,460
[Behead]

504
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,260
You deserve it! Let's go.

505
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,930
Okay.

506
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,540
Here you are.

507
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,020
Eat.

508
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,980
I heard there is a place

509
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,690
where you can eat buns and porridge every day.

510
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,420
On the 1st and 15th days of every month,

511
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
there's even meat.

512
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,620
Do you want to go there?

513
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,050
Come on. Hurry up.

514
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,980
Can you do it?

515
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,180
A bit to the left.

516
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,740
Okay.

517
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,260
Should it be higher?

518
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,220
Is this okay?

519
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,980
Yes.

520
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,010
[Happiness]

521
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,860
Get busy, guys.

522
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,540
I've finished cutting this.

523
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Let's have a wedding party tonight.

524
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,300
Okay.

525
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,180
Let's get drunk.

526
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,220
I'm coming.

527
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,300
You four

528
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,260
do a good job.

529
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,700
Our Outpost Battalion

530
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,220
is sort of Chen Yan's family.

531
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
I didn't expect Captain Chen

532
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,780
to get himself married into the marshal's family so soon.

533
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,020
Watch your mouth.

534
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,980
Chen Yan married the princess

535
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,460
with dignity.

536
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,700
Their baby will have the name

537
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
of Chen.

538
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,460
Yes.

539
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,300
In that case,

540
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,540
his child

541
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,140
will call us uncles.

542
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,060
Yes.

543
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,740
That's right.

544
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,300
We'll have a nephew.

545
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,980
Right?

546
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,700

00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,940
Father Marshal,

570
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,440
please accept

571
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,120
♫I'm only waiting for you♫

572
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,659
my kowtow.

573
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,530
♫To appear in my dreams♫

574
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,600
♫The courtyard is lush with sycamores♫

575
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,610
♫It only hopes that one day♫

576
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,139
Good.

577
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,659
♫There'll still be a phoenix to roost♫

578
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,820
Okay, get up.

579
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,460
Come on.

580
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,340
♫I'm still looking for you until the falling flowers return with spring♫

581
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,900
I wish you

582
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,540
be happy forever.

583
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,880
♫I'll love you till my life ends♫

584
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,870
♫I'm still looking for you until the sound of hooves fades with the strings♫

585
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,670
♫I hate that there's no time to meet♫

586
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:52,889
♫I'm still looking for you until the sun stains the clouds♫

587
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,300
♫Like a duckweed waiting to be married♫

588
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,650
♫I'm still looking for you♫

589
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,860
The ceremony is completed.

590
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,350
♫The Destiny whispers to me that it is hard to find the Netherworld♫

591
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,500
Bravo.

592
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,570
Bravo!

593
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,460
Bravo!

594
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:19,650
Bravo! Bravo!

595
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,160
♫No matter how thick the fog is and how hard it is to find the Netherworld♫
♫My love for you will never change♫

596
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,660
[Wei]

597
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,740
Chen Yan is really lucky.

598
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,100
Here.

599
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,300
I didn't expect him to marry the princess for real.

600
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,620
If it weren't for us,

601
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,060
he wouldn't get married so easily.

602
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,660
Yes.

603
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,460
That's right.

604
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,340
In my opinion,

605
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,740
he got married

606
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,780
thanks to us.

607
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,060
Am I right?

608
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,580
That's right.

609
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,460
Of course. Drink.

610
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,420
You're right.

611
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,100
Marshal! Marshal!

612
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,300
Don’t stand on ceremony on this wedding day.

613
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,180
Come, have a seat.

614
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,140
This is the wedding banquet.

615
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,860
Here.

616
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,460
Let’s have a drink together.

617
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,660
To the Marshal.

618
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,060
Come on.

619
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,100
To the Marshal.

620
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,540
Well,

621
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,060
After winning the battle

622
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,420
and return to the capital,

623
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,260
do you

624
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
have any plans?

625
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,620
My parents have arranged a marriage for me.

626
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
After the war,

627
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,740
I'm going back to get married.

628
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,580
Good.

629
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,100
What a loser.

630
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,980
Good.

631
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,820
It's not easy for you

632
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,620
to guard the border.

633
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,180
When we go back,

634
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,180
I'll go drink your wedding wine.

635
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,460
Great! Great!

636
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,460
Marshal,

637
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,260
let me toast you.

638
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:39,860
OK. Come on.

639
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,180
Let's all have a toast to you.

640
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,020
Cheers.

641
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,300
Cheers!

642
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,460
Come on. Cheers.

643
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,180
Fill it up.

644
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,260
Okay.

645
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Come on.

646
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,070

marrying me,

659
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,510
♫Spread out your palm♫

660
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,460
do you regret it?

♫If all your obsessions are empty♫

You won't.

If you betray me,

668
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,220
♫A little more touching♫

669
