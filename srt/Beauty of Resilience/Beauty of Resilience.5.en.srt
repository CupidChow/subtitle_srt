00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,410
Dean.

5
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,450
What are you...

6
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,770
Have some tea.

7
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,780
Thank you.

8
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:51,970
Wei Zhi.

9
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,070
What happened today

10
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,440
is not your fault.

11
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,370
Don't blame yourself.

12
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,650
What the students said

13
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,980
is not entirely wrong.

14
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,460
I've been different from others since I was young.

15
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,440
I can see demons and evil spirits

16
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,860
that others can't see.

17
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,890
So I suffered a lot.

18
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,850
Dean.

19
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,090
Please teach me immortal techniques

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,190
to expel the anomaly on me.

21
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,600
I just want to be a normal person.

22
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,810
I don't want people around me to suffer.

23
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,900
Stand up.

24
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,880
Kid, come on.

25
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,860
Kid.

26
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
I really can't help you.

27
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,190
I cultivate

28
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,630
neither to exorcise unwanted spirites,

29
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,050
nor to make elixirs for immortality.

30
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,510
What's more,

31
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,500
I don't even know

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,560
those techniques and magic.

33
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,250
I do this

34
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,310
to learn the truth.

35
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,630
What is humanity?

36
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,020
What is the law of Heaven?

37
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,890
If I can figure out these problems,

38
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,830
my whole life of cultivation

39
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,500
is worth it.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,810
But I have a word for you.

41
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,010
The so-called anomaly

42
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,550
may not be

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
some evil power.

44
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,430
Instead, it could be your destiny.

45
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,870
You mean I'm destined to be like this?

46
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,120
Is it really incurable?

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,490
You have your destiny.

48
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,330
This may be a restriction

49
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,050
or

50
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,770
a responsibility.

51
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,560
I don't understand.

52
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,659
You will know

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,900
when it happens.

54
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,159
Alright.

55
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,440
Kid.

56
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,530
Where did you get

57
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,130
this jade bracelet?

58
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,360
Picked up off somewhere.

59
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,190
What's your relationship

60
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
with Lord Gu Huaixuan?

61
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,900
I don't know this person.

62
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,130
This jade bracelet is unique.

63
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,880
How could it be picked up

64
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,920
so easily?

65
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,430
When I was young, there was a war.

66
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,310
My mother and I found it

67
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,690
on the way to escape from famine.

68
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,640
I had already taken it to the pawnshop.

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,380
But they said it was worthless.

70
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,290
I put it on because it looks good.

71
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,550
I'll let you take a rest, Dean.

72
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm leaving.

73
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,800

Let's mind our own business.

75

If you make trouble again,

76
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,900
I'll be angry.

77
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,230
Fire!

78
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,180
Help!

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Help!

80
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,110
Why do you

81
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,670
always cause trouble?

82
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,540
I didn't. It was the raven spirit.

83
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,230
He kept pouncing off my shuttlecock.

84
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,700
You're lying.

85
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,700
I didn't. I'm telling the truth.

86
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,700
Tell me.

87
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,580
What is

88
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,910
on your body?

89
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,260
Why did the fire start

90
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,490
so suddenly?

91
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,520
I don't know.

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,460
Give me your hand.

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,750
How dare you disobey me!

95
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,850
How dare you lie!

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,580
Get in.

Open the door!

If you don't tell me the truth,

what did you use to set the fire,

101
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,600
then you won't go out today.

102
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,450

Yes, Father.

Don't be afraid.

Grandpa, what is this?

120
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,840
This is the heirloom

121
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,750
of our Gu family.

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,930
In the past,

123
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,750
every generation only passed it

124
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,620
to the leader of the family.

125
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,880
Now,

126
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,950
I want to give it

00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,300
to my precious granddaughter.

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,250

If I hadn't lost my temper,

132
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,490
Mom wouldn't have

133
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,780
been mad at me, right?

134
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,790
You're right.

135
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,310
Remember.

136
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,940
From now on,

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,809
you can't take it off.

I miss you.

143
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,050
I just want to remind you that

144
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,280
this wine

145
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,770
is good for your muscles and bones

146
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,270
and helps promote blood circulation.

147
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,710
If it had been that easy,

148
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,260
I wouldn't have had to go back

149
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,240
to Heaven Realm to get the medicine.

150
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,990
It seems that

151
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,520
the Demon Clan

152
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,120
has sent someone powerful.

153
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,540
Their magic is indeed strange.

154
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,290
I underestimated the enemy.

155
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,360
However,

156
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,900
the wound on my chest

157
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,040
wasn't caused by the Demon Clan.

158
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,600
I've had it for a long time.

159
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,700
Since I came to the mortal world,

160
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,410
the wound on the chest

161
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,750
has been hurt repeatedly.

162
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,590
Recently, it's been more frequent.

163
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,900
I don't know why.

164
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
What kind of war

165
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
and people

166
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,300
could cause a serious wound like this?

167
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,950
I tried my best to recall,

168
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,750
but I couldn't remember anything.

169
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,260
Fortunately, you don't remember.

170
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,870
Still don't recall?

171
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,050
In the Three Realms,

172
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,670
only few people

173
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,730
can cause such a serious wound.

174
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,480
We've been fighting together for hundreds of years.

175
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,710
Do you remember?

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,260
Well...

177
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,980
We've been through

178
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,050
countless battles together.

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
It's inevitable

180
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,150
to have some wounds on your body.

181
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,740
Don't think too much.

182
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,200
Just treat when you have it.

183
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,040
Drink when you want.

184
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,750
Apply the medicine when it's needed.

185
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,480
But I think

186
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,390
our priority now

187
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,550
is to focus on

188
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,940
the selection of the Phoenix.

189
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,870
How is that

190
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,890
Wei Lingyue?

191
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
I've arranged her in the East Yard

192
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,710
and set up a barrier to defend demons.

193
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,100
No demons or devils can get close to it.

194
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,290
Father.

195
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,060
I heard that

196
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,350
you were hurt.

197
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,530
Don't worry, Father.

198
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,860
Master has subdued the Demon Clan.

199
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,020
And he set the barrier to defend demons

200
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
in the East Yard

201
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,520
to protect me.

202
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,560
Enough.

203
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,400
Stop it.

204
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,830
You and Jingyue

205
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,330
are going back with me immediately.

206
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,060
Father.

207
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,630
I can't go back.

208
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,430
I finally

209
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,440
get what I have today.

210
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,520
Besides,

211
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,650
these 18 people

212
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,490
were chosen by His Majesty.

213
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,210
When we first came here, you've said that

214
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,790
this was an imperial edict that we couldn't disobey.

215
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,700
I will ask for an imperial edict

216
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,040
from His Majesty.

217
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,110
Father,

218
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,900
I'm begging you.

219
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,730
I really can't leave.

220
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,850
I will work hard

221
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,920
and become the Phoenix.

222
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,050
I'll bring glory to you

223
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,760
and the Wei family.

224
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,110
Lingyue,

225
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,770
what I fear the most

226
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,030
is that you work too hard.

227
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,170
The Wei family

228
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,520
doesn't need you to be the Phoenix.

229
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,150
The Phoenix is chosen by the God.

230
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,020
And there are signs on my body showing

231
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,610
that I'm the Phoenix.

232
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,960
Stop it.

233
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,610
It's just a farce.

234
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,700
Father,

235
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,260
please trust me.

236
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,740
I'm really the Phoenix.

237
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,970
Why are you so stubborn?

238
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,680
Not only will you be hurt by yourself,

239
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,780
but also your sister.

240
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,480
I see.

241
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,590
All you care about is my sister.

242
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,540
Fine.

243
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,620
Take her back

244
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,050
in case she gets hurt by me.

245
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,000
You...

246
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,290
What are you

247
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
talking about?

248
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,460
Did I say anything wrong?

249
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,090
Since I was young,

250
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,640
all you've cared about is my sister.

251
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,970
You've never cared about me.

252
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,450
You...

253
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,250
You are so stubborn.

254
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,270
Father.

255
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,520
Mother died of metrorrhagia

256
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,840
after giving birth to my sister.

257
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,830
So you gave

258
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,150
all your love for mom

259
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,980
to the baby

260
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,260
in the swaddling.

261
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,740
Everyone in the Wei family

262
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,590
respects your love

263
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,630
for mother.

264
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,830
But who would understand my grudge

265
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,340
after losing my mother

266
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,320
and the love of my father?

267
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,630
We are all your daughters.

268
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,440
But Sister can be naughty and wilful.

269
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,560
I can only work hard.

270
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,180
No matter how good I am in others' eyes,

271
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,110
I've never gotten recognition from you.

272
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,880
But it's different now.

273
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,330
Now I'm the Phoenix

274
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm the focus of everyone's attention.

275
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,200
No matter how biased you are,

276
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,430
you can't hide my light.

277
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,620
You...

278
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,620
Father.

279
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,670
Father, I was looking for you and Sister

280
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,460
to have a meal together.

281
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,600
What's wrong?

282
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,460
What's wrong, Father?

283
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,380
Sister!

284
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,980
What's wrong?

285
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,150
Did you quarrel with Father?

286
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:33,790
Sister.

287
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,840
What's wrong?

288
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,200
Your eyes are red.

289
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm fine.

290
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,440
Sister.

291
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,700
You know

292
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,820
our father.

293
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,390
If he says anything bad,

294
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,790
don't argue with him.

295
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,830
Just follow what he says.

296
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,850
Act cute.

297
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
He'll be fine soon.

298
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,730
Look at you.

299
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,380
Your eyes are swollen.

300
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,940
That's not cool.

301
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,260
My sister

302
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,800
is the future Phoenix.

303
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,700
Show your dignity and nobility.

304
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,890
Jingyue,

305
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,790
do you really think

306
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
that I'm the Phoenix?

307
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,760
Of course.

308
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,970
It must be you.

309
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,320
Don't you feel grudging?

310
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,760
What do you mean?

311
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,200
Have you

312
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,750
never thought about

313
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
being the Phoenix yourself?

314
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,500
Who doesn't want to be the Phoenix?

315
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,890
But you are the one I've respected the most

316
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,420
since I was young.

317
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,180
So I naturally believe

318
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,480
that you are the Phoenix.

319
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,400
Do you really think so?

320
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,520
Of course.

321
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm not the only one who thinks that.

322
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,020
Others must think so too.

323
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,250
I am

324
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,200
your Chief Guardian.

325
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,220
If anyone dares to compete with you

326
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,650
for the Phoenix, I will be angry. I...

327
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,950
How could you be my Chief Guardian

328
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,020
with such a few skills?

329
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,380
Sister, I’ll practice hard.

330
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,020
Go back.

331
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,300
I want to rest.

332
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,740
Okay.

333
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,720
Sister.

334
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,950
You're not sad anymore?

335
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,690
Trust me, Sister.

336
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,690
I will protect you.

337
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,170
No matter it is people or demons,

338
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,330
I'll kill all of them who stop you.

339
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,110
I'm leaving.

340
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,530
Trust me.

341
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,060
A barrier?

342
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,080
Seems like that

343
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
it's the Master again.

344
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
No, no, no.

345
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,230
It's me...

346
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,859
Why are you here again? You're still here?

347
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,490
Well...

348
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,410
I just wanted to scare you.

349
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,200
Look what you did to me.

350
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,010
You painted my face like this.

351
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,130
Don't make trouble.

352
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,069
I told you it's dangerous here.

353
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,900
Leave now.

354
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,530
Unless...

355
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,829
you clean it for me.

356
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,619
It's very dangerous.

357
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,180
You...

358
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,980
You little devil

359
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,900
are still fooling around.

360
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,460
Master really ordered

361
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,540
to expel demons and devils this time.

362
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,500
If you are caught,

363
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,540
I can't save you.

364
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,860
That master?

365
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,740
Do you think I'm afraid of him?

366
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,380
I'm the Prince of the Devil Clan.

367
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,540
You think I can't defeat him?

368
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,460
You can't beat him.

369
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,980
I can't?

370
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,060
Why can't I?

371
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,900
Don't you believe

372
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,700
that I can defeat him, right?

373
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,090
I...
Let’s go.

374
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,460
Go!

375
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,620
Go!

376
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,880
If you meet a woman

377
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,130
in this world

378
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,660
and you can't stop yourself from loving her,

379
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,760
Then you must do whatever it takes

380
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,680
to keep her.

381
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,870
A woman

382
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,400
whom I can't stop loving...

383
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,770
Are you stupid?

384
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,720
What... What happened?

385
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,010
Are you...

386
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,660
That's so strange.

387
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,980
The East Yard.

388
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,710
Lady Lingyue.

389
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,520
That's strange.

390
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,470
Why is the black energy gone?

391
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,850
Lady Lingyue.

392
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,540
Lady Lingyue.

393
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,030
Is she not here?

394
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,720
Lady Lingyue.

395
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,440
Come out.

396
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,820
Lady Lingyue.

397
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,820
It's dangerous outside. Don't come out.

398
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,020
Lady Lingyue.

399
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
If you don't come out,

400
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,140
she will die.

401
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,580
Bad news! Bad news!

402
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,190
Bad news!

403
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,260
What's wrong?

404
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,020
What’s wrong?
It’s a demon.

405
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,060
The Demon Clan's here!

406
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,220
It's the Demon Clan!

407
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,020
Calm down.

408
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,850
My sister...

409
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,480
Calm down.

410
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,240
You girls go back to your room.

411
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,520
Let's take a look.

412
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,260
Okay.

413
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,540
I want to go too. Okay. Hurry.

414
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,260
My sister is still in the East Yard.

415
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,220
I'm going to save my sister.

416
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,700
Don't worry.

417
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
We will save her.

418
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,890
Bao Liang! Protect her!

419
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,710
I want to go too.

420
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm going to save my sister!

421
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,620
Calm down, Jingyue.

422
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,430
Step aside.

423
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,080
It seems that

424
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
no one cares about your life.

425
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,270
You are the Penglai Immortal Envoy?

426
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,940
You are...

427
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,040
The supreme lord of the Demon Clan.

428
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,190
Hand Wei Lingyue over.

429
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,200
I can spare your life.

430
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,440
Stop it.

431
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,990
I don't like killing.

432
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,010
What should we do?

433
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,180
Lord, bad news.

434
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,020
Huarong's missing.

435
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,720
Wait and see.

436
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,450
The Phoenix.

437
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,020
I'm determined to get it.

438
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,820
Master.

439
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,130
Master!

440
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,770
Master! Master!

441
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,530
Is Wei Zhi okay?

442
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,830
She's fine.

443
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:57,980
Liu Chang.

444
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,290
Send Wei Zhi back.

445
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,110
OK.

446
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,630
Where is Lingyue?

447
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm here.

448
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,740
Lingyue.

449
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,760
Are you alright?

450
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,730
Thank you, Master.

451
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,970
Thank you everyone.

452
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
I will never forget

453
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,300
your kindness.

454
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,500
The supreme lord of the Demon Clan

455
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,640
came personally.

456
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,010
It seems that Wei Lingyue

457
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,860
is indeed the Phoenix.

458
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,290
But...

459
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,900
why did he leave in a hurry?

460
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,690
Please spare my life.

461
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,930
You loser!
Lord.

462
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,510
This is very strange.

463
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,260
I've been watching Huarong

464
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,220
and never left.

465
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,960
But Huarong disappeared

466
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,020
for no reason.

467
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,330
Then why don't you go find it?

468
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,900
No matter where is it in the Three Realms,

469
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,650
you have to find it for me.

470
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,540
Yes.

471
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,650
[Qiao Mu House]

472
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,200
You're awake.

473
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,090
Lady Lingyue.

474
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,850
Are you okay?

475
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,410
Are you feeling unwell?

476
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,060
Lady Lingyue, I'm fine.

477
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,880
You almost died

478
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,370
to save me.

479
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,950
It's my fault.

480
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
But Master asked me

481
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,910
to hide in the barrier.

482
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,680
I dare not to disobey Master's order.

483
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,230
At the most dangerous time,

484
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,170
I didn't fight

485
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,080
with you.

486
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,500
And you almost died to save me.

487
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,940
I'm really sorry.

488
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,440
It's fine.

489
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,060
I'm happy that I can protect you.

490
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,600
What's there to be happy about?

491
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,130
Master.

492
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,320
Wei Lingyue.

493
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,950
Without my permission,

494
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,160
you can't leave the East Yard.

495
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,370
Well done.

496
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,640
Go back now.

497
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,390
Yes.

498
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,540
Wei Zhi.

499
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,960
You risked your life

500
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,520
only to be brave?

501
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,750
Trying to kick against the pricks.

502
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,390
Disregard your own life.

503
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,150
Copy the skills of Deity Arts for 300 times as punishment.

504
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,570
That's too...

505
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,490
too much.

506
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,450
Wait.

507
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,460
Brother Rain God's wine

508
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,590
Chick feet from the mortal world.

509
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,690
The elf herbs from the Devil Clan.

510
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,360
Night-light mushrooms from the Demon Clan

511
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,970
And chilli from the hell.

512
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,840
The amount and seasoning are right.

513
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,900
It seems the heat is not right.

514
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,540
Just get to the point.

515
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,370
Don't fight.

516
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,070
Take it out.

517
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,260
What?

518
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,820
Huarong.

519
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,460
What Huarong?

520
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,920
I just picked some mushrooms.

521
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,740
They are all there.

522
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,560
If you want them,

523
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,690
just take away.

524
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,830
So the Huarong you mentioned

525
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,380
is this fire.

526
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,300
You can't blame this on me.

527
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,900
If you hadn't come to catch me,

528
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,520
the soup wouldn't have come out.

529
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,050
If the soup hadn't come out,

530
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,510
the fire wouldn't have been out.

531
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,910
I can save...

532
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,580
I can save your Huarong.

533
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,740
It's true...

534
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,550
Now,

535
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,460
Lady Lingyue is still

536
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,660
in the East Yard of the academy.

537
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,310
I'm afraid the Demon Clan will come back.

538
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,750
All right.

539
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,620
I know everything about the academy.

540
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,790
You can go.

541
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,360
Lord Imperial Advisor,

542
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,060
I know I was born dumb,

543
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,270
but I believe diligence can make up for it.

544
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,340
I'm willing to suffer

545
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,110
and practice immortal techniques

546
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,860
to serve you.

547
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,880
I see.

548
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,560
I won’t treat you badly.

549
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,660
Thank you, Lord Imperial Advisor.

550
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,700
I will study harder

551
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,890
and bring you glory

552
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,120
in the Mid-Autumn exam,

553
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,570
Okay. You can go.

554
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,570
Yes.

555
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
The Mid-Autumn exam

556
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,170
of the Egret Academy

557
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
will be held in half a month.

558
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,850
If by then,

559
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,070
the list of winners

560
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,110
is disclosed,

561
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,310
it will be too late

562
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,710
for us to negotiate.

563
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,050
I've written a letter to ask Ming Chengwu

564
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,500
back to the capital as soon as possible.

565
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,110
But the Ming family is at the border.

566
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,190
If we let them train soldiers in Gucheng,

567
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,090
the soldiers are brave and good at fighting,

568
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,940
no one in our country can defeat them.

569
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,030
Besides,

570
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,270
you're going to help his son.

571
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,320
Aren't you afraid of

572
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,240
danger caused by them in the future?

573
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,050
Because the Ming family is at the border,

574
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,510
they don't have

575
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,170
complex relationships

576
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,910
or anything at stake

577
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
in the capital.

578
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,220
It will be of no concerns to use them.

579
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,720
As for your concerns,

580
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,250
I can handle it.

581
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,480
Could it be that...

582
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,950
you have something

583
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,810
up on them?

584
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,920
Xiao Jin, where have you been?

585
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,550
You weren't there for lunch.

586
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,940
Did you sneak out

587
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,900
secretly?

588
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,810
Who do you think is the Phoenix?

589
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,840
Can't you tell

590
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,740
even now?

591
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,830
Still guessing?

592
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,150
The Mid-Autumn exam hasn't come yet.

593
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,680
It's too early to say it now.

594
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,330
Exam?

595
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,720
What...

596
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,390
What exam?

597
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,290
On every Mid-Autumn Day,

598
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,450
the academy will select

599
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
excellent students.

600
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,750
This is the tradition of the academy.

601
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,750
It's also called the Mid-Autumn Meeting.

602
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:53,900
Besides,

603
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,580
the list of the winners

604
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,550
will be disclosed to the world.

605
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,770
Exam?

606
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,380
- I’m afraid of exams.
- What else can you do except from eating?

607
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,180
Smells good.

608
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,240
What are you doing? You scared me.

609
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,180
I heard that

610
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,830
you were hurt by the Demon Clan.

611
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,830
So I came to see if you're okay.

612
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,190
You don't have to.

613
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,250
It has nothing to do with you.

614
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,290
You're right.

615
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,440
What does it have to do with me?

616
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,830
You are not the Phoenix.

617
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,510
I'm looking for the Phoenix.

618
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,830
Why am I sad

619
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,630
because of your injury?

620
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,360
What are you mumbling about?

621
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,640
I advise you to leave now.

622
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,380
Listen.

623
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,660
Master can appear in the academyh

624
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,860
at any time.

625
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,790
Let me give you a massage.

626
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,200
It hurts so much.

627
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,740
Are you feeling better?

628
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,390
Not at all.

629
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,140
Then try again.

630
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,460
- No, I won’t.
- Try again.

631
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,500
Leave me alone.

632
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,210
Let me try another way.

633
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,060
Try it again.

634
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,690
No.

635
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,890
Go away.

636
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,900
Why are you running so fast?

637
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,540
What happened?

638
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,110
Jogging.

639
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,370
Just to exercise.

640
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,240
What happened to your neck?

641
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,670
Well,

642
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,920
I sprained my ankle

643
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,700
when doing exercises.

644
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,550
It's nothing serious.

645
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,420
Let me see.

646
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,020
No.

647
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:35,970
No need.

648
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,830
I'll be fine

649
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:38,850
after some rest.

650
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,490
This is

651
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,750
the medicine.

652
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,070
It can help promote blood circulation.

653
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,110
Thank you, Master.

654
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,130
Then I'm leaving.

655
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:53,730
Wait.

656
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
Apply it with warm wine.

657
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,320
You'll recover sooner.

658
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,330
Thank you, Master.

659
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,350
[Born to be a jinx. Stupid like a pig] [Nemesis]

660
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,000
Lead the way.

661
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,360
Why are you

662
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,960
so impatient?

663
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,180
You tied me up

664
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,010
without knowing where it is.

665
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,090
Cut the crap.

666
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,430
Where is the thing

667
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,220
I'm looking for.

668
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,360
Yingzhou.

669
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,530
I promise I’ll come back

670
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,530
right after I get it.

671
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,630
Stop!

672
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,430
Yingzhou is indeed a land without a ruler,

673
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,410
but it's been guarded by the Rain God, Yan Luo.

674
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,650
Do you think I'm stupid

675
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,770
to let you go alone?

676
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,650
What should we do?

677
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,130
I'll go with you.

678
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,440
No, no.

679
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,140
If you come with me,

680
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,740
people will know that it's a demon

681
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,900
kidnapping a little fairy.

682
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,630
This may cause a war between the Heaven and Demon Realm.

683
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,640
Even if you are powerful,

684
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,660
the Heavenly Realm is not less than you.

685
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,190
The war could last for thousands of years.

686
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,840
Do you still want

687
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,020
to save your Huarong?

688
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,490
Let's go.

689
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,760
Wait.

690
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,950
Although your appearance has changed,

691
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,630
you still look fierce.

692
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,320
It looks much better this way.

693
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,300
From now on...

694
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Shut up.

695
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,330
Who's there?

696
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,570
It's me, Tao.

697
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Grass Fairy, Tao.

698
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,560
Greetings, Kitchen God in the East Kitchen and...

699
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,210
Him?

700
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,820
He's just a firewood man.

701
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,310
High Immortal of Firewood.

702
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,679
You're welcome. By the way,

703
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,179
where is the Rain God?

704
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,530
There's been a drought in the northwest.

705
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,900
Lord Rain went to see it.

706
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,050
He said he would be back soon.

707
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,280
God is on my side.

708
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,429
Tao.

709
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,690
It's only been a few days.

710
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,710
Why are you

711
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,960
so thin?

712
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,540
I'm not.

713
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,640
I've gained weight.

714
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,260
You're too thin.

715
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,610
It won't look good if a girl is too thin.

716
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,060
I specially prepared cake

717
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
with wine and mushroom flavor for you.

718
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,290
Try it.

719
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,410
No.

720
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,310
Tao.

721
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,530
What?

722
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,420
Do you really want to

723
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,490
the third Heaven-Demon War?

724
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,580
Tao, I'm sorry.

725
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,880
♫The autumn breeze twists and leaves turn into letters♫

Master,

751
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,220
I've tried my best.

752
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,300
But sometimes,

753
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,370
I don't know why.

754
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,070
the harder I try,

755
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,300
the more it's like now.

756
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,690
I can't even stand.

757
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,740
Do you think that our fate

758
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,260
has been settled

759
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,680
in the very beginning?

760
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,150
A jinx like me

761
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,640
can't be changed

762
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,250

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,730
♫Don't care if love will affect immortality♫

768
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,360
♫Only fate can build an oath♫

769
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,280
♫Even forget about everything♫

770
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,050
♫All I want is dreaming with you in the mortal world♫
