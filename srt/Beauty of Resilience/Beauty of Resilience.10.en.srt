4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,660
The Gu family was defeated,

5
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,980
but our Ming family was unharmed,

6
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,530
and even attained the position of City Governor.

7
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,550
People in Gucheng

8
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,500
have been buzzing about this matter.

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,230
Shut up!

10
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,790
The Ming family and the Gu family
share a deep bond and a strong sense of loyalty.

11
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,940
It is true that I, Ming Chengwu,

12
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,400
has caused harm to the Gu family,

13
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,020
but it was due to my weakness

14
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,060
and incompetence,

15
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
not out of my malicious intent!

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,990
Father.

17
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,090
Father!

18
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,770
Father, what's wrong?

19
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,790
Somebody help!

20
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,070
Father!

21
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,010
Help!

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,900
Wei Zhi! Master!

23
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,980
Hurry up and save my father!

24
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,660
He's poisoned.

25
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,500
Father.

26
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,120
Who wanted to harm you?

27
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,370
Father.

28
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,730
Father!

29
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:54,890
Father!

30
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,820
Why did you arrest him?

31
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,280
Ming Chengwu hired an assassin to commit murder

32
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,360
and then committed suicide out of fear.

33
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,510
This is a serious case.

34
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,660
And we have been instructed to arrest people involved in this case.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,430
Take him away.

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,820
Wait.

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,040
Who are you?

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,760
How dare you stop us from carrying out our investigation?

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm Yan Yue,

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,680
the Yan Immortal Envoy from Egret Academy.

41
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,870
She is my disciple, Wei Zhi.

42
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,870
How can you apprehend people

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,460
without any evidence?

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,100
Your surname is Wei.

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,900
Are you from Minister Wei's mansion?

46
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,790
Yes.

47
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,250
You should stay out of this.

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,660
This is a serious case.

49
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,510
We must take away people

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,620
related to Ming Chengwu.

51
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,320
Please forgive us, Immortal Envoy.

52
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,180
Take him!

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,560
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

Wei Zhi.

55
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,410
Trust me.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,890
My father didn't hurt anyone.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,079
He was framed!

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,040
Father.

59
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,430
Father!

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,160
Uncle Ming.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,950
There are fluctuations in the barrier.

62
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,510
You should go back first.

63
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,780
Wei Lingyue.

64
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,490

66
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,590
Where is Wei Lingyue?

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,170
Take it easy, Immortal Envoy.

68
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,720
The Imperial has issued an edict

69
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,850
to take Wei Lingyue to the palace for an audience with His Majesty.

70
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,710
Although I was being cautious,

71
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,670
the Demon Realm still prevailed.

72
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,020
Many mortals died in vain.

73
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,430
Yan Yue, look at yourself.

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,250
You were well aware that the Phoenix has reappeared,

75
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,580
and she's bound to attract the attention of others.

76
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,080
Why did you let Wei Lingyue slip away from your sight?

77
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,870
Why did you care about

78
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,840
the affairs of a mortal woman?

79
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,220
What...

80
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,150
was wrong with you?

81
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,880
You're awake.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,580
Who are you?

83
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,840
Where am I?

84
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,190
You're truly the Phoneix.

85
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,840
How can a mortal be so calm in this situation?

86
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,310
I'm Mu Nan.

87
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,770
Here

88
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,630
is your home.

89
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,320
You must be mistaken.

90
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm Wei Lingyue

91
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,670
from Dayu Minister's Mansion.

92
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,860
Where is this place?

93
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,790
Have you forgotten?

94
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,170
Right.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,159
Life can be hard and bitter,

96
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,310
while time makes people indifferent.

97
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,670
It has been so long

98
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,100
that you have even forgotten who you are,

99
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,090
that...

100
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,090
I can't feel your scent anymore.

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,320
This is the Demon Realm.

102
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,550
You can temporarily call me

103
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,470
the Supreme Lord of the Demon Clan.

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,140
The Supreme Lord of the Demon Clan?

105
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,280
The Demon Realm?

106
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,200
Don't worry.

107
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:21,990
No one

108
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,100
can harm you here.

109
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,090
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

110
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,920
Here.

111
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,950
Where are we going?

112
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,290
You'll know when you get there.

113
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,480
My Lord,

114
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,890
why did you bring me here?

115
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,700
This is the place

116
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,570
where you lived in your previous life.

117
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,540
You don't remember anything at all?

118
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,840
Are you sure

119
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,530
it was me?

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,580
Although I can't

121
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,000
fully remember you at the moment,

122
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,180
once you see Huarong,

123
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,750
you'll know everything.

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,010
Huarong?

125
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,700
Huarong

126
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,930
is the fragment of the Phoenix's soul

127
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,890
that fell into the flower bud after the Phoenix's fall.

128
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,850
It has been passed down for thousands of years,

129
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,650
waiting for

130
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,419
the reawakening of the Phoenix,

131
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,970
to merge with her

132
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,380
and awaken her once again.

133
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,880
What's this?

134
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,090
Greetings, Saintess.

135
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,490
Why did they call me Saintess?

136
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,720
Because if you are the Phoenix,

137
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:11,980
then you are

138
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,190
the Saintess of our Demon Realm.

139
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,530
Not only do you have to protect the Demon Realm,

140
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,740
but you also receive admiration from thousands of people.

141
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,550
Me?

142
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,970
Don't worry.

143
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,970
We'll

144
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,270
find the answer soon.

145
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,900
Greetings, Saintess.

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,130
Sister.

147
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,620
Don't be afraid.

148
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:38,890
Just go.

149
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,240
You're not the Phoenix!

150
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,040
You're just

151
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,570
a lowly peacock.

152
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,580
I'm not a peacock.

153
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm the Phoenix!

154
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,300
Huarong

155
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,040
will never make a mistake!

156
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,720
Take her away.

157
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,470
Let go of me!

158
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,660
Let go of me! I'm really the Phoenix!

159
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,120
Let go of me!

160
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,000
My Lord.

161
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,450
Please calm down.

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,800
A peacock

163
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,100
with such a lowly bloodline

164
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,610
managed to

165
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,520
fool all of us.

166
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,080
This Peacock

167
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:41,940
was actually the handmaid

168
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,070
of the Phoenix in ancient times.

169
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,760
Wei Lingyue possesses the bloodline of the peacock,

170
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,510
and her performance in the academy is exceptionally outstanding.

171
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,540
It's not surprising

172
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,820
that she could fool everyone.

173
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,320
But,

174
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,020
how could the mere bloodline of a peacock

175
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,740
cause the strange phenomenon

176
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,950
of "Birds paying homage to the Phoenix"?

177
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,750
That day,

178
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,930
she was not the only one

179
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,020
in the final assessment.

180
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,600
You mean...

181
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,340
Have you all heard about it?

182
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,710
There's a message from the palace

183
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,410
that Wei Lingyue was ordered to enter the palace

184
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,110
but went missing on the way.

185
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,970
It's said that the Demon Clan has abducted her.

186
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,950
Demon Clan?

187
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
If Master could have

188
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,170
escorted Wei Lingyue to the palace at that time,

189
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,340
such an accident

190
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,980
wouldn't have happened.

191
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,570
-That's right.
-Yeah.

192
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,270
But where did Master go?

193
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,490
-Besides, the Demon Clan...
-Something's wrong!

194
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,920
-Something's wrong!
-What’s wrong?

195
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Something's wrong!

196
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,580
What's wrong?

197
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,220
What's wrong? Just tell us!

198
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,580
Lord Ming has committed suicide out of fear.

199
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,220
And Ming Lang

200
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,810
was also taken away and interrogated by the Imperial Court.

201
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,020
What did you say?

202
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
What happened to Ming Lang?

203
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,470
What happened to Lord Ming?

204
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,650
Lord Ming, he...

205
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,200
he...

206
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,180
Just say it!

207
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,410
He hired an assassin to murder Wei Zhi

208
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,860
and her family.

209
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,220
Jingyue.

210
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,880
Wei Zhi!

211
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,390
It's you again.

212
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,060
Why does everything

213
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,980
has something to do with you?

214
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,230
How many people do you intend to implicate?

215
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,010
You jinx!

216
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,940
Wei Jingyue.

217
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,530
The Saint said,

218
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,850
"When faced with unexpected situations, 
remain calm and composed.

219
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,480
When unjustly insulted for no reason,
do not get angry."

220
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,010
I don't want

221
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,470
the sound of the rumors outside

222
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,670
to drown out

223
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,570
the sound of your studying.

224
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,750
From now on,

225
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,070
the Imperial Court will send people to guard the academy.

226
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,200
I will also take turns patrolling

227
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,780
with your teachers

228
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,640
to ensure the safety of the academy.

229
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,700
From now on,

230
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,820
all students

231
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,720
must return to your dorms for self-study.

232
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,620
Understood.

233
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,860
Don't worry, Jingyue.

234
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,870
Let's go.

235
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,420
Originally,

236
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,220
I could have kept you

237
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,170
to serve the Phoenix.

238
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,820
But a lowly peacock like you

239
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,750
dared to have improper thoughts!

240
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,910
What are you doing?

241
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,960
Don't you want to be the Phoenix?

242
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,650
I'll let Huarong

243
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,210
to purify your soul.

244
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,460
Are you trying to burn me to death?

245
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm not trying to burn you to death,

246
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,800
but I'm making you bathe in Huarong.

247
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,260
Master?

248
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,460
Are you okay?

249
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,060
It’s really you.

250
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,670
Wei Lingyue

251
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,170
is my student.

252
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,240
Give her back to me,

253
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,950
and I will let bygones be bygones.

254
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,420
If you want to save...

255
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,560
the Phoenix,

256
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,690
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

257
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,030
Thank you for saving me, Master.

258
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,920
It's my duty

259
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,710
to protect the Phoenix.

260
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,030
The people of the Demon Clan

261
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,640
are often cruel and eccentric.

262
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,650
From now on,

263
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,100
you should be more careful.

264
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,550
Master.

265
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,120
I'm so scared.

266
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:49,990
What's wrong?

267
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,890
Do you feel uncomfortable?

268
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,470
I just feel

269
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,090
a complete lack of strength.

270
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,860
You must be infected by the demon aura.

271
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,870
Hang in there.

272
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,450
You'll get better when you reach the mortal world.

273
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,870
What‘s wrong with me?

274
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,030
Why am I still anxious?

275
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,490
Master, are you willing to

276
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,020
protect me forever?

277
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,500
Half of my spiritual power was sealed,

278
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,180
but I still managed to win so effortlessly.

279
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,940
Is the Supreme Lord of the Demon Clan

280
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,720
merely a reputation without substance?

281
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:35,970
Something's off.

282
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,370
It shouldn't be like this.

283
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,040
I've admired you for a long time.

284
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,020
If you don't mind...

285
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,620
Wei Lingyue.

286
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,720
What are you talking about?

287
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,800
Right now, you need to calm your mind

288
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,570
instead of thinking nonsense.

289
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,310
There must be something wrong.

290
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,190
Bastard!

291
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,640
It's all your fault!

292
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,970
Wei Jingyue,

293
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,250
what are you up to this time?

294
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,430
How dare you call my name?

295
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,030
It's all your fault.

296
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,860
Whoever has anything to do with you

297
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,740
will get in trouble!

298
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,380
Previously, you seduced the Master

299
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,180
and threw yourself into his arms.

300
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,980
Now you have used

301
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,780
dirty tricks

302
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,820
to harm Ming Lang!

303
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,580
Don't slander me!

304
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,620
Today,

305
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll teach you a lesson!

306
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,790
How dare you fight back?

307
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,860
I think you're looking for death, Wei Zhi.

308
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,460
Go away!

309
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,920
Give me back my bracelet!

310
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,240
No way!

311
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,260
I refuse to give you

312
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,430
even the slightest bit

313
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,750
of what you want,

314
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,660
as you're a despicable woman!

315
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,390
Go to hell!

316
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,440
It's the scent of the Phoenix!

317
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,600
Master!

318
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,020
That's strange.

319
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,020
Why is your hand so hot?

320
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,070
Aren't you cold?

321
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,620
The Phoenix

322
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,190
is Wei Zhi...

323
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,640
Why?

324
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,700
Why her?

325
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,940
Don't force me!

326
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,200
Sister.

327
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,220
You hand is injured.

328
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,480
She bullied you, right?

329
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,450
Who are you?

330
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,210
My father is Minister Wei.

331
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,890
If you dare touch me,

332
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,350
my father won't spare you!

333
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,220
Don't! Please don't kill her.

334
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,510
Fine.

335
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,850
If you say so.

336
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,760
You...

337
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,950
Don't come over.

338
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,740
Sister.

339
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,280
Don't be afraid.

340
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,420
Sister.

341
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,780
Are you

342
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,820
mad at me because

343
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,030
I didn't recognize you before?

344
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,380
Sister!

345
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,180
Don't come over!

346
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,780
Sister.

347
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,220
I just want to take you back, sister.

348
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,940
D-don't come any closer!

349
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,370
Sister!

350
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,990
-I told you to stay away from me.
-Sister.

351
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,940
Don't be afraid.

352
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
-Listen to me.
-Don’t come over.

353
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,300
Sister!

354
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,260
I'm here to take you home.

355
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,370
Help!

356
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,970
Look.

357
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,020
Help!

358
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Isn't that Wei Zhi?

359
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,900
It's that Demon Clan people again.

360
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,620
What are you doing? Don't go there.

361
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,910
But we can't just stand by and ignore the danger she's in!

362
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,060
Well, this...

363
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,090
What should we do?

364
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,070
I'll go save her.

365
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,040
You guys should inform the Dean.

366
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,660
What are you doing?

367
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,380
Where are you going?

368
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,460
What should we do? What now?

369
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:58,940
Let's go.

370
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,980
Let's go find the Dean!

371
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
-Let's go! L-et's go to the Dean!

372
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Sister.

373
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,220
Don't come over.

374
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,740
Sister!

375
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,150
Don't come any closer!

376
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,610
Sister!

377
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,490
Sister.

378
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,260
Sister.

379
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,700
As long as I'm here,

380
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,400
no one can harm you.

381
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,860
I don't even know you.

382
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,050
Don't force me.

383
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,380
Sister!

384
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,010
Stop!

385
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,560
You demon bastard!

386
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,060
Take this and die!

387
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,120
What have you done?

388
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,220
You know

389
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,860
he couldn't hurt you.

390
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,060
Why did you kill him?

391
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,360
Because he called me demon bastard

392
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,100
in front of you.

393
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,460
I know you're not a demon bastard,

394
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,300
but a lunatic!

395
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,580
Sister.

396
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,720
I know you still can't remember me now.

397
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,290
But I don't care about anything else

398
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,440
except you.

399
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,200
Wei Zhi!

400
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,240
Dean.

401
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,160
Are you alright?

402
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm fine.

403
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,160
Elder Mu?

404
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,400
My name is Jingxiu.

405
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,970
Who are you?

406
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,590
Why did you destroy my academy

407
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,670
and kill my disciple?

408
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Are you that mortal?

409
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,570
Then you should know that

410
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,030
trying to stop me

411
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,210
is like hitting a stone with an egg,

412
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,690
it's suicide.

413
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,060
It's precisely because mortals are slow-witted

414
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,830
that they would sacrifice themselves to seek truth.

415
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,760
Suit yourslef.

416
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:42,720
Sister.

417
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,360
Let's go.

418
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,010
I'm not coming with you!

419
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,280
You're infinitely resourceful.

420
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,700
Why are you making things difficult for an ordinary student

421
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,900
from our academy?

422
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,780
Why don't you stop now?

423
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,250
An ordinary student?

424
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,160
She's the Phoenix.

425
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,150
The Phoenix?

426
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,420
-The Phoenix? -The Phoenix!

427
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,490
Phoenix.

428
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,620
Pho-phoenix?

429
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,700
Stop talking nonsense.

430
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,260
I'm not the Phoenix at all.

431
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,070
Sister.

432
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,540
Come back with me.

433
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,380
Huarong will make you remember everything.

434
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,840
I won't go with you!

435
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,360
In that case,

436
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,420
no matter what,

437
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
I must bring you back.

438
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,340
Demon bastard, you wish!

439
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,940
No way!

440
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,230
Stop!

441
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,900
Don't hurt them.

442
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,300
I'll go with you.

443
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,930
Master! Master!

444
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,000
The Chixiao Sword.

445
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,890
You are the God of Red Sun.

446
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,590
I must take the Phoenix with me today.

447
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,020
The Phoenix

448
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,280
is not something you can covet.

449
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,600
Really?

450
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,620
Today,

451
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,540
let me,

452
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,650
the so-called demon bastard as they say,

453
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,300
to challenge you,

454
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,760
the lofty Divine Lord.

455
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,430
Master! Master!

456
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,250
Master!

457
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,340
Master.

458
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,410
As the mighty Divine Lord,

459
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,500
you're unexpectedly too weak.

460
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,650
Your cultivation has been sealed,

461
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,800
and yet you still dare to fight me?

462
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,580
The Chixiao Sword requires spiritual power to wield.

463
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,980
But now,

464
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,150
there's nothing you can do about it.

465
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,800
Sister.

466
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,630
Princess, run!

467
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,120
Wei Zhi!

468
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,730
Wei Zhi!

469
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,090
Wei Zhi, are you alright?

470
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,970
Where is Master?

471
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,940
How is he?

472
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:16,790
He...

473
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,740
Master.

474
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,250
Master!

475
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,300
Wei Zhi.

476
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,020
Are you alright?

477
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,990
I'm fine.

478
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,920
The Demon Clan's people are on their way here.

479
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,860
It's not safe here.

480
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,050
Let's go to the Devil Realm with me.

481
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,050
Master, I trust him.

482
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,010
Okay.

483
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,070
Let's go!

484
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,950
The Demon Supreme Lord's magic

485
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,950
is powerful and evil.

486
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,290
I'm afraid it has hurt his vitality.

487
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,820
He needs to rest for a long period of time.

488
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,180
Wei Zhi.

489
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,660
Wei Zhi.

490
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:52,760
Let's go.

491
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,830
We're almost there.

492
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,400
What's this?

493
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,320
It's the bathing pool.

494
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,870
Look how dirty you are,

495
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,739
you need to take a good bath.

496
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,909
I think I'll just go back and fetch some water to wash myself.

497
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,980
No, no, no.

498
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:19,929
Don't do that.

499
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,750
I'm not peeping.

500
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,690
Besides,

501
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,100
you just wash carefully here,

502
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,460
I'll guard the door for you outside.

503
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,310
Don't worry.

504
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,010
Then I'm more worried.

505
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,730
What's there to worry about?

506
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,130
How about we bathe together?

507
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,179
Just kidding, just kidding.

508
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,780
You've been through so much just now.

509
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,370
You must be tired.

510
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,840
Take a bath and you'll feel better.

511
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,389
Am I right?

512
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,010
Take your time.

513
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,440
I won't peep at all.

514
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,590
Take your time.

515
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I bear heavy responsibility for this matter.

516
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,230
I implore the Heavenly Emperor to punish me severely.

517
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,100
Get up.

518
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,850
Since the Phoenix has appeared,

519
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,660
the Demon Realm must take action.

520
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,990
It concerns the Three Realms,

521
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,430
and more importantly, the future of Yan Yue.

522
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,690
Now,

523
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,420
I'm not going to hold anyone accountable.

524
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,780
I want to

525
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,950
find Yan Yue and the Phoenix

526
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,820
before the Demon Realm gets to them.

527
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,390
I will do my best

528
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,660
to redeem myself.

529
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,810
You mentioned that the God of Mountain reported

530
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,620
their last trace was

531
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,380
near Wuji Mountain.

532
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,200
The Devil Realm has always maintained a high level of secrecy.

533
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,390
You can't enter the realm

534
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,460
unless you find their magic gate.

535
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,340
In that case,

536
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,980
they should still be in the mortal world.

537
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,350
There are countless cliffs

538
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,730
in Wuji Mountain,

539
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,790
and the terrain is complex.

540
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,780
Moreover, I have sealed

541
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,940
half of Yan Yue's spiritual power.

542
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,910
The Phoenix is still weak due to her young age.

543
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,090
They mainly want to avoid

544
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,250
the pursuit of the Supreme Lord of the Demon Clan.

545
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,020
Perhaps they are trapped somewhere.

546
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,210
I'll go investigate it immediately.

547
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,740
Fine.

548
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,290
You must be extra cautious

549
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,670
during the search.

550
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,000
Don't disturb the Devil Realm

551
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,500
or hurt the mortals.

552
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,410
As for that Demon Clan,

553
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,320
let's not

554
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,930
confront with them now.

555
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,240
Understood.

556
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:23,760
Ou Ya.

557
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,720
You're awake?

558
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,180
Where's Wei Zhi?

559
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,060
She...

560
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,330
Master.

561
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,240
She's so pretty.

562
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,960
Wei Zhi, are you alright?

563
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,030
I didn't expect that I'm truly the Phoenix.

564
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,160
Master, what should I do?

565
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,930
Don't think too much for now.

566
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,180
There are many things you need to gradually adapt to.

567
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,960
The most important thing now

568
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,800
is your safety.

569
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:53,920
Ou Ya.

570
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,810
Where are we?

571
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,530
We're in the Wolf Cave in the Devil Realm.

572
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,830
Devil Realm?

573
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,890
The Devil Realm

574
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,350
has always remained indifferent to the conflicts between Immortals and Demons.

575
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,850
What's your intention to the Phoenix

576
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,010
in bringing us here?

577
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:07,990
What?

578
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,470
I'm the Prince of the Wolf Clan in the Devil Realm.

579
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,530
What intentions could I

580
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,470
possibly have towards the Phoenix?

581
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,940
If I can get a mature Phoenix's

582
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,500
tail feather,

583
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,330
it has the potential to change the situation of our Devil Clan,

584
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,370
where females are scarce

585
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,530
and bloodlines are weak.

586
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,160
Ou Ya.

587
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,600
Are you out of your mind?

588
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,660
How dare you bring people to the Devil Realm?

589
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:27,990
I mean...

590
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,700
Non-devil beings

591
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,100
are not permitted to enter the Devil Realm

592
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,550
If the Devil King finds out,

593
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,470
you will be punished.

594
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,230
If we don't say anything,

595
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,950
who would know?

596
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,410
What do you mean?

597
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,250
She's not an ordinary mortal.

598
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,950
In less than three days,

599
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,540
everyone in the Three Realms will know that

600
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,650
a big bird has gone missing.

601
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,380
And by that time, the Demon Clan people will come here.

602
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,980
Are you trying to get us killed?

603
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,210
Well, I mean, Wei Zhi...

604
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,530
Don't listen to her.

605
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,340
Indeed, the Devil Clan is relatively weak.

606
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,840
But the problem is,

607
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,210
the Heaven Realm and the Demon Realm
have been fighting for so many years,

608
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,690
and neither side can defeat the other.

609
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,620
So the Devil Clan's attitude

610
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,140
suddenly becomes so important.

611
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,020
Whichever side we support

612
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,290
will be the winner, right?

613
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,310
So, the Heaven and Demon Realms

614
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,430
have formed an agreement,

615
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,180
that prohibits either side

616
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,060
from intruding into the Devil Realm without a valid reason.

617
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,980
So our Devil Realm

618
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,640
is the safest place.

619
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
You can rest assured of that.

620
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,720
Where's the Devil King's prohibition then?

621
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:14,650
Prohibition?

622
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,900
What's that?

623
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,980
The Devil King has ordered that

624
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,100
all devils

625
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,730
should not get involved with the Phoenix.

626
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,770
Are you enchanted or something?

627
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,240
I...

628
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,900
I'll go tell the Devil King right now.

629
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,420
It's not like that!

630
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,060
Lan Su. Lan Su, Lan Su!

631
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,170
L-Lan Su.

632
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,140
Are you really going to tell the Devil King?

633
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,260
If something bad

634
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,940
were to happen to me,

635
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,940
wouldn't you be worried?
