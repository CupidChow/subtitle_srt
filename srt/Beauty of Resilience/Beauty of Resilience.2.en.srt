4
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,350
Master.

5
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
What's wrong?

6
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
Are you okay?

7
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,320
You can leave now.

8
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,360
You...

9
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,150
Sorry.

10
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,530
Why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

11
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,060
I met

12
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,020
a strange woman.

13
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,540
She broke into my barrier.

14
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,550
In the Three Realms,

15
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,120
not many people

16
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,430
can break into your barrier.

17
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,420
So I measured her immortal bones.

18
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,010
How is it? Is she...

19
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:20,990
No.

20
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,980
She's just

21
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,480
an ordinary mortal,

22
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,180
who doesn't even have a lower-class immortal bone.

23
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,660
That's strange.

24
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,310
Did you make some mistakes

25
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,180
when you set the barrier?

26
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,470
Maybe.

27
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,700
But there's something even stranger.

28
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,180
What?

29
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,079
I saw

30
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,530
her future.

31
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,530
What is it like?

32
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,650
It's just an illusion.

33
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,130
In it, she's still young,

34
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,890
but she dies in a fire.

35
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,990
It seems that

36
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,660
it happens shortly afterward.

37
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,800
Yan Yue,

38
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,250
if you feel compassion,

39
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,610
I have to remind you,

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
the fate of mortals

41
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,370
should be changed by themselves.

42
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,330
If you interfere,

43
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,620
you will be punished severely.

44
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,520
I know.

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,250
Now that she's a mortal,

46
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,750
you don't need to take it to heart.

47
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,220
The priority is to select the Phoenix.

48
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,990
Yan Yue descended to the mortal world to find the real Phoenix.

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
You must pay close attention to

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
his every move.

51
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,310
If anything unusual happens,

52
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,500
you must report it in time.

53
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,760
Heavenly Emperor, you mean...

54
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,980
Yan Yue,

56
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,970
I hope everything goes well for you.

57
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,860
Don't repeat the same mistake.

58
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,780
Bao Liang.

59
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,900
You're back.

60
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,900
Yes, I'm back.

61
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,250
Bao Liang, you're back.

62
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
Is he the new master?

63
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,530
Yes.

64
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,080
Where is he from?

65
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,050
I'm incompetent.

66
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,510
We didn't find out his exact background,

67
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,900
only that

68
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,230
the magic he used is from the Heavenly Realm.

69
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,200
The magic of the Heavenly Realm?

70
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,220
Slow down.

71
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,220
No, no.

72
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,880
My waist.

73
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,180
Are we here for cultivation

74
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,340
or going through hardships?

75
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,380
If we're practicing like this,

76
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,460
why should we come to Egret Academy?

77
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,500
Isn't it good to go to a Martial Club instead?

78
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,640
I feel my legs

79
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,120
are not mine anymore.

80
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,290
Come here, give me a massage.

81
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,440
What's wrong with her?

82
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
What are you waiting for?

83
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,110
I'm calling you. Come here.

84
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,760
Hurry up.

85
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,540
She's really coming.

86
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,410
Is it comfortable?

87
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,770
Master is here.

88
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,610
Master! Master!

89
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,300
Master, I was wrong.

90
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,440
Five more laps.

91
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,900
You, run with her.

92
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,700
Why?

93
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,110
Everyone,

94
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
the third rule

95
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,490
of Egret Academy is

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,990
self-respect.

97
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,510
Today,

98
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,200
the first lesson begins.

99
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,270
The first lesson?

100
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,160
What were those before?

101
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,390
This is the skills of Deity Arts.

102
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,560
They're different from ordinary foundation skills.

103
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,280
If you start learning the skills of Deity Arts

104
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,170
without a strong body,

105
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,190
it'll harm your health at best,

106
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,250
or hurt your spirit if it's severe.

107
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,770
Master,

108
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,200
please show us

109
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,900
to widen our vision.

110
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,010
Teleportation.

111
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,270
Amazing!

112
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,060
No matter how brilliant the magic is,

113
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,390
it's just a skill.

114
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,450
What the cultivators seek is Tao.

115
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,700
Tao is the spirit of magic.

116
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,120
The magic is the body of Tao.

117
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,490
You use the Dao to control the magic and attain Dao through magic.

118
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,360
Only when your Dao and magic are both good,

119
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,050
will you succeed.

120
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,630
The virtuous Dao is natural.

121
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,480
The Dao has no form but it bred the sky and Earth.

122
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,450
The Dao has no feelings but it runs the Sun and the Moon.

123
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,530
The Dao has no name but it nurtures everything in the world.

124
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,970
My sister is so great.

125
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,860
She can't even stand firm,

126
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,740
how can she learn the Teleportation?

127
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,460
She's too stupid.

128
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,620
The highest level of Teleportation

129
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,100
can teleport other people

130
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,660
to the place you want.

131
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,880
But those who are teleported

132
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,400
must be relaxed

133
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,140
and

134
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,720
trust the spellcaster.

135
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,500
Does he hint that

136
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,720
I don't trust him?

137
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,000
Next, practice according to

138
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,470
the manual.

139
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,910
I master the magic of teleportation!

140
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,530
Sister, I can teleport myself!

141
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,150
He can do it too?

142
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,860
Yes.

143
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,190
Ming.

144
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,340
Ming,

145
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,990
you're amazing.

146
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
Do you have any tips?

147
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,320
Can you teach me?

148
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,980
Like this.

149
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,230
Then turn like this.

150
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,140
Like this?

151
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,630
Like this?

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,110
Move!

153
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,180
Why am I not moving?

154
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,350
How about this?

155
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,900
Ming.

156
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,760
Am I doing it correctly?

157
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,350
Yes.

158
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,510
Actually, the most important thing is

159
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,900
to focus

160
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,180
and not to think about anything else.

161
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,870
Go away.

162
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,280
She did it too.

163
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,820
Wei Lingyue

164
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,670
moved such a long distance.

165
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,700
Amazing.

166
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,260
She's so talented.

167
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,940
Wei Lingyue,

168
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,990
what were you thinking about

169
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,990
when you were performing the magic just now?

170
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Master,

171
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,140
I was not thinking about anything.

172
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,990
I just remembered the spell,

173
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,640
and it just worked out like that.

174
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,110
Master,

175
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,190
that is the gift, right?

176
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,590
Jingyue.

177
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,480
Lady Lingyue is so amazing.

178
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
When can I

179
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,710
be like her?

180
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,460
My Lord,

181
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,960
do you think that woman

182
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,230
is the Phoenix?

183
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,780
Shut up!

184
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,580
The Phoenix

185
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,650
is not something you can speculate.

186
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,600
Master,

187
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,740
it's not that I don't trust you.

188
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,790
It's just… it's so sudden

189
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,190
that I didn't realize it.

190
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,150
Usually,

191
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,240
you stay in your boudoir.

192
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,980
I think this is the first time

193
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,510
that you see this kind of situation.

194
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,870
I've heard a lot from my father

195
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,630
about the natural disasters in recent years,

196
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,420
but I never realized that

197
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,790
even in the suburbs of Yu Du,

198
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,060
the famine is also so severe.

199
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,070
The people are so pitiful.

200
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,350
How do you feel?

201
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,420
A cultivator

202
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,200
should always keep calm.

203
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,490
Your spirit should be stable,

204
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,960
your heart should be calm,

205
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,860
and you shouldn't be disturbed by the mortal world,

206
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,540
right?

207
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,520
A virtuous person should conform to nature.

208
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,720
If we can conform to the Natural Law

209
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,160
we'll be out of the depth of misfortune and get bliss in the end.

210
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,830
Yes, Master.

211
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,120
Lingyue.

212
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,540
Lingyue.

213
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,670
Lingyue.

214
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,820
Lingyue, you are amazing.

215
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,880
Lingyue.

216
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,340
Where did you go with Master?

217
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
To Yu Du's city wall.

218
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,420
-The wall? -Yu Du's city wall?

219
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,800
It's so far.

220
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,180
Master is back too.

221
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,020
Master.

222
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,190
That's all for today's lesson.

223
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,460
Everyone,

224
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,790
copy the mental methods

225
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,390
and the spell of teleportation 100 times.

226
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,170
Make sure you know it by heart.

227
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,310
100 times!

228
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,700
Do you think that's too little work?

229
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,020
100 times. 100 times.

230
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,390
That's too much.

231
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,980
Let's go back.

232
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,370
Wei Zhi.

233
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,220
Go and clean

234
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,140
the academy.

235
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,990
Master didn't tell us to do that.

236
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,300
Indeed he didn't tell you,

237
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,400
but can't I order you to do it instead?

238
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,570
Do you still remember

239
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,810
you are a servant of our Wei family?

240
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,140
Jingyue.

241
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,870
Don't always make things difficult for her.

242
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,340
Lingyue.

243
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,650
I didn't hit her or scold her.

244
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,940
I just asked her to clean up.

245
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,140
How did I make things difficult for her?

246
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,510
She is a skivvy

247
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,300
in our mansion,

248
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,120
but now she is

249
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,110
on an equal footing with me,

250
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,670
and she even ignores my words.

251
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,700
She even talks back!

252
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,610
If this gets out,

253
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,790
I will lose face!

254
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,580
Okay, I got it.

255
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,060
Wei Zhi.

256
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,130
then please

257
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,300
do what Jingyue said.

258
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,270
Yes, Lady Lingyue.

259
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,330
Lingyue, you were really amazing today.

260
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
You must be the Phoenix.

261
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,710
Enough, stop talking.

262
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,820
Master will kick you out if he hears it.

263
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,500
I didn't expect

264
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,180
that you had escaped

265
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,030
from that disaster.

266
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,540
Gu Fengzhi, the young lady from Gucheng,

267
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,580
is dead.

268
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,650
I'm a skivvy in the Minister of Rites' Mansion now.

269
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,210
My name's Wei Zhi.

270
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,430
Okay.

271
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,890
Got it.

272
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,740
Ming Lang.

273
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,130
From now on,

274
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,060
we should pretend that we've never met before

275
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,510
and abide by the hierarchy between masters and servants.

276
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,200
That'd be the best.

277
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,290
Fengzhi,

278
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,380
I mean,

279
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,690
Wei Zhi,

280
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,990
I can't imagine

281
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,600
how you've been through these years.

282
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,610
But don't worry.

283
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,220
Once you enter the Egret Academy

284
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,970
and get rid of the status of being a slave,

285
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,200
life will get better.

286
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,140
I need to learn some abilities

287
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,500
to allow me to earn my living.

288
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,700
By then, my mother and little brother

289
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,200
can have enough food to eat.

290
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,839
Don't worry.

291
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,859
I won't tell anyone

292
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,510
about your family's

293
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,520
whereabouts.

294
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,980
Thank you.

295
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,579
Wei Zhi.

296
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,190
I gave you

297
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,500
a hairpin before.

298
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,680
Do you still have it?

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,770
My son is very naughty.

300
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
If he causes any trouble

301
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,070
in your mansion,

302
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,060
please forgive him.

303
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,460
You're too polite.

304
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,810
[Ming Lang's Father, Ming Chengwu]

305
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,810
[City Governor of Gucheng, Gu Yuanshan]

306
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,600
Lord,

307
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,760
does the betrothal of our children

308
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,780
count or not?

309
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,930
We are like brothers.

310
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,760
Of course we should get closer by becoming in-laws.

311
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,070
Fengzhi,

312
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,080
this is for you.

313
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,840
My mother gave it to me.

314
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,960
My father said

315
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,750
I should treat you very well in the future.

316
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,120
[Little Ming Lang]

317
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,380
Well...

318
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,590
I pawned it long ago.

319
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,560
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,620
It's okay.

321
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,270
Okay, I'll leave now.

322
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,120
Okay.

323
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,090
For thousands of years,

324
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,890
the Demon Realm has been enervated and the mortal world has been peaceful.

325
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,870
The Heaven Realm is in charge of the Three Realms.

326
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,380
[Thunder God]

327
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,700
It's all because of the great leadership of the Heavenly Emperor.

328
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,060
We feel a vicarious honor.

329
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,860
The Red Sun God, Yan Yue,

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,850
[Wind God]

331
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,080
defend the Three Realms with invincibility.

332
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,210
The Rain God, Yan Luo,

333
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,470
nourishes all living creatures.

334
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,580
The two brothers help each other

335
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,720
and serve the Heavenly Emperor wholeheartedly.

336
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,820
That's indeed the luck of our Heaven Realm.

337
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,890
You flatter me, Wind God.

338
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,250
I'm coming.

339
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,260
I finally made it.

340
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,980
Kitchen God from the East Kitchen.

341
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,140
Your Majesties.

342
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,860
I specially developed

343
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,780
a new dessert.

344
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,580
Please have a taste.

345
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,790
Well...

346
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,160
Qing Huan.

347
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,470
Have a piece.

348
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,540
No.

349
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,210
I have an upset stomach these days.

350
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,270
You're really unlucky.

351
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,340
I haven't been back to the Heavenly Palace for a long time.

352
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,220
I miss

353
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Cousin Yi'er's food so much.

354
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,130
Let me try.

355
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,840
Delicious.

356
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,660
Your cooking skills have improved a lot.

357
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,020
The High Immortals of Heaven Realm

358
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,910
are all inflexible

359
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,360
and indifferent.

360
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,480
My cousin Yan Luo

361
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,900
is the most caring one.

362
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:57,830
Yi'er,

363
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,150
don't talk nonsense.

364
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,270
Cultivation is all about being void of vanities.

365
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,140
Because you couldn't

366
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,280
be indifferent to worldly temptations,

367
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,360
your cultivation stops right there.

368
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,550
It's okay.

369
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,540
That's all

370
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,780
for the Red Sun God's moves

371
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,540
in Egret Academy.

372
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:28,960
You may leave.

373
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,930
If there's anything unusual,

374
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,890
report to me at any time.

375
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,590
Yes.

376
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,670
Father.

377
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,760
I've been back to the Heavenly Court for a long time.

378
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,150
Yingzhou needs help,

379
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,330
so I come to say goodbye.

380
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:50,650
Yan Luo,

381
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,010
farming takes a lot of energy,

382
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,540
but there is already

383
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,940
a High Immortal there to take charge,

384
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,590
and that's enough.

385
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,710
Now the Phoenix is going to appear.

386
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,500
Aren't you going to stay in the Heavenly Court

387
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,270
to help?

388
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,860
There are many rules in the Heavenly Court.

389
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
Yan Luo is used to being free.

390
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,500
And he always loves stuff like farming and weaving.

391
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:12,900
Heavenly Emperor.

392
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,420
Just let him go.

393
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,150
You always side with Yan Luo.

394
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,860
You've spoiled him with too much liberty.

395
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,790
Sooner or later, he has to take

396
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,680
his due responsibilities.

397
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,440
Yan Yue will

398
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,590
take responsibility for those major problems.

399
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:30,910
Luo,

400
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,790
do you have any complaints

401
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,430
about Yan Yue's promotion to a God?

402
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,930
I don't mean that.

403
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,700
The promotion of Yan Yue

404
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,630
is what everyone wants.

405
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,850
I have an ordinary quality and an undiciplined nature.

406
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,270
I just want to be a common immortal.

407
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,370
But food is the paramount necessity of the people.

408
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,780
If my farming in Yingzhou

409
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,120
can relieve people's distress,

410
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,310
it is also a merit.

411
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,930
Thank you, Father.

412
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,820
Sister,

413
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,260
what have you been doing

414
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
with Her Majesty?

415
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,130
Nothing much.

416
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,460
I'm just cleaning the time dust.

417
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,970
Time dust?

418
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,220
Her Majesty is in charge of the time

419
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,130
of the Three Realms.

420
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,660
At the gaps when birth, aging, illness, and death circles

421
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,020
and everything changes,

422
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,050
some time dust that's not forgotten

423
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,780
or covered is left.

424
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,030
If you don't clean it in time,

425
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,470
there will be more and more of it,

426
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,540
which will overwhelm the River of Time.

427
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,780
I don't understand.

428
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,250
Neither do I.

429
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Her Majesty said the past is the past,

430
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,770
the present is the present,

431
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,570
and the future will come in the future.

432
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,480
I don't understand even more.

433
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,510
Tao.

434
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,010
Sister, I'm leaving.

435
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,300
Mother.

436
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,560
I’m leaving.

437
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,830
Be careful.

438
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,700
Heavenly Empress,

439
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,940
if you're so unwilling to let His Highness Yan Luo go,

440
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,300
why didn’t you ask him to stay?

441
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,610
Your Majesty.

442
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,440
What exactly does this omen

443
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,390
want to remind me?

444
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,530
Yan Luo.

445
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,620
Mother is not

446
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,600
benevolent or loving.

447
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,430
I just wish

448
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,300
that you can stay away from

449
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,330
the treacherous center of power

450
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,530
and that you can be

451
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,340
a Rain God freely.

452
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,460
Wei Jingyue.

453
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,510
It's Wei Jingyue again.

454
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,470
I can't stand it.

455
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,940
I'll go get even with her.

456
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,110
Wei Jingyue,

457
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,460
as a daughter of a Minister,

458
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,250
you're narrow-minded, mean and domineering.

459
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,980
You should be ashamed

460
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,220
when compared to the kind and graceful Lady Lingyue.

461
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,980
You always bully me.

462
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,620
What?

463
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,990
Can you gain extra weight by bullying me

464
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,110
or can you become a phoenix?

465
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,580
It's impossible.

466
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,330
You know what? A person like you

467
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,380
should stop dreaming about

468
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,980
your so-called

469
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,380
Brother Ming Lang.

470
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,020
He's

471
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,860
not interested at all

472
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,750
in a vicious woman like you.

473
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,010
You...

474
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,980
Wei Zhi.

475
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,560
Lady Lingyue.

476
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,430
Jingyue is not in her room.

477
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,170
Are you looking for her for something?

478
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,120
Nothing.

479
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,090
Jingyue is spoiled.

480
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,080
If she does anything wrong,

481
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,640
don't take it to heart.

482
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,820
I'll scold her.

483
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,070
Thank you, Lady Lingyue.

484
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,810
By the way,

485
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,150
did they ask you to wash

486
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,430
Master's clothes?

487
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes.

488
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,220
Then today,

489
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,600
let me wash them.

490
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,650
Well...

491
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,860
According to the rules of our academy,

492
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,660
we should take turns to do it.

493
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,590
It's okay.

494
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,890
How can you do such heavy work

495
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,980
as a lady?

496
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,410
The clothes are in the servants' room, right?

497
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,770
No, no, no.

498
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,990
I start to fantasize in broad daylight.

499
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,810
I'm doomed.

500
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,750
[Egret Academy]

501
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,480
Senior.

502
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,260
Well,

503
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,840
I'm going down the mountain to buy stationery.

504
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Please do me a favor.

505
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,820
You must come back before dark.

506
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,790
Thank you.

507
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,480
Go.

508
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,910
According to you,

509
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,650
Lady Wei Lingyue

510
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,880
is indeed different.

511
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,310
I also measured her immortal bones,

512
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,640
which are light and pure.

513
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,050
She is very different

514
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,110
from Wei Zhi.

515
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,890
Can you tell

516
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,750
if she is the Phoenix?

517
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,170
Although she has some talents,

518
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,220
I'm not sure

519
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,390
if she's just a mortal

520
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,450
who is destined to be a deity.

521
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,150
Based on the current situation,

522
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,090
it's still too early to judge.

523
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,980
If they keep practicing

524
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,900
the skills of Deity Arts,

525
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,440
their gap

526
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,530
will be more and more obvious.

527
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,420
Those with immortal bones will improve quickly.

528
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,880
Those who are not qualified

529
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,290
will not progress,

530
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,350
or even retrogress.

531
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,140
Over time,

532
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,820
the truth will come to light.

533
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,090
Isn't this a talisman for help from Yi'er?

534
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,640
This girl

535
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,700
must have gone to the mortal world

536
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,750
and have caused trouble again.

537
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,700
Cousin, I'm at the Happiness Pavilion.

538
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,780
Come and save me!

539
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,720
Hurry up!

540
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,780
Miss,

541
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,610
where are you going?

542
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,910
I'm only here

543
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,320
to…

544
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,350
to see your

545
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,460
beautiful feast.

546
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,060
This is the beautiful feast.

547
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,480
Isn't it special?

548
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,380
I...

549
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,370
I'm not eating.

550
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,390
I'm leaving.

551
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,600
Miss,

552
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,510
it's up to you whether you eat it or not.

553
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,380
But you must pay all the money

554
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,640
for the feast.

555
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,360
How much?

556
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,620
30 taels.

557
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,630
What?

558
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,820
So expensive?

559
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,210
Qing Huan, you lied to me.

560
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,230
You said 20 taels can support one for a year

561
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,630
in the mortal world.

562
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,950
Can you make it cheaper?

563
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,500
What do you take Happiness Pavilion for?

564
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,180
It's not like a market

565
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,530
where you can bargain.

566
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,590
Do you have no money?

567
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,610
It doesn't matter.

568
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,240
You don't look

569
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,710
very smart,

570
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,370
but your look…

571
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,470
How about

572
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,250
come be a dish

573
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,770
in our beautiful feast?

574
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,770
Cousin!

575
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,380
Catch her!

576
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,020
Come and save me! I'm at the Happiness Pavilion!

577
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,860
-Cousin! -Go!

578
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,140
Hurry up!

579
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:24,980
Hurry up!

580
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,270
Cousin, help!

581
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,600
Cousin, help me!

582
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,490
Cousin, help me.

583
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,390
This cousin of yours is quite handsome.

584
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,320
Cousin,

585
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,620
I'll leave this to you.

586
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,220
Thank you for saving my life.

587
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,450
Your cousin still owes me money.

588
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,810
How much?

589
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,930
30 taels…

590
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,010
of gold.

591
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,720
It's all Qing Huan's fault

592
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,260
that I didn't bring enough money.

593
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,000
No.

594
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,790
It's all Heavenly Emperor's fault.

595
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,790
He set the rule

596
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,150
that we're not allowed to conjure money with Immortal Techniques.

597
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,670
I wonder if Cousin Yan Yue

598
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,980
can get away safely.

599
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:50,980
Forget it.

600
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,530
He is a God.

601
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,060
I don't need to worry about him.

602
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,260
You said it.

603
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Odds of ten to one.

604
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,060
That's right.

605
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,190
If I win,

606
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,420
it'll be worth 30 taels of gold.

607
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,430
If I lose,

608
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,070
I'll pay you 300 taels.

609
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,380
You're bragging.

610
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,980
Kid,

611
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,680
don't regret it.

612
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,050
I'll keep my word.

613
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,780
OK. How do we play?

614
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,680
Make it simple.

615
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,040
Look who has the smaller number of dots.

616
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,300
Here.

617
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,140
Small. Small.

618
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,610
Small.

619
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,020
Give me the money.

620
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Amazing.

621
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,700
She wins for sure.

622
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,740
What is that?

623
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,980
What is that?

624
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,060
How could it be?

625
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,610
I can't believe it!

626
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,720
Xiao Jin.

627
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,680
What a coincidence

628
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,380
to meet you here.

629
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,100
I came out to buy something. What about you?

630
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,160
You talk so much every day.

631
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,460
No wonder Miss Wei

632
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,310
despises you so much.

633
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,660
Sir.

634
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,300
Don't go. What's the hurry?

635
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,100
Even our boss

636
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,420
can't handle you.

637
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,940
That's right, sir.

638
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,460
Don't. Don't.

639
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,420
Don't go. Don't go.

640
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,620
Don't go. Teach us.

641
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,260
Please teach us.

642
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,700
Stop. Stop.

643
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,490
Don't go.

644
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,040
Sir, please come in.

645
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,310
Sir, please.

646
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,780
Come in and have a drink.

647
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,220
How long has it been since you came?

648
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,700
Come in.

649
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,770
What a coincidence, Master.

650
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,530
What a coincidence.

651
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,980
Why are you here?

652
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,450
The academy has the rule that

653
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,260
you can't go out for no reason.

654
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,430
I came out to buy stationery.

655
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,390
And Senior agreed to it.

656
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,940
I also came out

657
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,120
to buy stationery.

658
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,600
But I couldn't find the way.

659
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,630
I was lost.

660
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,630
Shall I take you there?

661
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,770
Okay.

662
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,640
Sir, please come in.

663
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,650
[Wind]

664
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,860
Nice handwriting.

665
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,860
Why do I see

666
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,700
such a scene again?

667
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,660
Master!

668
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,160
Master!

669
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,040
Wei Zhi,

670
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,100
where are you from?

671
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,470
Yu Du.

672
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,740
Don't lie.

673
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,410
I was born in Gucheng.

674
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,020
But later,

675
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,250
something happened at home,

676
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,140
so I came to Yu Du.

677
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,490
I was very young back then.

678
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,030
What family members do you have?

679
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,500
My mother and brother.

680
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,540
Then,

681
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,100
are you married?

682
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,630
No.

683
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,300
My mother did arrange a marriage

684
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,460
for me,

685
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,480
but I'm not willing.

686
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,440
Why do you ask that?

687
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,050
Nothing.

688
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,730
Excuse me.

689
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,030
Help me pack these.

690
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,280
Okay.

691
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,290
In that case,

692
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
among the 18 people,

693
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,820
Wei Lingyue from the Minister of Rites' Mansion

694
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,710
has the best aptitudes.

695
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,610
The second best if the Young Master of Gucheng,

696
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:34,770
Ming Lang.

697
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,179
The cultivation of the skills of Deity Arts

698
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,150
has just begun.

699
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,730
The aptitudes of all students

700
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,850
were just revealed a little.

701
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,790
[Honored Consort of Dayu Kingdom]

702
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,060
There should be some changes later.

703
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,250
It's still unknown

704
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,780
if someone can catch up.

705
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,920
I'm also training hard.

706
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,860
I see.

707
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,210
You may leave.

708
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,510
Keep observing.

709
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,020
Report to me at any time.

710
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,370
Yes.

711
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,430
Your Majesty, you've been in seclusion.

712
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,110
You finally left the palace.

713
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,500
But after I came,

714
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,260
all you think about

715
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,530
is the Phoenix.

716
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,070
I'm doing this for the future.

717
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,430
That Minister Wei

718
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,830
is not on your side.

719
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,140
Now his daughter

720
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,410
is one of the best.

721
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,760
What should we do?

722
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,950
I've sounded out the intention of that old man.

723
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,830
It's a pity that he didn't appreciate my kindness.

724
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,710
In that case,

725
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,430
I'll help Ming Lang.

726
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,220
Ming Lang?

727
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,930
The one from Ming Chengwu's family in Gucheng?

728
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,320
In the past two years,

729
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,440
Ming Chengwu has always had his own plans

730
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,890
and refused to

731
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,400
be loyal to me.

732
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,360
Usually,

733
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,060
I don't even want to bother about it.

734
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,750
Now,

735
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,580
I need to remind him.

736
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,410
Stop it.

737
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,410
What about Xiao Jin?

738
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,000
Him?

739
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,100
His father was promoted by me

740
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,410
from the sixth rank.

741
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,200
He is loyal.

742
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,200
Unfortunately, he has a poor aptitude.

743
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,510
With so many eyes watching closely,

744
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,350
I can't choose someone too unqualified.

745
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,380
By then,

746
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,270
you will decide the candidate for the Phoenix.

747
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,010
Will that Immortal Envoy Master

748
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,500
listen to you?

749
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,400
Cultivators

750
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,430
pursue only the fame.

751
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,780
By then,

752
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,970
I'll confer some Avatar upon him

753
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,760
and hand Egret Academy over to him.

754
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,340
How could he not be happy?

755
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,860
Jing Xiu, that foul old man.

756
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,180
I dislike him for a long time.

757
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,110
You make much ado only for the bubble reputation

758
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,740
of the Phoenix.

759
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,520
Is it really worth it?

760
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,830
Bubble reputation?

761
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,860
Do you know how important

762
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,820
this bubble reputation is?

763
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,440
The Phoenix is the Spirit Animal of the Universe.

764
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,090
It is nobler and purer than the emperor.

765
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,130
And it's more qualified to give orders.

766
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,320
Having it means

767
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,690
truly having everything.

768
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,880
Then tell me,

769
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,120
in this world,

770
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,510
does the Phoenix really exist?

771
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,140
If it does,

772
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,360
it must be you.

773
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,610
Stop it.

774
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,020
Sir, Lady, please have mercy.

775
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,430
Please give me some food.

776
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,510
I haven't eaten anything

777
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,890
for days.

778
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,780
Don't worry.

779
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,460
This is

780
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,270
is the master of Egret Academy.

781
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,260
He's highly skilled and has a kind heart.

782
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,150
He will definitely help you.

783
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,920
I don't have any money left.

784
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,400
I spent it all.

785
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,980
My lady, you're so kind.

786
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,140
Please have some mercy on me.

787
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,010
Get up.

788
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,720
I'm not a lady.

789
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,230
Take it.

790
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,900
I'm not rich.

791
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,650
Thank you, my lady.

792
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,240
Give me back my purse.

793
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,030
Stop!

794
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,630
Mother!

795
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,990
Mother, look at me.

796
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,750
Mother, wake up.

797
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,060
Look, I have money now.

798
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,060
I can buy medicine for you.

799
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,190
Mother, wake up.

800
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,490
Wake up, Mother.

801
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,550
Mother!

802
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:47,770
Wei Zhi.

803
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,000
We should go.

804
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,350
If we don't go back now,

805
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,880
we'll break the rules of the academy.

806
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,700
Are the rules more important than people's lives?

807
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,600
You can't save her.

808
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,460
I can't,

809
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,490
but you can.

810
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,260
Aren't you an omnipotent

811
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,900
immortal envoy?

812
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,140
Please save them.

813
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,920
She's dead.

814
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,850
Joy, sorrow, separation, reuion. Birth, aging, sickness and death.

815
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,340
This is how the mortal world is.

816
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,120
Master, you must be from a noble family

817
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,700
and have never been through the hardships of the mortal world.

818
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,460
That's why you can utter

819
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,880
such refreshing and refined views.

820
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,030
Keep composure when everything has changed.

821
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,660
Stay calm even if the sky falls down.

822
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,460
It's what a cultivator should be like.

823
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,740
That's called insensitive.

824
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,670
That's as good as dead.

825
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,990
I don't know how could a heartless person

826
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,780
be qualified

827
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,560
to cultivate?

828
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,660
Wei Zhi.

829
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,420
The high-priced brushes and ink in your hand

830
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,400
are enough to feed them for a year.

831
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,660
Do you know the money you spend

832
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,050
in Happiness Pavillion

833
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,060
can buy her life?

834
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,570
People like you

835
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,350
won't understand.

836
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,360
Because poor people become humble.

837
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,180
When they are bullied,

838
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,730
they can only endure it

839
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,660
and blame it on their own tragic lot.

840
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,110
How can they talk about self-discipline

841
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,970
and self-esteem?

842
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,380
I found those wet nurses were right.

843
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,020
Little ants like us

844
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,900
are not qualified

845
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,490
to enter the academy.

846
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,250
Only someone like you,

847
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,530
like the Wei sisters

848
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
and those young masters,

849
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,100
are qualified to stay there.

850
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,620
You are indeed a nobody like an ant.

851
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,760
But remember,

852
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,050
ants can still shake a tree.
