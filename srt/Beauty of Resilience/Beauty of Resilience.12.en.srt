4
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,750
Master,

5
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,260
do you really have a cultivation of two million years?

6
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,450
No.

7
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,770
I traded something for it.

8
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,970
What is that valuable?

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,310
Just some trinkets.

10
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,300
By the way,

11
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,600
after taking the elixir,

12
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,440
you should have a good rest.

13
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,230
I should go now.

14
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,100
What did Master

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,790
trade?

16
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,910
He...

17
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,570
Lan Su.

18
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,550
Why are you here?

19
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm here

20
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,530
to help you.

21
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,870
Help me?

22
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,800
Thank you, Lan Su.

23
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,130
Master and I

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,260
won't stay here for long.

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,860
Ou Ya is a good fellow.

26
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,720
You can rely on him.

27
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,180
You've misunderstood.

28
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,520
Let me ask you,

29
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,620
do you like your Master?

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,370
So the answer is yes.

31
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,600
I got you.

32
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,370
No need to explain.

33
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,810
If you like him, go chase him.

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,860
Master won't like me back.

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,000
If I force him to like me,

36
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,340
he'll be annoyed with me.

37
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,750
You've got to be more confident.

38
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,070
You know he likes you.

39
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,350
If a man is very nice to a woman,

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,990
it means he likes the woman,

41
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,490
or he has an ulterior motive.

42
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,140
You got him

43
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,430
into so much trouble.

44
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,670
He is a High Immortal from Heaven Realm.

45
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,230
But he would fight with

46
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,720
a group of small devils for you.

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,380
He even traded the treasure from Heaven Realm

48
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,390
for the auction item.

49
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,490
Why?

50
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,220
The answer is simple.

51
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,540
Because he loves you.

52
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,390
No, he said

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,670
that's his duty.

54
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,410
Nonsense.

55
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,260
He was lying to you.

56
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,300
Can't you see his love in his eyes?

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,750
You're so numb.

58
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,130
Can't you feel it at all?

59
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,770
I can feel a little.

60
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,990
But I don't think

61
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,210
it's possible.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,579
I bet

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,329
he likes you.

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,300
I think

65
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,140
he is just

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,530
a little shy.

67
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,730
So

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,510
you should take the initiative.

69
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,640
Otherwise,

70
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,920
you two will be waiting too long

71
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,880
and still don't know

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,810
each other's feelings.

73
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,580
Take the initiative?

74
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,000
First,

75
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,550
seduce him with your nice scent.

76
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,680
Master.

77
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,080
Second.

78
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,350
Take the initiative.

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,000
I really have to do that?

80
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,900
You need to find the opportunity

81
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,460
to stay with him alone.

82
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,060
Got it?

83
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,020
After that,

84
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,810
you need to

85
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,020
find ways

86
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,080
to have body contact with him.

87
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,340
For example,

88
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,240
you can use this

89
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,050
to towel his face.

90
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,420
And

91
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,400
towel his neck

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,980
and his hands.

93
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,030
Most importantly,

94
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,980
you must

95
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,490
look at him affectionately.

96
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,580
Even a perfect gentleman

97
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,570
won't able to resist this.

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
You have sweat on your neck.

99
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,070
No way. It's cool today.

100
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,060
No, it's hot.

101
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,660
If I say I didn't do this on purpose,

102
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,180
will you believe me?

103
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,260
Yes.

104
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,410
Last,

105
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,260
you need to

106
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,600
slowly lean towards him.

107
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,300
No, I can't.

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,210
I can't do this.

109
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,280
Trust me.

110
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,300
If he doesn't take the initiative,

111
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,340
you have to.

112
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,590
That is how

113
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,860
you can get him.

114
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,900
Only when you

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,060
are ready to do this

116
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,980
can you two be together.

117
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,710
Understand?

118
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,020
Should we get up first?

119
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,920
I suddenly remember

120
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,920
I have something urgent to do.

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,900
So

122
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,930
I have to go now.

123
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,140
Oh no.

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,290
What's wrong, High Immortal?

125
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,340
Can't hold it anymore?

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,790
Wei Zhi is still in the room.

127
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,430
High Immortal.

128
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,490
Wei Zhi likes you.

129
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,640
You know it, right?

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,450
I know it or not.

131
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,670
What's the difference?

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,990
Make your response.

133
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,460
I am telling you

134
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,400
she likes you.

135
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,750
Go respond to her.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,460
Why?

137
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,230
Because she likes you

138
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,480
and you like her too.

139
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,280
Who told you that?

140
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,210
I can tell myself.

141
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,270
So

142
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,920
can you tell

143
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,860
whether Ou Ya likes you?

144
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,630
Of course he likes me.

145
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,040
If you're sure Ou Ya likes you,

146
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,360
why did you come to me?

147
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,260
I am trying to help Wei Zhi.

148
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,340
Are you helping Wei Zhi

149
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,770
or yourself?

150
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,539
It's not about

151
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,250
Wei Zhi and me.

152
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,000
If Ou Ya doesn't take your feelings seriously,

153
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,410
he may still love some other girl.

154
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,130
So you and Ou Ya

155
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,500
need to figure things out yourselves.

156
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,680
It has nothing to do with others.

157
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,420
My love for him

158
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,450
is as strong as always.

159
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,230
But he

160
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,240
never takes it seriously.

161
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,220
His attitude is ambiguous.

162
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,210
High Immortal,

163
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,030
what should I do?

164
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,510
With sincerity

165
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,100
one can surmount any difficulties.

166
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,300
This is not like cultivation.

167
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,360
This is about love.

168
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,690
Love?

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,940
I don't understand love.

170
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,620
Maybe you are right.

171
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,070
I shouldn't have expected you

172
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,750
and Wei Zhi to help solve my problem.

173
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,360
As the Divine Lord,

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,920
I don't need romantic love.

175
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,500
Did Master get angry?

176
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,750
It's fine.

177
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,370
I can never expect that...

178
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,200
No, no, no. Trust me.

179
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,890
I am a bystander.

180
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,290
A bystander is always clear-minded.

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,140
I know you two love each other.

182
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,690
Let me tell you,

183
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,560
what your Master

184
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,680
traded with Master Skunk

185
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,180
is the medicinal jade.

186
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,740
Medicinal jade?

187
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,330
Yes.

188
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,050
The jade is very rare.

189
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,740
It's very precious in the Three Realms.

190
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,300
It can help restore one's power.

191
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,000
For you,

192
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,830
he risked his life

193
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,590
and gave it up.

194
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,650
Master.

195
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,150

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,180
on the anniversary of your mother and Si'er's death,

390
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,870
I want to go back to the ancestral temple

391
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,980
and do some memorial services for them.

392
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,470
Help me prepare for it.

393
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,150
Okay.

394
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,060
Time flies.

395
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,980
So many years has passed

396
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,810
since your mother died in childbirth.

397
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,790
So

398
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,840
in Father's memory,

399
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,950
Mother and I died at the same time.

400
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,950
The person who loves your sister the most

401
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,200
will lose all his memory

402
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,000
of her.

403
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,570
Can she accept this?

404
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,040
No need to ask her.

405
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,910
She has no other choice.

406
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,510
Father.

407
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,250
I'm Jingyue.

408
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,130
Jingyue.

409
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,010
You've got what you want.

410
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,460
Isn't it enough?

411
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,530
But what he took away

412
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,110
is my father's memory of me.

413
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,350
He doesn't remember me anymore.

414
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,480
This is too cruel.

415
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,380
So you'd rather

416
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,410
have that ugly face

417
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,710
for the rest of your life?

418
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,980
I don't know.

419
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,450
I don't know.

420
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,900
Wei Zhi.

421
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,760
It's all Wei Zhi's fault.

422
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,990
She made me suffer like this.

423
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,860
I hate her.

424
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,430
Jingyue.

425
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,440
Your hatred is meaningless.

426
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,610
Now,

427
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,090
she's become the Phoenix.

428
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,170
Your hatred can't hurt her

429
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,160
at all.

430
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,650
You have to

431
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,530
make Wei Zhi

432
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,780
suffer more

433
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,440
than you.

434
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,670
You're right.

435
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,120
I want to revenge!

436
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,010
Sister.

437
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,780
I want to revenge!

438
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,500
Go back and tell your sister

439
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,360
that I'll take

440
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,500
her offer.

441
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,540
Please have a seat.

442
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,530
Where's Ou Ya?

443
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,460
I thought he'll come

444
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,100
with you.

445
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,250
He said

446
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,570
he'll come with Lan Su.

447
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,580
OK. Let's begin first.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,670
I'm Yi Li,

449
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,910
Lan Su's elder Brother.

450
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,080
I'm the fourth child of the noble Fox Clan.

451
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,540
At the auction that day,

452
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,640
I was being rude.

453
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,710
Today,

454
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,810
I'd like to apologize to you.

455
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,220
Please forgive me.

456
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,540
As Lan Su's elder brother,

457
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,870
I couldn't stand

458
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,680
seeing her being bullied.

459
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:56,910
After drinking this,

460
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,860
we let bygones be bygones.

461
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,630
I'll drink first.

462
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,290
Good.

463
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
You two are really straightforward.

464
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,500
Let's drink again.

465
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:20,900
Come on.

466
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,010
I've always wanted

467
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,780
to ask you a question.

468
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,210
About your identity.

469
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,530
Don't be nervous.

470
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,990
Just a small question.

471
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,530
You two are not from the Devil Clan.

472
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,570
So what brings

473
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,260
you here?

474
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,020
To avoid something?

475
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,160
Yi Li.

476
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,880
You think too much.

477
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,510
You are Ou Ya's friends.

478
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,580
His friends are my friends.

479
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,250
Tell me if you need any help.

480
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,060
I can help you a lot

481
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,170
in the Devil Realm.

482
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,060
Thank you.

483
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,940
Let's drink again.

484
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,020
I've found

485
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,850
the guys you want.

486
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,670
Thanks.

487
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,330
Ou Ya, run!

488
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,780
Brother, tell her to stop!

489
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,260
She'll kill me.

490
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:17,820
Stop!

491
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,590
Go after Ou Ya.

492
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,540
The people you're looking for

493
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,670
are probably hidden by him.

494
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,510
We don't know who those two people are.

495
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,260
I warned you

496
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,180
not to get involved in it.

497
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,980
The demons want them.

498
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,590
You can do nothing about it.

499
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,420
Even the Devil King

500
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,160
cannot stop them.

501
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,500
Is Ou Ya

502
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,120
still okay?

503
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,890
The demons want us.

504
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,730
We now left.

505
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,930
They will be fine.

506
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,570
Chen Yan.

507
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,200
I remember you now.

508
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,020
How dare you

509
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,090
stand beside my sister!

510
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,730
Let her go with me

511
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,410
and you make atonement for your sins.

512
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

513
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,950
But the Phoenix

514
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,410
is not something you can covet.

515
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,270
Give it up.

516
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,080
Chen Yan.

517
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,410
After so many years,

518
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,220
you are still so shameless.

519
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,320
You think I'll give up?

520
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,860
Wei Zhi.

521
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,640
Let's go.

522
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,220
The demons are coming!

523
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:51,970
Master!

524
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,050
Master!

525
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,900
Master!

526
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,430
I'm sorry I've let you down, Your Majesty.

527
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,480
Not only did I fail to find the true Phoenix,

528
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,260
but I didn't tell

529
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,460
whether the Phoenix is good or evil.

530
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,130
This almost caused a huge disaster.

531
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,800
But

532
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,400
fortunately, God bless Dayu Kingdom.

533
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,070
The Peahen has come to the world

534
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,270
to repel evil beings and balance Yin and Yang.

535
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,740
It is the only Spirit Animal

536
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,290
that can match the Phoenix and bless us all.

537
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,870
Wei Lingyue, the third daughter of Minister Wei

538
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,550
is the real Peahen.

539
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,020
The Peahen and the Phoenix are connected.

540
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,100
It's easy to confuse them.

541
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,100
I'm sorry I made the mistake.

542
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,030
Please give me the punishment I deserve, Your Majesty.

543
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,340
Your Majesty.

544
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,220
How can we be sure

545
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,430
whether she is the Peahen or not?

546
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,040
Your Majesty.

547
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,830
Sorry for my rudeness.

548
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:01,840
You...

549
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,180
Where am I?

550
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,950
Your Majesty,

551
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,470
you're in Egret Academy.

552
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,890
Egret Academy?

553
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,900
Yes.

554
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,300
My son,

555
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,390
you died miserably.

556
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,770
It's all because of that Phoenix.

557
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,240
Its presence isn't an auspicious sign.

558
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,320
The Phoenix

559
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,510
is like a demon.

560
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,930
A demon!

561
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
My dear son.

562
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,860
That day, the Phoenix went crazy

563
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,750
and colluded with the demons

564
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,870
to kill Xiao Jin.

565
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,680
We are really scared.

566
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,330
Dean, we want to leave the academy.

567
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,700
Son.

568
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,710
Let's go back.

569
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,900
Okay.

570
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,160
Your Majesty.

571
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,220
It's hard to tell whether the presence

572
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,020
of the Phoenix is a good sign.

573
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,650
I'm willing to be loyal to Your Majesty

574
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,270
and help you eliminate devils and demons.

575
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:34,810
Good.

576
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,890
You are powerful.

577
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,700
It's good that you are willing to work for me.

578
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,620
Good.

579
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,670
Imperial Advisor.

580
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

581
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,610
Since there was an abnormal sign in the Immortal-Revealing Mirror,

582
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,990
everyone in Dayu has been talking about it.

583
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,320
As we were looking forward to an auspicious sign,

584
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,300
we didn't expect that the Phoenix is a demon

585
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,970
and colluded with other demons.

586
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,330
This thing

587
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,940
must be kept as a secret.

588
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,370
Don't let anyone know.

589
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

590
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,510
Take my order.

591
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,500
Wei Lingyue is now

592
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,560
the Peahen Saintess of Dayu.

593
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,620
Only the Peahen

594
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,900
can protect our country

595
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,140
and our people.

596
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,020
Long live Your Majesty!

597
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,700
Take a look.

598
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,020
I heard

599
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,700
the Peahen is the queen of all birds.

600
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,430
Yes.

601
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,470
We normal people

602
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,020
can only rely on

603
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,250
the protection of Lady Lingyue.

604
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,000
She is coming.

605
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,380
Look! Look!

606
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,060
It's so grand.

607
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,460
It must be Lady Lingyue.

608
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,880
[A few days later]

609
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,650
Hey, Girl.

610
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:35,640
Here.

611
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,570
Take these.

612
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,290
You can

613
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,510
cook them for the Numb Guy.

614
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,910
Thank you, Lady Hua.

615
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,620
He is awake.

616
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,830
How are you?

617
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,580
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

618
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,720
No.

619
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,260
Did I sleep for a long time?

620
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,270
The Numb Guy

621
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,980
looks more handsome

622
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,330
than before.

623
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,640
Where is this?

624
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,920
This is the Between Land.

625
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,260
It's the boundary

626
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,430
between the Human Realm and Devil realm.

627
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,860
There are humans and devils here.

628
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,660
So,

629
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,210
we call it Taoyuan Village.

630
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,880
Many years ago,

631
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,860
humans and devils were enemies.

632
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,280
The fought with each other for years.

633
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,460
The army of humans

634
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,150
was defeated.

635
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,180
Those survivors

636
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,020
of the human army

637
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,540
got help from some kind devils

638
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,610
and stayed there to recover.

639
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,360
Gradually, some humans fell in love

640
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,150
with the devils and chose not to go back.

641
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,990
Later,

642
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,860
their descendants

643
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,260
were afraid of being discriminated

644
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,940
and revenged,

645
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,740
so they moved

646
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,900
to the Between Land

647
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,560
which is like a deserted place.

648
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,980
Enough old stories.

649
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,820
As the old saying goes,

650
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,540
every morning

651
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,580
is a new start

652
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,110
as the sun rises.

653
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,680
Thank you.

654
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,460
OK.

655
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,660
I won't disturb you two.

656
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,360
I should leave now.

657
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,250
Girl.

658
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
You should cook some nice food

659
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,880
for the Numb Guy.

660
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,730
The Numb Guy?

661
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,730
Well,

662
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,120
I didn't mean to

663
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
ruin your reputation.

664
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,760
That day,

665
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
you fainted.

666
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,420
Then

667
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,860
some kind villagers passed by

668
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,020
and took us in.

669
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,020
To hide our identities,

670
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,510
I said

671
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,390
we are a couple.

672
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,640
Master, don't be angry.

673
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,690
Call me the Numb Guy.

674
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,310
The Numb Guy.

675
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,650
[Devil King's Hall]

676
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,030
Okay.

677
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,590
My King.

678
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,220
[Wuyan, Devil King's adviser, a dog devil]

679
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,150
Bad news!

680
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,330
[Devil King]

681
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,830
Wuyan.

682
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,960
You're the chief adviser in Devil Realm.

683
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,500
Look how panic you are.

684
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,400
How inappropriate!

685
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,270
How inappropriate!

686
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,060
Why am I so unlucky?

687
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,710
Though the Phoenix is in the Tianyao City,

688
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,580
I've never seen it.

689
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,140
How can I find it?

690
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,170
My goodness.

691
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,660
Be more quiet.

692
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,070
The demons

693
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,360
are already giving us a headache.

694
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,210
If you let Heavenly Emperor know this,

695
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,930
we will all be doomed.

696
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,170
Are you blaming me?

697
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,990
Don't you have

698
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,880
a good nose?

699
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,460
Why did it fail you this time?

700
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,490
You are the Wolf King.

701
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,660
You didn't find it either.

702
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,100
You...

703
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,060
Find out

704
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,600
who brought the Phoenix

705
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,670
into the Tianyao City.

706
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,380
I can't believe it.

707
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:04,850
I think

708
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,600
we should

709
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,580
clear off these things

710
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,750
first.

711
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,350
The is a calamity.

712
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,370
This is a calamity.

713
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,190
Looks like

714
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,130
I need to see the Demon Lord.

715
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,130
Get ready.

716
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,990
Today, I will lead the Demon Army

717
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,350
and attack Devil Realm

718
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,890
so as to find the Phoenix.

719
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,680
My Lord,

720
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,020
invading Devil Realm

721
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,530
means breaking the balance of the Three Realms.

722
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,990
Please reconsider it.

723
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,850
Take my order.

724
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,670
We will go immediately.

725
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,790
Lord,

726
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,050
the Devil King wants to see you.

727
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,720
Let him in.

728
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,380
Yes.

729
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,700
Go away.

730
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,510
Lord.

731
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,220
Long time no see.

732
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,470
You've become more handsome.

733
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,340
All the females in the Three Realms

734
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,800
will be attracted to you.

735
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,050
Unlike me

736
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,940
who's getting older and older.

737
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,120
What's the matter?

738
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,910
Why are you so serious?

739
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,010
I heard

740
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,650
that you came to Devil Realm

741
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,370
a few days ago.

742
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,740
Well, though we

743
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,230
haven't visited each other for centuries.

744
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,040
We're still friends.

745
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,870
If you had told me you were coming,

746
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,910
I would have treated you warmly.

747
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,130
I didn't mean to be your guest.

748
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,100
I was looking for someone.

749
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,240
Please tell me more about this.

750
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,340
That's my place.

751
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,360
I'll find the person for you.

752
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,110
Who is it?

753
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,140
Tell me.

754
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,610
The Phoenix.

755
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,220
Who?

756
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,240
The Phoenix?

757
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,930
You must be kidding.

758
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:25,900
How could the Phoenix

759
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,400
be in Devil Realm?

760
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,030
Besides,

761
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,760
if she comes,

762
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,410
how could I not know?

763
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,300
Lord.

764
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,230
Lord.

765
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,300
You old fox.

766
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,000
My Lord,

767
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,290
I know.

768
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,900
I know

769
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,460
the importance of the Phoenix

770
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,540
to the Heaven and Demon Realms.

771
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,130
I don't want to get involved in it.

772
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,300
But Lord,

773
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,230
we devils

774
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,110
and demons

775
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,900
are never enemies.

776
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,550
Why don't we just mind our own business?

777
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,220
Well...

778
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,420
How about this, Lord?

779
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,570
You

780
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:10,720
give me some time.

781
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:11,890
Ten days.

782
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,530
Within ten days,

783
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,810
I'll bring you the Phoenix.

784
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,450
Well, if you don't agree,

785
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,260
I...

786
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,610
I can only

787
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,060
go see Heavenly Emperor

788
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,770
and ask for his forgiveness.

789
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,210
After all, the Phoenix concerns the Three Realms.

790
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,070
One more day.

791
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,510
One more day.

792
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,420
Why are you so cruel?

793
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,610
Just one more day.

794
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,760
Fine.

795
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,620
Five days.

796
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:54,860
Bye.

797
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,570
By the way, Lord,

798
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,820
I have to correct you.

799
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,430
You said I'm an old fox.

800
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,390
It's wrong.

801
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,090
I'm and old wolf.

802
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,610
It's all because

803
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,210
we haven't talked much.

804
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,170
From now on,

805
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,350
let's see each other often.

806
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,350
He is killing me.
