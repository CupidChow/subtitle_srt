[Episode 19]

4
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,720
It's Jinghe's provisions.

5
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,460
Let's go and take actions.

6
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,660
What actions?

7
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,750
Listen to the Commander.

8
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,820
Follow them.

9
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,490
Let's see where they will camp tonight.

10
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,700
If we are to attack them,

11
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,090
we have to wait until it's dark.

12
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,170
I don't think so.

13
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,250
Commander,

14
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,579
there are only a few of us.

15
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,980
Besides, your safety is very important.

16
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,980
It’s too dangerous.

17
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,400
How about Chen Yan and I follow them?

18
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,100
After Commander gets permission from the Marshal,

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,380
you bring reinforcements to help us.

20
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,820
It will be too late

21
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,140
if we go get his permission first.

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,540
We don't have enough people

23
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,820
to take all these provisions.

24
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,100
Unless...

25
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,820
Unless what?

26
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,860
Unless we don't take these provisions.

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,700
We'll just destroy them.

28
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,140
We're able to do it.

29
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,660
This is a good opportunity

30
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,140
to win a military honor.

31
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,540
Commander.

32
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,579
I'll do it.

33
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,100
Let's do it.

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,980
Look.

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,820
I didn't expect

36
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,100
Jinghe's provisions are stored here.

37
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,540
This place is not well guarded.

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,340
There aren't many provisions

39
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,660
and they're not watched by many soldiers.

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,380
This place

41
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,660
is far away from our defense area.

42
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,420
I guess they didn't expect

43
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,540
we would find this place.

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,860
What should we do?

45
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,660
Two people are enough.

46
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,820
We go there secretly

47
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,980
and burn all their provisions.

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,410
Let's go.

49
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,980
We'll go.

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,540
You two stay here.

51
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,380
Some people are born lucky.

52
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
No wonder you're often rewarded.

53
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,600
[Grain Transport Officer]

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,600
[Jinghe]

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
If you don't want to die,

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,100
put down your weapons.

57
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,940
Capture them alive.

58
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,580
You want to die?

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,580
Stay here.

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,579
I'll go back and bring reinforcements.

61
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,339
Be alert.

62
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,140
Hurry up.

63
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,460
I thought my task this time

64
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,780
is a boring one.

65
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,220
I didn't expect

66
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,100
I could catch

67
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,580
you two rascals.

68
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,820
How did you

69
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,900
find us?

70
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,540
Well.

71
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,020
What I want to know

72
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,140
is not just that.

73
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,460
I will

74
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,780
try to get

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,580
all the Information

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,780
you have

77
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,220
about

78
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,540
Weicang's army.

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,700
You rascal.

80
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,660
You have no right to talk to me like this.

81
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,580
I'm the Commander.

82
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,900
What?

83
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,140
I am Sima Jin’s eldest son,

84
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,580
Sima Zhaoyang.

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,700
He is my close guard.

86
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,380
If you

87
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,380
lay a finger on me,

88
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,540
my father

89
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,460
will slaughter you all

90
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
and avenge us.

91
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,980
By then,

92
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,970
you'll all be dead.

93
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,380
Kid.

94
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,220
Why should I believe what you said?

95
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,820
The jade seal of the Sima family

96
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,340
is in my sachet.

97
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,020
If you let us

98
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,140
go back safely,

99
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,220
my father

100
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,140
will give you a big reward whose worth

101
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,780
is 100 times higher than your salary.

102
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,100
The jade seal is inside.

103
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,020
Get down!

104
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
You...

105
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,780
What is it?

106
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,980
Knockout drops.

107
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,460
What are you doing?

108
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,580
In my hair.

109
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,260
Look.

110
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,100
You...

111
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,340
What's in your hair?

112
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,700
Something that can save our lives.

113
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,660
A tiny dagger.

114
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,340
Take it out.

115
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,900
How can I take it out with my hands tied?

116
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,580
Use your teeth. Hurry.

117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,450
If...

118
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,140
No Adam's apple?

119
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,700
She is a woman.

120
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,700
Hurry up.

121
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,530
Let's go.

122
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,260
Don't you remember

123
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,020
why we came here?

124
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,980
Okay.

125
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,780
Staff Mu.

126
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,140
Be alert.

127
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,340
Are they Commander and Chen Yan.

128
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,780
Commander.

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,820
Sorry we are late.

130
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,580
Are you okay?

131
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,460
Yes.

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,530
How did you get out of danger?

133
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Chen Yan saved me.

134
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,340
This is the second time he has done that.

135
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,700
You did a good job.

136
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,900
I should thank the Commander.

137
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,340
We not only managed to escape

138
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,140
but also burned Jinghe's provisions.

139
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,780
We shouldn't stay here for long.

140
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,700
Let's go back to the camp.

141
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,580
OK.

142
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,970
Retreat.

143
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,380
Hurry up!

144
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,020
Hurry up.

145
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,340
Water.

146
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,780
Here.

147
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,340
Here, water.

148
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,260
Hurry!

149
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,300
Hurry up.

150
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,580
Here's the water.

151
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,620
Not enough. More water.

152
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,400
[Yin Keji]

153
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,400
[In the previous life, he was a General of Jinghe]

154
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,500
Here. Not enough.

155
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,820
More.

156
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Not enough. More water.

157
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,929
OK.

158
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,460
Lord Yin,

159
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,980
I’ve checked.

160
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,940
No casualties.

161
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,100
Only four batches of fake provisions were burned.

162
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,220
More men!

163
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,100
Clean up the mess

164
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:42,940
and we'll go.

165
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,620
Yes.

166
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,980
There.

167
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,460
[Wei]

168
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
Commander Sima,

169
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,460
have you realized your mistake?

170
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,620
Yes.

171
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,580
You didn't inform me of your operation

172
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,620
and almost became their captive.

173
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,100
How rash you are!

174
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,100
Don't you remember

175
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,500
I am the Marshal?

176
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Please calm down, Marshal.

177
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Although this operation

178
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,810
was dangerous,

179
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,330
they cut off Jinghe's provisions.

180
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,060
Besides,

181
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,180
there is no any casualties.

182
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,980
Marshal.

183
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,220
Please don't be angry.

184
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,460
You don't need to defend him.

185
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,460
I know

186
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,300
what happened.

187
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,820
Commander Sima,

188
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
you carry a heavy load

189
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,940
and run six miles.

190
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,460
If you make the same mistake again,

191
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,580
you will be punished more severely.

192
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,980
Yes.

193
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,340
Who is Chen Yan?

194
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,980
Me.

195
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,100
I rewarded you last time

196
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,820
for what you did for the refugees.

197
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,980
This time,

198
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
you helped Commander Sima

199
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,300
and saved his life.

200
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,820
You are a clever guy.

201
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,820
I hereby promote you

202
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,570
to Central Guard.

203
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,500
You'll work for General Cao.

204
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,450
He got promoted again.

205
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,300
Thank you, Marshal.

206
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
But...

207
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,100
I have to

208
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,170
decline this.

209
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,180
What?

210
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,500
Chen Yan.

211
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,500
Are you insane?

212
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,180
It is because of my wrong analysis

213
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,460
that the Commander got in danger.

214
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,220
Be frank.

215
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,340
I just want to follow the Commander.

216
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,220
There are many talents working for General Cao.

217
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,420
I'm afraid I'll never be able to stand out.

218
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,220
That's true.

219
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,500
Then

220
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,580
I'll promote you to Centurion.

221
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,420
You continue to work for Commander Sima.

222
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,860
But remember,

223
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,820
you

224
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,500
must stay loyal

225
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,180
to Commander Sima.

226
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Don't worry, Marshal.

227
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,370
[Sima]

228
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,940
If you make a mistake again,

229
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,580
I'll send you home.

230
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,590
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:27,450
[Wei]

232
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,940
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,980
You are too bold.

234
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,340
Normally, a general

235
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,940
can take actions if the matter is really urgent.

236
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
But the Outpost Battalion

237
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,570
is only three miles away from the Gu City.

238
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,100
You didn't even report it.

239
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,300
I've realized my mistake.

240
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,460
Really?

241
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,820
Let me ask you,

242
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,100
did you weigh up the pros and cons

243
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,700
before you decided to take the provisions?

244
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,460
That was not many provisions.

245
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
And they were not heavily guarded.

246
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,620
They were in such a deserted place.

247
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,620
I thought

248
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,980
it was an easy operation.

249
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,340
So I made the rash decision.

250
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,860
But have you ever thought

251
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,980
maybe it was a trap?

252
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,980
No.

253
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,700
We had nothing

254
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,980
useful for them.

255
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,580
If that was a trap,

256
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,460
what did they want?

257
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,100
Maybe their target is you.

258
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,580
You are an important person.

259
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,300
But that General from Jinghe

260
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,490
didn't know me at all.

261
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,620
This is also the reason

262
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,340
why Chen Yan could

263
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,500
get us out of danger.

264
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,340
Chen Yan is very smart.

265
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,620
With the his help

266
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,100
and loyalty to you,

267
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,340
as well as Mu Nan's help,

268
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,460
you'll be safe and I won't be that worried.

269
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,460
Chen Yan's origins

270
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,940
are still unclear.

271
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,420
But he's a good guy.

272
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:43,080
[Wei]

273
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,620
Wangyue.

274
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,180
This time,

275
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,740
it's a small mistake,

276
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,960
but I hope you've learnt your lesson.

277
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,580
Let me ask you,

278
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,460
do you think

279
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,980
those provisions will have a great impact

280
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,580
on the overall situation of the warfare?

281
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,060
Those provisions were too few to have a great impact.

282
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,940
So,

283
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,100
you know those provisions

284
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,980
didn't matter that much.

285
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,820
But you felt you would miss a great opportunity

286
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,490
if you just did nothing.

287
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,090
Remember,

288
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,500
war is like a chess game.

289
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,820
If you want every move of yours to be perfect,

290
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,340
you may not get the result you expect.

291
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,460
Sometimes, you have to give up some things

292
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,620
if you want to achieve the final success.

293
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,060
Go.

294
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,460
Yes.

295
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,100
Investigate Chen Yan for me.

296
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,100
Okay.

297
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
What are you looking at?

298
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,700
Staff Mu.

299
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,970
That's enough.

300
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,460
The Marshal didn't order others watch him.

301
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,220
It's okay if he doesn't ran six miles.

302
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,460
That is Marshal's order.

303
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,420
No one is allowed to disobey it.

304
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:26,860
OK.

305
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
I’ll talk to the Commander.

306
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,180
I'll ask him to stop.

307
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,100
The Commander said

308
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,340
before he finishes running,

309
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
no one is allowed to speak to him.

310
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,460
Okay.

311
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,740
Let him run.

312
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,340
What a stubborn girl

313
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,220
she is.

314
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,460
Chen Yan.

315
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
You know it?

316
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,100
What are you talking about?

317
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,510
[Wei]

318
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,460
Staff Mu.

319
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,220
You are too young.

320
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,190
[Wei]

321
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,410
In the future,

322
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,580
you'll meet many women.

323
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,700
You'll get it by then.

324
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,100
I'm a straightforward man.

325
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,460
I'll be frank.

326
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,620
You have many merits.

327
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,820
You have a good heart and sharp eyes.

328
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,500
But that you have sharp eyes

329
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,060
doesn't mean you're allowed to see anything.

330
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,940
You're smart.

331
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,180
But please only do good deeds.

332
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,210
OK.

333
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,700
I won't tell others.

334
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,900
[Wei]

335
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,670
You dare not.

336
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Not necessarily.

337
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,520
You...

338
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,100
I think

339
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,580
it's all Chen Yan's fault.

340
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,220
Now we have to do more training.

341
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,500
Listen,

342
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,050
mind your language.

343
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
He's the Centurion now.

344
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,940
Are you talking about me?

345
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,700
How is it?

346
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,820
Are the barracks for Centurions

347
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,220
uncomfortable?

348
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,620
Well,

349
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
I'm not used to

350
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,820
living alone.

351
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,500
The mat

352
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,580
is very soft.

353
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,820
The quilt

354
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,580
is very comfortable.

355
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,700
Look at him!

356
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,180
Go take a bath.

357
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,420
Take a bath?

358
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,980
Let's go.

359
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,100
Take a bath.

360
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,220
Let's go.

361
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,570
Go.

362
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,860
You two wait for me!

363
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,060
Commander,

364
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,300
you're also taking a bath here.

365
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll take a bath with Commander.

366
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,020
You two have a bath together.

367
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,660
Don't move.

368
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,260
I'll go.

369
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,220
Why do you get it every time?

370
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,349
You want to take everything.

371
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,960
Chen Yan.

372
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,810
Why didn't you take off your clothes?

373
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,260
None of your business.

374
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,839
Can't I wash my clothes and my body at the same time?

375
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,710
Mind your own business.

376
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,170
What's going on?

377
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,500
Nothing.

378
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,900
Can't you be quiet for a second?

379
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,700
I swear.

380
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,780
I turned my back on you.

381
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,900
I saw nothing.

382
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,940
What do you mean?

383
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,460
What?

384
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,860
Well...

385
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,290
You know it?

386
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,390
I...

387
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,900
Don't worry.

388
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,940
I'll distract their attention.

389
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,900
You put on your clothes quickly.

390
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,220
Guys,

391
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm coming.

392
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,350
Let's take a bath together.

393
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,700
Have a good bath.

394
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,220
What are you doing?

395
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
Have a good bath.

396
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,980
Let go of me!

397
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,700
Have a good bath.

398
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,220
Stop it, okay?

399
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
You're so annoying.

400
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,660
How

401
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,140
did he know who I am?

402
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,940
Did he see it

403
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,860
when I was having a bath?

404
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,020
He shouldn't.

405
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,700
I had been turning my back to him.

406
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,420
Forget it.

407
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,460
I'll ask him directly.

408
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,140
Here.

409
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,660
Thank you.

410
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,180
Commander.

411
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,380
Where is Chen Yan?

412
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,220
I don't know.

413
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,130
How did you find it?

414
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,290
How did you find it?

415
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,180
I saw it myself.

416
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,940
Look.

417
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,180
It was just an accident.

418
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,630
Believe me.

419
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,430
When?

420
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,180
The night when we planned to take their provisions

421
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,870
and were imprisoned in the same room...

422
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,900
I didn't see clearly.

423
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
And then?

424
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,620
Then...

425
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,530
Nothing.

426
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,460
I didn't expect that.

427
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,700
So it was an accident.

428
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,460
You've known what you shouldn't know

429
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,940
and now you make me know you've known that.

430
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,220
How should I punish you?

431
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,420
I...

432
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,410
Commander.

433
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,660
Think about it.

434
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,900
Nobody knows...

435
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,420
Nobody knows this thing

436
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,700
except you and I.

437
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,940
Others

438
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,420
can never know this.

439
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,380
Since you've saved me

440
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,180
several times,

441
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,260
I'll trust you this time.

442
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,300
If I hear

443
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,980
any rumors,

444
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,940
you'll be killed.

445
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,020
Thank you

446
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,600
for what you did yesterday.

447
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,940
[Wei]

448
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,380
You're welcome.

449
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,350
There's something I'm curious about.

450
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,020
You are a girl.

451
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Why are you staying here?

452
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,110
This is a battlefield.

453
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,590
Besides, your identity...

454
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,450
This doesn't make sense.

455
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,140
I don't know.

456
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,300
Maybe it's because of

457
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,020
my father.

458
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,420
When I was still a child,

459
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,620
I liked reading books about war.

460
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,860
Although I'm a woman,

461
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,020
I don't want to spend my entire life

462
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,500
making embroideries

463
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,650
or serving my husband or my child.

464
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,540
Besides,

465
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,940
as the daughter of the Marshal,

466
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,460
I have to take the responsibility

467
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,620
to protect my country.

468
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,300
What's wrong?

469
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
You think it's ridiculous?

470
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,500
No.

471
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,660
I understand.

472
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,860
Your identity

473
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
brings you restrictions

474
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,940
but gives you a sense of responsibility.

475
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,900
So serious.

476
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,140
This is not like you.

477
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,060
I know little about your thoughts.

478
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,900
If I had been born into a family like yours

479
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,780
and at the same time

480
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,500
had all the skills I have now,

481
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,540
I would be the most versatile man

482
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,660
in this world.

483
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,540
This is what Chen Yan would say.

484
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,980
Now that you know who I am,

485
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,420
can we still be good bros?

486
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,780
Of course.

487
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,980
Or you want us

488
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,220
to be sisters?

489
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,220
Enough.

490
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,220
My versatile bro.

491
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,140
Do me a favor.

492
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,500
What favor?

493
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,780
Commander.

494
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,700
What

495
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,380
are you doing?

496
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,980
Today is Mu Nan’s birthday.

497
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,220
So I want to give him a surprise.

498
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,940
I'll go find a cook.

499
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,460
If I let a cook do it,

500
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,740
it wouldn't be a surprise.

501
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,620
You mean

502
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,850
you're going to cook by yourself?

503
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,110
Of course.

504
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,140
The problem is,

505
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,730
I don't know how to cook.

506
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,380
So I want you to teach me.

507
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,740
I...

508
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,060
I don't know how to cook, either.

509
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,970
You said you are a versatile man.

510
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,220
Yes.

511
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,420
So you should know how to cook.

512
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,540
You bandits

513
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,140
don't cook for yourselves?

514
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,010
We...

515
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,780
Bandits are a group of rude men.

516
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,020
When we have a meal,

517
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,020
we just have some wine and meat.

518
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,220
Sometimes,

519
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,260
we make a quick dish.

520
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,940
A quick dish?

521
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,020
What is it?

522
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,700
Well.

523
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,500
You put this,

524
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,060
that,

525
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,180
and...

526
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,970
Throw all you have into the pot

527
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,700
and get them cooked.

528
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,660
I think it's good.

529
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,540
I don't know how to do it.

530
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,220
But I'm good at cutting vegetables.

531
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,140
Then do it.

532
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,540
Stop eating.

533
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,940
Hurry.

534
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,420
Commander.

535
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,980
It's done.

536
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,740
Okay, you can go now.

537
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,500
Thanks.

538
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,660
I get nothing?

539
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,140
It's not your birthday today.

540
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:18,980
Fine.

541
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,780
Well,

542
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,420
see you.

543
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,420
Tell Staff Mu,

544
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,220
I wish him a happy birthday.

545
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,500
Okay, I will.

546
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,780
Princess,

547
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,860
did you cook all these dishes?

548
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,020
Of course.

549
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,260
Let me try.

550
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
It's good?

551
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,970
Don't you think it's too salty?

552
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,260
No.

553
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,860
This is the best dish I've ever had

554
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,940
since I came to the army camp.

555
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,420
Today is your birthday.

556
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,500
Happy birthday.

557
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,300
You always remember it?

558
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,900
Yes.

559
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,420
Of course.

560
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,380
You've been in the Sima family

561
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,660
for ten years.

562
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,780
The first time you came to my family

563
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,180
you only knew your name.

564
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,700
You didn't know where your home was.

565
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,900
You didn't have any friends or relatives.

566
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,700
You didn't know when your birthday was.

567
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,620
So many things were unknown to us.

568
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,180
So at that time,

569
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,500
Father took the day when you came to our family

570
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,460
as your birthday.

571
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,980
If your family

572
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,740
hadn't taken me in,

573
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,060
I might

574
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,180
have died years ago.

575
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,660
The past ten years

576
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,500
during which I am always with you

577
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,020
is the happiest time for me.

578
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,290
It is very happy time for me, too.

579
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,500
I should thank you

580
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,860
for keeping me company.

581
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
You're like my little brother.

582
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
You are

583
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,700
much more closer to me

584
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
than my elder brother is.

585
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,300
I'm like your brother?

586
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,260
We are not master and servant.

587
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,300
You

588
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,540
are my younger brother.

589
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,530
You don't want to be my brother?

590
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Yes.

591
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,140
I do.

592
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,220
It's such a huge honor

593
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,300
for me.

594
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
Okay.

595
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,260
This is delicious.

596
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,940
Report!

597
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,220
Marshal,

598
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,780
I’ve checked

599
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,460
Chen Yan's background.

600
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,220
His parents died.

601
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,860
There is no one left in his hometown.

602
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,540
He had been a bandit before he joined the army.

603
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,220
It doesn't matter that he has humble origins.

604
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,180
People like him

605
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,460
work hard

606
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
and know what to cherish.

607
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,460
By the way,

608
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,700
please

609
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,380
bring this document

610
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,980
to the Commander's office.

611
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,260
Okay.

612
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,140
You've all received

613
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,180
Marshal's order.

614
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,780
Let's have a discussion.

615
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,140
Jinghe wants to negotiate peace now.

616
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,260
I think it's because we've taken

617
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,700
two cities of theirs in a row.

618
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,540
They must be scared.

619
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,740
However,

620
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,020
I don't know why Marshal

621
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,220
agreed to have this peace talk.

622
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,980
Why don't we take this opportunity

623
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,420
to take down a few more cities?

624
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,220
It's not that easy.

625
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,420
We've already taken

626
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,860
two cities of Jinghe.

627
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,940
Now our soldiers are tired.

628
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,260
The whole army need to make adjustments.

629
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,220
Besides,

630
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,260
this is a long war.

631
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,700
We cannot ensure a stable supply of provisions.

632
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
I think Jinghe

633
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,940
has noticed this

634
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,980
so they chose to talk peace with us.

635
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,620
It's their stalling tactics.

636
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,530
That's right.

637
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,420
Marshal decides to hold the talk

638
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,500
in the Outpost Battalion

639
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,300
because he wants to put pressure on them.

640
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,140
After all,

641
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,180
this place is now controlled by Gu City's Army.

642
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,610
The peace talk

643
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,780
will be held in seven days.

644
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,900
We need to ensure Marshal's safety

645
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,620
and show them our strength.

646
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,780
This job must be perfectly done.

647
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,660
Yes.

648
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,960
[Sima]

649
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,260
I think the Marshal's mansion

650
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,430
should be under heavier guard.

651
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,420
You two,

652
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,600
keep an eye on this place.

653
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,380
Yes.

654
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,520
Let's check other places.

655
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:50,350
[Wei]

656
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,110
By then, these places

657
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,540
will all be guarded.

658
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,170
Get more people to guard here.

659
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,090
[Wei]

660
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,980
There

661
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,700
and there.

662
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,540
That place is very important.

663
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,860
What is this place?

664
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,180
Here?

665
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
It's used to store some sundries.

666
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,700
Why is this place

667
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,540
unguarded?

668
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,740
Who is in charge?

669
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,780
Staff Mu.

670
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
I'm in charge

671
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,180
of the whole area.

672
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,660
Almost no one comes here.

673
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,060
We put some

674
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,460
cooking utensils, hammers,

675
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
and other things in it.

676
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,420
My men are sent to

677
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,500
other more important places.

678
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,260
So no one guards here.

679
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,420
All places are important places.

680
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,300
The Commander said

681
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,220
they all need to be guarded.

682
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,700
Yes.

683
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,860
Staff Mu.

684
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,980
I will guard this place

685
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,380
by myself.

686
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,980
I know you're here.

687
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,060
Just show up.

688
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,020
No need to do it.

689
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,900
You seem to be doing well.

690
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,460
You got promoted so quickly.

691
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,460
I'm the Close Guard for the Marshal

692
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,860
and work part time in the Outpost Battalion.

693
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,860
So my decision is right.

694
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,740
Wherever you are,

695
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,020
your talent will be appreciated.

696
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,500
This is all because of

697
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,260
your good plan.

698
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
With the special identity,

699
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,420
I can take operations

700
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,700
much more easily.

701
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,300
I've made arrangements

702
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,860
for tomorrow's peace talk.

703
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,460
Everything goes according to the plan.

704
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,700
If anything goes wrong,

705
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,180
ensure your safety first.

706
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,220
Nothing will go wrong.

707
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,220
Do you still remember our first principle?

708
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,140
That is, never

709
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,740
make any arbitrary actions

710
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,740
and always have a backup plan.

711
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,540
Even though

712
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,060
you’ve become

713
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,370
the most promising man of Jinghe,

714
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,620
you should still keep it in mind.

715
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,460
Of course.

716
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,060
I always remember it.

717
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,300
No one

718
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,540
except you

719
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,060
cares about me.

720
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,460
You are important to Jinghe.

721
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,060
And Jinghe needs you.

722
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,220
After we finish this task,

723
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,900
we'll go back

724
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,460
and visit the grave

725
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
of your parents together.

726
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,260
Okay.

727
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,860
I should go now.

728
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,700
Well, how is that girl Commander?

729
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,220
You are close to her.

730
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,700
Be careful.

731
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,310
Don't worry.

732
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,610
She's a spoiled girl.

733
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,780
Bye.

734
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,620
Wait.

735
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,910
Be careful.

736
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,740
Bye.

737
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,460
Bye.

738
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,660
What are you doing?

739
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,180
Stop it.

740
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,660
I'm having a bath.

741
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,300
Let me go!

742
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,300
I'm having a bath.

743
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,650
Stop it, okay?

744
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,490
You're so annoying.

745
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,700
Let me take a bath.

746
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:38,330
[Jing]

747
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,510
[Wei]

748
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,080
[Jing]

749
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,340
This is long talk.

750
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,460
It's dark now.

751
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,260
But no good results have come.

752
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,980
What a pity.

753
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,620
Since

754
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,780
you don't want a sincere negotiation,

755
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,740
why do you waste

756
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,020
each other's time?

757
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,740
Marshal Sima, we have sincerity,

758
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,450
but you just ignored it.

759
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,420
You have no sincerity

760
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,020
at all.

761
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,130
How can you say I ignored it？

762
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,380
See you.

763
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,540
Marshal.

764
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,820
Marshal.

765
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,660
Where is he?

766
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,460
Where is he?

767
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,180
He's not here.

768
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Not here.

769
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,740
Let's go.

770
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,940
Commander.

771
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,980
The assassin is nowhere to be found.

772
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,570
Father Marshal.

773
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,580
Are you alright?

774
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,820
I'm fine.

775
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,500
Go find him immediately.

776
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,180
Yes.

777
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,020
Mu Nan, search the camp.

778
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,620
Yes.

779
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,340
The rest,

780
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,580
search the outside of the camp with me.

781
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,660
When two countries are at war, the delegates should not be hurt.

782
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,020
Is this the way

783
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,060
you treat your guests?

784
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,180
How dare you say that?

785
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,100
Why are we having this drama?

786
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
Lord Yin,

787
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,980
you should know it.

788
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,420
No more words.

789
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,140
Goodbye.

790
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,740
Mu Nan.

791
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,250
Marshal.

792
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,140
Ask all the soldiers to come back.

793
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,300
Check if any of them has a fresh wound.

794
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,860
Search for the weapon the assassin used.

795
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,780
We must find the mole.

796
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,580
Yes.

797
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,860
Come with me.

798
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,740
Marshal.

799
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,820
Are you alright?

800
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,940
Escort Marshal back to Gu City.

801
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,980
Ensure his safety.

802
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,610
Whose room is that?

803
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,210
Chen Yan's.

804
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,300
Chen Yan.

805
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,260
An assassin attacked us.

806
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,860
All the rooms

807
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,820
should be searched.

808
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,300
Go ahead.

809
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,380
Bro.

810
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,520
Go over there.

811
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,980
Don't just stay here.

812
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,140
As an officer

813
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,460
from the Capital,

814
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,460
you can't even find an assassin

815
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,260
with so many men.

816
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,060
Impressive.

817
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,340
You spend all your time

818
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,540
suspecting your own soldiers.

819
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,900
Chen Yan.

820
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,180
Why are you saying this?

821
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,740
Nothing.

822
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,970
Just my grumble.

823
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,620
Guys,

824
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,140
search more carefully.

825
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,620
Under the quilt.

826
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,200
In the cabinet.

827
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,120
Search carefully.
