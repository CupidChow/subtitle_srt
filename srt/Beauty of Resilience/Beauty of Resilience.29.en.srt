has ascended the throne.

193
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
And I

194
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,740
became Heavenly Empress Dowager.

195
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,860
I know

196
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,060
he is not the ideal heir

197
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,580
in your mind.

198
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
But actually, he doesn't want the throne.

199
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Mortals always say immortals are carefree.

200
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,340
But they don't know

201
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,100
immortals

202
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,940
have their own difficulties.

203
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
We all have our crosses to bear.

204
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,740
You should

205
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,580
know this

206
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,620
better than anyone else.

207
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
But you are also better than anyone else

208
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,420
in enduring it.

209
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,340
Is it

210
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,600
worth it?

211
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,460
But don't worry.

212
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,290
Yan Luo is your son.

213
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,460
He will do his best

214
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
and be a good Heavenly Emperor.

215
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,140
Now,

216
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,980
Phoenix is dead.

217
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Yan Yue

218
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,859
is missing.

219
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,859
You must

220
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,380
miss Yan Yue very much.

221
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,660
But Yan Luo

222
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
didn't intend to find him.

223
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,900
He told me

224
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,980
if there got to be someone

225
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,060
who needs to sacrifice his freedom,

226
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,620
he's willing to be that person.

227
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,660
Yan Yue has shouldered too much pain

228
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
for his duty.

229
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,740
If Yan Yue doesn't want to contact Heavenly Realm,

230
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,940
he won't force Yan Yue.

231
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Maybe now's the time

232
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,460
for him to share

233
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,610
Yan Yue's responsibility.

234
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,740
Among the three of you,

235
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,420
you are the most persistent.

236
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Yan Luo

237
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,970
is the most carefree.

238
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,220
But neither of you is braver than Yan Yue.

239
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,900
Your Majesty.

240
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,460
Alright.

241
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,860
There's no one else.

242
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,780
Forget about the formalities.

243
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,650
The four guardians of Demon Realm and I

244
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,620
have formed a seal in the Weak River.

245
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,300
Taking the Weak River as the border,

246
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,660
the Demon Clan can't step out of the seal.

247
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,660
But since the world was created,

248
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,220
we and the Demon Clan have been enemies.

249
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,620
the supreme lord of the Demon Clan died

250
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,980
because of your father.

251
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,700
Aren't you afraid the truce will give

252
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,660
the Demon Clan time to recover and avenge?

253
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,460
We in Heavenly Realm

254
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,980
are never afraid of our enemies.

255
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,220
But we don't foster killing, either.

256
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,140
Not bad.

257
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,740
You do have the aura of Heavenly Emperor now.

258
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,740
Any news about Yan Yue?

259
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Maybe no news

260
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,220
is the best news.

261
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,220
Lord Rain.

262
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,460
Lord Rain...

263
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,620
No, no, no. You're Heavenly Emperor now.

264
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,900
It should be Your Majesty.

265
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,140
There is no one else.

266
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,370
It's just a title.

267
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,700
You don't need to be overcautious.

268
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,380
Why are you here?

269
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,140
To get some fresh air.

270
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,410
I like here better.

271
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,220
There aren't so many restrictions

272
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,940
or concerns.

273
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,980
Is it tiring to be Heavenly Emperor?

274
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,740
There are countless things to do.

275
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,020
It's not tiring to do all those things.

276
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,020
Instead, the identity of being Heavenly Emperor is exhausting.

277
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,490
Then...

278
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
I forgot what to say.

279
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,980
Actually, I want to tell you

280
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,980
since you're not happy,

281
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,980
why don't you quit?

282
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,500
Come back to Yingzhou.

283
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,180
Both resting soil and I

284
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,700
need you.

285
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,300
Tao.

286
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,140
You are taking good care of them.

287
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,060
Therefore,

288
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,300
I can leave this place to you

289
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,380
without any worries.

290
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,020
The rise and fall of Yingzhou

291
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,620
will depend on you in the future.

292
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,380
I solemnly entrust this responsibility

293
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,260
to you.

294
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,540
Even without you saying that,

295
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,220
I will take good care of them.

296
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,620
This is all your hard work.

297
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,980
But why are you saying it

298
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,180
like you'll never come back?

299
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,460
I'll come back to see you when I'm free.

300
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,140
But even if I come back,

301
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,420
I'm just a guest.

302
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,220
From now on, you are the owner of Yingzhou.

303
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Me?

304
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,940
My rank is too low.

305
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm not qualified.

306
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
You are qualified when I say so.

307
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,020
After all, I am Heavenly Emperor.

308
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,700
What?

309
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,860
Do you think the position is too humble?

310
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,060
No.

311
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,380
It's just suddenly...

312
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,860
I'm not used to it.

313
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,180
You've always been here.

314
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,220
No matter what happened,

315
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,220
you would teach me what to do.

316
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,300
From now on,

317
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,260
I'll be on my own.

318
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,140
Tao.

319
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,260
You need to trust yourself.

320
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,660
Look.

321
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,540
During this time,

322
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,700
you have done a good job, haven't you?

323
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,300
In addition,

324
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
you can be sure about the future?

325
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,540
Maybe soon,

326
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,700
I can remove the burden

327
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,780
on my shoulder

328
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,260
and come back here

329
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,700
to be carefree Rain God again.

330
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Really?

331
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,380
Life is unpredictable.

332
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,700
Take care.

333
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,020
I'm leaving.

334
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,420
Lord Rain.

335
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,780
I will be waiting for you.

336
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,910
[30 years later]

337
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,980
Wei Zhi.

338
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,300
Wei Zhi!

339
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,260
Wei Zhi!

340
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,020
Ou Ya.

341
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,700
Wei Zhi!

342
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,020
Wei Zhi, you're finally awake.

343
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,740
This...

344
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,860
I've been waiting for this day

345
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,140
for more than 30 years.

346
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,260
30 years.

347
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,700
Ou Ya, time to eat.

348
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
Wei Zhi.

349
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,140
Wei Zhi, you're finally awake.

350
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,700
Baby. The baby.

351
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,460
Yeah, the baby.

352
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,420
-The baby. -Let's go.

353
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,220
Wei Zhi.

354
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,730
Let's go.

355
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,950
When we woke up,

356
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,260
we saw you and the egg

357
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,300
lying there.

358
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,180
So, we brought you back.

359
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,300
You

360
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,660
are my baby.

361
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,660
All these years,

362
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,980
you've been asleep due to the damage to your spirit.

363
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,740
We brought you two

364
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,730
back here, Flower Forest.

365
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,980
We've been trying to hatch the egg

366
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,700
for so many years,

367
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,540
but failed.

368
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,700
Without you,

369
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,980
my baby and I

370
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,260
would have died.

371
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,700
Thank you so much.

372
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,420
I'll keep in mind

373
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,260
everything you've done for me.

374
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,260
If I get the chance in the future,

375
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,860
I must repay you.

376
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,060
Repay?

377
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,060
We are friends.

378
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,620
That's what friends should do.

379
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,260
Yes.

380
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,980
After so many years,

381
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,260
you haven't changed.

382
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,420
That's nice.

383
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,170
Did I cause you

384
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,140
any trouble

385
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,460
while I was asleep?

386
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,700
Don't worry.

387
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,420
Your Phoenix scent is gone.

388
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,500
So,

389
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,530
everyone in the Three Realms

390
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,220
thought you died

391
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,210
in that war.

392
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,940
For the past 30 years,

393
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,420
the Three Realms have been peaceful.

394
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,460
Wei Zhi,

395
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,460
you just woke up.

396
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,500
You haven't recovered yet.

397
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,530
Let's practice this later.

398
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,370
Everything will be fine.

399
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,620
Will my power recover?

400
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,980
Well...

401
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm not sure.

402
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
What about him?

403
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,620
Is he okay?

404
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,220
He...

405
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,860
Yan Yue is in Demon Realm.

406
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,460
He lost his memory.

407
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,700
If

408
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,140
I forget you,

409
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,460
you should know I don't mean it.

410
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,460
Wei Zhi.

411
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,500
Don't worry.

412
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,220
Yan Yue is fine now.

413
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,700
I went to Demon Realm to look for him once.

414
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,860
He's okay.

415
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,970
But

416
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,780
it seems that

417
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,740
he doesn't remember

418
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,140
the people and things he used to know.

419
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,900
Since the supreme lord of the Demon Clan died,

420
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,380
Demon Realm has been in chaos.

421
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,940
Different forces have been fighting for power.

422
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,060
In order to find Yan Yue,

423
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,620
I traveled across Demon Realm

424
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,900
and finally found him

425
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,740
in a forest.

426
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,930
He was grabbing new land with his soldiers.

427
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,140
When he saw me,

428
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,380
he beat me up.

429
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,130
He didn't seem to know me at all.

430
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,980
I couldn't fight with them,

431
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,220
so I came back first.

432
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,980
But then I went there again.

433
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,380
However, that time

434
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,780
I didn't find him.

435
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,660
And then?

436
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,700
Then,

437
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,660
Yan Luo ascended the throne and became Heavenly Emperor.

438
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,300
He called a truce with Demon Realm.

439
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,460
The Weak River Barrier was set.

440
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,660
Since then, Demon Realm has been cut off

441
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,800
from the outside world.

442
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
Wei Zhi.

443
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,780
Now you know

444
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,260
Yan Yue is safe.

445
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,020
Don't think too much.

446
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,020
When you recover,

447
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,980
we can think about solutions together.

448
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,980

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,780

452
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,460
Actually,

453
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm a little scared.

454
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,380
I'm afraid that you'll repeat

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
By the way,

571
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,620
I also went to see

572
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,220
my classmates at Egret Academy.

573
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,500
But only Ming Lang and Bao Liang

574
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,980
are still there.

575
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,659
Ming Lang is both virtuous and talented.

576
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,170
As everyone expected,

577
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,290
he became the new Imperial Advisor.

578
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,860
As for Bao Liang,

579
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,620
he is now

580
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,980
the dean of Egret Academy,

581
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,940
succeeding the old dean.

582
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,060
I feel relieved

583
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,340
to see them safe.

584
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,980
I still

585
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,449
have that man in my heart.

586
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,420
So, I decided to go find him.

587
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,900
Mother.

588
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
Don't worry.

589
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,260
I'll visit you often.

590
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:09,240
[Tomb of the Kind Mother Mrs. Wei]

591
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,320
[Wei Ye]

592
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,740
Mother.

593
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,100
Did Zhi come to see you?

594
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,820
[慈母顾门魏氏之墓]

595
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,140
Zhi.

596
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,500
You're still alive.

597
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,300
Talisman?

598
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,060
Yan Luo ascended the throne and became Heavenly Emperor.

599
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,820
He called a truce with Demon Realm.

600
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,900
The Weak River Barrier was set.

601
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,970
Since then, Demon Realm has been cut off

602
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,180
from the outside world.

603
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,860
Then these should be Yan Luo's talismans.

604
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,820
Dean.

605
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,140
Are you Elder Mu?

606
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,570
Yes.

607
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,500
I'm Elder Mu.

608
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,980
I always show up

609
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,140
when people have the strongest desires.

610
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,940
Heavenly Realm has sealed Demon Realm.

611
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,460
You can't break through it

612
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,460
with your mortal body now.

613
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,260
You can help me?

614
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,660
I can help you

615
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,420
but under a condition.

616
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,370
I want you

617
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,820
to exchange your appearance

618
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,900
with the girl in the mirror.

619
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,420
Are you willing to do so?

620
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,140
What's the use of my appearance?

621
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,940
I don't care

622
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,620
what you want to do in Demon Realm.

623
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,940
Why do you care about my intention?

624
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I'm willing to exchange.

625
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,980
Are you sure?

626
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,020
Yes.

627
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,260
This talisman

628
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,940
can only help you enter Demon Realm

629
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,580
but can't get you out.

630
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,140
I'll be careful.

631
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,180
Thank you, Elder Mu.

632
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,380
You'll find out soon

633
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,460
I'm doing this

634
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,340
to protect you.
