[Episode 16]

4
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,979
You know where the answer

5
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,850
you want is.

6
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,010
It's just that

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,610
you don't dare to face it.

8
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,320
Impossible.

9
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,290
Absolutely impossible.

10
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,150
It's really annoying.

11
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,110
I'll go out for a walk.

12
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,880
Bad news!

13
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,050
Bad news!

14
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,360
R-Rain God!

15
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,940
What's wrong?

16
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,280
I-I just

17
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,510
transplanted rice seedlings

18
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,770
all over the land in Yingzhou.

19
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,450
Well, congratulations.

20
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,280
And then, I...

21
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,350
When I passed by that place,

22
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,940
I suddenly found a bunch of seedlings

23
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,829
were all bending down.

24
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,340
No matter how hard I tried to help them get up, it was no use.

25
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,210
I also heard a strange sound.

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,890
A strange sound?

27
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,000
Look, in this area,

28
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,320
and also overthere, all the seedlings

29
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,180
bent down.

30
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,200
Is it because of the pests?

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,310
Come out.

32
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,930
Who?

33
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,820
Isn't this the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen?

34
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,360
There is plenty of

35
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,980
grass in the world.

36
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,600
Without sesame seeds,

37
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,200
you still have watermelons.

38
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,190
Without my sister,

39
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,810
you still have me.

40
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,240
What did she say?

41
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,050
Sesame and watermelons?

42
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,980
Kitchen God.

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,470
Kitchen God!

44
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,100
Cousin Yan Luo.

45
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,370
Sorry.

46
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,010
I crushed

47
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,460
your seedlings.

48
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,330
But,

49
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,450
I was too sleepy.

50
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,380
I was lying here,

51
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,400
drinking.

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,170
It was so cozy.

53
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,920
Where's the wine?

54
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,760
Tao.

55
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,130
Help the Kitchen God sort it out.

56
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,230
I'll go to work.

57
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,540
There's no more wine.

58
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,670
Here.

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,830
Have you thought it through?

60
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:37,960
Where is

61
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,610
the Phoenix?

62
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,090
Please do me a favor.

63
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,460
After I die,

64
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,840
please tell Lan Su

65
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,780
that I

66
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,370
never betrayed

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,420
my friends until I die.

68
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,780
A person who doesn't betray

69
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,820
his friends

70
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,460
will never betray

71
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,540
his woman.

72
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,610
What was your agenda

73
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,160
getting close to the Phoenix?

74
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,940
Right.

75
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,030
The Phoenix can help us devils

76
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,470
solve our problem of thousands of years

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,690
that there are too few females

78
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,610
and that the bloodline is weak.

79
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,310
How?

80
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,290
Why should I tell you?

81
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,290
Anyway,

82
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,870
we won't let the Phoenix die,

83
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,950
not to mention hurting her.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,980
If she's willing to help us, fine.

85
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,560
If she isn't,

86
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,460
I won't make her.

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,730
That's all.

88
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,480
Do you understand?

89
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,300
Yes.

90
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:16,640
Then...

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,620
What about the Phoenix?

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,409
My Lord,

93
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,990
he is about to be out of consciousness.

94
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,880
Since you'd rather die

95
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,590
than tell me where the Phoenix is,

96
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,490
fine,

97
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,540
I'll show you something.

98
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,350
The hangover soup is so good.

99
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,220
One more bowl, please.

100
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,450
This is fresh peach juice made from the peaches that bloom

101
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,520
and bear fruit once every 3,000 years.

102
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,179
We can't have it one bowl after another.

103
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,730
I didn't expect

104
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,630
a minor Peach Fairy like you

105
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,300
can make wine.

106
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,360
Kitchen Lord.

107
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,620
Who are you talking to?

108
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,270
You.

109
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,810
Don't call me Kitchen God.

110
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,080
Call me Yi'er.

111
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,950
Also,

112
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,400
don't always use an honorific title.

113
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,930
It sounds so awkward.

114
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,730
But...

115
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,540
but you're a High Immortal.

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,800
Haven't you lived

117
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,010
for many years?

118
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,300
Speaking of which,

119
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,390
you may be my senior.

120
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,840
That's not wrong.

121
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,770
Yi'er.

122
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,560
Are you troubled?

123
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,540
Troubled?

124
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,380
How do you know?

125
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,380
I see you drown your sorrows.

126
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,230
I've seen it so many times in the mortal world.

127
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,270
Can you really drown your sorrows?

128
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,110
Why do I feel it's useless?

129
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,300
Did you have a quarrel

130
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,040
with Immortal Yan Yue?

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,460
Yan Yue?

132
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,430
What does it have to do with Yan Yue?

133
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,170
Everyone in the Heaven Realm knows about

134
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,540
your engagement with Immortal Yan Yue.

135
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,250
Yan Yue and I

136
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,530
are

137
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,690
just cousins.

138
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,650
Nothing else.

139
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,260
Which High Immortal is it then?

140
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,900
He's not from the Heaven Realm.

141
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,990
He's…

142
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,240
He's from the Demon Realm.

143
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,180
Don't tell anyone.

144
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,410
Yi'er, Kitchen God in the East Kitchen,

145
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,310
I really admire you.

146
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,940
The Heaven and Demon Realms are distinctly separate

147
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,850
and are mortal enemies.

148
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,140
As a noble High Immortal,

149
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,170
you managed to break through the feuding barrier of the two realms

150
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,670
and fall in love with a demon.

151
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,820
It's really the grand love of the Three Realms.

152
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,650
However,

153
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,060
he doesn't seem to know

154
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,090
that I like him.

155
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,720
Maybe

156
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,300
he doesn't even know

157
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,100
how I feel about him.

158
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,800
Yi'er,

159
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,430
do you have any wine left?

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
I want to drink some too.

161
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,200
Why?

162
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,740
Having a crush on

163
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,340
someone who is impossible to be with you,

164
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,840
I know

165
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,180
that feeling way too well.

166
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,040
I'll get drunk with you.

167
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,660
Let's go.

168
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,570
Tao.

169
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,100
You have a crush?

170
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,750
Who is he?

171
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,160
Where have you been?

172
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,870
Don't leave again.

173
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,980
I'd rather die for you

174
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,120
than not see you.

175
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,670
Silly.

176
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,920
How can I let you die?

177
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,420
You can't die.

178
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,740
When I return to the Heaven Realm

179
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,020
and ask Father for help,

180
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,690
I can definitely save you.

181
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,120
Wei Zhi.

182
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,780
No matter what the truth is,

183
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,870
for you,

184
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,010
I won't get cold feet again.

185
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,250
No matter what,

186
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,940
I will always be by your side.

187
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,290
No.

188
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,000
Impossible.

189
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,180
What is that?

190
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,470
Father.

191
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,710
You're finally here.

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,900
Where is the Phoenix?

193
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,570
I beg you

194
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,630
to save the Phoenix.

195
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,100
You found it?

196
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,550
Yes.

197
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,280
So you…

198
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,480
have been hiding the Phoenix?

199
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,480
Father.

200
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,780
The Phoenix is in danger

201
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,900
just to save me.

202
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,100
I came here

203
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,260
to ask for your help

204
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,260
to save the Phoenix.

205
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,770
Besides that,

206
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,200
I have no other request.

207
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,600
In the end,

208
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,840
you still can't escape

209
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,360
your fate.

210
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,700
When the sky and the earth were just separated,

211
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,580
fire emerged in chaos

212
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,260
and went after the light.

213
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,120
A fire phoenix broke out from the mountain.

214
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,780
The Phoenix was unruly.

215
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,890
In the long years,

216
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,210
it accumulated endless evil power.

217
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,300
It caused chaos to the people

218
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,860
and started a great war.

219
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,520
It was regarded as an evil beast.

220
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,480
In the Heaven Realm,

221
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,230
only your birth mother, High Immortal Xi Cai,

222
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,710
can compete with her.

223
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,050
She was ordered to fight the Phoenix.

224
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,680
She trapped it in the flowers,

225
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,630
trying to use the pure spiritual energy of them

226
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,860
to purify the delusion in the Phoenix's heart.

227
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,520
But nobody expected

228
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,370
the Phoenix could go crazy again.

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,300
It broke the Heaven-Demon Barrier,

230
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,530
causing a catastrophe.

231
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,550
In the critical moment,

232
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,550
Xi Cai risked her life

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,660
to fight with the Phoenix.

234
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,380
When I arrived,

235
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,420
Xi Cai has used up her last bit of cultivation.

236
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,890
She saved all the lives in danger

237
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,630
and restored

238
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,200
the Heaven-Demon Barrier.

239
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,700
Yan Yue.

240
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,950
At this point,

241
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,310
your spiritual power

242
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,810
has completely recovered.

243
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,120
The Phoenix Nirvana

244
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,370
will endanger the Three Realms.

245
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:31,950
So,

246
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
you must fulfill

247
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,540
the mission of the Red Sun God.

248
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,670
Even just to avenge your mother,

249
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,900
you should kill the Phoenix.

250
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,450
This is

251
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,540
your fate as the Red Sun God.

252
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,500
Father.

253
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,760
Why

254
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,690
have I never heard of these things?

255
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,040
Because

256
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,020
you can't stand

257
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,520
killings again and again.

258
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,410
To let you live in peace,

259
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,120
I sealed

260
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,540
your memory.

261
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,100
This is the history between the Phoenix

262
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,140
and the Heaven Realm.

263
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,450
I have

264
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,230
told you the truth.

265
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,100
Your mother died because of the Phoenix

266
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,800
and used her immortal cultivation to save the people,

267
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,320
so that the people were spared

268
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,780
the misery of being massacred.

269
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,410
She was so brave and selfless.

270
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,810
She loved all the people in the world.

271
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,270
I hope you can understand

272
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,260
your responsibility.

273
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,650
Don't let her down.

274
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,240
But why do I have to

275
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,670
fight against the Phoenix?

276
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,280
The Phoenix is born

277
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,590
to fly around the sun,

278
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,400
like a moth flying to the flame.

279
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,850
It's irresistible.

280
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,250
Therefore,

281
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,060
the Phoenix and the Red Sun

282
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,350
are enemies generation after generation.

283
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,380
So you have no choice but to  use Chixiao Sword

284
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,340
to kill it again.

285
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,420
Father,

286
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,190
Wei Zhi is kind-hearted

287
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:02,920
and forbearing.

288
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,430
How could she endanger the Three Realms?

289
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,280
The Phoenix is a divine creature.

290
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,890
It has existed

291
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,089
since the beginning of the universe.

292
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,619
But now, she

293
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,800
is still trapped in a mortal body.

294
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,470
Her blood hasn't been stimulated yet.

295
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,030
The evil nature

296
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,670
is not fully released yet.

297
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:24,960
If

298
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,280
she is reborn,

299
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,310
the power that comes out

300
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,180
will destroy the Three Realms.

301
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,270
Just because of

302
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,790
the unknown evil

303
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,560
and the danger which is yet to come,

304
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,540
we're going to kill

305
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,240
the innocent Wei Zhi?

306
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,260
Just like the illusion

307
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,930
you saw just now,

308
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,050
the Phoenix is immortal.

309
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,790
If the host is too weak,

310
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,100
its blood

311
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,750
may not be stimulated at all.

312
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,660
But for Wei Zhi, the Phoenix blood has been stimulated twice.

313
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,480
Do you

314
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
still not get it?

315
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,210
It's inevitable!

316
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,200
Father,

317
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,240
I can’t do it.

318
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,360
In the eyes of everyone in the Three Realms,

319
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,570
Wei Zhi is the wicked and heinous Phoenix.

320
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,840
But in my heart,

321
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,140
she

322
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,300
is my love.

323
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,510
I really can't

324
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,860
kill my love

325
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,060
with my own hands.

326
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,150
Nonsense!

327
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,700
Many deities in the Heaven Realm

328
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,050
were killed or severely injured

329
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,470
due to the Phoenix Nirvana.

330
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,400
And now you're telling me

331
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,590
you can't complete the mission

332
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,210
because of your personal feelings?

333
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,060
You are now

334
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,830
being unfaithful,

335
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,420
disloyal, and unfilial.

336
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,480
Have you never

337
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,290
ever been true to me?

338
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,450
Never.

339
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,490
Now the situation is tense.

340
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,840
Yu Du has assembled an army.

341
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,830
Gucheng will be at war anytime.

342
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,790
We must get ready as soon as possible.

343
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,390
If you have any suggestions,

344
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,040
just speak out.

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,600
I heard

346
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,940
the court is taking Fairy Peahen as the commander-in-chief.

347
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,350
What is this Fairy Peahen

348
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,760
capable of?

349
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,460
She is the third daughter

350
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,080
of Minister Wei,

351
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:38,960
Wei Lingyue.

352
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,140
I went to Egret Academy

353
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,820
with her before.

354
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,340
She is highly skilled.

355
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,600
She's a strong rival.

356
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,500
As for the ways to cope with

357
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,280
her magic,

358
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,450
I'll tell everything I know

359
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,400
to you in detail.

360
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,770
That's good, Lord.

361
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,630
Although there are many people

362
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,470
and good weapons in the court,

363
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,450
we are greatly indebted to Gucheng.

364
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,860
So we will exert ourselves to the utmost

365
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,460
to protect Gucheng with our lives.

366
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,170
We'll be at your command.

367
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,060
Generals,

368
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,660
now

369
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,690
Gucheng has reached a point where its very existence is at stake.

370
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,370
Only by working together

371
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,650
can we get a slim chance of survival.

372
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,700
Since the war is inevitable,

373
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,440
we must first settle down

374
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,680
the old, weak people, women and children in the city.

375
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,950
Only when the rear is stable

376
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,440
can we keep up the morale of the army.

377
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,400
General Xia is quite right.

378
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,470
I once heard

379
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,860
there is a secret tunnel in the city

380
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,660
which leads to the outside of the city.

381
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,260
If it's true,

382
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,600
find the secret tunnel and repair it.

383
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,710
Once the war begins,

384
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,540
it can be used as the vital line

385
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,730
for the weak, the old, the women, and children to escape.

386
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,040
There is indeed hearsay about it.

387
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,060
But

388
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,760
since the old City Governor passed away,

389
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,900
no one knows the entrance

390
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,150
of the secret tunnel.

391
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,860
I know.

392
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,100
At that time,

393
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,020
I escaped through this tunnel

394
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,790
with my girl.

395
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,870
It's been ten years.

396
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,340
I never thought

397
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,300
I would come back alive.

398
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,550
Aunt,

399
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,610
we will avenge Master Gu

400
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,810
for you.

401
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
If it's about revenge,

402
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,520
I have given up this idea long ago.

403
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,620
I just want the people of Gucheng

404
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,630
to be safe and rich.

405
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,100
I hope they'll never fall into the endless wars

406
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,750
where reprisal breeds reprisal.

407
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,810
But if

408
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,980
someone overthrow justice

409
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,020
and kill the innocent

410
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,950
for their private ends,

411
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,630
the people of Gucheng

412
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,800
are not afraid of war either.

413
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,720
Go on.

414
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,360
Why are you here?

415
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,760
Why can't I be here?

416
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,690
An evil beast like the Phoenix has appeared here.

417
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,630
I'd like to see

418
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,770
what's going on in the academy.

419
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,480
Wei Zhi is not evil.

420
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,770
The academy

421
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,680
is also the same as usual.

422
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,190
This is not up to you.

423
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,700
In my opinion,

424
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,890
you should approach Wei Lingyue.

425
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,310
She is

426
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,550
a favorite with the imperial court.

427
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,820
Maybe

428
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,660
because you taught her

429
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,180
in the academy,

430
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,960
she may offer you a position.

431
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,470
The situation of the court

432
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,610
is not my concern.

433
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,490
I won't side with anyone

434
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,310
just because they're in power.

435
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,060
Why are you so stubborn?

436
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,580
Isn't this

437
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,410
the mortal world you want to protect?

438
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,790
The policies change every day.

439
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,220
People curry favour with those in power

440
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,670
and can't distinguish good from evil.

441
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,190
Just because good

442
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,660
is hard to come by,

443
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,190
it's worth pursuing and fighting for.

444
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,500
You can

445
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,570
just talk about the principles,

446
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,130
but you don't need to stick to them.

447
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,270
Back then,

448
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,290
I chose to give up immortality

449
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,620
and escaped from your body,

450
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,290
just to do good and be kind.

451
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,310
Fine.

452
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,550
Fine.

453
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,220
I hope you can get what you desired

454
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,970
and die happily.

455
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,090
[Gucheng]

456
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,040
This house has been long neglected and in disrepair.

457
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,600
Please don't mind it, Aunt.

458
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,590
After renovation

459
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,050
and cleaning,

460
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,500
you can move in.

461
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,970
Thank you, Lord.

462
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,590
Aunt,

463
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,350
please don't call me that.

464
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,790
Just call me Ming Lang

465
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,970
like before.

466
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,560
Ming Lang,

467
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,200
thank you.

468
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,770
My father

469
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,300
did something wrong to Gucheng

470
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,140
and your family.

471
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,380
No matter what I do now,

472
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,170
I can't make up for even a tiny part of his fault.

473
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,560
Now everything

474
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,790
has been clear.

475
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,800
It’s all the scheme of the Imperial Advisor.

476
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,840
Your father

477
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,430
was not a person wicked to the extreme.

478
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,490
Let bygones be bygones.

479
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,140
Do you have

480
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,790
any news about Wei Zhi?

481
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,990
Maybe no news

482
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,160
is good news.

483
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,300
Who would have thought

484
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,130
the daughter I've resented for so many years

485
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,260
has an identity like that?

486
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,720
We all know Wei Zhi very well.

487
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,670
She's so kind.

488
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,860
No matter what others say,

489
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,050
in my heart,

490
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,410
she is not an evil creature,

491
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,810
or the noble Phoenix.

492
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,600
She is just our family.

493
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,620
As her mother,

494
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,660
I owe her much these years.

495
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,400
All I want now is that she's safe.

496
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,770
Wei Zhi is with Master.

497
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,830
Master is powerful.

498
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,280
He will surely be able to protect her.

499
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,640
Aunt,

500
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,970
let me take you there.

501
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,690
I have regained my memory of my previous life.

502
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,350
He can be trusted.

503
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,780
Then I'll use the last move

504
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,960
to take a chance.

505
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,350
The Heavenly Emperor has ordered

506
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,610
that it's time to go to the Human Realm.

507
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,580
In the past,

508
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,840
I've always wanted to return there.

509
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,090
Because as soon as I opened the door,

510
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,630
I could see Wei Zhi.

511
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,150
Before I left, I promised her

512
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,370
I would save her.

513
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,550
I told her to wait for me

514
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,170
and trust me.

515
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,690
But when we meet again next time,

516
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,890
there's nothing but death that's waiting for her.

517
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,550
And I even have to do it myself.

518
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,290
Don't blame yourself too much.

519
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,220
It's all fate.

520
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,100
Qing Huan,

521
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,200
for the sake of

522
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,490
our fraternity,

523
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,580
do me a favor.

524
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,880
As long as I can do it,

525
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,430
I will help you.

526
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,590
Give Wei Zhi and I

527
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,250
some time alone.

528
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,670
Will you let her escape?

529
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,890
I will fulfill

530
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,380
what I promised Father.

531
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,950
Besides,

532
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,460
in this world,

533
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,510
Wei Zhi has nowhere to go,

534
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,030
but to die.

535
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,210
Fine.

536
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,210
I'm glad you understand it.

537
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:08,840
Thank you.

538
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,120
You're back.

539
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,010
I miss you so much.

540
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,030
What took you so long?

541
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,780
The Heavenly Court

542
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,000
didn't find the way to break the Formula,

543
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:46,870
right?

544
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,080
It's okay. I don't care.

545
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,290
I don’t care if there's a way

546
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,180
to break the Formula.

547
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,670
As long as you're with me,

548
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,840
I'm not afraid of dying,

549
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,320
and I have no regrets.

550
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,930
So,

551
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,420
don't be too sad.

552
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,990
It's not a big deal.

553
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,280
Do I look good today?

554
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,990
Yes.

555
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,060
But something seems to be missing.

556
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,270
Follow me.

557
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,510
Sit down.

558
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,680
Now,

559
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,240
you're even more beautiful.

560
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,730
Wei Zhi.

561
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,560
♫It's the fog under your eyes♫

562
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,370
Happy birthday.

563
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,110
♫That makes it rain at the Mount Ba♫

564
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,600
You know?

565
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,580
I knew it long ago.

566
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,010
♫Who will I sigh for in this life♫

567
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,750
Because I've read

568
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,870
your admission document.

569
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,940
♫I will remember the past when we part♫

570
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,900
You remembered it all along?

571
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,570
I had to

572
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,110
check your immortal bones repeatedly.

573
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,230
So,

574
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,640
♫I've buried my heart in autumn♫

575
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,420
I learned it by heart.

576
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,380
♫It's your frown♫

577
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,830
♫That brings the sorrowful clouds♫

578
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,860
♫Who will I meet in this life?♫

579
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,440
You made all these?

580
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:41,520
♫Sadness or joy are predestined♫

581
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,930
Yes. Try it.

582
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,690
♫Love and hatred made me suffer a lot♫

583
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,460
♫What's the date of the Palace in the sky♫

584
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,570
Not bad, right?

585
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,340
♫I'm only waiting for you♫

586
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,430
Delicious.

587
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:51,930
Here.

588
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,710
You have some, too.

589
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,540
♫To appear in my dreams♫

590
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,410
♫The courtyard is lush with sycamores♫

591
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,020
♫It only hopes that one day♫

592
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,380
It's your birthday.

593
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,510
How could there not be longevity noodles?

594
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,360
♫There'll still be a phoenix to roost♫

595
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:05,990
Today is your birthday.

596
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,060
Normally,

597
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,270
I should cook for you.

598
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,200
Good.

599
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,420
♫My love for you will never change♫

600
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,730
I can make you a bowl of longevity noodles.

601
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,810
Have a taste.

602
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,390
Have a taste.

603
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,060
Thank you.

604
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,870
Eat up.

605
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,460
It won't taste good when it gets cold.

606
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,370
To be honest,

607
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,980
since I left Gucheng,

608
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,410
I haven't celebrated my birthdays anymore.

609
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,600
Since my home was wrecked at Gucheng,

610
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,190
I've lost my childhood life.

611
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,600
Also since then,

612
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,710
my mother started to

613
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,120
take me as a jinx.

614
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,460
She thinks I got my family killed

615
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,900
and caused serious damage to Gucheng.

616
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,630
Since then,

617
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,719
I've never celebrated my birthdays again.

618
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,030
So every time,

619
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,820
I just looked to

620
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,060
the direction to Gucheng alone,

621
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,340
and missed Grandpa

622
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,500
and Father.

623
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,090
Sometimes,

624
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,199
I fell into self-doubt

625
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,929
and self-denial.

626
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,340
I'd wonder if one of those things would happen

627
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,350
if it weren't for me.

628
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,150
But it's different now.

629
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,000
I have you now.

630
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,260
With a person who loves me and cares about me,

631
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,360
my existence becomes meaningful.

632
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:52,949
By the way,

633
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,900
I've prepared a birthday gift for you.

634
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,000
Open it.

635
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,370
Who did you ask to have it fixed so well?

636
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,450
I fixed it myself.

637
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,130
Although

638
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,270
it has no spiritual power anymore,

639
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,220
it'll be

640
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,680
a memory for you and Grandpa

641
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,340
which can never be erased.

642
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,140
If Grandpa knew

643
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,060
I'm so happy now,

644
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm sure he'd be very happy.

645
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,760
Will you always be with me?

646
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,100
Yes.

647
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,320
How much longer do you think

648
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,020
I can live?

649
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,160
You will surely

650
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,260
live on safely.

651
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:05,750
Come on.

652
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,600
It's so beautiful here.

653
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,760
On my birthday,

654
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,950
having a walk out here

655
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,670
with you in the breeze,

656
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,580
it's so comfortable.

657
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,550
Yes.

658
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,580
Have you caught shrimps before?

659
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,170
It's very fun.

660
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,470
Look

661
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,830
what I found.

662
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,300
Look.

663
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,500
A conch.

664
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,760
Why are there conches here?

665
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,430
It seems

666
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,710
it used to be a sea here before.

667
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,850
Who would have thought the sea dried up?

668
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,330
Now only this conch is left

669
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,740
to be a witness of the past world.

670
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,860
I heard that

671
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,120
as long as you put it

672
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,840
near your ear,

673
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,060
you can hear the sound of the sea.

674
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,760
Why is there only the sound of wind?

675
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,820
To listen to the sound of the sea,

676
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,500
you have to close your eyes

677
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,380
and listen with your heart.

678
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,570
