[Episode 28]

4
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,820
With him growing

5
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,260
inside you,

6
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,540
he will drain all your spiritual power

7
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,420
and blood.

8
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
With your current state,

9
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,820
you won't be able to maintain the balance within.

10
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,660
But sister,

11
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,540
take a rest.

12
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,260
I believe there will be a way.

13
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,100
I'm leaving.

14
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,340
Wait!

15
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,100
I have something to tell you.

16
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,579
The old spirit on the Three Lives Stone.

17
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,540
Although Wei Zhi and Wang Yue

18
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,820
are both Phoenixes,

19
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,700
they are not the same person.

20
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,660
Sister...

21
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,700
Let me finish.

22
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,980
You don't care about the Phoenix

23
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,700
or Wei Zhi,

24
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,660
you care about Wangyue.

25
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,660
It should only be Wangyue.

26
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,540
Because she gave you a home

27
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,940
and treated you as her own family.

28
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,660
You respect her and love her.

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,860
Every moment you spend with her,

30
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,580
whether filled with joy or sorrow,

31
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,980
remains in your memory.

32
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,540
But Wei Zhi

33
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,100
is just a young girl

34
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,060
from Gucheng.

35
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,100
By chance,

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,380
we met

37
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,500
because of your persistence and dedication.

38
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,940
But I'm not Wangyue.

39
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,579
And I can never replace her.

40
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,540
Do you understand?

41
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,340
Sister.

42
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,530
That's enough.

43
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,940
This has been bottled up

44
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,540
inside of me for a long time.

45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,260
I had to tell you.

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,420
Mu Nan,

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
you're smart,

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,410
so you must already know this.

49
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,820
You just don't want to admit it, right?

50
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,780
Hundreds of years have passed by in a blur.

51
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,820
Are you planning to escape

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
for another hundred years?

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,100
Wangyue is gone.

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,490
You can cherish

55
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,980
all the great memories in your heart,

56
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,420
but you don't have

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,540
to protect her anymore.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,540
You should have a new life.

59
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,380
A new life?

60
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,260
Yes.

61
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,340
You should protect

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,779
the person you really need to protect.

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,260
This person is not Wangyue

64
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,779
or Wei Zhi.

65
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,540
But there must be

66
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,660
someone like that out there.

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,780
Trust me.

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,460
My Lord.

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
Great!

70
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,970
The medicinal jade seems very effective.

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,659
Thank you for your effort.

72
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,460
You're so polite.

73
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,140
Very hypocritical!

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,340
Although the effect of the medicinal jade

75
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,570
along with the infusion of my spiritual power

76
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,780
can't cure her,

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,660
they can at least stabilize

78
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
her current condition.

79
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,580
I feel relieved

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,820
that you don't have to be worried anymore.

81
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,060
I want to have a drink.

82
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,460
Let's go together.

83
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,900
Okay.

84
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,900
Let's go.

85
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,460
Let's go!

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,580
Everything in this yard

87
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,340
was left by the former Phoenix.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,020
At that time,

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,220
she was called Sima Wangyue,

90
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,340
and I was called Mu Nan.

91
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,140
I'm just an abandoned child

92
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,700
adopted by the Sima family.

93
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,580
I grew up with her

94
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,780
and called her sister.

95
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,260
This is really a sad story.

96
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,460
No wonder you look so weary

97
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,660
and tired.

98
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,980
Mu Nan.

99
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,700
Can I also call you Mu Nan?

100
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,770
Then,

101
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,340
is there any way now

102
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,780
to save Wei Zhi?

103
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,980
Or,

104
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,260
your...

105
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,220
Sister.

106
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,980
There might be a way.

107
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,580
Then think of a way. Go now.

108
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,660
I'll take care of Wei Zhi.

109
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,220
I...

110
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,540
We'll wait for you to come back.

111
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,580
Xi Cai.

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,780
Yan Yue

113
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,820
let me down.

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,220
I'm very sad.

115
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,980
But,

116
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
he is our son.

117
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
So,

118
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,020
I can't let him

119
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,340
make more mistakes.

120
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,980
Mu Nan.

121
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,650
[Wei]

122
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm not greedy.

123
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,460
I just...

124
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,310
[Wei]

125
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,820
Want...

126
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,020
Here...

127
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,460
To have

128
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,100
a place for me.

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,980
But,

130
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,100
I...

131
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,860
I don't dare now.

132
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Because,

133
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,299
I think...

134
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,700
I lost.

135
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,220
You've had feelings for her

136
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,820
for so long.

137
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,299
But...

138
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:43,809
I...

139
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,100
I just knew you recently.

141
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,180
Aren't I...

142
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,820
Aren't I ridiculous?

143
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,700
Confronting long-lasting feelings

144
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,570
with such a brief acquaintance.

145
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,580
Mu Nan.

146
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,620
Mu Nan.

147
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,340
I can't accept it.

148
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,620
I can't accept it!

149
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,300
I can't accept it...

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Didn't you go to find Wei Zhi?

197
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,100
♫To the thoughts♫

198
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,170
♫Don't ask, don't tell♫

199
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,760
♫Just hold each other♫

200
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,220
Isn't it because...

201
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,880
♫Fold a feather of tenderness♫

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,450
Of you.

203
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,160
♫And it's immortal♫

204
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,100
Don't drink too much in the future

205
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,420
if you can't hold your liquor well.

206
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,850
♫Believe in love and loneliness♫

207
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,220
Isn't it because

208
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,810
♫Learn to be foolish and brave♫

209
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,580
you asked me to drink?

210
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,100
♫It's hard to turn back♫

211
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,010
♫You don't have to understand if you don't want to hear♫

212
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,580
♫Even if it's a dream♫

213
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,580
I'm leaving.

214
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,460
Take care of Wei Zhi for me.

215
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,220
Okay, don't worry.

216
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,420
Wait for me.

217
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,180
He...

218
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,620
Why did

219
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,740
he seem a bit weird just now?

220
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,740
It seems

221
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,980
that this is the only way

222
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,060
to save my sister.

223
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,580
Are you here for Yan Yue?

224
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,500
Yan Yue is imprisoned here

225
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,860
within the Heavenly Emperor's barrier.

226
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
You can't get in.

227
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,420
But I can take you in.

228
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,220
Why are you helping me?

229
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,180
I want to help him.

230
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,460
Wei Zhi...

231
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,060
What happened to her?

232
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,460
Wei Zhi?

233
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,460
She was fine

234
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,500
in our Demon Realm.

235
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,740
Everyone respected her

236
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,820
and obeyed her.

237
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,460
But because of you,

238
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,820
she lost control over her spiritual power

239
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,220
and caused

240
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
her bloodline to stimulate.

241
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,460
What happened?

242
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,620
Wei Zhi!

243
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,420
Is pregnant.

244
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,820
What?

245
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,980
Wei Zhi is pregnant?

246
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,500
It's because of you

247
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,220
that her baby possesses

248
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,700
the bloodlines of the Heaven Realm

249
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,220
and the Phoenix at the same time.

250
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,820
He continues to drain

251
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,580
Wei Zhi's spiritual power

252
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
causing her to lose to Wei Lingyue.

253
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,340
Even her mother died because of her.

254
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,810
It's because of you

255
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,220
that she's on the brink of

256
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,690
falling into diabolism.

257
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,620
I want to go see her.

258
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,820
I...

259
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,580
I...

260
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,100
Want to go see her.

261
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,620
You want to see her?

262
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
What gives you the right?

263
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,740
Is it because of the sweet words

264
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,220
you told her before?

265
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,340
Let me tell you.

266
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,460
If the fetus continued to absorb

267
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,700
her spiritual power,

268
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Wei Zhi would die

269
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
the day he's born.

270
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
The only thing that can save her now

271
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,340
is Huarong.

272
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,740
You decide

273
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,980
what should be done.

274
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,700
But, if anything happens

275
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,220
to Wei Zhi,

276
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,980
I will make you perish alongside

277
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,220
the Heaven Realm and our Demon Realm.

278
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,740
Yan Luo...

279
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Why do you have

280
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,020
to impose all the pain and injustice

281
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,619
on Wei Zhi?

282
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Can you tell me

283
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,020
why?

284
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,980
What are you planning to do?

285
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,620
Wei Zhi

286
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,460
has my child now.

287
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,610
She must be in so much pain

288
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,460
and in great despair right now.

289
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,500
I can't just sit back

290
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,380
and do nothing anymore.

291
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,550
I can't pretend to be calm.

292
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,940
She needs me.

293
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,020
Our child

294
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,900
needs me too.

295
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,500
How did it go?

296
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,660
Have you found a way

297
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,780
to save Wei Zhi?

298
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,140
It will depend on your Divine Lord.

299
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,660
If Yan Yue has a way

300
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,620
to save Wei Zhi,

301
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,180
I'm sure

302
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,740
he'll risk everything for it.

303
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,660
I hope so.

304
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,740
Otherwise, I will make sure

305
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,300
the Heaven Realm knows no peace.

306
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,940
Actually,

307
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,460
you also believe

308
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,380
that Yan Yue will save Wei Zhi, right?

309
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,900
But...

310
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,060
You also hate it.

311
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,980
Why is he the one who can save Wei Zhi

312
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
and not you?

313
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,900
So,

314
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,460
you're very frustrated and dispirited.

315
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,940
Wei Zhi's life can be saved,

316
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,460
but your heart

317
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,980
is hard to heal.

318
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,300
You're right.

319
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,220
However, you're not entirely correct.

320
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,900
My heart

321
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,220
has actually been healed

322
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,140
by someone a long time ago.

323
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,980
By whom?

324
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,780
How about this?

325
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,620
I will definitely tell you

326
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
after my sister's matter

327
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,380
is resolved.

328
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,700
You...

329
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,940
I hate the people who keep me hanging the most.

330
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Heavenly Empress.

331
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,980
Take a rest. Let me do it.

332
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,700
The Heavenly Ganoderma from the West

333
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,980
is fully ripe now. I have to turn it into

334
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,020
an elixir as soon as possible.

335
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,540
Your love for Heavenly Emperor

336
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,660
is very deep.

337
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,860
That's what a couple should do.

338
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,700
Actually, the Heavenly Emperor's good fortune

339
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,980
and longevity surpass ten thousand years.

340
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,220
It’s normal

341
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,460
to have a few strands of white hair.

342
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,420
Mother.

343
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,500
Mother!

344
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,660
Yan Yue?

345
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,860
Yan Yue!

346
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,220
Yan Luo!

347
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,740
Mother.

348
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,940
If you take another step forward,

349
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,970
the formation on the ground will activate,

350
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
and all the thunder and fire

351
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,420
will pour down on Yan Luo.

352
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,220
You're brothers.

353
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,540
Why are you doing this to him?

354
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
Mother,

355
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,220
you have the key to the Ice Prison.

356
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,140
I need it.

357
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,700
Yan Yue is helpless.

358
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,700
This is the last resort.

359
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,980
I know what you want to do.

360
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,940
But...

361
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,980
There is one thing

362
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,780
you must hear carefully.

363
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,140
Think well

364
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,620
if you want to use this key.

365
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,020
Your father

366
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,300
casted a heavenly curse on this key.

367
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,460
If you use it to take out the Huarong,

368
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,140
the curse will be triggered,

369
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,180
and it will gradually erase

370
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,620
all your memories

371
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,700
related to the Phoenix.

372
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,300
Father

373
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,980
always uses this move.

374
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,980
Also,

375
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,660
you've made a mistake

376
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,260
by using Yan Luo as a threat.

377
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,140
If you make another mistake,

378
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,260
the Heavenly Court

379
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,890
will treat you as a traitor.

380
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,980
You will be doomed soon.

381
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,220
Yan Yue,

382
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,660
is the Phoenix worth it?

383
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,980
Yes.

384
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,900
It seems

385
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,940
that you've already made up your mind.

386
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,900
If you activate the key,

387
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,380
you will forget her again.

388
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,780
Yan Yue,

389
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,180
have you thought it through?

390
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,860
Even if I forget the past,

391
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,180
we still have

392
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,260
the future.

393
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,980
Yan Luo.

394
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,620
Thank you.

395
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,260
Yan Yue,

396
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,380
this is all I can do for you.

397
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,500
Take care.

398
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,740
Sister.

399
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,420
You haven't recovered yet.

400
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,620
Why are you here?

401
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,300
Nothing.

402
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,220
I miss the sunrise and the sunset.

403
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,980
Sister.

404
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,180
Are you

405
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,180
thinking about him again?

406
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,460
I just don't understand.

407
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,900
It's so painful to love someone.

408
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,140
The Formula is disappearing now.

409
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,980
It also pains me

410
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,860
not to love anyone.

411
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,060
Sister,

412
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,140
your spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

413
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,700
Don't think too much.

414
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
Get some sleep.

415
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,620
Actually,

416
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,940
Yan Yue didn't get married.

417
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,940
That's just an illusion.

418
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,460
Sister.

419
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,480
Did I do something wrong?

420
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,060
Wei Zhi.

421
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,220
I'm sorry.

422
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,940
I won't let you wait anymore.

423
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,060
Your Numb Guy is back.

424
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,380
Are going to leave?

425
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,620
No.

426
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,900
I'll stay

427
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,260
wherever you and our child are.

428
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
I won't leave you again.

429
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,100
Wei Zhi!

430
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,460
Wei Zhi!

431
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,140
We can't delay this any longer.

432
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,700
Our lord can't be bothered

433
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,220
during the spell cast.

434
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,900
If the enemy attacks,

435
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,020
defend him to the death!

436
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,900
Yes!

437
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,060
Wei Zhi.

438
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,700
You must stay safe.

439
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,700
You must get better.

440
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,620
You two

441
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,940
only helped for a short while,

442
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,450
and you already ate half of the meat.

443
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,130
We...

444
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,060
We're trying it for Wei Zhi.

445
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,660
It's such a happy event for Wei Zhi.

446
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,970
This meal is very important,

447
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,420
so we need to try it for her, right?

448
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,620
Besides,

449
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,940
we just came to Demon Realm,

450
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,380
and you've already made us work like servants.

451
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,690
We haven't seen her yet.

452
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,140
What's wrong with eating a few pieces of meat?

453
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,860
That's right!

454
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,620
That's too much.

455
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,660
No, no, no.

456
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,500
I have to go.

457
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,900
Maybe I can help.

458
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Don't!

459
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,540
Huarong needs the Demon Clan

460
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,460
to help with the fusion.

461
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,540
Are you from the Demon Clan?

462
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,620
You'll be like a piece of wood

463
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,460
when you go there.

464
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,540
What's the use of standing there?

465
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,180
No!

466
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,700
What's wrong with me standing there?

467
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Let me tell you.

468
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,700
The supreme lord of the Demon Clan is useless.

469
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,490
He gave all his spiritual power

470
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,540
to Huarong,

471
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,460
then made Huarong

472
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,060
and Wei Zhi merge together.

473
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,020
Now he's just a small lamb

474
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,660
ready to be trampled upon.

475
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,220
I can go there and help.

476
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,620
To sum it up,

477
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,620
one is a Devine Lord from heaven,

478
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,730
another is a Lord from the Demon Realm.

479
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,410
With these two men there,

480
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,250
it's useless for you to go.

481
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,740
Go back to work now.

482
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,420
Wei Lingyue!

483
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,740
What are you doing here?

484
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,020
I came to get back what belongs to me.

485
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,700
What's going on?

486
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,020
Is something wrong?

487
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,370
This is not good!

488
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,780
Wei Zhi is in danger!

489
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Divine Lord,

490
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,460
why do you keep getting bewitched

491
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,940
by the Demon Phoenix

492
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,500
and keep making one mistake after another?

493
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Wei Lingyue.

494
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,220
All the killings

495
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,620
have been caused by you.

496
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,420
You still don't repent?

497
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
I'm doing this to enforce justice on behalf of heaven,

498
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,900
to save the commoners

499
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,220
and to save you as well.

500
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,420
You're so stubborn.

501
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,020
Stubborn?

502
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,020
Fine.

503
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,380
Now,

504
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,540
I will get rid of the evil creature

505
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,980
that led you astray.

506
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,260
How could your magic

507
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,860
improve so much?

508
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

509
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,860
Get up.

510
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,260
How can I become

511
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,980
worthy of your guidance and greatly increase

512
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
my spiritual power, Your Majesty?

513
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,420
I know

514
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,740
that you are determined to destroy Phoenix.

515
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,980
This is the paradigm of the Three Realms.

516
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,260
Don’t be too modest.

517
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,660
Rewards and punishments have always been rigorously carried out in the Heaven Realm.

518
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,660
I know

519
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,220
that you care about the Devine Lord.

520
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,020
If you can really kill the Phoenix, I will grant you

521
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,020
the position of the Devine Lord's consort.

522
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,460
I will do my best!

523
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,370
This is...

524
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,020
The Heavenly Thunder Magic?

525
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,780
This is the Heavenly Thunder Magic.

526
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,179
I'll pass it to you now.

527
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,580
Remember.

528
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,420
Using the Heavenly Thunder Magic

529
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,940
requires a great amount

530
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,060
of spiritual power to support it.

531
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
If it surpasses one's own limits,

532
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,659
it will backfire and destroy

533
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,139
both the physical body and primordial spirit.

534
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,580
At that time, the body and the spirit will disappear.

535
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,420
So I think you must know clearly

536
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,060
when to use it.

537
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,500
How can she...

538
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,020
Wei Zhi.

539
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,060
You despicable servant!

540
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,420
You shamelessly took away

541
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,940
everything that was supposed to be mine.

542
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,820
My love.

543
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Awesome!

544
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,140
My glory.

545
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,260
And my kindness.

546
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,740
But,

547
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
these things don't matter anymore.

548
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,980
Because...

549
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
I'm going to tear you apart

550
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,340
right now!

551
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,780
Wei Lingyue.

552
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,250
Yan Yue!

553
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,100
Are you losers

554
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,060
really trying to hinder me?

555
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,180
You are actually willing to sacrifice your own lives

556
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,100
to protect her?

557
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,980
Wei Zhi!

558
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,980
What makes you better than me?

559
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,900
My Lord!

560
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,500
Yan Yue!

561
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,620
My Lord!

562
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,420
Why are you so stupid?

563
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,740
You actually self-destructed your primordial spirit.

564
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,860
Why?

565
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,980
I didn't expect

566
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,420
that in the end,

567
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,580
he's the only one who can save my sister.

568
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,020
I can't do it anymore.

569
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,530
It seems

570
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,100
that I can only hand over all my cultivation

571
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,140
to Yan Yue.

572
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,380
This is the only way he can have a chance of survival.

573
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,340
Only if he is well,

574
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,740
will there be hope for sister.

575
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,500
However, you're now

576
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,380
relying on these cultivations

577
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,940
to prevent your soul from dispersing.

578
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,660
If your cultivation is exhausted,

579
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,860
your body and soul will perish,

580
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,340
like Wei Lingyue.

581
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,860
Don't do it.

582
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,460
Forever.

583
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,980
I have been very tired

584
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,380
all my life.

585
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,980
It's a pity

586
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,540
that I still didn't get to live

587
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,660
my own life

588
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,300
that sister told me about.
