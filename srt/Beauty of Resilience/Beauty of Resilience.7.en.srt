4
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,259
Whenever I see her,

5
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,980
I will always think of the death of my whole clan.

6
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,900
There's blood all over the ground,

7
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,820
and fire all over the mountain.

8
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,460
She's my kid.

9
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,500
But I can't help

10
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,030
hating her.

11
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,900
Wei Zhi

12
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,150
feels deeply rooted

13
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,170
regretful.

14
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,100
I can notice that

15
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,620
among all the children of her age at the academy,

16
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,840
she's much more anxious

17
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,920
than them.

18
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,800
Since she's back,

19
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,860
I won't

20
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,460
allow her to go back.

21
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,550
I arranged a marriage

22
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,280
for Wei Zhi.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,580
Then...

24
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,850
What does Wei Zhi think?

25
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,180
She agreed too.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,540
Madam,

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,520
since I'm her teacher,

28
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,480
it's a kind of fate between us.

29
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,940
I

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,090
have a presumptuous request.

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,290
Could you let Wei Zhi

32
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,990
attend the Mid-Autumn Day party

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,740
of academy first?

34
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,400
Please make the decision after that.

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,040
No need.

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,510
That will only make Wei Zhi

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
have unnecessary fantasies.

38
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,050
Madam.

39
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,060
Dean.

40
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,480
You're here to visit us

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,990
out of concern.

42
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,170
I'm so grateful.

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,720
But I think

44
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,570
from now on,

45
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,670
we'd better

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,150
cut off all contact.

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,530
Madam.

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,690
Dean.

49
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,750
Please leave.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,650
Master.

51
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,430
Master!

52
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,020
Master, bad news!

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,540
Bad news!

54
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,980
Young Master Chun Wu...

55
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,100
Young Master Chun Wu

56
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,440
threw the medicine up.

57
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,220
Go get the best medicine.

58
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,459
Yes.

59
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,260
Go get a doctor.

60
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,899
Okay.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Go.

62
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,160
Master! Master!

63
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,920
I can't even feed him the medicine.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,550
Feed it again.

65
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,460
No matter what, you have to feed him the medicine.

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,530
Yes, Master.

67
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,460
Master.

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,290
Why are you back again?

69
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,630
The bride's mother is here.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
Madam, you are...

71
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,659
Please come in.

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,780
-Please. Please.
-Don't bother.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,550
Have a seat, please.

74
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,190
Please have a seat.

75
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,170
I've seen

76
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,480
what happened in your mansion.

77
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,070
Chun Wu's illness

78
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,800
is getting worse.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,690
In my opinion,

80
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,790
their wedding...

81
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,930
should be one day earlier.

82
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
You're a sensible person.

83
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,460
Well,

84
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,120
in your opinion,

85
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,490
when is the right time?

86
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,710
How about tomorrow morning?

87
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,340
Let's do it as you said.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,170
Let's do it as you said.

89
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,770
We'll get everything ready.

90
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,450
We'll get everything we need.

91
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,590
We'll welcome Miss Wei Zhi

92
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,760
in a grand manner.

93
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,480
I'll leave you to it.

94
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,760
Goodbye.

95
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,460
Send her off.

96
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,820
Yes.

97
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
See her off.

98
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,840
This way, please.

99
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,760
Master.

100
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,830
Master!

101
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,290
Young Master Chun Wu...

102
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,210
He passed away.

103
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,980
Master.

104
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,330
How did you get in?

105
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,420
Did you steal the key?

106
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,500
Sister, mom is going out.

107
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,690
Hurry up and run away.

108
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,090
I don't want to see you

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,750
be forced to do what you hate.

110
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,680
I don't want you to be unhappy.

111
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,030
My dear Ye.

112
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Tell mom that

113
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,890
I forced you to do this.

114
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,110
Don't get yourself involved again.

115
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Don't forget that.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,240
Why don't we send someone to the Wei family

117
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,620
to get the betrothal gifts back?

118
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,450
Even if they can return half of it.

119
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,320
The money for the wedding

120
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,270
is just spent,

121
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,900
but we have to hold a funeral now.

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,080
The betrothal gifts to the Wei family

123
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,159
were given too hastily.

124
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,590
We weren't thoughtful enough.

125
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,680
We agreed to bring good luck by the wedding.

126
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,440
Why did you pass away

127
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,170
at this time?

128
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,380
Master,

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,260
someone wants to meet you outside.

130
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,180
She said she can solve the problem of the Chun family.

131
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,310
Who is it?

132
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,320
She doesn't want to tell her name.

133
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,800
She looks powerful.

134
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,340
Madam.

135
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,240
May I know which noble family you are from?

136
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,020
Why do you want to see me?

137
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,050
It doesn't matter who I am.

138
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,570
What matters is

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,850
I know what happened to the Chun family.

140
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,320
You must be in a difficult position.

141
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,190
You don't want to lose both dignity

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,380
and money.

143
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,110
It happened suddenly.

144
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,200
We really haven't

145
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,510
come up with a solution.

146
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,520
What solution do you have?

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,070
Although the groom is dead,

148
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,620
the contract is still there.

149
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,420
Your family

150
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,330
can still marry the bride.

151
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,420
You mean...

152
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,890
No, no.

153
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,500
After all, it's a life.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,530
If the Wei family goes to the county government and report it to the government...

155
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
Don't worry about that.

156
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,700
I've arranged everything.

157
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,130
Just do as I say.

158
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,670
Well...

159
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,450
So many dowries,

160
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,390
as well as the money and title deed...

161
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,010
If you fail to get all of these,

162
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm afraid

163
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,730
it'll be hard to explain to your clan.

164
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,420
May I know

165
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,880
why you want to help me?

166
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,050
We just get what we need.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Let's go.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,580
Ming Lang.

169
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,890
Ming Lang.

170
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,340
Ming Lang.

171
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,919
Ming Lang.

172
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,030
Ming Lang.

173
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,370
Wei Zhi.

174
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,539
What's the rush?

175
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,289
Brother Ming Lang.

176
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,049
You have to help me.

177
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,090
You must help me.

178
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,040
What's wrong with you?

179
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,190
Calm down.

180
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,950
My mother wants me to marry

181
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,810
that Chun Wu to bring him good luck.

182
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,610
But how can I

183
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,900
marry a living dead?

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,910
A living dead?

185
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,760
This...

186
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,500
It's the order of parents.

187
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,940
Marriage is vital. It is supposed to be arranged by matchmakers and parents.

188
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,190
As an outsider,

189
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
I can do nothing.

190
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,330
Since

191
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,680
we've known each other since childhood.

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,850
We were engaged

193
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,180
when we were kids.

194
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,920
Tell them

195
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,520
we were engaged.

196
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,690
So I don't have to marry him.

197
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,080
Wei Zhi.

198
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,260
Don't talk nonsense.

199
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm not.

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
Have you forgotten?

201
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,830
Wei Zhi!

202
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:16,840
Well...

203
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,600
Wei Zhi!

204
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,230
You damn girl.

205
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,720
How dare you

206
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,840
slander Brother Ming Lang?

207
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,210
Why don't look at yourself

208
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,500
in the mirror?

209
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,640
Brother Ming Lang was engaged to you?

210
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,810
How can you say

211
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,670
such shameless things?

212
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:31,820
I...

213
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,430
The engagement she said

214
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,800
is ridiculous.

215
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,760
Exactly.

216
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,800
Who would believe

217
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,740
what Wei Zhi said?

218
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,920
Really?

219
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,860
I don't know.

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,530
Ou Ya.

221
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,720
Ou Ya!

222
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Are you there?

223
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,990
Can you help me?

224
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,410
I'm warning you.

225
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,500
Stay away from Ou Ya.

226
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,810
If you dare to seduce him again,

227
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,840
I'll scratch your face

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,120
and make you die in a horrible way.

229
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,120
I don't understand.

230
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,000
Let me say it again.

231
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,640
If you try to seduce Ou Ya again,

232
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll scratch on your face

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,650
and make you die a horrible death.

234
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,130
Master.

235
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,650
Wei Zhi?

236
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,430
Master, please help me.

237
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,550
Helping you?

238
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,410
I don't want to marry a living dead.

239
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,350
And I don't want to live a lonely life.

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,130
I know I don't have the Immortal perception.

241
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,770
I don't deserve to learn immortal techniques.

242
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,040
I don't expect anything,

243
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,580
being the Phoenix or a fairy.

244
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,790
I just want to live.

245
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,020
Master,

246
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,620
could you please help me?

247
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,320
Even if you want me to stay here

248
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,420
for the rest of my life as a servant,

249
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,860
I won't complain.

250
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,840
I can't help you.

251
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,840
Why?

252
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,090
You are so powerful.

253
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,350
You're a superior master.

254
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,110
Everyone has his own fate.

255
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,660
We have to experience

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,360
the hardships of our own's.

257
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,250

I can't change it.

259
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,190
May I ask

260
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,160
if the the Natural Law

261
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,530
is ruthless?

262
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,630

384
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,020
Take her away.

385
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,500
Mother! Ye!

386
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,520
Let go of me!

387
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,250
Mother.

388
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,080
Ye!

389
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,210
Let go of me!

390
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,990
I'm wronged.

391
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,500
The Chun family will kill my daughter!

392
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,540

394
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,420
Guards, arrest her!

395
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,990
Take her away!

396
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,240
What are you doing?

397
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,250
Let go of me!

398

401
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,080
Let go!

404
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,550
Feng Zhi, don't be afraid.

405
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,210
Just be yourself.

406
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,700
Fire! Fire!

407
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,400
Fire!

408
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,640
The bride is still inside it.

409
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,720
Put out the fire!

410
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,370
Hurry up!

411
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,490
I've been waiting all day.

412
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,400
I finally got you.

413
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,460
Stop!

414
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,210
Don't worry, I won't eat you.

415
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,770
Wait for me.

416
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,890
Isn't this the one I love the most

417
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,090
in the three realms?

418
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,530
A luminous mushroom?

419
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,890
Looks like

420
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm lucky today.

421
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,620
My Lord,

422
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,950
try the new dish I cooked.

423
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,080
Actually this prison

424
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,070
can't lock you up.

425
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,160
Why did you come back?

426
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,720
Do you think I want to go back?

427
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,710
But if I run away,

428
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,960
they will be in trouble.

429
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,470
I don't want to implicate them.

430
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,770
So I came back to keep staying here.

431
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,640
I had no time to think about it before.

432
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,940
I didn't expect that

433
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,290
you made such a mess in our Demon Realm.

434
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,730
It's fragrance and the cooking smoke.

435
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,280
It's not the foul atmosphere.

436
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,050
Demon Realm

437
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,180
has its own rules.

438
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,760
If you want to have fun,

439
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,610
go back to your Heaven Realm.

440
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,350
Cold-faced Stone,

441
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,730
I think you're

442
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,180
a sharp-tongued but kind person.

443
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,220
I've been here for so long.

444
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,890
You've never really hurt me.

445
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,560
Why are you so serious?

446
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,770
Here.

447
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,010
Taste

448
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,230
the new ingredient I found.

449
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,510
I'm sure you'll like it.

450
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,870
Smile more.

451
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,260
Stop wearing that straight face.

452
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,230
Actually, if you smile,

453
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,980
you might look handsome.

454
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,870
Try it.

455
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,010
It's really delicious.

456
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,150
Get up if you're done.

457
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,710
Childish.

458
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,260
Master.

459
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,020
Thank you for saving my life.

460
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,900
You're welcome.

461
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,500
Who are you indeed?

462
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,650
Or...

463
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,770
you are not a human being?

464
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,000
You're not a demon anyway.

465
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,830
Of course, you're not a devil.

466
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,450
But you're quite mighty.

467
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,860
You'll know soon.

468
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,190
It turns out that everyone is the same.

469
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,300
We're all so tiny and weak.

470
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,840
This is amazing.

471
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,320
Do you know

472
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,010
who I am now?

473
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,630
Master, you are...

474
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,030
an immortal?

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,040
How old are you?

476
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,150
About

477
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,720
3,000 years old.

478
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
3,000 years old?

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,670
You look so young.

480
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,090
No mortal

481
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,420
dares to talk to me like this before.

482
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,360
I've never seen

483
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,570
such a beautiful scene.

484
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,530
No wonder all mortals want to cultivate and become immortals.

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,250
♫he branches' falling made a splash♫

486
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,790

ordinary mortals

488
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,280
will never see it.

489

♫There are too many memories♫

490
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,320
You're lucky.

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,890
♫It's hard to let go of it♫

492
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,030
♫Who answered every word?♫

493
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,190
I'm lucky?

494
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,670
♫I wander around to find him♫

495
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,290
Maybe I was lucky

496
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,660
when I was a kid.

497
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,390
♫It has been many years♫

498
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,040

♫Even if I will die and never come back♫

500
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,560
Everyone around me loved me.

♫I'll be with you forever♫

502
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,120
But because of me,

503
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,340
everything ruined.

504
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,240
♫The two parts that can't be cut♫

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,190
♫Tears wet the shore♫

506
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,420
After that,

507
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,880
♫If I can be with you for the rest of my life I wouldn't be parted with you♫

508

♫Only love never changes♫

512

That's why

513
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,950
wherever I go, people hate me.

514
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,380
♫The two parts that can't be cut♫

515

♫I can't see through the night♫

516
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,920
For us deities,

♫When the mountain turns grey♫

518
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,030

♫Can we be together?♫

520

♫I'm only afraid that your clothes are thin♫

522
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,990
♫You can't keep warm in the cold night♫

523
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,800
Just like the sun,

524
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,810
there're sunrise and sunset.

525
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,790
Sunset is short.

526
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,090
But sun shines the whole day.

527
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,100
So,

528
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,830
sufferings are only temporary.

529
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,560
What you said

530
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,080
is just comforting.

531
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,100
If you believe it,

532
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,460
it's not just comforting.

533
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,800
Master, you're going to keep me as a servant

534
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
at the academy?

535
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,980
The academy doesn't need a servant.

536
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,210
Then you're kicking me out?

537
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,280
But now,

538
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,370
I have nowhere to go.

539
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,230
Let me ask you.

540
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,170
Why did you come to the academy?

541
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,460
I want Dean to help me.

542
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,400
I don't want to see

543
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,670
those weird things anymore.

544
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,130
That's it?

545
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:07,810
Also,

546
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,410
I do want to learn real skills.

547
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
But you are not qualified.

548
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,960
Your immortal bones are ordinary.

549
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,850
It's impossible for you to become successful.

550
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,540
I've seen your fate.

551
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,310
You have a bad fate.

552
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,670
You may die

553
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,770
young.

554
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,400
Then why didn't I die today?

555
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,060
If I didn't die today,

556
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,610
that means the God doesn't want me to die.

557
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,570
I have to fight for my fate though.

558
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,030
I didn't teach you for nothing.

559
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,300
Wei Zhi.

560
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,570
Remember,

561
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,590
you are not a servant.

562
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,790
You're

00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,290

You can leave now.

Mother.

570
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,470

00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,500
Wei Zhi...

573
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,960
Don't worry.

574
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,550
Her master went to save her.

575
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,320
She's fine now.

576
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,560
Mother.

577
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,130
Sister is fine.

578
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,740
Madam.

579
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
What happened in Gucheng City

580
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,380
has past so many years.

581
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,510
It's time to let it go.

582
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,380
I almost caused a disaster this time.

583
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,950
It's all my fault.

584
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,330
But some things

585
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,120
can't be forgotten

586
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,450
as I wish.

587
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,830
Wei Zhi

588
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,770
has her own fate.

589
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,720
I'll let her go back to the academy

590
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,560
and leave it to fate.

591
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,170
Thank you

592
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,360
for your help.

593
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,220
In two days,

594
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,490
there'll be a mid-autumn examination at the academy.

595
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,070
Why don't you

596
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,160
go check it out in person?

597
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,780
No.

598
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,620
I'd better not go.

599
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,860
Well..

600
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,860
What happened to her?

601
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,730
She is a fairy from the Heaven Realm,

602
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,840
yet she ate food in the Demon Realm.

603
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,450
This is outrageous.

604
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,890
You mean she has got

605
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,770
the food poisoning?

606
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,570
Yes.

607
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,860
The luminou mushroom she just ate

608
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,550
is a rare delicacy in the Demon Realm.

609
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,730
But for the immortals,

610
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,100
it's extremely poisonous.

611
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,570
Now,

612
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,460
I'm afraid her life is at stake.

613
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,510
Is there any antidote?

614
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,690
This poison can only be detoxified by the Glimmering Ganoderma.

615
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,060
But it's extremely rare.

616
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,520
In our Demon Realm,

617
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,820
none has been found.

618
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,480
Where is it?

619
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,110
I'm afraid

620
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,670
the antidote

621
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,810
only exist in one place in this world.

622
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,900
[Zihua Book Pavilion]

623
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,920
My Lord.

624
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,930
Long time no see.

625
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,490
I want the Glimmering Ganoderma.

626
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,740
You haven't changed at all.

627
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,540
You always want the best.

628
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,850
It's extremely rare

629
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,130
in the three realms.

630
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,880
Please have some tea.

631
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,410
I'll take the money

632
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,820
your paid for the tea.

633
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,120
Your tea

634
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,610
is made from

635
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,870
the root of the Glimmering Ganoderma.

636
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,770
It can strengthen your body and prolong your life.

637
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,770
Ridiculous!

638
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,320
I am the supreme ruler of the Demon Clan.

639
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,910
I don't need your tea.

640
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,430
My Lord.

641
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,120
You've had the tea.

642
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,720
You...

643
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,330
Tell me.

644
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,880
What do I need to pay you

645
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,710
to buy your Glimmering Ganoderma?

646
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,550
I told you

647
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,630
that things here

648
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,250
can't be bought with money.

649
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,010
My Lord.

650
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,520
This is something

651
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,690
you are more than familiar with.

652
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,219
It is lifeless now.

653
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,030
Only your spiritual energy

654
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,659
can restore it.

655
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,820
You're so straightforward.

656
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,220
Please wait a moment.

657
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,630
Here's the Glimmering Ganoderma.

658
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,330
I want the Formula.

659
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,940
Make a condition.

660
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,610
I wonder why

661
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,230
you want this?

662
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,830
Just make a condition.

663
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
The Formula...

664
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,870
The use of it...

665
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,950
It's poison after all.

666
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,030
I want

667
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,750
the Formula!

668
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,400
The condition is

669
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,150
your smile.

670
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,100
My smile?

671
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,240
Yes.

672
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,750
As the supreme lord of the Demon Clan,

673
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm decisive.

674
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,790
I've never smiled.

675
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,310
I'll exchange my smile with you.

676
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,990
You don't want to smile now.

677
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,990
But from now on,

678
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,890
you're not able to smile.

679
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Cut the crap.

680
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,320
Just take it.

681
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,140
This Cold-faced Stone...

682
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,200
I didn't expect him to be the one who saved me.

683
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,790
I, Fairy Yi'er

684
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,990
never owe anyone anything.

685
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,990
I must repay him.

686
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,050
Aunt.

687
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,300
As long as it belongs to you,

688
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,440
I I must have it all.

689
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,170
Yi'er.

690
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,010
It seems that

691
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,020
I've indulged you too much.

692
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,500
Not only did you sneak to the Demon Realm,

693
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,100
but also manipulated the time without permission.

694
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:43,950
Aunt.

695
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,320
I know I was wrong.

696
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,210
Besides,

697
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,360
I just stop the time

698
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,260
for a short moment.

699
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,380
It's true.

700
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,340
You know

701
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,610
changing the law of time

702
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,840
will get the whole world be punished.

703
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,640
Our clan

704
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,140
has been manipulating the time

705
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,590
since the beginning of the three realms.

706
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,960
It's a huge responsibility.

707
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,240
We've been obeying the heavenly rules

708
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,900
and fulfil our duties.

709
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,240
You are grounded in the Heavenly Palace.

710
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,390
Don't go anywhere.

711
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,480
Reflect on yourself.

712
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,940
Aunt.

713
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,450
What should I do?
