196
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Looks like you've learned a lesson.

197
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,700
I don't need you

198
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,730
to surrender.

199
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,580
What I want

200
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,980
is your death.

201
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
A lowly slave

202
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,700
turned into

203
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,860
the reincarnated Phoenix.

204
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,740
Everything should've belonged to me.

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
I became the laughingstock

206
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
of the entire academy

207
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,300
and turned against my father

208
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,580
because of you.

209
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,300
Don't you deserve to die?

210
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,820
The things you're talking about

211
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,100
never belonged to you.

212
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,460
You have to walk on your own.

213
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,620
Master said

214
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,930
you should behave yourself.

215
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,500
You don't deserve to mention Master.

216
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Master is a deity from heaven.

217
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,820
I love him.

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,220
Only I deserve him.

219
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,860
You pestered him

220
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,340
and tempted him.

221
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,340
How dare you do that?

222
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,940
You don't have to

223
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,820
pester or tempt

224
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,180
to love someone.

225
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,420
Even the Formula

226
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,220
couldn't kill you.

227
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,100
Looks like

228
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,490
you're destined

229
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,820
to be killed by me.

230
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,580
Wei Zhi, go!

231
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I'll protect you.

232
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,580
Mother.

233
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
Mother!

234
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,610
You overestimated yourself.

235
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,790
[Peaceful Breeze]

236
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,580
Mother.

237
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,860
Mother.

238
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,100
Mother!

239
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,060
Go.

240
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,860
I'll protect you.

241
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,980
Mother.

242
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,580
Mother.

243
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,980
Mother!

244
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,460
Mother!

245
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,580
Mother!

246
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,580
You harmed others and yourself.

247
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,580
Wei Zhi.

248
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,100
You're such a jinx.

249
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,060
[Peaceful Breeze]

250
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,220
I never meant to hurt anyone.

251
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,180
But you've been forcing me.

252
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,340
You hurt my friends and my family.

253
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,170
All of you

254
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,580
deserve to die!

255
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,280
[Peaceful Breeze]

256
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,170
Retreat! Hurry! Retreat!

257
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,740
Black Phoenix?

258
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,860
Isn't the Phoenix dead?

259
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,740
Is the disaster of the Three Realms coming?

260
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,820
Why didn't you kill the Phoenix?

261
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,100
Why?

262
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,100
Phoenix's blood is activated again,

263
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,340
and it's going to disrupt the mortal world.

264
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,420
This is the result

265
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,500
of your mercy.

266
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,740
You should know

267
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,090
what the Phoenix brings to the mortal world

268
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
is killing,

269
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,000
blood,

270
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,420
and disruption of the Three Realms.

271
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,180
As the God of Red Sun,

272
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,980
you disregarded the safety of the Three Realms

273
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
for your personal feelings.

274
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,460
I'm so disappointed

275
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,340
in you.

276
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,580
I let you down.

277
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,140
I am willing

278
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,900
to be punished.

279
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,770
The God of Red Sun released the Phoenix privately.

280
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,540
Now he'll be deprived of his divine status

281
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,700
and will be punished by 99 thunderbolts.

282
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,420
I can't count on you.

283
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,460
My immortal body is getting old.

284
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,780
It'll be too late if I don't do anything now.

285
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,540
Mother.

286
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,890
Mother.

287
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,140
Mother.

288
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,660
Don't be afraid.

289
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,460
Go back to your room.

290
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,980
Sorry.

291
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm late.

292
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,980
Mu Nan.

293
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,380
I messed it up.

294
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I ruined everything.

295
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,140
I got my mother killed.

296
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,500
I didn't realize until now

297
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,660
that everything Mother did was for me.

298
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,260
I'm ominous.

299
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,260
I should have listened to my mother.

300
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,300
I shouldn't have gone

301
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,420
to the Egret Academy

302
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,610
and practiced magic.

303
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,660
If I had gotten married,

304
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,460
Mother wouldn't have died.

305
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
Those innocent people wouldn't have died.

306
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,740
Sister.

307
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,900
You did nothing wrong.

308
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,500
They are wrong.

309
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,180
Tell me what I should do.

310
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,380
My power is out of control now.

311
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,980
I can't even take revenge.

312
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,620
Sister.

313
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,980
Don't worry.

314
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,490
Let me see

315
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,780
what happened to you.

316
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,900
How could you

317
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
have his child?

318
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,260
It's said that Phoenix harms the Three Realms.

319
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
But what did she do wrong?

320
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Why does she have to

321
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,140
be bullied and betrayed?

322
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,500
My sister's spiritual power

323
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,700
will be gradually devoured by the child in her womb.

324
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,980
What should I do?

325
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,940
Since heaven and earth can't tolerate the Phoenix

326
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,620
and force her to fall,

327
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,420
I, Mu Nan,

328
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
will fall with her

329
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,900
and destroy

330
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,420
the cruel Three Realms.

331
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,860

333
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,020
Wei Zhi is in trouble.

334
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,220
Wait for me here.

335
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
I'll take a look.

336
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,980
Okay.

337
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,460
This is not good.

338
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,700

you're such a nice guy.

367

You must be joking.

The people are suffering.

369
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,070
How can I just stand by?

370
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,540
I didn't expect the Phoenix Fire

371
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,980
would be so dangerous.

372
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,420
If the fire continues,

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,940

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,140
and the people in the city

375
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,300
will be destroyed.

376
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,140
They're innocent.

377
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,860
Innocent?

378
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,420
Isn't Wei Zhi innocent?

379
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,700
The Heaven Realm wants her to die,

380
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,900
and the mortal world wants her to die.

381
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,300
Wei Zhi?

382
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,020
The fairy who practices the charm?

383
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,980
Fairy.

384
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,220
She is not a fairy.

385
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,460
She's the Phoenix.

386
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,980
Looks like fate is entangled.

387
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,700
Even deities

388
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,940
can't escape it

389
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,060
or cut it off.

390
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,220
You don't have to tell me this.

391
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,740
I just want to tell you,

392
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,540
as long as I'm alive,

393
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,370
no one can hurt her.

Zihua Book Pavilion

395
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,740
Why do you think I have a way?

396
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
If you don't,

397
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,700
I'm afraid Wei Zhi...

398
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,300
Her pain and despair

399
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,020
have stimulated her bloodline.

400
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,460
Don't worry.

401
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,980
Phoenix won't die.

402
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,700
But she'll fall

403
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,460
and turn into a monster.

404
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,540
Her anger will turn into Phoenix Fire

405
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,460
that burns the world

406
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,460
and destroy the Three Realms.

407
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,540
And now,

408
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,060
her malice

409
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,980
has started to devour

410
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,700
her soul.

411
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,300
Are you begging me?

412
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,460
Yes.

413
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,060
I'm begging you.

414
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,420
As long as Wei Zhi can regain sanity,

415
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,500
I'm willing to pay any price.

416
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,460
Even if you have to die?

417
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,460
Even if I die.

418
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,420
I thought the dishes here

419
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,980
were top-notch

420
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,220
in the Devil Realm.

421
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:06,940
But after trying

422
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,260
Miss Yi's cooking,

423
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,140
I realize

424
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,540
these are not even worth mentioning.

425
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,020
Yi Li,

426
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,620
that's too far.

427
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,020
I think the dishes here

428
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,970
are delicious.

429
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,860
You flattered it

430
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,300
too much.

431
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,860
Brother.

432
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,940
You're shameless.

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,860
Lan Su.

434
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,060
Where is Ou Ya?

435
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,020
Why isn't he here yet?

436
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,700
I don't know. I don't care.

437
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,460
Bad news.

438
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,980
Bad news.

439
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,900
Something happened.

440
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,980
Something happened

441
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,300
in the mortal world.

442
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,100
[Treasure House]

443
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Ma'am,

444
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,780
we really

445
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,660
need this jade.

446
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,740
We've made a price.

447
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,420
Is it okay or not?

448
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,620
Just tell me.

449
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,860
Ma'am,

450
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,260
we're friends.

451
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,860
Don't try to trick us.

452
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,300
Sorry, Your Highness.

453
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,380
I didn't mean that.

454
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,300
What do you mean then?

455
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,180
This thing

456
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
is just a decoration to you.

457
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,940
I know.

458
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,940
The Treasure Pavilion is not short of money.

459
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,220
You want spiritual power, right?

460
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,140
Tell me

461
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,860
how many years of magical prowess is required.

462
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,140
I'll get it for you.

463
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,780
Brother, shut up.

464
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,660
Ten times your power

Do you want to

467
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,780
become an old fox again?

468
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,980
It's not about money and power.

469

We value things.

You have to keep the priceless treasures.

471
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,140
It's easy to get priceless treasures

472
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,900
but rare to find a true lover.

473
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,860
Are you not willing to help us?

474
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,940
It's hard to prioritize cherishing things and people.

475
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,220
Please forgive me.

476
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm sorry.

Yes, I am.

Greetings, Devil King.

Good.

You've tried it, haven't you?

493

You have no conscience.

494
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,970

would you like

499
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,540
to make some good dishes

500
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,540

501
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,860
Of course.

502
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,180
Okay.

503
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,140
You look like a good girl.

504
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,140
Well,

505
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,860
take this as the deposit for your cooking.

506
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,900
How could you

507
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,140
just

508
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,220
give it to me?

509
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,300
This is

510

from your Heaven Realm.

511
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,140
It's not suitable

to keep it here.

00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,460
If it succeeds,

your kindness

So it's that simple.

00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,220
I see.

A little bit.

580
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,940
I think it's worth it.

581
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,980
Deal.

582
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,420
Ancient sages once said,

583
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,300
I nourished my noble spirit.

584
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,660
The noble spirit

585
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,300
means righteousness.

586
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,140
All disciples of Egret Academy,

587
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,420
we must maintain the noble spirit

588
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,620
and help each other.

589
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,500
We shall not give up on anyone.

590
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,740
This is my lesson

591
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,700
for you.

592
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,220
Dean.

593
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,300
What do you mean?

594
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,940
Dean.

595
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,220
Dean, aren't you going back to the academy?

596
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,700
The academy is not about the room,

597
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,770
nor me,

598
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,620
but

599
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,380
about your hearts.

600
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,220
Wei Zhi

601
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,220
is your classmate,

602
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,370
and a member of the academy.

603
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,180
Today,

604
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,500
she is in danger.

605
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,460
We can't give up on her.

606
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,460
Dean.

607
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,570
[Honest and Virtuous]

608
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,020
Goodbye, Dean.

609
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,860
Thank you.

610
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,550
[Honest and Virtuous]

611
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:52,020
[Peaceful Breeze]

612
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,740
I

613
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,580
am going now.

614
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,020
Goodbye.

615
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,460
I'll leave the rest

616
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,420
to you.

617
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,060
Wei Zhi.

618
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,140
Wei Zhi.

619
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,610
Come.

620
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,420
Hold my hand.

621
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,420
You've suffered.

622
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,740
But suffering

623
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,980
will eventually pass.

624
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,780
You've been a kind child

625
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,300
since young.

626
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,340
Remember your kindness.

627
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Remember,

628
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,740
in this world,

629
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,180
many people care about you.

630
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,900
You have to hang in there

631
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,020
for them.

632
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
Open your heart.

633
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,780
Let me help you.

634
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,180
I cultivate the noble spirit.

635
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,980
It's called Qi.

636
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,910
[Honest and Virtuous]

637
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,980
It's vast and magnificent.

638
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,740
Nourished with righteousness,

639
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,940
it'll be stuffed between heaven and earth.

640
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,300
It is Qi,

641
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,460
which must go together with virtue and morality.

642
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,380
Otherwise, it'll fail.

643
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,180
It's collected by continuous,

644
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,180
not occasional good deeds.

645
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,300
If you do something wrong,

646
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,140
it'll be discouraged.

647
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,540
Sister.

648
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,580
Are you feeling better?

649
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,980
For the past month,

650
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,860
you've been giving me magical prowess every day.

651
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,300
You must be tired.

652
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,740
More than that, I'm afraid it'll damage

653
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,820
your cultivation.

654
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,500
This is nothing,

655
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,580
as long as you can recover.

656
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,460
Don't lie to me.

657
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,620
What happened to me?

658
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,140
It's the baby in your womb.

659
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,740
What's wrong with the baby?

660
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,380
He has the blood of

661
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,900
both you and the God of Red Sun,

662
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,940
and all kinds of spiritual power

663
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
of human, fairy, devil and demon.

664
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,020
As he grows day by day

665
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,460
in your stomach,

666
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,780
he'll absorb all your power

667
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,620
and blood.

668
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,180
You can't maintain the balance

669
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,020
with your current state.

670
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,980
But sister,

671
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,810
take a rest.

672
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,460
I believe there will be a way.

673
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,380
I'm leaving.

674
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,420
Wait.

675
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,300
I have something to tell you.
