[Episode 35]

4
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,860
You

5
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,980
are worthless now.

6
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,700
From now on,

7
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,380
there is no more trace

8
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,060
or evidence that can stop me.

9
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,700
I am

10
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,780
Yan Yue.

11
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,100
Yan Yue.

12
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,850
What are you struggling for?

13
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,820
If you listened to me

14
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,100
and killed the Phoenix,

15
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,100
we wouldn't have

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
ended up like this.

17
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,820
I finally got the phoenix tail feather

18
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,380
after waiting for so many years.

19
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,260
The crisis of the Devil Clan

20
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,260
can finally be solved

21
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,490
this time.

22
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,380
Thanks to you.

23
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,580
Ou Ya.

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
You did a great job.

25
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,260
I didn't do anything.

26
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,579
It's because Wei Zhi

27
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,060
is a friend of Devil Realm.

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I heard

29
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,820
that Yan Yue ascended to the Heavenly Emperor

30
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,940
and brought Phoenix to the Heavenly Court.

31
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,540
Yes.

32
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,260
Wei Zhi gave the phoenix feather

33
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,980
to me before she left.

34
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,820
Keep an eye on the heavenly affairs.

35
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,380
If anything happens,

36
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,500
be alert.

37
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,100
What?

38
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,340
Did Your Majesty see anything wrong?

39
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,260
It's abnormal. Something must be wrong.

40
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,820
I've fought with

41
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,780
the Heavenly Court for tens of thousands of years.

42
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,980
It's necessary

43
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,660
to take precautions.

44
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,660
Yes.

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,860
So many delicacies.

46
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,340
I can't even

47
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,330
devote myself to cultivation.

48
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,220
Heavenly Emperor.

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,460
Yan Yue.

50
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,140
Why are you alone?

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,980
Where's Wei Zhi?

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
She's busy.

53
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,350
She's not coming.

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,950
I made

55
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,100
all these dishes

56
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,140
for you two.

57
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,540
If Wei Zhi is tired,

58
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,900
I can find a sedan chair

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,020
to take her here.

60
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,380
You don't

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,340
always have a chance

62
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,450
to taste Yi's dishes.

63
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,700
I said,

64
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,220
she's not coming.

65
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,100
That's it.

66
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,260
Then the three of us will enjoy it.

67
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,820
So what if he becomes the Heavenly Emperor?

68
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,260
He's so fierce.

69
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,340
Fried vegetables.

70
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,540
Dried bamboo.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,460
And the soup.

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,220
These are all your favorite dishes.

73
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,220
Although we're carrying on Inedia,

74
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,140
we have to

75
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,900
enjoy the delicacies.

76
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,140
Besides,

77
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,460
you haven't tried Yi'er's dishes

78
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,540
for a long time.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,010
You must miss it.

80
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,780
Try it.

81
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,140
How is it?

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,020
Is the soup special?

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,900
It's all right.

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,220
The ingredients of Heaven Realm

85
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,260
taste special.

86
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
What's wrong?

87
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,780
You were disturbed

88
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,340
when we were eating.

89
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,330
Nothing.

90
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,900
Is it because of Wei Zhi?

91
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,460
Since Wei Zhi went to heaven,

92
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,340
they've always been awkward.

93
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,900
I feel sad.

94
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
Yan Yue wants to rule the Three Realms.

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,700
He hopes Wei Zhi can support him

96
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,540
to recover the Demon Realm.

97
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,660
Wei Zhi doesn't agree with him.

98
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,780
One of them

99
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,460
stands for the Heaven Realm,

100
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,340
while the other the Demon Clan.

101
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,220
It's normal

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,220
to have different opinions.

103
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,580
Don't you think

104
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,100
Yan Yue is weird?

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,340
He is the Heavenly Emperor now.

106
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,140
His status is different.

107
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,900
What he does

108
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,660
may seem

109
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,980
a little strange.

110
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,700
You're right.

111
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,770
But...

112
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,660
But what?

113
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,460
Yan Luo,

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,650
you're late.

115
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,140
There are no leftovers.

116
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,260
I'm here to invite you

117
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,480
to visit Wei Zhi.

118
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,780
She's new to Heaven Realm.

119
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,220
She must be very uncomfortable.

120
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,900
We have a teacher-student relationship.

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,140
You know her well.

122
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,460
She'll feel better

123
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,700
if someone talks with her.

124
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,100
That's considerate of you.

125
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,100
Let's go together.

126
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,580
But

127
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,900
what were you talking about?

128
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,540
I made a bowl of soup

129
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,900
with the mustard in the Demon Realm for Yan Yue.

130
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,900
He drank it in Demon Realm

131
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,220
not long ago

132
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
and said it was delicious.

133
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,580
But just now,

134
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,020
he didn't recognize it.

135
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,140
He thought it was food from the Heaven Realm.

136
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,580
Really?

137
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,780
It seems

138
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,100
something is wrong.

139
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,780
I didn't expect

140
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,780
I can also use the Time Magic too

141
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,700
because of the power you gave me.

142
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,020
This is God's will

143
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,980
to make me complete

144
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,020
the immortal plan.

145
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,580
There's no room for discussion.

146
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,059
In order to kill the Phoenix,

147
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,059
you've lost your mind.

148
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,100
The Phoenix must die.

149
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,460
If she doesn't die,

150
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,820
how can I

151
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,980
gain immortality?

152
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,700
High Immortals?

153
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,100
They can only end up

154
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,180
with exhaustion

155
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,180
and death.

156
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,180
Your so-called desire to purify the Phoenix

157
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,100
is just a lie.

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,580
Your real purpose

159
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,340
is to imprison the Phoenix and steal her power.

160
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,060
You are High Immortal Xi Cai.

161
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,180
Don't forget your mission.

162
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,500
Only by killing the Phoenix

163
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,820
can the Three Realms be at peace.

164
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,460
Everything I did

165
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,340
is for the Three Realms.

166
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,580
I was about to succeed.

167
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,860
But

168
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,940
I failed because of you.

169
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
It's all your fault.

170
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,740
You still don't recognize your mistake?

171
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,500
You absorbed the Phoenix's power

172
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,460
and provoked her to harm the living.

173
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,740
You disregarded the people

174
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,450
for your selfish desire.

175
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,220
Historically, some people must be sacrificed

176
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
to achieve great things.

177
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,100
A nobody

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,060
is nothing to be regretted.

179
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
Do you deserve to be Heavenly Emperor?

180
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,830
Your lies

181
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,980
will soon spread throughout the Three Realms.

182
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,580
You don't have the chance.

183
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,850
Xi Cai.

184
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,980
Only the High Immortal's primordial spirit

185
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,050
can create the strongest formation

186
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,420
and repair the Heaven-Demon barrier.

187
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,580
So,

188
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,700
don't blame me.

189
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,340
Blame the Phoenix for killing you.

190
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,500
Xi Cai.

191
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,580
I will tell the Three Realms

192
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,180
that the Phoenix broke the barrier

193
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,060
and caused misery to the people.

194
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,100
And High Immortal Xi Cai

195
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,580
killed the Phoenix and lost all her cultivation

196
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,340
to repair the barrier.

197
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,940
Your name will be known forever.

198
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,820
You've made it this far.

199
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,100
You're indeed the Crown Prince I've chosen.

200
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,940
If you hadn't

201
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,420
stopped me all the time,

202
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,460
I guess I'd have finished

203
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,820
what I need to do.

204
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,340
You've lingered out.

205
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
But how long can you last?

206
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,340
I won't give up.

207
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,180
You don't have to entice me.

208
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,700
Stop here.

209
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,700
Look

210
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,300
what I found for you.

211
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,700
The fragment of my mother's primordial spirit.

212
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,740
Xi Cai.

213
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,580
Back then,

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,980
you solved the crisis of the Three Realms.

215
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,020
Now,

216
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,920
you helped me succeed.

217
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,980
I'm starting to

218
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,310
miss you.

219
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,470
Wei Zhi.

220
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,700
Why are you here?

221
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,180
We're worried about you,

222
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
so we came here together.

223
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,220
What do you think?

224
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,580
The Heaven Realm is boring, right?

225
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,980
So now you know

226
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,980
why I always go to the mortal world

227
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,300
and the Demon Realm, right?

228
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,290
I have nothing to give you.

229
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,300
These talismans have their purpose.

230
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,620
You can use them

231
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,220
or try to figure out rune techniques.

232
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,460
You won't think too much

233
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,700
if you have something to do.

234
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Thank you.

235
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,460
Even you believe

236
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm thinking too much.

237
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,100
Yan Yue's recent opinions

238
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,100
of the Three Realms

239
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,580
has drastically changed.

240
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,580
I can't understand

241
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,940
that a person

242
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,220
will become another person overnight.

243
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,620
Maybe

244
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,220
he is too sad

245
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,500
or has a big burden on his shoulders.

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,460
So,

247
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,700
his temperament has changed.

248
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Will anyone experience a temperament change

249
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,300
after becoming the Heavenly Emperor?

250
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,060
He's more and more

251
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
similar to

252
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,420
the late Heavenly Emperor.

253
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,220
May I ask

254
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
if there is any magic in the Heaven Realm

255
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,570
that can change one's temperament?

256
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,860
No.

257
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,220
What about controlling one's mind?

258
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,820
Wei Zhi.

259
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,980
You think too much.

260
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,940
It's an extremely evil forbidden technique

261
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,100
in the Three Realms,

262
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,620
or any place.

263
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,940
High Immortals

264
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,740
that cultivate pure powers

265
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,060
will never use it.

266
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,860
I was wrong.

267
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,220
It doesn't matter.

268
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,980
We just want to help him.

269
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
There are many things

270
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,100
about the enthronement ceremony

271
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,300
for him to decide.

272
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,700
I can talk to him.

273
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,580
Leave it to me.

274
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,340
Yes, Wei Zhi, don't worry.

275
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:26,980
You two

276
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,100
are finally together.

277
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,580
Heavenly Empress Dowager is right.

278
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,340
You're a family.

279
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,820
You can sit down and talk.

280
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,220
High Immortal Xi Cai,

281
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,700
you're Yan Yue's biological mother.

282
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,860
Can you tell me

283
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,460
what happened?

284
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Why is Yan Yue so strange?

285
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,500
Why is the person I love

286
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,220
drifting away from me again?

287
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,740
Is this fate again?

288
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,340
I don't want to accept it.

289
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,300
But it's killing me

290
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,740
step by step.

291
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,460
High Immortal Xi Cai.

292
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,500
Are the God of the Red Sun and Phoenix

293
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,980
not destined to be together?

294
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,700
Can love

295
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,120
compete with fate?

296
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,340
Are you satisfied

297
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,860
with the succession ceremony?

298
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,580
Not bad.

299
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,060
You've worked hard.

300
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,180
It's my duty.

301
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,380
I should share your burden.

302
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,740
One more thing.

303
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,420
Father passed away.

304
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,980
Mother is heartbroken.

305
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,900
She wants to go to the Ice Kiln to worship.

306
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,859
I've told you before.

307
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,940
No one can disturb

308
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,220
Father's rest.

309
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,260
But this is not appropriate.

310
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,690
Father is so distinguished.

311
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,540
But his funeral is so hasty.

312
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm afraid people in the Three Realms

313
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,740
will talk about it.

314
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,500
As long as I say it's okay.

315
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,890
Before the succession ceremony,

316
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,700
I have something important

317
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,380
to do.

318
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,020
Don't mind these trivial matters.

319
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,540
You think this is a trivial matter?

320
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,700
Besides unifying the Three Realms,

321
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
nothing else

322
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,860
matters.

323
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,380
The unification of the Three Realms?

324
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,260
Yan Yue.

325
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,980
Do you think so?

326
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,220
Or did Father tell you his last wish

327
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
before he died?

328
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,300
Is there any difference?

329
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,780
Isn't the unification

330
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,890
of the Three Realms

331
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,980
what the Heavenly Emperor should do?

332
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,500
Yan Yue.

333
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,500
The Three Realms could have followed their path

334
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,460
and live in peace.

335
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,900
But the unification of the Three Realms

336
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,930
will cause a war

337
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,860
and trouble instead.

338
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,940
But it's different now.

339
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Wei Zhi is the Saintess of the Demon Realm.

340
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,220
The demon clan will surrender

341
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,420
with her order.

342
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,620
But will Wei Zhi agree?

343
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,140
Will the Demon Realm agree?

344
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,300
Since she wants to be Heavenly Empress,

345
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,700
she should prioritize the interests of the Heaven Realm.

346
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,900
Besides, you are her teacher.

347
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,380
You can help me

348
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,980
persuade her.

349
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,220
I can't persuade her.

350
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,940
You should know Wei Zhi better than I do.

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,620
She came to the Heaven Realm just for you.

352
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,220
But as the Saintess of Demon Realm,

353
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,980
she'll never agree with

354
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
the unification of the Three Realms.

355
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,500
You two should be united.

356
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Do you want to conflict

357
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,780
because of this?

358
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,460
If there's nothing else,

359
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,980
I'll get going.

360
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,020
What happened to your hand?

361
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,660
I accidentally scratched my hand

362
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,260
when practicing sword the other day.

363
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,970
That scratch

364
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,220
was obviously caused by the Chixiao Sword.

365
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,700
But the Chixiao Sword has a natural spirit.

366
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,980
It won't hurt his master.

367
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,700
May I ask

368
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,740
if there is any magic in Heaven Realm

369
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,690
that can change one's temperament?

370
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,140
No.

371
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,480
What about controlling one's mind?

372
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,900
You are not Yan Yue.

373
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,460
Who are you?

374
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,540
When did you

375
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,500
suspect me?

376
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,460
Father.

377
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,510
You finally recognized me.

378
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,900
I am

379
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,140
the owner of this body now.

380
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,620
Walk-in?

381
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,780
I can't believe it's the forbidden trick Walk-in.

382
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,980
Where is Yan Yue?

383
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,020
Where is he?

384
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,540
His primordial spirit

385
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,940
has been suppressed by me.

386
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,180
Message talisman?

387
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,700
Why did you do that?

388
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,770
My body

389
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,900
has completely decayed.

390
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,700
It's irreversible.

391
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,210
This is

392
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,430
the only thing I can do.

393
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,260
Taking someone else's body

394
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,620
is the first unforgivable crime in the Heaven Realm.

395
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,500
You've fallen into a demon.

396
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,940
You are the Heavenly Emperor who protects the Heavenly Principle.

397
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,860
Why did you use

398
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
such evil magic

399
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,460
to take away your own son's body?

400
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,740
Because all of this

401
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
was destroyed by the Phoenix.

402
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,220
Yan Yue was trapped in love.

403
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,020
He couldn't kill the Phoenix

404
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,860
nor could he protect

405
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,300
the peace of Heaven Realm.

406
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,220
So I should

407
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,460
handle all these.

408
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,060
The Three Realms are peaceful.

409
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,620
Yan Yue and Wei Zhi

410
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,660
have agreed to live in the Demon Realm.

411
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,900
I don't understand

412
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,780
what the Phoenix has done wrong,

413
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,860
that you have to

414
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,300
kill her.

415
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,020
And Yan Yue.

416
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,140
He is your son!

417
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,980
A vicious tiger won't eat its son!

418
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,940
Yan Luo!

419
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,980
You are also my son.

420
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,980
Do you want to

421
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,500
watch your father

422
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,740
die like this?

423
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Wei Zhi?

424
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,980
Wei Zhi must be going to Yan Luo

425
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,380
for rune techniques.

426
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,980
Does she have to work so hard?

427
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,460
Boring.

428
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,100
Father.

429
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,690
Leave

430
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,740
Yan Yue's body.

431
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,460
Don't make more mistakes.

432
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,460
Although your body has decayed,

433
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,900
we can find a way together.

434
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,460
It might not be a dead end.

435
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,980
Is there any way?

436
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,730
Wei Zhi.

437
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,180
Where are you going?

438
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
You are not Yan Yue.

439
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,660
What are you talking about?

440
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,970
Come back with me.

441
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,460
Stop being willful.

442
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,460
Lord Rain.

443
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,610
Lord Rain.

444
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,780
Your Majesty.

445
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,980
I have something important to…

446
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,980
Lord Rain.

447
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,790
[Zihua Book Pivillion]

448
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,980
Mr. Mu.

449
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,980
Why did you save me?

450
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,940
I don't want to see

451
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,420
the Phoenix, the fool saved with his life,

452
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,620
die in vain.

453
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,980
Old Dean,

454
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,460
why is Zihua Book Pavilion

455
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,780
here?

456
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,540
Zihua Book Pavilion

457
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,420
has never been fixed.

458
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,700
It always appears

459
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,900
when people need it.

460
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,140
This time is no exception.

461
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,980
Mr. Mu,

462
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,220
if someone

463
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,900
you trust the most

464
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,460
and are most familiar with

465
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,260
turns into someone you don't know

466
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,620
one day,

467
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,980
and you don't even think

468
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,140
he is

469
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,260
who he used to be,

470
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,860
but there's no evidence to prove it,

471
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,980
what would you do?

472
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,420
In the Three Realms,

473
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,460
there is indeed a forbidden technique.

474
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,420
It's powerful and dark,

475
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,980
secret and scary.

476
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,420
Most of

477
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,900
the forbidden techniques

478
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,860
hide in the Heavenly Court.

479
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,180
The power of the forbidden techniques

480
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,660
comes from their inner desires.

481
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,780
The deeper the obsession of the caster,

482
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,660
the stronger the magic is.

483
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,620
Although

484
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,380
Zihua Book Pavilion

485
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,500
has traded so many

486
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,900
souls and desires,

487
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,700
fundamentally,

488
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,060
I just

489
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,260
want

490
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,420
to understand them.

491
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,420
Unfortunately,

492
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,420
the desire is not extinguished.

493
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,220
Your problem

494
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,700
won't be solved.

495
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,740
In other words,

496
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,700
even you can't do anything.

497
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,220
I have no choice.

498
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,780
But maybe

499
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,780
you do.

500
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,780
Me?

501
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,460
Huarong.

502
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,460
Huarong?

503
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,540
Yes.

504
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Huarong is the purest and kindest

505
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,500
in the Three Realms.

506
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,260
Only it

507
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,180
can break free from evil,

508
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,900
and regain authenticity.

509
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,700
Mr. Mu.

510
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,060
What happened?

511
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,220
I didn't choose

512
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,540
to make a deal with you

513
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,460
and broke the rules here.

514
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,060
This place will collapse.

515
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,740
From now on,

516
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,660
there will be no Zihua Book Pavilion in the Three Realms.

517
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,380
Wait.

518
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,300
Why won't my son kick me?

519
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
What son?

520
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,220
Watch out.

521
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,700
Can't it be a girl?

522
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Besides, it's only been a while.

523
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,940
It'd be strange if you could tell.

524
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,060
Su,

525
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,540
the phoenix tail feather

526
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,980
is so magical.

527
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,020
The demon's curse was just broken.

528
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,620
Now we have a child.

529
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,860
Yes.

530
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm going to be a mother.

531
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,980
First of all,

532
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,220
I've made up my mind.

533
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,020
One child

534
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,700
is not enough for us.

535
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,700
We have to have two babies.

536
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,460
Not even two.

537
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,660
Not even three.

538
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,500
We're going to have four children.

539
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,460
Go away.

540
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,940
-You can give birth yourself. -Watch out.

541
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,420
All right.

542
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,220
But

543
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,140
I wonder

544
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,220
how Wei Zhi is now,

545
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,700
if she's used to staying in the Heavenly Court.

546
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,220
Don't worry.

547
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,180
Yan Yue

548
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,300
doesn't dare bully her.

549
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,060
Don't worry.

550
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,780
Someone was

551
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,060
so suspicious

552
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,220
and worried

553
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,900
when Wei Zhi left.

554
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,420
Have you forgotten?

555
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,300
I...

556
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,700
I was just worried.

557
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,620
Right?

558
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Besides,

559
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,540
the Devil King said

560
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,900
we should take precautions

561
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,460
and worry about the change.

562
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,180
Look at the situation.

563
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,490
How can it change?

564
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,700
Evil.

565
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,460
It's time

566
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,260
to kill you.

567
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,260
Phoenix egg?

568
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,850
Phoenix egg?

569
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,140
Yan Yue!

570
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,710
Why are you here?

571
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,790
Su!

572
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,640
Su.

573
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
Su.

574
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,700
Su.

575
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,910
Su!

576
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,690
Su.

577
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,910
Su.

578
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,270
Su.

579
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,740
Lan Su.

580
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,110
You're finally here.

581
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,220
If you were a little late,

582
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,710
I might not be able to see you.

583
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,460
Why did this happen?

584
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,940
Who did this?

585
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,620
Yan Yue.

586
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,850
He wants to do something to the Phoenix egg.

587
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,260
What happened?

588
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,540
Why did he go crazy?

589
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,460
It's like a nightmare.

590
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,250
Su.

591
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,180
Yan Luo is dead.

592
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,380
Yan Yue chased me back.

593
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
No.

594
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,540
It shouldn't be Yan Yue.

595
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,260
Not Yan Yue?

596
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,380
Who else could it be?

597
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,140
Lan Su is pregnant.

598
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,460
We finally have a baby.

599
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,300
Now...

600
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,460
There's nothing now!

601
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,950
Nothing.

602
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,500
Everything is so strange.

603
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,140
It happened so suddenly. I...

604
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,420
I have no idea.

605
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,670
Wei Zhi.

606
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,950
Don't worry.

607
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,350
The Phoenix egg is fine.

608
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,810
Ou Ya.

609
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,070
I'm here.

610
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,460
Lan Su.

611
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,380
The Phoenix is our savior.

612
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,460
Promise me

613
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
to always stand by Wei Zhi's side.

614
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,500
I promise you.

615
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,140
Lan Su, I promise you.

616
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,420
Am I still beautiful?

617
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,220
Yes.

618
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,980
Beautiful.

619
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,180
You are the most beautiful girl

620
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,620
in the Devil Clan,

621
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,460
and my most beautiful wife.

622
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
You're still so sweet.

623
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,660
What a pity.

624
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,020
I can't be with you anymore.

625
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,220
No.

626
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,610
Don't forget me.

627
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,940
I promise you, Su.

628
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,700
You must keep me

629
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,540
in your heart.

630
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,300
I promise you.

631
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,900
But I'm still worried about you.

632
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,460
You've always been clumsy.

633
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,780
You can

634
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,929
find another partner.

635
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,659
No.

636
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,810
And have a bunch of wolves.

637
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,060
But I'm afraid you won't have the luck

638
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,020
to find someone

639
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,300
as beautiful as me.

640
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,860
Su.

641
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,820
Su.

642
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,610
Wei Zhi.

643
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,060
I'm here.

644
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,580
He listens to you.

645
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
Talk to him.

646
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,780
Su.

647
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,060
Su!

648
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,780
Su.

649
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,900
Su.

650
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,660
Su.

651
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,980
Wei Zhi killed Yan Luo

652
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
and fled back to Demon Realm?

653
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,460
I never thought

654
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,620
this would happen

655
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,980
after I took Wei Zhi to the Heavenly Court.

656
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,940
I can't believe

657
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,300
Wei Zhi would do

658
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,940
such a thing.

659
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,570
Yan Yue.

660
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,740
Do you have evidence?

661
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,820
When I arrived,

662
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,820
Yan Luo was dead.

663
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,780
Wei Zhi was the only one beside him.

664
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,860
Isn't this

665
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,580
the evidence?

666
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,620
Mother.

667
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,060
You don't trust me?

668
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,260
I'm heartbroken,

669
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,940
but we can't

670
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,460
hurt the innocent.

671
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,500
Wei Zhi is the last one

672
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,460
in the Three Realms

673
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,540
I think is the murderer.

674
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,500
I went after her

675
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,460
for an explanation.

676
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,100
But she ran back to Demon Realm

677
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,300
and never responded to me.

678
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
And...

679
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
And

680
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,540
she attacked me.

681
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,510
But why did she do that?

682
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,730
Yan Luo had no grudge against her.

683
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,890
Maybe

684
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,980
she doesn't want me to ascend the throne

685
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,870
and oppose the Heaven Realm to control the Demon Realm.

686
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,460
I asked Yan Luo

687
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,740
to persuade her for me.

688
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,940
I never expected

689
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,780
this would happen.

690
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,020
Are

691
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,660
all

692
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,170
the demons

693
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,180
like this?

694
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,380
Aunt.

695
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,420
I also...

696
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,340
I also saw Wei Zhi

697
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,580
going to Yan Luo's place.

698
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,300
Really?

699
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,600
I saw Wei Zhi going into Yan Luo's place

700
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,060
on my way to find her.

701
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
But I don't think

702
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,740
she's that kind of person.

703
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,860
Aunt.

704
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,180
Aunt.

705
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,420
In that case,

706
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,180
send my order

707
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,660
to bring Wei Zhi to the Heavenly Court

708
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,140
and let her tell the truth.

709
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,460
Mother, don't worry.

710
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,260
I will never be biased.

711
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,950
I will avenge

712
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,830
Yan Luo.
