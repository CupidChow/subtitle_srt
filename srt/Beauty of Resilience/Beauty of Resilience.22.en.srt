for so many years.

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm not afraid of this level of torture.

General, you've dedicated your whole life

to fighting for the country.

24
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,100
But in the end,

25
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,780
you are treated like this.

26
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,580

I believe Marshal will find out the truth.

41
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,820
At this point,

42
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,580
you still believe in Sima Jin?

43
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,460
Look at your injuries.

44
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,580
They were caused by Sima Jin's order, right?

45
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,220
This is the crime of attempted murder of Marshal.

46
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,460
They won't risk letting go of the true culprit

47

even if they have to kill the wrong person.

48

General Cao,

49
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,100
you are a smart man.

50
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,220
Why don't you switch sides

51
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,980
and give yourself a chance

52
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,100

56

and put you in a false charge,

57

why don't we just go all out

58

59
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,380
Nonsense!

No way!

Not a chance even if you kill me!

65
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,580
I know you would rather die than surrender.

66
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,140
But General,

67
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,340
have you thought about this?

68
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
If you die

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,260
in the prison in Gu City,

70
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,460
then you'll be deemed as

72
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,250
After you die,

74

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,540
Also, your family,

77

78
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,460

I didn't poison the wine.

127
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,220
I didn't collude with the enemy, either.

No reason.

131

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,460
How are you?

198
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,420
Thank you for your concern.

199
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm much better now.

200
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,100
You saved Wangyue.

201
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,980
The Sima family should thank you.

202
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,860
Well,

203
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,220
you've taken your revenge

204
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,420
and now you're awake.

205
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,740
You don't have anything to worry about. Just rest.

206
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,420
Yes.

207
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,220
Chen Yan.

208
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,340
Yes.

209
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
You made another great contribution.

210
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,500
I now promote you to be

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,220
the battalion commander of the Outpost Battalion.

212
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,220
Battalion commander!

213
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,500
Great!

214
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,860
That's great.

215
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,460
Yes.

216
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,740
Marshal, thank you for your promotion.

217
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,220
You're promoted.

218
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,460
But why do you still look

219
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,980
gloomy?

220
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,820
I just...

221
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,460
Just what?

222
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,620
I've been practicing martial arts since I was little

223
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,100
so that I can serve the country.

224
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,820
But I didn't expect to use the martial arts

225
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,340
on my own general.

226
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
So,

227
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,820
although I just got promoted,

228
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,460
I feel

229
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,620
a little sad.

230
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,700
Chen Yan,

231
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,420
you have

232
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,100
great potential.

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,460
In the future,

234
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,290
you'll achieve big things.

235
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,970
But remember,

236
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,220
once your enemy,

237
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,330
always your enemy.

238
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,100
Don't ever

239
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,420
be merciful

240
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,820
to your enemy.

241
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,220
Understand?

242
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,620
Yes.

243
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,230
[Wei]

244
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,850
Father.

245
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
You want to see me?

246
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,980
Tomorrow morning,

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,980
go back to Outpost Battalion

248
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,100
with your soldiers

249
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,100
and continue to perform your duty.

250
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,460
Yes.

251
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,740
Anything else?

252
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,700
About General Cao...

253
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,340
No one would have known

254
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,150
that your years long

255
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,500
right-hand man

256
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,460
would betray us.

257
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,100
Father, don't dwell on it.

258
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,060
People are unpredictable.

259
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,620
This is

260
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,220
a ready-made lesson.

261
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,340
Remember,

262
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,620
when you are in a high position,

263
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,860
you should be careful

264
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,030
with the people around you,

265
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,580
especially those who are closest to you

266
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,640
and you trust the most.

267
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,220
You have to be extra wary.

268
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,450
Once your enemy,

269
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,580
always your enemy.

270
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,300
Don't ever

271
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,700
be merciful

272
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
to your enemy.

273
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,500
Enemies are always enemies.

274
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,170
Never show mercy

275
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,180
when facing your enemies.

276
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,920
[Jing]

277
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,340
Kill!

278
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,180
[Jing]

279
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,420
My enemies

280
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,300
are just

281
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,210
ordinary people

282
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,140
who are trying to protect their families.

283
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,300
What did they do wrong?

284
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,820
Why do we

285
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,050
have to have wars?

286
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,020
Mu Nan.

287
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,730
If it weren't for the dish,

288
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,940
you wouldn't have come out, right?

289
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,140
Tell me.

290
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,540
What are you doing?

291
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,610
You've been avoiding me for days.

292
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,020
Nothing.

293
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,660
Nothing?

294
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,900
You aren't going to tell me the truth?

295
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,420
What happened?

296
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,460
I...

297
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,740
Do you remember

298
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,220
what I told you before?

299
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,660
What?

300
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,460
The thing I said to you

301
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,700
when I thought I was dying.

302
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,970
The happiest thing

303
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,170
in one's life

304
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,180
is not to be super rich,

305
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,900
or to get fame and fortune.

306
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,140
It's when you're dying,

307
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,410
the person you love the most

308
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,060
is still by your side.

309
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,300
Do you really remember?

310
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,300
Speaking of which,

311
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,900
you drank the poisonous wine for me

312
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,980
and almost died.

313
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,380
If you died,

314
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,460
I would be guilty

315
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,700
for the rest of my life.

316
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
For you,

317
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,770
even if I die,

318
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,500
I have no regrets.

319
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Don't talk nonsense.

320
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,540
I mean it.

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,140
I know.

322
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,780
Actually, that day, when you were poisoned,

323
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,660
I made a vow.

324
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,220
If you could pull through this time,

325
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,900
I'd ask my father to include you into the family tree.

326
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,460
From now on,

327
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,300
you are Sima Munan.

328
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,620
We can

329
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,460
win glory

330
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,540
together with Father.

331
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,540
I'll ask Mother to find you

332
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,020
a good wife in the future.

333
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Wangyue, stop it.

334
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,220
I

335
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:32,940
can only be

336
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,300
your younger brother.

337
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,420
What's wrong with you?

338
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,060
You want to be my elder brother

339
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,220
just because you saved my life?

340
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,700
Even if my surname is not Sima,

341
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,780
I will always treat you

342
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,060
as my only family.

343
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,540
Then let's be the closet family

344
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,700
for the rest of our lives.

345
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,980
What do you think?

346
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,300
All right.

347
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
It's settled.

348
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,660
Eat.

349
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,700
Okay.

350
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,300
Marshal.

351
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,660
How is the screening

352
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,940
of Jinghe's scouts?

353
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,180
Several points of contact

354
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,540
of Jinghe's scouts were destroyed.

355
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,860
But we only caught some small fry.

356
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,020
These scouts are all tough guys.

357
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,380
They either killed themselves by biting off their tongues

358
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,660
or refused to confess

359
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,460
after being tortured.

360
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,900
We still have no clue

361
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,220
to their core members.

362
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,220
After the battle at Black Wind Castle,

363
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,620
the war is inevitable.

364
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,620
At this time,

365
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,220
we need to tighten up on screening.

366
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,740
Don't let any suspicious person go.

367
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,300
Yes.

368
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,460
Come on, cheers.

369
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,260
Come on.

370
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,180
Let's play.

371
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,500
Finger-guessing! Finger-guessing!

372
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,180
What are you doing?

373
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,980
Commander,

374
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,220
it's not appropriate for you

375
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,780
to come to our barracks like this.

376
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,660
Why?

377
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,380
There's nothing I haven't seen.

378
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,460
Where is Chen Yan?

379
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,380
Are you looking for me?

380
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,380
What's the matter?

381
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
Let's talk outside.

382
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,060
Why do you need to talk outside?

383
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,300
Stop whooping.

384
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,620
What are they talking about?

385
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,140
Let's hear it.

386
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,940
Let's see if we can hear what they are talking about.

387
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,380
Let me...

388
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,660
What's wrong?

389
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,500
I need your help.

390
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,540

393
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,660
What did they say?

394
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,860
I heard that

Thank you for coming with me.

400

You're welcome.

401
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,460
I didn't expect

402

403
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,740
to do this.

404
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,980
Even though he made huge mistakes,

405
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,450
General Cao was a man with military merits.

406
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,300
He should

407
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,260
be buried properly.

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,660
My father kept telling me

409
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,900
there was a General Cao in Gu City

410
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,700
who had been on the battlefield with him for many years.

411
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,170
They were like brothers.

412
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,060
Although he was not great

413
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,180
as my father described,

414
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,210
I respected him.

415
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,860
So tell me,

416
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,180
why?

417
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
What do you mean why?

418
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,460
That's who he was.

419
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,180
How did he betray us?

420
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,860
Did loyalty and friendship

421
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,140
mean nothing to him?

422
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,460
Maybe

423
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,460
at that time,

424
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,740
he had

425
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,900
no other choice.

426
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,220

You're kind.

00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,820
no matter what.

781
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,820
Yes.

782
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,420
Let's go. Hurry up.

783
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,100
He was fine yesterday.

784
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,780
Why is he gone today?

785
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
I don't believe it.

786
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,060
I don't want to dig anymore.

787
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,820
Chen Yan!
