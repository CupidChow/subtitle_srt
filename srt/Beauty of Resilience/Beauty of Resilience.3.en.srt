That's from His Majesty.

I hope you can take it.

171
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,590
To be frank,

172
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,940
since Wei Zhi entered the academy,

173
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,990
our family's cottage

174

175
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,200

the marriage between our two families

177
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,350

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,480
The date of the wedding

189
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,950
should be brought forward

190
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,210
to relieve his sickness.

191
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,680
I've heard of your skillfulness.

192
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,770
You're also a good manager

193
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,630
of the household.

194
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,740
Our family has a small workshop

195
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,370
in the downtown area of Nancheng.

196
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,250
As long as Wei Zhi marries here,

197
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,960
I'll leave the workshop

198
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,630
to you to take care of from now on.

199
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,980
Chun Wu's second maternal uncle

200
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,330
is a private school teacher.

201
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,400
He told me

202
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,580
that Wei Zhi had a great talent.

203
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,100
His brother must be too.

204
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,500
He has a bright future.

205
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,540
As soon as Wei Zhi marries here,

206
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,550
I'll let her brother attend the school

207
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,500
and study.

208
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,420
I will do my best

209
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,580
to train him.

210
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,190
Our family

211
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,220
is not as rich as those people.

212
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
But we've been sincere and honest

213
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,170
from the beginning to the end.

214
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,760
You can see that.

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,130
That's very considerate of you.

216
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,230
Wei Zhi

217
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,050
is blessed.

218
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,150
So,

219
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,500
it's a deal?

220
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,530
It's always better to have facts in black and white.

221
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,510
Let's write it down now.

222
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,340
Okay.

223
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,660
Bring me a brush and paper.

224
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,110
Master.

225
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,300
Master.

226
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,650
Lady Lingyue.

227
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,580
It's so late.

228
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,210
What do you want from the Master?

229
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm here to

230
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,870
bring him some laundry.

231
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,030
But I think it's too late.

232
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,950
Let me help you.

233
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,710
Anyway,

234
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,970
I need to bring in the foot bath too.

235
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,580
Let me help you.

236
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,430
You should go back to rest.

237
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,370
Master.

238
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,720
Master.

239
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,980
Your foot bath and clothes

240
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,610
are here.

241
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,430
Um.

242
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,100
Lady Wei Lingyue

243
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
washed the clothes and brought them here.

244
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
She washed them.

245
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,850
Why did you bring them to me?

246
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,370
I'm a servant of the Wei Mansion.

247
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,100
It's my duty

248
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,410
to do this.

249
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,530
Now

250
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
you are

251
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,650
a student of the Egret Academy.

252
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,700
Review your homework and practice your kung fu.

253
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,120
That's your job.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,400
And

255
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,960
Don't court me again,

256
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,310
such as

257
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,190
embroidering flowers on my clothes.

258
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,370
If you don't do your homework well,

259
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,960
it's useless to embroider even a phoenix.

260
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,960
Master, you got the wrong idea.

261
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,960
I don't have the time to make courtesies with you.

262
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,460
If you don't have

263
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,340
any other orders,

264
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,420
I shall take my leave.

265
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,920
Master.

266
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,940
We'll repeat the curriculum today.

267
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,560
Teleportation.

268
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,580
It's flying.

269
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,580
I'll go first.

270
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,730
She caught it.

271
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,100
Amazing.

272
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,460
-That's amazing. -Yeah.

273
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
She's advanced tremendously

274
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,110
in just a few days.

275
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,360
She's really something.

276
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,960
As expected of Lady Lingyue.

277
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,650
I have to work hard too.

278
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,250
Next.

279
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,930
Ming Lang.

280
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,700
Watch out.

281
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,590
He caught it. He caught it.

282
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,130
Great.

283
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,720
Next.

284
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,960
I'll do it.

285
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,020
Jingyue, it's here.

286
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,900
My hair.

287
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,310
Be careful.

288
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,720
There it is.

289
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,830
It's terrible.

290
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,960
Look at that.

291
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,040
Xiao Jin.

292
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,160
Yes.

293
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,870
The next one.

294
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,270
Next. Next.

295
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,250
Next.

296
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,770
It hurts.

297
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,600
Oh no.

298
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,570
My turn is next.

299
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm screwed.

300
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,350
This is

301
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,660
for today.

302
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,630
Wei Zhi.

303
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,740
Come with me

304
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,480
Looks like I'm going to get a lecture.

305
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,780
Go back and change your clothes.

306
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,880
What's wrong with me, brother?

307
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,110
Teleport to my place.

308
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,350
Come again.

309
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,910
One more time.

310
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,140
Do you really not know how to do it?

311
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,340
As long as you follow the technique,

312
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,770
even the most foolish of mortals

313
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,020
would be able to do it.

314
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,660
Master.

315
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,300
Do you think

316
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm doing this on purpose?

317
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,240
I do suspect

318
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,930
that you're not fully committed,

319
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
because you reject your Master

320
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,340
from the bottom of your heart.

321
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,770
Take it.

322
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,010
Get down yourself.

323
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,510
Master, don't go.

324
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,950
What should I do if you leave?

325
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,690
It's…

326
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,360
It's...

327
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,910
Why is this so high?

328
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,310
Someone, help!

329
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,010
Forget it.

330
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,090
I should rely on myself.

331
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,660
Why can't I do it?

332
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,990
I'm sure I can do it this time.

333
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,620
Why?

334
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,420
I can't tell

335
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,780
you're a master.

336
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,830
Can we win two out of three?

337
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,550
Don't deny it.

338
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,620
Accept the bet.

339
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,300
Get the money.

340
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,210
Whose book is this?

341
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,100
Why is it here?

342
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,870
Wei Zhi?

343
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,670
Why are you in the tree?

344
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,020
It's so high.

345
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,500
Sister.

346
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,860
Did you do it again?

347
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,460
You don't know?

348
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,460
This is the Master

349
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,290
giving Wei Zhi an extra lesson.

350
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,870
What's the saying?

351
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,970
The stupid bird flies first.

352
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:46,930
Wei Zhi.

353
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,810
Come down.

354
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
It's too dangerous up there.

355
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,410
I...

356
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,160
I can't get down.

357
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,390
Then how did you get up there?

358
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,050
Master

359
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,070
brought me up.

360
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,340
Then he left me alone.

361
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,210
I didn't make it up.

362
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,290
Master was giving her extra lessons.

363
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,530
It's a pity.

364
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,140
A stupid bird is a stupid bird.

365
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,540
Even if they fly up to the top,

366
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,630
they can't become a phoenix.

367
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,170
My poor little girl.

368
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,960
Why don't you jump down?

369
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,460
The trees attract the wind.

370
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,180
But my warm embrace

371
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,300
is for you.

372
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,050
Behave yourself.

373
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,710
It's not the occasion for a joke.

374
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,430
Wei Zhi.

375
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,700
The tree is so high.

376
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,800
You must not jump.

377
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,470
Ming Lang.

378
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,870
Let's find a way to save her.

379
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,730
If she jumped, it'd be bad.

380
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,580
Yes.

381
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,020
How about we teleport up there

382
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,780
and bring her down?

383
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,590
Yeah.

384
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,030
It's logical for us

385
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,580
to save her.

386
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,900
But Master does this

387
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,860
because he hopes Wei Zhi

388
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,110
can be successful in her studies.

389
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,310
As students,

390
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,240
how can we do it recklessly?

391
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,710
Sister is right.

392
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,160
If we save her,

393
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,300
we'd let down

394
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,510
Master's kindness.

395
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,240
We'll be punished.

396
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:02,920
Liu Chang.

397
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,180
Lady Lingyue.

398
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,700
Wei Zhi.

399
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,230
When you use your Qi,

400
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,540
be calm and relaxed.

401
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,300
When chanting the heart formula,

402
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,410
you must be free of distractions.

403
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,270
When uniting the mind and airflow,

404
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
have a sense of conviction.

405
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,700
This is for you.

406
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,760
Practice it well.

407
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,810
You'll be able to do it.

408
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,940
Lady Lingyue.

409
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,850
Believe in yourself.

410
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,120
You'll be able to do it.

411
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,090
Everyone, let's disperse.

412
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,180
Let's go.

413
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,220
Let's go too.

414
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,580
Let's go.

415
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,600
Sister.

416
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,290
Let's go.

417
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm sure I can do it.

418
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,460
How about

419
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,660
me treating you all to dinner down the mountain tonight?

420
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,260
Bao Liang,

421
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,810
let's go to practice.

422
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,700
I can't even master

423
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,620
teleportation yet.

424
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,300
Don't look down on a fat guy.

425
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,460
I'm a potential stock.

426
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,190
Yes, yes, yes.

427
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,200
That's right.

428
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,590
I'm going.

429
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,280
Pao Liang.

430
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,430
Pao Liang, where are you going?

431
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,520
What do you care about him?

432
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
He's just going down the mountain

433
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,610
for food, drink and entertainment.

434
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,090
He's not a bad guy.

435
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,680
And he's smart.

436
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,810
But he has way too many distractions.

437
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,740
He's a rich man.

438
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,140
Come in.

439
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,740
Master.

440
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,730
Pao Liang.

441
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,060
I ranked the last again

442
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,040
in today's classroom assessment.

443
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,240
I came here to ask you

444
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,990
if there is any way

445
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,500
to improve me.

446
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,120
In terms of practicing kung fu,

447
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,890
in addition to talent,

448
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,810
you have to work hard,

449
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,820
be diligent

450
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,770
and concentrated.

451
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,040
You're smart.

452
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,620
I don't have to tell you

453
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,010
what you should do to work hard.

454
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,290
I know, I know.

455
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,250
This is

456
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,880
what you're trying to do?

457
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,570
I…

458
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,730
Master.

459
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,360
There's no one else here.

460
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,700
Please don't be reserved.

461
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,140
The old man at the Immortal-Revealing Mirror

462
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,290
told me the truth.

463
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
The immortal bones

464
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,790
and immortal destiny

465
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,860
are just gimmicks.

466
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,320
It depends on

467
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,110
power and money.

468
00:27:59,330 --> 00:27:59,930
You see?

469
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,950
People like Wei Zhi

470
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,470
are still

471
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,250
on the tree.

472
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,060
There are 18 people in the class.

473
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,180
Except for Wei Zhi,

474
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,780
I'm the worst one.

475
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:16,800
Master.

476
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,560
I don't want much.

477
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,740
I just want you to

478
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,210
give me

479
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,610
a decent grade…

480
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,690
Grade.

481
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,780
I run a business.

482
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,810
I just want decency.

483
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,150
Penglai Immortal Envoy.

484
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,600
I wonder what school of thought you're in.

485
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,310
Help!

486
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,660
Are you okay?

487
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,530
What do you mean?

488
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,760
I'm just a nobody

489
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,570
with no immortal bones.

490
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,620
If I fell from the tree

491
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,500
and die,

492
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,220
is that okay

493
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,340
to people with immense power

494
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,380
like you?

495
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,760
Why are you here?

496
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,850
Didn't you tell me to come here?

497
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,220
Didn't you ask me

498
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,180
to help you check

499
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,100
Wei Zhi's destiny?

500
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,300
Yes.

501
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,080
What do you mean?

502
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm just a nobody

503
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,160
with no immortal bones.

504
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,220
If I fell from the tree

505
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
and die,

506
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,770
is that okay

507
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,980
to people with immense power

508
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,940
like you?

509
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,140
What's wrong with you?

510
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:57,510
Nothing.

511
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,920
It looks like nothing.

512
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,300
But I feel like

513
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,710
you seem to have been beaten up by someone.

514
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,800
How could that be?

515
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,880
That makes sense.

516
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,630
Who would dare to beat you up

517
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,850
in the Three Realms?

518
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,580
Let's get down to business.

519
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,350
How's your investigation going?

520
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,650
I went to her house.

521
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
There was

522
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,920
nothing special about it.

523
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,320
And then

524
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,780
I went back to Dewa Penyesuaian Nasib

525
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,710
and took Buku Catatan Kelahiran dan Kematian.

526
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,200
It turns out

527
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,220
she is just

528
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,110
a mortal with a very bad fate.

529
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,630
But

530
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,450
according to Buku Catatan Kelahiran dan Kematian,

531
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,380
Wei Zhi

532
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,320
is having a tribulation in the near future.

533
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,480
That's right.

534
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,960
You said

535
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,830
you saw her future?

536
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,040
Maybe

537
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,780
this is it.

538
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,420
She's

539
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,320
dead.

540
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,900
She's a mortal.

541
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,410
Yeah, right.

542
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,090
She's a mortal.

543
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,510
She's just a mortal

544
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,550
and a nobody

545
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,150
with no immortal bones

546
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,960
to immortals with immense power like us.

547
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,190
If she dies, she dies.

548
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,420
Are you okay?

549
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,640
I found

550
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,580
a demon trail.

551
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,690
What?

552
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,560
A demon came to the academy?

553
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,230
Do you want me to send some heavenly soldiers

554
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:31,930
for guardian?

555
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,120
It's not necessary to mobilize the troops.

556
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,430
But

557
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,680
the demonic realm seems ready to do something.

558
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,710
The Demon King has always been subservient to the Heaven Realm.

559
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,430
Has he gone disloyal

560
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,870
because of the Phoenix?

561
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,410
The Demon Realm is weak.

562
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,180
They dare not fight against the Heaven Realm.

563
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,260
Tell Father

564
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,820
to inform the Demon King of this.

565
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,770
[The wolf prince of the Demon Realm, Ou Ya]

566
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,429
You are too young

567
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,730
I'll let you off this time.

568
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,840
[Princess of Fox Clan of the Demon Realm Lan Su]

569
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:48,969
My wife.

570
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,199
Who is your wife?

571
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,270
Call me Beauty.

572
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,120
My beautiful Wife.

573
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,060
Why...

574
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,040
Why are you here too?

575
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
I haven't married you yet.

576
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,180
Don't call me that.

577
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,260
But you're still

578
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,580
my wife.

579
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,880
I've been blessed for many lifetimes

580
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,100
to marry the noble fox princess.

581
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,640
Am I right?

582
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,640
And

583
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,950
this is the dream of

584
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,890
many promising young men.

585
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,150
This is for you.

586
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,670
Take it.

587
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,060
Confess.

588
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,730
You left the Demon Realm secretly without my knowledge

589
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,930
and came to Egret Academy.

590
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,230
What are you thinking?

591
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:20,970
I'm going

592
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,710
to do something big, of course.

593
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,150
I don't believe you.

594
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,750
My wife.

595
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,130
Do you want to have children

596
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,810
if we get married?

597
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,000
Of course, I do.

598
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
But it's hard for a female

599
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,720
in the Demon Realm to conceive.

600
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,580
That's right.

601
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,130
It's extremely hard.

602
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,170
So

603
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,420
you know what?

604
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,990
According to legend,

605
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,240
the reincarnation of the Phoenix

606
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,060
will stimulate the real bloodline.

607
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,910
And a single one of

608
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,320
the mature phoenix tail feathers

609
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,460
can change

610
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,620
the Demon Realm fertility crisis.

611
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,620
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

612
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,380
My wife.

613
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,590
Call me Beauty.

614
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,090
My beautiful wife.

615
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,790
How can you

616
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,580
curse your husband like that?

617
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,830
The Phoenix has appeared in the world.

618
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,810
The heaven and the demons are all watching.

619
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,840
I don't believe you didn't notice it.

620
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,390
And now

621
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,460
the High Immortals are already

622
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,460
guarding the academy now.

623
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,800
I know.

624
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,640
Besides,

625
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,020
the Demon King

626
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,980
has forbad anyone

627
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,860
to think about the Phoenix.

628
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,160
If you do, you'll die.

629
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,720
I know that, too.

630
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,610
What's wrong?

631
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,380
What do you know?

632
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,370
You will be killed by the immortals

633
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,220
and the Demon King.

634
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,860
My wife.

635
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,120
I know.

636
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,430
But I am at least

637
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,810
the Prince of the Wolf Clan.

638
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,820
Would I be

639
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,800
afraid of death?

640
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,350
Lan Su, think about it.

641
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,520
Why is the Demon Realm weak?

642
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,180
It's because we have very few females.

643
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,660
Isn't that right?

644
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,600
If this continues,

645
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,500
the Demon Realm will be extinct.

646
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,430
Nothing would make sense then.

647
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,140
Now we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

648
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,100
in front of us.

649
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,490
If I bring the Phoenix

650
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,710
back to the Demon Realm,

651
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,420
I will be

652
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,820
a great credit to the Demon Realm.

653
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,700
Are you

654
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,180
serious?

655
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,490
But the Demon King...

656
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,130
Forget the old man.

657
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,940
He just won't offend either side.

658
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,810
What does he know?

659
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,120
Besides,

660
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,890
it's such an arduous task.

661
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,460
I need your help.

662
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,050
I'll help.

663
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:18,880
That's right.

664
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,900
Go back to the Demon Realm right now

665
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,100
and cover for me there.

666
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,980
If there's any news,

667
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,860
let me know as soon as possible.

668
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,210
How's that?

669
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:32,990
All right.

670
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,570
I'll trust you for once.

671
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,390
But if dare to fool around

672
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,730
out there again,

673
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,890
I shall…

674
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,180
I understand.

675
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,580
The flowers outside smell better.

676
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,580
Today

677
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,100
we're studying a new lesson.

678
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,000
The second chapter of the Skills of Deity Arts,

679
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,740
"Create something out of nothing".

680
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,520
The highest level of creating something out of nothing

681
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,790
is to be able to create something with ease.

682
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,900
But because of the beginner's lack of skill,

683
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,300
not only can they not change what they think,

684
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,910
but they may reveal

685
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,620
their secret desires.

686
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:29,910
Therefore,

687
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,360
it's important to memorize the techniques

688
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,800
and study it again and again.

689
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,050
Yes.

690
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,900
Everything is born from something.

691
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,970
Something is born from nothing.

692
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,580
The beginning of something

693
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,790
is rooted in nothing.
