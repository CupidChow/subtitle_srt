4
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,110
Aren't you bored

5
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,860
alone here?

6
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,020
Don't you want to go out?

7
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,010
Of course.

8
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,890
But I can't get out.

9
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,840
Well.

10
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,770
Do you think it can help you?

11
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,270
We can't walk out of

12
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,340
this forest.

13
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,310
We can't walk out of it.

14
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,290
Should we fly out of it?

15
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,820
Yes.

16
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,550
I know.

17
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,670
I know how to get out.

18
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,220
Wait for me.

19
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,079
I know how to get out.

20
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,300
Wait for me.

21
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,810
Well,

22
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,370
why don't we try

23
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,670
the Teleportation Master taught us?

24
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,270
We may be able to get out.

25
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,210
Yes, Teleportation.

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,630
We're bewitched

27
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,430
by the illusion.

28
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,330
Try it.

29
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,440
You should go first. I'll cover the back.

30
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,730
Come on, let's do it together.

31
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,480
Hold me tight. Let me cast the spell.

32
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,820
Okay.

33
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,260
Run like this.

34
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,630
It doesn't work, Liu Chang.

35
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,820
We have to find another way.

36
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,870
I can run.

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,030
I won't give up.

38
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,730
But it's almost time.

39
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,960
If it's time

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,240
and we're still trapped here,

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,950
who knows

42
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,850
what we'll face.

43
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,360
I can't let us take the risk.

44
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,560
I don't care.

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,390
I quit.

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,190
Why did you use the flying talisman?

47
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,420
To save our lives.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
There is no retreat on the battlefield.

49
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,510
You wouldn't come back if you didn't retreat.

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,260
Only a coward like you

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,100
thinks about saving your life.

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,380
General Liu, calm down.

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,920
Father.

54
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,329
Lord Bao.

55
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,920
Your son is witted.

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,459
Liu Chang is far behind.

57
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,670
From now on,

58
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,900
our families should be more intimate.

59
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,420
General Liu.

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,250
They are classmates.

61
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,970
It's what we should do.

62
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,930
Go.

63
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,990
They're back too.

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,700
What a pity.

65
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,310
I've accepted the flying talisman.

66
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,620
I don't know

67
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,790
why you can see me.

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,090
But today

69
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,280
is the happiest day of mine

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,320
in thousands of years.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,450
So,

72
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,980
Wei Zhi, listen carefully.

73
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,090
Turn back if you can't get over.

74
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,070
Just repent and salvation is at hand.

75
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,140
Thank you.

76
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,390
I will make it.

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,970
What's the competition?

78
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,840
No matter what it is,

79
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,310
the end must be

80
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,480
across the Weak River Barrier.

81
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,640
Miss Wei,

82
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,370
you were talking about the Weak River Barrier?

83
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,970
I once read

84
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,230
the introduction of this dangerous place in the Three Realms

85
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,400
in the library.

86
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,720
If I'm not mistaken,

87
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,720
we have to

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,670
cross the illusive barrier

89
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,020
in this round.

90
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,720
Miss Wei, do you have a way

91
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,290
to pass it?

92
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,660
There's no way.

93
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,700
We can't cross the Weak Water Barrier with flesh.

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,070
Our magic

95
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,530
can't be used here either.

96
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,330
It's a dead end.

97
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,420
-This... -A dead end.

98
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,540
Everyone, think about

99
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,940
how to pass it.

100
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,070
Even my sister can't think of a way.

101
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,310
Who else can think of it?

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,470
Look over there.

103
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,000
What's this?

104
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,320
This is the demon fog.

105
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,950
Demonic fog invasion

106
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,880
may trigger the devil inside

107
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
and confuse people.

108
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,780
It can't be undone.

109
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,460
Yes.

110
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,220
A man should be decisive.

111
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,280
Yes, we quit.

112
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,350
The fog wall can't be boundless.

113
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,250
Let's

114
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,180
go this way.

115
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,520
If we find the edge of the fog,

116
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,580
we might be saved.

117
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,580
What kind of solution is that?

118
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,700
There's no way.

119
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,450
Wei Zhi, listen carefully.

120
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,280
Turn back if you can't get over.

121
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,210
Just repent and salvation is at hand.

122
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,010
Let's go.

123
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,300
Wait.

124
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,750
I think we should

125
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,820
go that way.

126
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,780
Are you crazy? My sister said

127
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,700
the destination was across the shore.

128
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,420
Go on.

129
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,770
The demonic fog

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,970
may look dangerous,

131
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,640
but it might be a cover-up.

132
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,600
It's too late.

133
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,540
Wei Zhi,

134
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,560
how sure are you about that?

135
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,430
I'm not sure.

136
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,080
It's no different from asking for death.

137
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,450
I quit.

138
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,310
Me too.

139
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,040
What should we do?

140
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,520
Look.

141
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,900
She's going in.

142
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,940
She seems to have chosen a dead end,

143
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,940
but it can imply

144
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,300
unexpected hope.

145
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,220
Isn't this

146
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,150
what I should think of?

147
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,580
Sister.

148
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,390
Are you crazy?

149
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,020
Let's go.

150
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,070
They...

151
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,730
Who is the one that leads the way into the mist?

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
She is a maid of Minister Wei.

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,310
Minister Wei is good at managing his people.

154
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,070
Even a maid

155
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,590
is so extraordinary.

156
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm flattered.

157
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,850
It's just a coincidence.

158
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,450
Luck

159
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,380
is also a part of our strength.

160
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,630
It's the last critical moment.

161
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,169
Let's see

162
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,850
whose luck

163
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,220
is better.

164
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,210
Lingyue.

165
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,740
Jingyue.

166
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,510
Wei Zhi.

167
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
Where are you?

168
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,290
Kill her.

169
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,630
You'll be the Phoenix.

170
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,180
Kill her.

171
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,870
Kill her.

172
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,170
You'll be the Phoenix.

173
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,220
Kill her.

174
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,410
Sister.

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,890
Ming.

176
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,880
Sister, where are you?

177
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,900
Wei Zhi.

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,710
It's all your fault.

179
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,590
We're so screwed.

180
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,930
Sister.

181
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,220
Ming Lang.

182
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,130
Ming Lang.

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,010
Ming Lang.

184
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,960
Ming Lang.

185
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,500
Father.

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,080
Jingyue.

187
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,420
Where are you?

188
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,200
Phoenix.

189
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,280
You're the Phoenix with everyone's attention.

190
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,730
Wei Lingyue.

191
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,330
Are you the Phoenix?

192
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,420
I am.

193
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,530
Are you

194
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,600
really the Phoenix?

195
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,060
Everyone, calm down.

196
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,970
Use the Heart-protecting Chant.

197
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,580
Sister.

198
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,300
Sister.

199
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,320
Get out. Get out.

200
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,280
Sister.

201
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,340
We're out.

202
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,220
We quit.

203
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,640
Sister, what should we do?

204
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,040
Let's move on.

205
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:37,890
Let's go.

206
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,620
It was all because of my sister's Heart-protecting Chant.

207
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,580
Wei Zhi.

208
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,670
Otherwise,

209
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,280
you'd die in the fog.

210
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
It's all thanks to Wei Zhi

211
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,870
going backward.

212
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,000
In terms of strength,

213
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,520
she knows nothing.

214
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,240
If it's just luck...

215
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,740
No.

216
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,980
It's not just luck.

217
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,880
It's not the end yet.

218
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,400
Let's get through this first.

219
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,250
What...

220
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,430
What's going on?

221
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
There's no other way

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,850
to survive the coldest place.

223
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,270
We have to move forward.

224
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,340
If we stay,

225
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,360
we can't keep our body temperature

226
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,860
when our spiritual power runs out

227
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,240
and we can't pass.

228
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,120
But there's nothing here.

229
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,030
Mr. Ming,

230
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,510
how do you judge the direction?

231
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,340
No need to judge.

232
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,960
In my opinion,

233
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,060
we just need to

234
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,060
follow one direction

235
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,500
and we can get out of here.

236
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,030
Here,

237
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
our body temperature

238
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,000
is precious.

239
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,150
Don't get separated.

240
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,050
Come on.

241
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,590
Let's hold hands.

242
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,330
Hold hands.

243
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,010
Weird.

244
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,250
Why are your hands so warm?

245
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,490
Aren't you cold?

246
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm fine.

247
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,220
Your hands are quite cold.

248
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Let me rub it for you.

249
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,340
Are you okay?

250
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,140
I, I can.

251
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,180
Are we

252
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,210
getting out of here soon?

253
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,100
Jingyue.

254
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,820
Jingyue.

255
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Hang in there.

256
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,380
We can get out soon.

257
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,430
I can't make it.

258
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,810
Leave.

259
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,300
Leave me alone.

260
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,960
Jingyue.

261
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,360
Why don't you leave first?

262
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,600
I'll stay here

263
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,600
to cast a spell to protect her from the cold.

264
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,850
Don't worry.

265
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,770
If it doesn't work,

266
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,390
I will leave with the flying talisman.

267
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,550
If you do this,

268
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,460
you'll both be eliminated.

269
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,360
She is my teammate.

270
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,260
I'll stand by her side.

271
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,060
Ming Lang.

272
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,810
I thank you on behalf of Jingyue.

273
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,470
Just go.

274
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,070
Let's go.

275
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,099
Take it.

276
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,339
Take this Wunuan Pill.

277
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,510
Don't ask anything.

278
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,000
You'll be number one tomorrow.

279
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,590
Father.

280
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,950
This...

281
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,390
I don't think it's a good idea.

282
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,650
Ming Lang.

283
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,560
Although I am the master of the city,

284
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,550
there's not much I can help you.

285
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,260
If you can be chosen as the real Phoenix,

286
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,030
you'll truly

287
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,510
succeed

288
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,780
after some time of

289
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,190
practicing.

290
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,130
Ming.

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,220
What's wrong with me?

292
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,200
You

293
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,540
froze.

294
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,330
I don't feel cold at all.

295
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,580
You saved me.

296
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,250
If you're okay,

297
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,680
let's continue.

298
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,860
Let's go after my sister.

299
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,060
Ming.

300
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,750
Ming, what's wrong?

301
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,590
I got you into trouble.

302
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,750
What are you talking about?

303
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,630
I dragged you down.

304
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,290
Jingyue.

305
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,930
I'm afraid

306
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,930
I can't pass the test with you.

307
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,670
Ming,

308
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,690
you must have a way.

309
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,300
Right?

310
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,110
Tell me.

311
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,500
You must have a way.

312
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,850
I have an idea.

313
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,560
Ming.

314
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,130
Ming, are you okay?

315
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,160
I'm fine.

316
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,420
Ming Lang

317
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,360
is loyal to his friend.

318
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,490
It's Jingyue's fault.

319
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,620
She dragged him down.

320
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,850
Don't say that, Minister Wei.

321
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,390
It's just a test.

322
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,400
Don't worry about it.

323
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,610
Wait.

324
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,520
You'll freeze.

325
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,030
Let me help you.

326
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,450
It's okay. I'm not cold.

327
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,510
It's okay. We're teammates.

328
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,170
OK. Let's go.

329
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,000
We passed.

330
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,310
Did we pass?

331
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,920
The cooperation is over.

332
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,130
The assessment you're going to face

333
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,030
is the last part.

334
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,270
Draw the sword

335
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,870
and start the final battle.

336
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,510
Whoever wins

337
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,290
will be the last winner.

338
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,830
Why is there still a battle?

339
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,620
Miss.

340
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,610
Lady Lingyue, what are you doing?

341
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,460
Don't you know?

342
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,650
Only one person shall win the assessment.

343
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,740
Only you and me are left.

344
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,090
We must

345
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,530
have a showdown.

346
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,700
This...

347
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,280
Qing Huan.

348
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,950
What do you want?

349
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,240
Get up, Wei Zhi.

350
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,570
A hundred birds face the Phoenix.

351
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,180
The Phoenix is here.

352
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,960
In that case,

353
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,880
Wei Lingyue is really the Phoenix?

354
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,970
Fine.

355
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,460
In this Mid-Autumn Festival assessment,

356
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,130
Wei Lingyue

357
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,910
won first place.

358
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,280
Great.

359
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,530
Congratulations, Minister Wei.

360
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,460
It's true.

361
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,870
Lady Lingyue is indeed the Phoenix.

362
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,140
How nice.

363
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,390
Why is Wei Lingyue the Phoenix?

364
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,790
Sister, you're amazing.

365
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,420
I knew

366
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,630
you'd be the first.

367
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,660
Good.

368
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,110
My Lord,

369
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,900
Huarong…

370
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,080
Something is wrong with Huarong.

371
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,200
Congratulations, My Lord.

372
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:14,900
The Phoenix.

373
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,110
Sister.

374
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,320
I've opened my eyes today.

375
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,220
I've never seen

376
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,710
a hundred birds facing the Phoenix.

377
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,900
The Phoenix bless Dayu.

378
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,210
It's the auspicious sign of the country.

379
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,470
Minister Wei.

380
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,230
Congratulations.

381
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,710
Congratulations.

382
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,870
It's just an assessment.

383
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,740
Minister,

384
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,540
you're wrong.

385
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,930
A strange sign has appeared.

386
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,940
Your daughter is the real Phoenix.

387
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,930
Thanks to His Majesty's grace

388
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,720
and the teachers' and students' efforts.

389
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,570
The Mid-Autumn Festival competition

390
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,240
is wonderful.

391
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,560
I'll report to His Majesty

392
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,120
to commend the academy.

393
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,130
Lord Imperial Advisor.

394
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,690
The strange sigh appeared and the real Phoenix showed up.

395
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,900
It's a blessing to Dayu.

396
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,590
Besides, Lord Imperial Advisor is also responsible for

397
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,780
finding the real Phoenix for His Majesty.

398
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
Now that you've achieved your merits,

399
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
congratulations.

400
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,460
Congratulations.

401
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,880
The phoenix is an auspicious sign.

402
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,260
Of course I have to enter the palace

403
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,410
and report it to His Majesty.

404
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,610
But

405
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,100
the news will spread soon.

406
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,980
The peace of the academy

407
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,800
and Phoenix's safety…

408
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,290
Dean,

409
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,970
are you confident in ensuring that?

410
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,670
With Yan Yue here,

411
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,330
it'll be fine.

412
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,260
Let Wei Lingyue

413
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,900
wait for His Majesty's decree.

414
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,670
A hundred birds face the phoenix.

415
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,510
A hundred birds face the phoenix.

416
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,380
Father,

417
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,700
I know

418
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,410
what happened today

419
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,770
is not what you want.

420
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,250
Lingyue.

421
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,030
I'm not here to scold you.

422
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,440
The conclusion is complete.

423
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,060
I

424
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,700
will do my best

425
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,420
to protect you.

426
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,840
Really, Father?

427
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,460
I won't be proud

428
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,220
just because

429
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,260
I'm the Phoenix.

430
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,820
I will assist you in

431
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,930
serving Dayu

432
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,120
and helping the people.

433
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,190
Good.

434
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,160
It's my fault for underestimating you.

435
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,860
You

436
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,310
can bear the name of a phoenix.

437
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,090
I think you're unlucky.

438
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,620
If you fall again,

439
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,740
you'll break.

440
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,590
Alright.

441
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,910
From now on,

442
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,030
I'll protect you.

443
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,890
That's right.

444
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,740
Everyone should be

445
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,100
congratulating Lady Lingyue.

446
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,860
I've strengthened the barrier.

447
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,050
Don't come out

448
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,180
for the time being.

449
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,330
Master, are you the only one

450
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,390
who can go in and out?

451
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,830
Master,

452
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,320
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

453
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,970
I specially prepared

454
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,250
the moon cakes specially made in the mansion.

455
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,450
I'd like to invite you to taste it.

456
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,310
No need.

457
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,750
The full moon is the most normal phenomenon.

458
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,710
I don't understand

459
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,040
why people should make such a fuss.

460
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,770
Since I acquire a different identity now,

461
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,800
I have many questions

462
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,940
to ask you.

463
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,530
Phoenix is the Chosen One.

464
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,700
You don't need to ask anyone for advice.

465
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,490
Just follow your heart.

466
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,350
Yes, Master.

467
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,430
Be careful.

468
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,700
Don't come out of the boundary

469
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,060
without me.

470
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,160
The Phoenix is about to come out.

471
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,970
Your merit is about to be fulfilled.

472
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,310
Why are you still frowning?

473
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,030
You need to explain

474
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,060
why you

475
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,840
tampered with the last round first.

476
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,700
But the result is perfect, isn't it?

477
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,990
It's Heavenly Emperor's order.

478
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,650
It's a strange omen of the Phoenix. The Three Realms will hear about it.

479
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,470
The Demon Clan will surely make a move.

480
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,050
What should we do

481
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,400
next?

482
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,720
Did Heavenly Emperor

483
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,320
have any instructions?

484
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,060
His Majesty

485
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,230
asked you to watch her closely.

486
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,180
Watch her?

487
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,740
First, the light of the Immortal-Revealing Mirror

488
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,500
broke through the Heavenly Palace.

489
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,290
The heavens were shocked.

490
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,570
Later, the Heavenly Emperor sent me to the Mortal Realm.

491
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,270
I should know this is a serious matter.

492
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,550
Now that the Phoenix has been found,

493
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,900
the Demon Clan is ready to make a move.

494
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,600
Why didn't the Heavenly Emperor issue an edict

495
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,630
and send the Phoenix

496
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,760
to the Heavenly Court?

497
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,510
The Heavenly Emperor didn't give any other decree.

498
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,120
I can't answer

499
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,670
your question.

500
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,940
Now, I only have half of my magical prowess.

501
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,310
If I meet another demon,

502
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,740
I'm afraid I can't handle it.

503
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,740
Do you need me to send some Heavenly Soldiers

504
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,650
to help you?

505
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,270
No need.

506
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,520
I'll go back to the Heavenly Court

507
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,730
and ask Father.

508
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:56,790
Master.

509
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:01,960
Master.

510
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,710
Are you all right? I'm fine.

511
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:07,830
That's good.

512
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,820
The wound

513
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,480
was done by Ou Ya?

514
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,220
Ou Ya?

515
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,930
Wei Zhi, are you okay?

516
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,900
Are you hurt?

517
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,230
I'm fine.

518
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,610
That's good.

519
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,990
Yan Yue is coming.

520
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,080
Wei Zhi, don't worry.

521
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,840
With Yan Yue here,

522
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,630
no one dares to hurt you.

523
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,780
I'm leaving.

524
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,920
Ou Ya.

525
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,090
Please spare my life.

526
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,830
I don't want your life.

527
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,980
Let me ask you.

528
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,770
Who sent you here?

529
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,530
Lord Ming.

530
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,480
Ming Chengwu?

531
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:30,760
Why?

532
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,409
We take money to work.

533
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,150
I don't know the cause and effect.

534
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,389
Please save me.

535
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,750
Since you don't know the cause and effect,

536
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,020
I can't change your karma.

537
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,139
A moment ago,

538
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,860
you were already dead.

539
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,139
Master.

540
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,380
my mother and brother

541
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,350
must be in danger.

542
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,230
Master,

543
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,870
please take me to save them.

544
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:19,850
Mother.

545
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,030
Ye.

546
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,760
-Sister. -How are you? Are you hurt?

547
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,240
You were also instructed by Ming Chengwu?

548
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,880
When Ming Chengwu went to Yu Du,

549
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,480
Gucheng suffered a bloodbath.

550
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,240
The Gu family was destroyed.

551
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,240
But he became the City Governor.

552
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,150
All these years,

553
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,190
I have no evidence

554
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,840
or the ability to find the truth.

555
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,810
I just want to live in seclusion

556
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,460
and live peacefully.

557
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,810
But I didn't expect

558
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,490
he wouldn't even

559
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,460
spare us.

560
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,670
Let's go.

561
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,350
Let's meet Ming Chengwu.

562
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,570
Master.

563
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,930
It's my business to find the Ming family.

564
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,150
You shouldn't take care of it for me, should you?

565
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,280
It doesn't matter.

566
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,540
I'm already doing it.

567
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,140
It's for your self-defense.

568
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,770
For me?

569
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,310
Your power is weak,

570
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,640
and you can't use magic.

571
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,780
After thinking about it,

572
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,780
this is the best for you.

573
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,690
Thank you, Master.

574
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,470
Let's go.

575
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,380
Okay.

576
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,040
Father.

577
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,740
If you want to explain

578
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,780
why you didn't take

579
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,840
the Wunuan Pill,

580
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,100
save it.

581
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,400
I let you down.

583
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,630
I won't blame you.

584
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,740
But you must promise me

585
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,460
to go back to Gucheng with me now.

586
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,880
Why?

587
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,900
Yu Du is going to be in trouble.

588
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,120
Our Ming family

589
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,260
can't get involved in this again.

590
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,750
Studying at Egret Academy

591
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,160
and being taught by an immortal,

592
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,420
how many people's dream

593
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,470
is this?

594
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,180
Now my course is not finished,

595
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,480
how can I just leave?

596
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,750
You don't want to be the Phoenix,

597
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,020
but you're bewitched by the Phoenix.

598
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,360
If I could do something to

599
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,890
your feelings for Wei Lingyue

600
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
before today,

601
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,600
I couldn't do anything more

602
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,610
after today.

603
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,660
Ming Lang.

604
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,460
You've been taking charge of politics with me

605
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,680
since childhood.

606
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,010
Can't you see through this?

607
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,680
Can't you let it go?

608
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,620
You're right, Father.

609
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,350
But I

610
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,180
don't want to go home now

611
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,990
because I want to

612
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,520
learn in the academy.

613
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,350
it's not for Miss Wei.

614
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,300
If it isn't for Wei Lingyue,

615
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,260
is it for

616
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,020
Gu Fengzhi?

617
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,020
Do you think I can't tell

618
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,930
that Wei Zhi is Gu Fengzhi?

619
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,960
Father.

620
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,620
It's such a big deal.

621
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,000
But you didn't tell me.

622
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,570
If I hadn't been

623
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,990
witty enough to see it,

624
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
I'm afraid I'd be kept in the dark.

625
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,080
If anything,

626
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,320
this is the most disappointing to me.

627
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,920
I know I was wrong.

628
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,170
The Phoenix is here.

629
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,110
And the orphans of Gucheng are here too.

630
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,700
I can't see through

631
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,570
the Minister of Rites' Mansion now.

632
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,210
As far as I know,

633
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,820
it's just a coincidence

634
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,370
for Wei Zhi to live in Wei Mansion.

635
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,130
There are only her mother and brother

636
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,150
in her family.

637
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,040
Please

638
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,430
let them go.

639
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,880
Ming Lang.

640
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,380
How could you

641
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,280
think of me like this?

642
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,440
How can I

643
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,380
kill women

644
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,330
and children?

645
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,100
The Gu family was defeated.

646
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,460
But our Ming family was unharmed.

647
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,930
and became the City Governor.

648
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,050
People in Gucheng

649
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,060
have been talking about it.

650
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,810
Shut up!

651
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,220
The Ming family and the Gu family are deeply in love.

652
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,360
I did

653
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,870
let the Gu family down.

654
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,540
That's because I was weak and incompetent.

655
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,440
I had no choice,

656
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,160
but I wasn't ruthless!

657
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:51,570
Father.
