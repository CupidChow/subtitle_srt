[Episode 6]

4
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,400
Weird.

5
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,950
Why isn't it burning?

6
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
You said it was a flower?

7
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,350
In this world,

8
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,100
no flower can't be saved with resting soil.

9
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,290
Can I leave now?

10
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,620
What are you doing?

11
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,540
Let go of me!

12
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,790
How could you

13
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,860
break your promise?

14
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,750
Someone!

15
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,310
Is anyone there?

16
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,030
You broke your promise.

17
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,370
You devil!

18
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,260
Despicable! Shameless!

19
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
I've saved

20
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,329
your flower.

21
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,580
But you still locked me up here.

22
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,950
What do you want?

23
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,630
I want you to answer a few questions.

24
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,380
Are you interrogating me?

25
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,130
Yes.

26
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,410
You are the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen of the Heaven Realm,

27
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,780
and the niece of the Heavenly Empress.

28
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,990
You knew it!

29
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
Where is the Red Sun God

30
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,120
of the Heavenly Realm?

31
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,580
Are you looking for the Red Sun God?

32
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,470
He is the son of the Heavenly Emperor.

33
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,530
Of course he is serving

34
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,520
the Heavenly Emperor in the Heavenly Realm.

35
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,900
Besides,

36
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,340
he's usually busy with work.

37
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
I don't

38
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,159
know him well.

39
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,470
The son of the Heavenly Emperor?

40
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,440
You are not familiar.

41
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,490
Are you sure he's in the Heavenly Court?

42
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,680
Of course.

43
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,620
Who pretended to be

44
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,590
the Penglai Immortal Envoy

45
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,280
in Egret Academy?

46
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,340
I don't know.

47
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,100
No one can lie

48
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,590
in front of me.

49
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,990
Well...

50
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,290
He is...

51
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,580
the commander of the Imperial Guards of the Heavenly Realm.

52
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,970
Q-Qing Huan.

53
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,060
Qing Huan?

54
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,760
That's right.

55
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,110
He's awesome.

56
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,260
He commands millions of Heavenly Soldiers.

57
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,170
Besides,

58
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,320
we grew up together.

59
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,430
He is

60
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,430
a nice guy,

61
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,240
but he is impulsive.

62
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,790
If he knows

63
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,020
you locked me up here,

64
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,270
He will definitely...

65
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,050
tell

66
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,860
the Heavenly Empress.

67
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,860
He will tell her that I went out

68
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,840
to look for ingredients.

69
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,430
I'll be

70
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,140
in big trouble.

71
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,000
One last question.

72
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,180
Why did you steal Huarong?

73
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,750
It's a long story.

74
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,070
Do you know

75
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,640
there is a very special ingredient

76
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,360
called glow-in-the-dark mushroom

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,880
in the Demon Realm.

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,090
I've been here secretly to pick some for several times.

79
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,640
But

80
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,330
every time I cooked it,

81
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,030
I just couldn't make it

82
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,770
taste like the unique delicacy

83
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,940
described in the book.

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,930
I'm thinking about it.

85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,540
According to the diet custom, I have to

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,670
bring the original ingredients back

87
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,220
in the Demon Realm to cook.

88
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,360
So I borrowed the flowers.

89
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,140
Nonsense!

90
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Huarong is guarded.

91
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,490
How could you

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,920
get it so easily?

93
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,710
I...

94
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,730
My Lord, bad news.

95
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,970
Huarong is missing.

96
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,400
Well...

97
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,430
You won't tell me?

98
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,720
Fine.

99
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Then you can stay

100
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,010
in this prison.

101
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,210
My Lord,

102
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,110
you just locked the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen up,

103
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,100
if it causes trouble,

104
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,450
I don't think it's worthwhile.

105
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,270
Immortals and demons are enemies.

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,040
There's no need to pretend to be nice.

107
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,800
She can

108
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,040
steal Huarong

109
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,300
in front of you

110
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,110
and use the spirit soil of Three Realms

111
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,530
to revive it easily.

112
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,880
Don't underestimate her.

113
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,460
Keep an eye on her.

114
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:56,880
Yes.

115
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,440
Well,

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,440
how about the Egret Academy...

117
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,700
We haven't found out who is the Phoenix.

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,580
Right now,

119
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,270
nothing can go wrong.

120
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,090
Yes.

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,080
[From the God's blessings, behold the message of the emperor that you make the relationships sincere and I hereby bestow a Mid-Autumn Festival banquet to Egret Academy]

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,080
[Eighteen students and their parents will all be here. Each of them can enjoy themselves. Respect it!]

123
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,590
The academy was attacked by demons.

124
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,220
It's such a big matter.

125
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,520
The Imperial Advisor

126
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,830
hadn't said a word about it to the emperor.

127
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,720
And he ignored the safety of the students

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
to hold the Mid-Autumn Festival Party.

129
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,090
He even invited the students' parents.

130
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,620
Mid-Autumn Festival Party is the tradition of the academy.

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,340
Although there was a speech prohibition order,

132
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,250
the secret of the demon invasion

133
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,040
still spread.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,630
This Mid-Autumn Festival Party

135
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,330
is indeed

136
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,420
a good way

137
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,710
to calm people down.

138
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,120
If the Mid-Autumn Festival Party will be held,

139
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,750
why do we have to hold a feast?

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,280
You have started cultivating since childhood

141
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,550
and stayed away from the world.

142
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,610
You don't even know the government as well.

143
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,480
But what about you, Dean?

144
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,670
You've been cultivating for years.

145
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,130
How can you bear the corruption of the government?

146
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,360
This

147
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,620
is the secular world.

148
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,960
Anyway,

149
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,740
please do your best

150
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,630
to protect students' safety.

151
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,600
It's my duty.

152
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,060
I'll take my leave.

153
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
Why are you here?

154
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,330
I would not have thought so.

155
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,590
It's fine

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,340
that Yi'er is messing around.

157
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,980
You are the Divine Lord.

158
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,710
Why did you cooperate with her

159
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,340
to do child's play?

160
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,320
Yi'er?

161
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,570
What did she do this time?

162
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,960
She stole some resting soil.

163
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,580
I don't know what she's up to.

164
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,300
The sunrise this morning

165
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,500
was an hour late.

166
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,910
Didn't you help her

167
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,830
let Yan Luo come home late?

168
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,680
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,940
Yi'er

170
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,460
didn't come here.

171
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,530
Didn't come?

172
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,880
That's even stranger.

173
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,580
You stopped the sunrise

174
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,590
this morning

175
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,330
for no reason?

176
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,780
Recently, the academy has been in trouble.

177
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,310
The students haven't slept well.

178
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,250
Therefore,

179
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,540
I delayed the sunrise

180
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,210
so that they can get some more sleep.

181
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,160
But after that,

182
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,080
I also felt

183
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,570
that it was quite inappropriate.

184
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,480
Of course not.

185
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,890
As the Divine Lord,

186
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,240
you have always abided by the Natural Law.

187
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,360
No sorrow, no joy.

188
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,620
And you never offer your sympathy.

189
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,910
How come you

190
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,820
did such a ridiculous thing

191
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,740
for these mortals today?

192
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,550
You should know

193
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,740
the life of a mortal

194
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,000
is just like the life of this flower.

195
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,450
It is fleeting.

196
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,820
Any behavior to change lives

197
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,060
by using magic

198
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,190
is against the Natural Law.

199
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,570
They'll be punished,

200
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,610
or get divine retribution.

201
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,590
Okay, I got it.

202
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,770
I won't do it again.

203
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,880
I just don't know

204
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,730
where did

205
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,630
Yi'er go on earth?

206
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,320
Yi'er.

207
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,150
Why did she steal resting soil?

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,750
Lord Rain.

209
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,930
The resting soil is the spirit soil of Three Realms.

210
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,620
I failed to guard it

211
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,210
and let you down.

212
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,470
I should be punished.

213
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,680
Yi'er is smart.

214
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,230
She wouldn't do anything bad.

215
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,300
Forget it.

216
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,590
It's all my fault.

217
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,570
Please punish me, Lord Rain.

218
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,280
Tao.

219
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,700
It's okay.

220
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,740
You didn't do anything wrong.

221
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,740
No.

222
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,270
If you don't punish me,

223
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,840
I will punish myself.

224
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm requesting to

225
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,220
fertilize all the fields in Yingzhou.

226
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,780
I won't rest until I finish it.

227
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,620
Then you have to stay up

228
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,500
for three days and nights.

229
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,500
So this is the punishment

230
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,700
for me.

231
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,750
Are all devils so stubborn?

232
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,400
Liu Chang.

233
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,970
Take your invitations home.

234
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,270
You must attend.

235
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,150
That's all for today.

236
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,100
Yes.

237
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,250
My two elder brothers

238
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,430
had won first place

239
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,200
at the Mid-Autumn Festival Party.

240
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,330
This time,

241
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,620
I'm afraid I'll embarrass the Liu family.

242
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,070
Mid-Autumn Festival Party

243
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,540
is the tradition of Egret Academy.

244
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,440
But it's the first time

245
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,880
that I know about the parents' feast.

246
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,680
Yes.

247
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,430
That's because you're capable.

248
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,860
Let's go.

249
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,590
Even Lord Imperial Advisor

250
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,740
will attend it.

251
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,970
This

252
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,600
is unprecedented.

253
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,860
It's definitely because of the Phoenix.

254
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,250
Lady Lingyue.

255
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,860
We're lucky to have you.

256
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,910
Look who you're talking to.

257
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,060
She's peerless and mighty.

258
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,920
Don't say that.

259
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,460
The Imperial Advisor is distinguished.

260
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,880
Let's go.

261
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,340
Let's go.

262
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,990
[For Wei Zhi's Parents. At the right time, the autumn leaves and moon are bright and everything is shining. On August 15th, the Academy's Mid-Autumn Exam ceremony will be held.]

263
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,990
[Egrets fly in deep mountains and goshawks appear in the cliff shore. Thanks to your blessings, we helped each other. I'm honored to have you here.]

264
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,990
[Egret Academy. August 1st]

265
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,610
This is strange.

266
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,370
She's pretty.

267
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,190
The places she passed by

268
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,610
smelled like a bird.

269
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,980
But why am I

270
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,190
not interested in her?

271
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,650
I'm just interested in that girl.

272
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,050
What am I talking about?

273
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,810
Dean.

274
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,660
You've washed so many clothes.

275
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,270
Is this invitation yours?

276
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,340
Yes, thank you.

277
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,560
Do you want me

278
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,270
to ask seniors

279
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,060
to send the invitation to your home?

280
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,950
No, no, no.

281
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,740
Don't worry about it.

282
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,920
We have a lot to do at home.

283
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,980
My mother is busy too.

284
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,290
And her legs are not in good condition.

285
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,230
I'd better not invite her.

286
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,220
If your family can come,

287
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,550
then

288
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,250
ask her to come.

289
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,890
Okay, I'll ask her later.

290
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,980
Wei Zhi.

291
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,340
Why is the jade

292
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,070
gone?

293
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,160
I put it away.

294
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
Put it away?

295
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,170
Why?

296
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,700
Because last time you said

297
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,690
that is rare.

298
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,700
I thought it must be valuable.

299
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,960
So I put it away.

300
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,870
Dean,

301
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,140
I'll hang my clothes first.

302
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,740
Okay.

303
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,640
I urgently asked you here

304
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,589
to

305
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,470
distinguish the Phoenix.

306
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,810
As we all know,

307
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,530
the Immortal-Revealing Mirror worked.

308
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,270
It shows that the Phoenix

309
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,980
is hidden in the 18 students

310
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,980
of the Egret Academy.

311
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,180
For the winner

312
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,260
of the Mid-Autumn Exam,

313
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,570
the Emperor will appoint him

314
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,680
the true Phoenix.

315
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,150
Lord Imperial Advisor.

316
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,420
Do you believe the theory

317
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,990
of the heavens and demons now?

318
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,860
The Phoenix.

319
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,740
How glorious.

320
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,160
How noble.

321
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
How can it be decided

322
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,880
by the cultivation exam?

323
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,910
You are right.

324
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,260
Ming Lang

325
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,000
is intelligent, diligent and gentle.

326
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,090
I think he

327
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,340
has the potential of being the true Phoenix.

328
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,510
No, no, no.

329
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,310
He is simple-minded.

330
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,030
I'm afraid he isn't up to the task.

331
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,550
Don't make excuses in front of me.

332
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,680
Just follow my arrangement.

333
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
Thank you for lifting him up, Lord Imperial Advisor.

334
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,320
[Sifang Inn]

335
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Father, please.

336
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,890
Good.

337
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,660
Father,

338
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,750
I remember your teachings.

339
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,240
I dare not slack off

340
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,100
on schoolwork.

341
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,760
I dare not say

342
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,330
that I'm outstanding.

343
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,390
But

344
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,630
in the academy,

345
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,850
only Lady Wei Lingyue

346
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,700
is better than me.

347
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,260
She is talented,

348
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,840
noble

349
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,700
and very gorgeous.

350
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,860
She is

351
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,670
amazing.

352
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,650
Ming Lang.

353
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,370
Yu Du is different from Gucheng.

354
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,440
The relationships between people

355
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,770
are complicated.

356
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,900
You must know it clearly.

357
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,770
Father,

358
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't understand what you mean.

359
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,240
You and the Lady of Minister Wei

360
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,350
need to keep the friendship as classmates.

361
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,940
As for the rest,

362
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,270
don't think too much.

363
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,120
Father.

364
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,060
But...

365
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,660
Ming Lang.

366
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:42,880
Yes.

367
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,510
I will remember your teachings.

368
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,910
The Mid-Autumn Exam.

369
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,190
Ming Lang.

370
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,000
Show them what you got.

371
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,150
Wei Zhi.

372
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,010
Ming Lang.

373
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,140
Rice Cake.

374
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,590
Where did you get it?

375
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,570
My father came here.

376
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,090
He brought it from Gucheng.

377
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,260
So I brought some for you.

378
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,810
It's really from Gucheng.

379
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,220
It's been a long time

380
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,260
since you have eaten dishes from your hometown.

381
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,620
Take it.

382
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,520
Thank you.

383
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,100
Well,

384
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,420
I haven't seen Uncle Ming for a long time.

385
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,040
How is he?

386
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,650
He...

387
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,330
He's fine.

388
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,060
What's up?

389
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,970
Nothing.

390
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,290
It's just...

391
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,830
What?

392
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,460
I mentioned Lady Wei Jingyue

393
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,200
to my father today.

394
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,300
He seemed unhappy.

395
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,540
Maybe he thought her

396
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,590
is outstanding.

397
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,050
I'm not good enough for her.

398
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,900
You're good at both literature and martial arts.

399
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,110
Lady Wei Jingyue is gentle and kind.

400
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,100
In my heart,

401
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,610
you two are a perfect match.

402
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,930
In my opinion, you're the only one

403
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,510
who can match her in the academy.

404
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,750
But

405
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,240
I always feel

406
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,780
I don't deserve her.

407
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,750
Why not?

408
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,140
Think about it.

409
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,340
You are the third child in your family.

410
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,560
So does she.

411
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,600
You two are equal.

412
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,870
It's equal footing.

413
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Sounds reasonable.

414
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,500
Of course.

415
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,910
Wei Zhi.

416
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,820
Just wait and see.

417
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,210
[Minister's Mansion]

418
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,460
Master,

419
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,040
[Chengxiang Tea]

420
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,940
the parents' invitation

421
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,780
for the Mid-Autumn Festival Party

422
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,980
was just sent to the mansion.

423
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,540
The Lord Ming

424
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,310
has arrived at Yu Du.

425
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,230
I heard

426
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,680
he came, passed by our mansion

427
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,820
and went straight to the Lord Imperial Advisor's Mansion

428
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,220
without stopping.

429
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
This tea tastes good.

430
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,100
It's better than

431
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,830
the tea that Mr. Ming sent

432
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,550
last time.

433
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,920
Master,

434
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,360
why do you only care about

435
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,710
whether the tea tastes good

436
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,200
at this time?

437
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,540
You don't care about

438
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,650
the relationship

439
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,290
between the Imperial Advisor and Lord Ming?

440
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,640
Ming Chengwu.

441
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,490
Imperial Advisor.

442
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,010
They two become closer.

443
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,420
Then our Lady Lingyue

444
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,580
who won't give up

445
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,560
until the end

446
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,990
can be saved.

447
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,300
Go.

448
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,850
Give the tea

449
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,610
to the servants.

450
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,330
Yes, Master.

451
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,710
I wonder how Wei Ye is doing.

452
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,060
I haven't seen him

453
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,390
since I came to the academy.

454
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,730
How about

455
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,460
going home tomorrow?

456
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,920
Maybe mother

457
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,620
want to attend

458
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,770
the Mid-Autumn Exam.

459
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,840
[Xinju Hall]

460
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,940
Come on.

461
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,010
Wei Ye.

462
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,220
Sis.

463
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:07,940
Come and see

464
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,060
what I brought you.

465
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,380
Look.

466
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,260
What is this?

467
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,830
This is the rice cake I told you about.

468
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,410
The best cake in the world.

469
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,690
Let me help.

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,790
Try it.

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,350
How is it?

472
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,600
It's delicious.

Well,

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,510
the Mid-Autumn Exam is coming.

477
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,640
This time, we're holding a big banquet

478
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,100
to invite our parents.

479
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,850
Mother, do you want some rice cake?

480
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,880
It's delicious.

481
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,120
Where did you get it?

482
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,880
I bought it on the way.

483
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,570
Go inside.

484
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,810
Rice cakes are so precious.

485
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,460
How could you

486
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,380
buy it

487
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,440
on the way with a little money?

488
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,160
Tell me the truth.

489
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,770
Where did you get it?

490
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,950
It's from Ming Lang.

491
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,260
What?

492
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,420
The third young master of the Ming family.

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,420
He is

494
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,600
my classmate at Egret Academy.

495
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,790
All these years,

496
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,780
we are

497
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,160
hiding around.

498
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,380
Why?

499
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,280
You want us to die?

500
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,240

Mother.

505
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,190
Why did you

506
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,080
lock her up?

507
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,990
She has grown up.

508
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,970
It's time to get married.

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,500
Mrs. Gu.

510
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,130
I haven't been called that

511
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,220
for a long time.

512
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,130
I am

513
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,240
the dean of Egret Academy.

514
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,060
I saw Fengzhi

515
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,910
in the academy.

516
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,070
Father.

517
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,080
Priest.

518
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,400
He said

519
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,150
he would leave tomorrow.

520
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,210
Is the carriage ready?

521
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,810
Yes.

522
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,740
Father, don't worry.

523
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,140
It's just that you came from afar.

524
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,670
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

525
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,190
I've been traveling

526
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,090
so I'm used to moving around freely.

527
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,350
My daughter-in-law

528
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,480
is an excellent homemaker.

529
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,860
It's just that Yuanshan has been away from home all year long.

530
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,650
We're sorry for her.

531
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,530
Not at all, father.

532
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,600
Yuanshan took over your position

533
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,490
and inherited the position of City Governor.

534
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,980
He should have his duty.

535
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,840
I don't know

536
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,180
when I can play chess

537
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,820
with you again.

538
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,900
There will be a chance.

539
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,060
Come down. Come down,

540
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,290
Come and play.

541
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,990
-Fengzhi. -This is the daughter of Yuanshan.

542
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,700
She is Fengzhi, right?

543
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,290
Yes.

544
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,080
Fengzhi, come here.

545
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,120
Greetings to the priest.

546
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,260
Grandpa.

547
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,370
Priest!

548
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,470
Priest.

549
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,300
Do you think my bracelet is pretty?

550
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,920
Grandpa gave it to me.

551
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,220
It's pretty.

552
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,570
Fengzhi.

553
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,590
Listen to your grandpa

554
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,570
and mother.

555
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,570
Okay.

556
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,130
After you left,

557
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,330
the mansion has been peaceful for a while.

558
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,060
I just hope that Yuanshan

559
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,230
can return with meritorious service.

560
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,090
But at this moment,

561
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,850
an imperial edict

562
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,240
changed everything.

563
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,330
From the God's blessings, behold the message of the emperor that

564
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,300
Gu Fengzhi, the witch of Gucheng, would bring disaster to the country,

565
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,050
caused drought and made people restless.

566
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,950
Thus, Gu Fengzhi will be offered as a sacrifice to the god to pray for the rain.

567
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,160
Respect it!

568
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,490
Father.

569
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,620
Take the food on the way.

570
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,740
When you arrive,

571
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,750
send a letter back.

572
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,220
Don't worry.

573
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,250
Fengzhi.

574
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,060
I can't be with you anymore.

575
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,020
You must listen to grandpa.

576
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,400
Duo.

577
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,170
Take care of her.

578
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,000
Grandpa, mother.

579
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,090
What did Fengzhi do wrong?

580
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,300
Why are we moving out?

581
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,510
Why do they call me a witch?

582
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,780
You're right.

583
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,560
Those bad guys used natural disasters

584
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,300
to slander our good girl.

585
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,210
Master, Young Madam!

586
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,260
Master, Young Madam, bad news!

587
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,510
The gate is surrounded by refugees.

588
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,930
Use the back door.

589
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:31,980
Let's go.

590
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,670
Gu Huaixuan.

591
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,340
If you continue to resist,

592
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,050
everyone in Gu mansion

593
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,310
will be executed.

594
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,630
Madam.

595
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,660
Where is she going?

596
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,560
Burn her!

597
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,480
Burn her to death!

598
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,570
It's noon.

599
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,430
The worship of the God of Earth ceremony begins!

600
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,650
Burn her to death!

601
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,980
Burn her!

602
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,380
Burn her!

603
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,430
Burn her!

604
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,210
Burn her!

605
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,380
Burn her!

606
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,460
Burn her!

607
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,300
Burn her!

608
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,220
Burn her!

609
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,300
Burn her!

610
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,300
Burn her!

611
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,260
Burn her!

612
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,270
Burn her!

613
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,220
Burn her!

614
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,260
Burn her!

615
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,300
Burn her!

616
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,210
Burn her to death!

617
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,260
Fire!

618
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,390
You!

619
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,980
Fengzhi!

620
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,080
Burn her! Burn her!

621
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,500
Burn her to death!

622
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,030
Fengzhi!

623
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,160
Don't come any closer.

624
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,100
I'll lose my temper if you come any closer.

625
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,620
Burn her to death!

626
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,590
Burn her!

627
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,580
Burn her!

628
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,700
Burn her to death!

629
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,590
Burn her!

630
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,060
Burn her to death!

631
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,060
Burn her!

632
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,980
Burn her to death!

633
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,820
Come!

634
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:29,880
Hurry up!

635
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,300
Burn this witch to death!

636
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,130
Father, help!

637
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,050
Fengzhi!

638
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,780
The Gu family

639
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,980
rebelled.

640
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,980
I just want to save my daughter.

641
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,780
I have no intention of rebellion.

642
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,060
Arrest them!

643
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,540
Father!

644
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,580
Grandpa!

645
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,040
Grandpa!

646
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,570
Grandpa!

647
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,530
Grandpa!

648
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,260
Grandpa!

649
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,390
Grandpa!

650
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,640
Grandpa!

651
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,940
Grandpa!

652
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,800
Fengzhi.

653
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,520
Fengzhi.

654
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,710
Grandpa!

655
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,429
Grandpa!

656
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,940
Grandpa!

657
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,300
Grandpa!

658
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,420
Grandpa!

659
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,700
Father.

660
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,710
Fengzhi.

661
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,340
Father.

662
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Father!

663
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,830
Grandpa.

664
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,020
Let's go.

665
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,070
Let's leave.

666
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,290
Grandpa.

667
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,060
Mother, let me help you.

668
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,880
[Yu Du]

669
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,680
Wait.

670
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,130
Go.

671
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,760
I didn't expect it.

672
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,160
This...

673
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,980
Back then,

674
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,010
I traveled

675
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,470
to Yu Du.

676
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,180
I stayed at Egret Academy

677
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,510
by chance.

678
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,120
Soon,

679
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,710
I heard the news.

680
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,450
I was really heartbroken.

681
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,390
I thought

682
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,260
I would never see

683
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,160
people from Gu family anymore.

684
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,780
Until

685
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,690
I recognized the jade bracelet

686
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,860
that Wei Zhi wore.

687
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,720
And then I recognized her.

688
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,370
Mrs. Gu.

689
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,720
you've suffered these years.

690
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,780
What is your plan

691
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,080
for the future?

692
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,270
My only wish

693
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,630
is to

694
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,550
bring up

695
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,250
the only son of the Gu family.

696
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,890
What about Fengzhi?

697
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,810
What about Weizhi?

698
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,600
Even after so many years,

699
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,300
whenever I saw her,

700
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,060
I would think of the death of the whole clan.

701
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,020
Blood all over the ground.

702
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,010
Fire all over the mountain.

703
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,610
She's my flesh and blood.

704
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,560
But...

705
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,270
there's no way not to hate her.
