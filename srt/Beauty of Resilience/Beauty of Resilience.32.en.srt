[Episode 32]

4
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,820
Can you stop talking nonsense?

5
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
Quickly find a way.

6
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,860
What can I do?

7
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,940
This bird egg

8
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,100
has been here for so long.

9
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
It's the Phoenix's child.

10
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,980
Stop calling it a bird egg.

11
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,060
Phoenix egg... Phoenix egg...

12
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,860
How come you keep getting older

13
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,060
but not any wiser?

14
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,100
You've lived in vain.

15
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,340
I think

16
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,260
we should find a sensible person

17
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,260
and ask them.

18
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,500
Where can an insect escape?

19
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Stop!

20
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,690
Why are you here?

21
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,530
Well...

22
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,700
Is this the reliable person

23
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,580
you wanted to find?

24
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,820
Why are you alone?

25
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,500
Where is Yi'er?

26
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,930
Thank you.

27
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,820
Before leaving, Yi'er said

28
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,100
that if we have any questions,

29
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
we should come here to find her.

30
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,260
But...

31
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,540
Are you looking for the East Kitchen God

32
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,260
just for this bird egg?

33
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,540
What bird egg?

34
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,579
I think there's something wrong

35
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,540
with both of you.

36
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,340
What else can it be?

37
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,980
This is a Phoenix's...

38
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,980
It's... It's a special

39
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,140
and very rare egg

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,340
from a bird king.

41
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,220
Got it!

42
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,380
You're saving a rare animal.

43
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,140
Exactly! We want to save a rare animal.

44
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,220
If we don't save it,

45
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
it will become extinct.

46
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,380
We must save it then.

47
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,700
Right?

48
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,380
Then, please ask the East Kitchen God

49
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,100
to show herself.

50
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,380
The East Kitchen God

51
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,100
is currently in the Heavenly Court.

52
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,140
Then quickly ask her to come here.

53
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,940
She...

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,380
She's been banned by the Heavenly Empress from going out.

55
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,260
She can’t come.

56
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,420
Then, why didn't you say this earlier?

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
I'm here for you when Yi'er is not.

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,780
Yes! Yes!

59
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,820
We have her!

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,900
Honey, have a seat.

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,339
Do you have any good idea?

62
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,579
Fortunately, I'm also the last disciple

63
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,540
of the Rain God.

64
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,459
If I didn't have good skills, I wouldn't have been

65
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,820
able to attend to this fertile land of Yingzhou.

66
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,540
Give me this.

67
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,140
Please.

68
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,140
Thank you, High Immortal.

69
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,659
This is the resting soil.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900
It's the most valuable soil in the world.

71
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,700
No matter how precious, isn't it just soil?

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,380
Is it reliable?

73
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,900
This...

74
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
This...

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,820
This resting soil only treats the symptoms.

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,780
It'd be better for you

77
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,220
to quickly find the bird's mother.

78
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,540
No!

79
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,700
Wait!

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,340
How can you just go?

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,140
I must go to the Demon Realm.

82
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,420
The High Immortal said that it  only

83
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,380
treats the symptoms not the root cause.

84
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,340
If something happens to this child,

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,540
how will we face Wei Zhi?

86
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,100
Let's go together then.

87
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,340
No!

88
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,260
If you go,

89
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,460
who will take care of this child?

90
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Well...

91
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,380
Together!

92
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,340
It's such a big egg.

93
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,540
Isn't it heavy for you to carry?

94
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,020
I can carry you easily.

95
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,900
This egg is nothing.

96
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,340
No.

97
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,540
It will be terrible

98
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,020
if the Heavenly Emperor finds out.

99
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,580
Right.

100
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,580
Then, how about this?

101
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,580
You stay,

102
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,260
and I'll go find the Phoenix.

103
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,820
No!

104
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,220
Why not?

105
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,900
What if

106
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,780
you get bewitched by

107
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,700
some seductive, despicable devil

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,660
and don't want to come back?

109
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,220
I'll strangle you to death.

110
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,460
Got it!

111
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,980
You...

112
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,020
care about me, right?

113
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,130
But...

114
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,140
I can't do this or that.

115
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,780
Then, there's no other way.

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,540
What are you doing?

117
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,340
I have an idea.

118
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,260
Demon Duke.

119
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,900
Father.

120
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,380
Continue.

121
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,980
Don't mind me.

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,580
Don't be nervous.

123
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
Adjust your breathing and control your thoughts.

124
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,660
Do it one more time.

125
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,540
Teacher.

126
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,900
I can't do it.

127
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,460
It's okay.

128
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,100
Let's stop here today.

129
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,980
Go play.

130
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,820
Yan Xiaomo.

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,820
You don't take classes seriously,

132
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,900
and all you do is play around.

133
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,900
My slingshot!

134
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,780
Stop!

135
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,010
If you want to play,

136
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,340
go get it yourself.

137
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,260
I told you to teleport up there,

138
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,900
not to choose the easy way.

139
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,020
Alright.

140
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Dogma is static,

141
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
while ideas are dynamic and alive.

142
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,380
It's already great

143
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,140
that Mo can creatively infer other ways

144
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,020
from one instance.

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,340
You don't have to be so strict.

146
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,780
You don't have to defend him.

147
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,100
I must

148
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,220
teach him a lesson today.

149
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,460
Demon Duke.

150
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,419
Teacher, you're amazing!

151
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,460
What kind of magic is this?

152
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,420
It's called the Solar Corona.

153
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,580
The Solar Corona?

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,860
Teach it to me.

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,940
Promise me

156
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,700
you won't punish Mo again.

157
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,980
I will teach you then.

158
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Okay, it's a deal.

159
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,700
Consider yourself lucky.

160
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,700
Go.

161
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,820
Give me your hand.

162
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,420
Your hand! Left hand.

163
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,060
Dear.

164
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,580
Why do you keep

165
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,980
looking at your hand?

166
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,940
Today, there was magic

167
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,940
called the Solar Corona.

168
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,700
Its shape is like a glowing sphere.

169
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,220
It can envelop a person

170
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,980
and make them invulnerable to any attacks.

171
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,700
Is it that magical?

172
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Yes.

173
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,220
I didn't expect her magic

174
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,180
to be so great.

175
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,580
I really

176
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,740
underestimated her in the past.

177
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,220
Besides, she promised to teach me.

178
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,180
She asked me

179
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,100
to put out my left hand

180
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,700
and drew a circle on my hand.

181
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,580
She then said that she'd finished teaching me,

182
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
and I would have to experience the rest on my own.

183
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,460
What do you think she meant by that?

184
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,460
She might be hinting

185
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,940
that any skill

186
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,300
requires time,

187
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,420
and you shouldn't be over-anxious

188
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
or rushed.

189
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,460
She used this to point out

190
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
that I shouldn't be too strict with Mo.

191
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,700
This teacher...

192
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,580
Is really smart.

193
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,620
Fortunately, you're here.

194
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,500
You immediately grasped the underlying meaning.

195
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,220
However,

196
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,620
this Magic of Solar Corona

197
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,170
doesn't have a mental method

198
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,820
or a spell.

199
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,620
She also said I've already learned it.

200
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,580
So,

201
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,100
how do I use this move?

202
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,340
You did it!

203
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,820
Wei Zhi.

204
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,460
Who are you calling?

205
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,620
Demon Queen.

206
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,500
I remembered that I was the one

207
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,220
who put the jade pendant in this box.

208
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
This is the love token

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,100
the Demon Duke gave me.

210
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,580
What?

211
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Do you recognize it?

212
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,940
My husband

213
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,620
once gave me a jade pendant

214
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,980
that looked very similar to this one.

215
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,570
This is unique.

216
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,820
Thanks to you,

217
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,860
Yan Xiaomo's skills

218
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,180
have improved a lot.

219
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,860
Yes.

220
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,460
This child is very talented.

221
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,460
According to the northern part of the Demon Realm,

222
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,210
there have been many clans

223
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,500
from other regions coming here recently.

224
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,420
Go there and look.

225
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,860
Maybe you can find your husband.

226
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,740
Thank you, Demon Queen.

227
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,340
But...

228
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
It seems that I've already

229
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,940
received news about my husband.

230
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,820
If given enough time,

231
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
the truth will surely be revealed.

232
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,420
That's great then.

233
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,340
I hope you and your husband

234
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,340
will be reunited soon.

235
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,460
Wei Zhi.

236
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,060
I treat you as my friend.

237
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,500
Are you hiding anything from me?

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Demon Queen,

239
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,460
I also treat you as my good friend.

240
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Are you hiding anything from me?

241
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,740
I won't let anyone

242
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,420
hit on my husband.

243
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,700
Of course. Me too.

244
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,420
Slow down! Slow down!

245
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,980
Don't drop it.

246
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,580
You know what? It looks real.

247
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,500
It won't fall off.

248
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,940
Su, we're here.

249
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,980
This is the legendary

250
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,100
Weak River Barrier?

251
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,060
Yes, this is it.

252
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,700
Let's not waste time and quickly go inside.

253
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,460
Let's go.

254
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Su, are you okay?

255
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,460
I'm fine.

256
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,820
The barrier is very strong.

257
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,220
How can we get in?

258
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
Let me try.

259
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,340
I can't believe it.

260
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,460
We can't get in.

261
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,340
Then, how did Wei Zhi get in?

262
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,500
What happened?

263
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,620
I used to be able to get in.

264
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,500
No.

265
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,500
I'll try again.

266
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,180
Are they looking down on me,

267
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,940
the prince of the Wolf Clan?

268
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,220
Don't waste your energy.

269
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,180
You two can't get in.

270
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,340
Who?

271
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
After several battles,

272
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,980
the barrier has been reinforced.

273
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,700
You can only break the barrier

274
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,620
with this.

275
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,460
Old man, don't try to fool us.

276
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,860
You want to make some kind of a deal with us,

277
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,420
right?

278
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,620
We won't be fooled by you.

279
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,420
Someone

280
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,460
has already made a deal on your behalf.

281
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,100
Made a deal on our behalf?

282
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,300
The Dean of Egret Academy.

283
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,940
The Dean?

284
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,300
That's right.

285
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,420
The thing he left me before he left

286
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,100
is enough to trade for this with you.

287
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,330
Where did that old man go?

288
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,700
It really opened.

289
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,300
What did the dean

290
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,980
leave with Elder Mu?

291
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,380
Who cares?

292
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,619
It's open.

293
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,420
Let's go.

294
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,140
Demon Duke,

295
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,900
we caught two suspicious members of the Devil Clan.

296
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,420
The Demon Queen has already interrogated them.

297
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,700
Untie them.

298
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,440
Wei Zhi!

299
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,390
This is like the flood

300
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,770
that swept away the Dragon King's temple.

301
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,460
Lan Su and I have been looking for you for quite a while.

302
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,460
Your bird egg...

303
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,220
No, no! Child.

304
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,620
Something is wrong with the child.

305
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,980
Come back with us now.

306
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

307
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,700
You...

308
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,740
Your bird... Your Phoenix egg...

309
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,060
Your child from Yan Yue.

310
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,460
Is...

311
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,180
How dare you!

312
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,460
Take these two,

313
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,220
who are spreading false rumors,

314
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
and put them in prison.

315
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,460
No! What's wrong with her?

316
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,700
Yan... Yan Yue!

317
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,020
What happened between you and Wei Zhi?

318
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,700
One became foolish, while the other went crazy.

319
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,220
Dear.

320
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,940
These two disrespectful foreigners

321
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,020
trespassed the Demon Realm.

322
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,260
Just now, this scoundrel had the audacity

323
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,140
to disrespect me while you were away.

324
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,980
He said that the child

325
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,420
inside this woman's womb is yours.

326
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,980
No! this...

327
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,020
This originally is...

328
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Lan Su!

329
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,980
Ou Ya, don't worry about me.

330
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,980
Quickly go!

331
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,540
Wei Zhi!

332
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,740
Wei Zhi, it's you, right?

333
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,620
I brought

334
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,420
you and Yan Yue's child.

335
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,740
You have to...

336
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,380
The Heavenly Court sent the Red Sun God

337
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,540
to kill the Phoenix.

338
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,450
Who would have thought that fate would play tricks on us?

339
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,060
The Red Sun God

340
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,450
has committed an unforgivable crime.

341
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,460
Teacher.

342
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,220
Quickly tell us.

343
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,660
What happened to the Red Sun God?

344
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,460
What crime did he commit?

345
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,180
He fell in love

346
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,540
with his enemy, the Phoenix.

347
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,140
So, Yan Yue's wife was originally a Phoenix.

348
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,220
This...

349
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,620
If you're not Wei Zhi,

350
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,300
then who are you?

351
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,700
Who are you?

352
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,980
Lock her up.

353
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,060
What did you do to Wei Zhi?

354
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,460
What should I do?

355
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,900
Demon Queen, what can I do for you?

356
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
These wooden sculptures

357
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,860
are very important to the Demon Duke.

358
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,940
Put them down.

359
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,850
Sorry.

360
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,900
I let myself in

361
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,140
when I saw that no one was here.

362
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,660
My husband

363
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,890
also likes carving figures.

364
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,380
They're very similar to these.

365
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,220
Who are you?

366
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,450
Have you not had

367
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,300
any suspicions these days

368
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,420
that my husband and yours

369
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,660
might be the same person? Stop it!

370
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,020
He's my husband!

371
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,500
Mo's father.

372
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,220
He doesn't recognize you

373
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,780
or remember you.

374
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,620
We've went through a catastrophe

375
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,980
and finally reunited.

376
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,740
He just lost his memory.

377
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,980
Like I said,

378
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,980
this pair of wooden carvings

379
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,610
depict the way

380
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,900
we used to live.

381
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,980
I'll now regard you

382
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,700
as a silly woman who's spouting nonsense

383
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,180
after losing her husband.

384
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,660
Have you never asked him?

385
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,620
The Demon Realm is so big.

386
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,980
Why did he insist on

387
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,060
choosing to live in such a house?

388
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,940
The Demon Duke likes this place.

389
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,220
There's no particular reason.

390
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,500
The moment I walked into this room,

391
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,930
it felt very familiar to me.

392
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,260
It's similar to the one

393
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,180
we lived in

394
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,620
back in Taoyuan Village.

395
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,700
That's impossible!

396
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,220
Who are you?

397
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,220
What do you want to do?

398
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,220
You can't return

399
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,780
to your previous appearance, right?

400
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,060
You...

401
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,180
So, I'm the one whom he loves now.

402
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,500
No matter what you say or do,

403
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,380
it's all useless.

404
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
The great story

405
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,780
between the two of you

406
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,980
is now a thing of the past.

407
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,420
Don't interfere

408
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,740
in our current story.

409
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,500
I love my husband

410
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,220
and my child very much.

411
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,460
My love for him won't weaken

412
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,460
in the slightest because of you.

413
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,700
Listen carefully!

414
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
No one

415
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
can separate us.

416
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
How can you be like this?

417
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,980
You...

418
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,220
Guards!

419
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,380
Send this outsider

420
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,740
to the northern border.

421
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,500
She wants to go find her husband.

422
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,220
Yes.

423
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,420
Teacher!

424
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,700
Father! Mother!

425
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,140
The Teacher was taken away.

426
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,220
Demon Duke.

427
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,980
Where is Yan Xiaomo's teacher?

428
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,460
What about the Madam?

429
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,220
She should be in the house.

430
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,420
Honey.

431
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,650
Where's the teacher?

432
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,660
Yan Xiaomo's teacher, Wei Zhi.

433
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,980
She just came to bid her farewell.

434
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,740
I let her go.

435
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,540
She wants to leave?

436
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,740
She said that she wanted to leave.

437
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,700
And...

438
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,860
Yan Xiaomo's skills

439
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,780
have improved a lot recently.

440
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,740
She can't find her husband here,

441
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,260
so she's going to the northern border to look for him.

442
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,970
I saw how desperate she was to find him,

443
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,220
so I didn't stop her.

444
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,490
I also prepared

445
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,460
food and water for her,

446
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,860
and sent her away.

447
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,140
Are you really

448
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
saying the truth?

449
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,940
Have I ever lied to you before?

450
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,180
Yan Xiaomo told me

451
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,540
that his teacher was abducted.

452
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,740
Do you mean

453
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,380
I'm making this up?

454
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,020
I didn't mean that.

455
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
So, you rushed over here

456
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,980
to ask about the teacher's whereabouts?

457
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm afraid that Yan Xiaomo will be anxious

458
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,780
and won't bear his teacher leaving.

459
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,500
Is Mo the one who can't bear her leaving

460
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,740
or you?

461
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,180
What do you mean

462
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,050
by this?

463
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,180
It's clear.

464
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
Honey.

465
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,460
Why is it so cold?

466
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,620
What happened to your hand?

467
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,980
You don't bear her leaving, right?

468
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,980
No.

469
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,620
It's just that...

470
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,140
I think she's a mortal.

471
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,220
What's wrong with you?

472
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,540
Why are you suddenly jealous?

473
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,980
Mother, I'm hungry.

474
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,380
We'll eat now.

475
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,700
I remember.

476
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,740
We were recuperating in a small village.

477
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,420
We had neighbors there.

478
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,700
The man of the house was called...

479
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,300
Numb Guy!

480
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,780
I really admired them.

481
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,620
So,

482
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,980
I carved them

483
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,020
to show you.

484
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,450
Then, I'll give an order

485
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,060
to help Wei Zhi find Numb Guy.

486
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,130
Anything else?

487
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,420
No.

488
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,700
Wei Zhi.

489
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,620
Where are you?

490
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,380
A mortal?

491
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,460
Today,

492
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,700
I can finally taste

493
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,300
the human flesh.

494
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,460
This dinner

495
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,940
is mine.

496
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,660
Wu Mu!

497
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,900
It's me!

498
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,300
Wei Zhi!

499
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,860
Wei Zhi?

500
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,770
Look!

501
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,220
Saintess.

502
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,260
This means

503
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,020
that you're the only one

504
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,660
among the four guardians

505
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,980
who's stationed here.

506
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,410
The other three have already established

507
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,460
their respective forces.

508
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,020
Then, the entire Demon Realm scattered.

509
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,980
The topics related to you,

510
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,260
the legend of the Demon Realm,

511
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,220
and the Phoenix have become taboo.

512
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,220
As time went by,

513
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,540
they gradually disappeared.

514
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,940
As for Yan Yue...

515
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,700
Our Lord

516
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,980
passed all his power to him

517
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,980
before he left.

518
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,050
I couldn't find any trace of him at all.

519
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,860
I didn't expect...

520
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,500
He's in the Demon Clan.

521
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,060
In addition,

522
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
he has established his own force.

523
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,740
He has already forgotten about the past,

524
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,140
and he's living happily.

525
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,980
Then, do you have any plans for the future?

526
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,460
I haven't decided yet.

527
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,780
Everyone related to Phoenix

528
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,010
had a tragic fate.

529
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,220
I don't want to bring Yan Yue back

530
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,860
to his former state,

531
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,660
and I'm not ready to let it go like this.

532
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,900
It's okay.

533
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
We'll talk about it

534
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,460
after you've made up your mind.

535
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,180
You are the Saintess.

536
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,780
The gate of the Holy Temple

537
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,460
is always open for you.

538
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,660
Do you know

539
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,780
what you are doing?

540
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,660
I'll teach you a lesson on behalf of Wei Zhi!

541
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,780
How can you

542
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,900
teach me a lesson when you're like this?

543
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,860
You are still the Red Sun God

544
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,500
who has no feelings.

545
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,020
Wei Zhi risked so much

546
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,980
to come to find you,

547
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,780
but it was all for nothing in the end.

548
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,690
What are you talking about?

549
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,220
I don't understand at all.

550
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,260
Something is wrong with my memory.

551
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,700
I don't remember anything

552
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,140
of what you said.

553
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,860
But, it seems to be related to my past.

554
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,740
So,

555
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,660
I came here to ask you.

556
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,980
For the time being, I'll believe

557
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,460
that you haven't regained your memory.

558
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,020
Listen carefully then.

559
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,260
Your original identity

560
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,220
is the Red Sun God of the Heaven Realm.

561
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,740
Many years ago,

562
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,460
you were ordered to kill the Phoenix,

563
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,690
but you fell in love with the Phoenix.

564
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,500
She got pregnant with your child.

565
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,860
You tried to resist,

566
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,700
but you couldn't in the end.

567
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,980
So, you lost

568
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,700
all your memories of her.

569
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,460
The Phoenix was unconscious

570
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,020
in the Devil Realm for decades.

571
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,260
You fell into the Demon Realm, and no one

572
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,660
has heard any news about you ever since.

573
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,940
The first thing Wei Zhi thought about

574
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,540
when she woke up was to find you.

575
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,740
If she sees you

576
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
with another woman,

577
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,180
she'll be devastated.

578
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,620
Do you mean that the husband

579
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,220
Wei Zhi is looking for is me?

580
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,180
But, how can't I

581
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,380
remember anything?

582
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,460
What? You met Wei Zhi?

583
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
Then why did you

584
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
find someone

585
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,380
who looks like her?

586
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,700
Ever since I can remember,

587
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,740
the Demon Queen

588
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,660
has been by my side.

589
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,500
You were clearly alone

590
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,420
when you fell into the Demon Realm.

591
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,540
How could have the Demon Queen accompany you?

592
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,970
Stop making excuses

593
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,780
for your betrayal.

594
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,610
What is this?

595
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,180
Where am I?

596
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,220
By the way,

597
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,420
where is the baby that was in your womb?

598
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,020
Your Demon Queen took it.

599
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,139
Where are you going?

600
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,940
Let me go first!

601
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,340
Yan Yue!

602
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,780
Just send it here.

603
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,739
This is the only universal transmission talisman

604
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,300
refined by Our Lord during his lifetime.

605
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,100
You were the most precious person

606
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,060
to Our Lord during his lifetime.

607
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,380
Now,

608
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,739
you can make the most of everything.

609
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,139
Thank you.

610
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,179
Monster, I'll fight with you!

611
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:45,900
Ou Ya!

612
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,170
This is...

613
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,820
Why are you here?

614
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,500
I thought it was a pursuer,

615
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,340
and I'd die here today.

616
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,380
Who wants to kill you?

617
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,580
Who are you?

618
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,420
It's me, Wei Zhi!

619
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,460
Wei Zhi?

620
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,660
Don't lie to me.

621
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,580
Wei Zhi is with Yan Yue now.

622
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,340
I'm really Wei Zhi.

623
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,970
Elder Mu changed my face

624
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,420
so that I can enter the Demon Realm.

625
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,490
The one you saw

626
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,330
by Yan Yue's side

627
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,540
was not me at all.

628
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,500
You really smell like Wei Zhi.

629
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,380
But...

630
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,180
What happened

631
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,420
to your face?

632
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,980
You are the prince of the Wolf Clan.

633
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
You and your wife Lan Su

634
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,860
love each other.

635
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,660
However,

636
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,980
you used to be a playboy before.

637
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,140
In Egret Academy,

638
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,780
you once even pretended to be...

639
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,740
Stop!

640
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,020
I got it!

641
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,460
I believe you.

642
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,940
Then, have you seen Yan Yue?

643
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,980
I did.

644
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,940
You saw him?

645
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,260
Why aren't you with him?

646
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,900
Why did you come out now?

647
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,460
Also,

648
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,100
who is

649
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,890
that Demon Queen

650
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,780
who looks exactly like you?

651
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,940
I also don't know who she is.

652
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,260
It doesn't matter anyway.

653
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,420
But you...

654
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,860
What happened to you?

655
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,020
Who is after you?

656
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,980
Wei Zhi.

657
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,180
Please save your child

658
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
and Lan Su as soon as possible.

659
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,740
That day...

660
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,100
Lan Su and I saw that the fluorescent light

661
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,100
of the eggshell disappeared.

662
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,820
So,

663
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,300
Lan Su and I were very worried.

664
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,260
We wanted to bring the child

665
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,140
to see you.

666
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,420
I didn't expect that Yan Yue

667
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,060
would want to kill me and Lan Su.

668
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,300
They caught Lan Su.

669
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,060
And now

670
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,780
they've also taken away your child.

671
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,940
I hardly managed

672
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,860
to escape.

673
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,260
I must save them now.

674
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,660
My child.

675
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,340
My love.

676
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,020
I'll come to you now.

677
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,490
Yan Yue,

678
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,580
I won't let anyone else be with you.

679
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,060
Honey!

680
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,620
What are you doing?

681
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,660
I think

682
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,370
this thing

683
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,620
will bring us bad luck.

684
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,740
I want to get rid of it.

685
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,300
Bad luck?

686
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,660
You've never believed in these things.

687
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,020
I feel I have a connection with this thing.

688
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,820
Why don't we keep it?

689
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,820
No!

690
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,860
What's wrong?

691
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,380
Why are you acting so strange?

692
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,970
You're the one who's acting strange.

693
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,380
You always comply with me.

694
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,980
You also said I could do anything.

695
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,420
Why are you stopping me today

696
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,980
when I want to deal

697
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,060
with something I hate?

698
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,780
Did you believe

699
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,500
the nonsense

700
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,460
those two Devils spouted?

701
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,940
Don't believe them!

702
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,660
I must

703
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,730
