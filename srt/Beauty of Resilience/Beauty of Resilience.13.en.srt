4
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,260
By the way, My Lord.

5
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,460
I have to correct

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,110
what you said before.

7
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm not a cunning fox.

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm a wolf.

9
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,910
It's all because

10
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,850
we haven't seen each other for so many years.

11
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,820
From now on,

12
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,950
we should meet more often.

13
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,280
He tried to kill me.

14
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,020
You are stupid.

15
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,510
How dare you get involved in the Phoenix's matter?

16
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,510
Do you want to kill

17
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,140
the whole Fox Clan?

18
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,210
What do you want me to do?

19
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,610
how can I say no

20
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,810
to Ou Ya?

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,010
Ou Ya, again!

22
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,880
Brother, calm down.

23
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,930
I'm not in the mood.

24
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:05,950
Now the Devil King

25
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,260
knows about the Phoenix.

26
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,990
The Demon Realm is furious

27
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,110
and swears to find the Phoenix.

28
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,280
In order to buy time,

29
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,710
the Devil King has to make a soldier writ.

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,470
He will not only hand over the Phoenix,

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
but also find out the one

32
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,450
lured the Phoenix to the Devil Realm

33
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,470
in five days,

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,540
and punish him severely.

35
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,540
From now on,

36
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,930
stay at home.

37
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,670
Don't cause any more trouble.

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,210
Is it that serious?

39
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,070
I have to tell Ou YA.

40
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,070
Hurry up! Hurry up!

41
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,790
You're in big trouble!

42
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,780
What do you mean?

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
The Demon Realm is going to start a war in Tianyao City,

44
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,510
and ordered the Devil King

45
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,700
to hand over the initiator in five days?

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,890
I...

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,940
Leave now.

48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,190
And come back when things are over.

49
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,950
What are you waiting for?

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,980
Go!

51
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,329
Wait.

52
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,770
W-Where can I go?

53
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,680
Go wherever you want.

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,710
Just leave here.

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,880
Go.

56
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,100
Ou Ya.

57
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,980
Take care of yourself.

58
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,380
OK.

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Take good care of yourself.

60
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,890
Clothes get dirty.

61
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,750
Garland withers.

62
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,480
Armpit sweats.

63
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,700
Body smells.

64
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,480
Feeling restless.

65
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,960
Auntie.

66
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,500
What's wrong?

67
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm fine.

68
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,430
You are full of worries.

69
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,159
You just went to the Heavenly Emperor's place?

70
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,140
Did you two fight?

71
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,100
Impossible.

72
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,340
Why did you two fight?

73
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,870
He cares about the people,

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,610
You are a motherly model.

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,600
Do you know

76
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,040
the five anomalies of the Immortal?

77
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,980
Five anomalies of the Immortal?

78
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,480
Clothes get dirty. Garland withers.

79
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,680
Armpit sweats. Body smells.

80
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,150
Feeling restless.

81
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,870
They are used to describe

82
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,780
that someone will die soon.

83
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,030
But Auntie,

84
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,890
we are immortals.

85
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,960
We will live forever.

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,280
Don't worry.

87
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,530
Actually, immortals

88
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,310
will die one day.

89
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,370
We

90
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
have a long life,

91
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,490
so people think

92
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,100
we can live forever.

93
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,820
Auntie.

94
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,650
You smell good.

95
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,440
It's fine.

96
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,490
Auntie.

97
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,400
What's wrong?

98
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,610
Did something happen?

99
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,960
I

100
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,940
read the ancient book by accident.

101
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,540
I was just emotional.

102
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,190
How about I make some desserts

103
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,260
for you?

104
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,850
A bowl of dessert can relieve all your worries.

105
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,570
I guarantee that it'll brighten your heart

106
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,000
after you taste it.

107
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,950
Food.

108
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,960
If it's really that magical,

109
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,390
can it turn

110
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,380
the white hair black?

111
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,350
Of course not.

112
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,830
The elixir

113
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,970
is not that effective.

114
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,290
Let alone the grains.

115
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,460
I'm tired.

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,840
I need to take a rest.

117
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,440
Auntie.

118
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,990
Auntie!

119
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,960
Auntie has indeed

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,070
more wrinkles.

121
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,950
Could it be that

122
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,310
she also has white hair?

123
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,820
That's why

124
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,810
she had that feeling.

125
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,190
Got it.

126
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,860
Prophet.

127
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,920
Ou Ya.

128
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,640
Did you meet

129
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,470
the girl

130
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,270
you adore so much?

131
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,060
Yes, I met her.

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,570
She's the phoenix.

133
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,960
Prophet.

134
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,120
I listened to you.

135
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,220
I have kept her

136
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,120
by my side.

137
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,500
I believe I can change

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,430
the fate of the Devil Realm.

139
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,170
For the danger of the Demon Realm

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,640
lasts for thousands of years,

141
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,170
I finally see a little hope.

142
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,650
Get the Phoenix's tail feather

143
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,330
and put it in the source

144
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,400
of the fountain of life in the Demon Realm.

145
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,150
Then we can change

146
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,200
the fate of the Devil Clan.

147
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,450
Ou Ya.

148
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,310
Your obsession with Phoenix.

149
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,190
That's just affected by

150
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,660
the scent of the Phoenix.

151
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
Don't

152
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,240
be bamboozled by it.

153
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,530
The Phoenix's scent?

154
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,960
Prophet,

155
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,800
my feelings for her

156
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,220
is true or not?

157
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,940
Whether it's true

158
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,580
or not,

159
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,400
it is not worth mentioning.

160
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,340
What you need to care about

161
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,680
is the future of the Devil Clan.

162
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,650
Tell me.

163
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,440
Where is the Phoenix?

164
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,940
I don't know either.

165
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,240
You...

166
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,180
Didn't you say

167
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,760
that she was always by your side?

168
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,540
I... She was...

169
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
S-She was by my side.

170
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,580
B-But,

171
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,240
she ran away.

172
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,940
No matter what,

173
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,160
y-you must find her.

174
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,460
It's been a long time.

175
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,440
I miss here.

176
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,180
It's a pity that

177
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,980
I can't hang around today.

178
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,540
Well, get down to business.

179
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,780
Demon Realm grows in the Tree of Demon.

180
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,500
How many load in spring the trees?

181
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,300
The comb made by this branch

182
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
can make hair black.

183
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,180
I'll take it back and give it to Auntie.

184
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,860
Good.

185
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,770
This one.

186
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,990
Stop!

187
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,620
I wanted to leave without a trace,

188
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,920
and didn't want to hurt the innocent.

189
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,130
But you want to die.

190
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,620
Then don't blame me

191
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,590
for being ruthless.

192
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,570
How dare you break into the Demon Realm?

193
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,930
I think you're tired of living.

194
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,440
I didn’t break into the Demon Realm.

195
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,330
But my...

196
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,240
my godfather is seriously ill,

197
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,290
and needs the demonic wood urgently.

198
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,460
It's one more crime

199
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,460
to cut down the demonic wood secretly.

200
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,110
You'll be killed without mercy.

201
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,130
I-It's a misunderstanding.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,190
I didn't cut down the demonic wood secretly.

203
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,660
I just want to borrow it.

204
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,220
Your Lord and I

205
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,320
are friends.

206
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,940
If he finds out

207
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,700
that you did this to me,

208
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,830
he'll chop you into pieces

209
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,980
and kill you.

210
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,590
Nonsense!

211
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,640
If you really know My Lord,

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,920
why did you

213
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,950
steal things?

214
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,690
My Lord.

215
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,690
Leave.

216
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,470
Do you hear him?

217
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,060
Leave!

218
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,590
Go!

219
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,910
Hurry up.

220
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,530
Thank you.

221
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,700
I mean

222
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,270
you should leave.

223
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:51,810
Me?

224
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,250
Leave.

225
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,820
You saved me again.

226
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,540
I just want to thank you.

227
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,850
You saved me many times.

228
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,880
I can't do nothing.

229
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,620
How about

230
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,850
I make you something delicious?

231
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
If you really want to do something,

232
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,280
please leave.

233
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,270
What's wrong with you?

234
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,220
I sincerely thank you.

235
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,880
You always ask me to leave first.

236
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,460
You saved me out of kindness,

237
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
but you always act like

238
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,690
you're so cool.

239
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,840
And speaking ill of me.

240
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,980
How dare you

241
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,410
throw me out like trash.

242
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,430
Lord of the Demon Clan!

243
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,890
I must appear

244
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,600
in front of you.

245
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,260
I must do this meal

246
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,670
for you.

247
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,540
You have to eat

248
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,380
whatever you want.

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,550
Otherwise,

250
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,320
I won't leave.

251
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,730
Where did you go so early?

252
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:22,720
Me?

253
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,150
I'm going to the market.

254
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,580
Market?

255
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,570
Yes.

256
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,460
Why are all these wooden men carved by you

257
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,780
have no face?

258
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
I don't know.

259
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,060
I've always been like this.

260
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,420
But honestly,

261
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,750
I think

262
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,340
if they have five facial features,

263
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,500
they will look more vivid

264
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,460
and pleasant.

265
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:56,770
What do you think?

266
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,530
By the way,

267
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,940
I bought some food.

268
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,260
-This is fruit.
-Let me see.

269
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,570
Let me see what else there is.

270
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,410
And snakeskin.

271
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,190
The devil said

272
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,030
this is delicious.

273
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,070
How about

274
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,310
trying it?

275
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,870
And this.

276
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,040
It's the spider's eye.

277
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:32,970
How about...

278
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,550
Don't eat them.

279
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,780
Well,

280
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,740
Last time Lady Hua said

281
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,300
there were mushrooms

282
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,870
in the forest at Xiaodongtian.

283
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,150
I'm going to pick some mushrooms.

284
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,500
I'll go with you.

285
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,220
Do you know how to

286
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,180
pick mushrooms?

287
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,860
What?

288
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,620
Can't I?

289
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,570
It's so beautiful.

290
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,230
We should go back.

291
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,580
That's enough.

292
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,840
Okay.

293
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,070

299
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,580

♫I will remember the past when we part♫

♫I've buried my heart in autumn♫

coming back after his patrol every morning.

306
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,940

My father

310
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,980

will protect me anyway.

319
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,530

can a family

00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,110
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

387
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,450
Why do you kill me?

388
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,030
I didn't use the holy Huarong

389
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,740
to make soup.

390
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,420
Even if you don't like soup,

391
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,010
I can do something else for you.

392
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:47,990
Tell me.

393
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,110
What do you want me to do for you?

394
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,960
I want you...

395
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,300
to get lost!

396
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,010
Again?

397
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:02,950
Except for this.

398
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,250
I can give you

399
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,560
anything you want.

400
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,210
My Lord.

401
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,780
Perfect tonic soup.

402
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,860
It's fresh. It's delicious.

403
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,140
Fine.

404
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,180
I'll drink it myself.

405
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,750
You're going to the market this early?

406
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,780
Yes.

407
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,050
Go change some household commodities.

408
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,620
I think you

409
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,880
are increasingly like a mortal.

410
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,210
I'm leaving.

411
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,890
Come back early.

412
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,210
Okay.

413
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,840
It's me.

414
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,450
My Lord.

415
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,350
Look, the dish I just made.

416
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,330
Have a taste.

417
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,480
So you like this.

418
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,970
I didn’t know it.

419
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,780
Why do you know how to cook this dish?

420
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,980
Fried japchae is the most common

421
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,840
stir-fry dish in the Human Realm.

422
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,910
As the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen,

423
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,110
of course I can do this.

424
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,270
This is the taste.

425
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,220
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

426
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,870
I almost forgot it.

427
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,150
Are you going to cry?

428
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,140
You eat so much

429
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,850
of the dish I made.

430
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,480
You're the first one.

431
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,350
Isn't it delicious?

432
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,990
I want you

433
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,990
to cook this dish every day.

434
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,790
Really?

435
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,940
Is it that good?

436
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,740
Do you have to eat it every day?

437
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,430
Just tell me whatever you want.

438
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,100
I want

439
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,350
the best kitchen in the world.

440
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,160
Is my cooking

441
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,620
really delicious?

442
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:49,890
I'm back.

443
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,260
Coming.

444
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,770
We can eat soon.

445
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,880
This is for you.

446
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,300
For me?

447
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,140
Do you like it?

448
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,480
Yes.

449
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,950
That's good.

450
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,730
♫The branches' falling made a splash♫

451
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm fine. It's just an old injury.

452
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,050
It's ok.

453
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,800
Is the rice ready?

454
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,680
♫There are too many memories♫

455
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,550
I'll get the rice.

456
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,360
♫It's hard to let go of it♫

457
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,500

Master, what's wrong?

478
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,010
Wei Zhi.

You're awake.

510
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,760
How are you? Are you still feeling unwell?

511
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,760
Don't move.

512
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,060
Where have you been?

513
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,130
I went to Shanhaijian.

514
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,990
Shanhaijian?

515
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,750
Lady Hua said

516
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,040
there is a spiritual herb

517
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,390
which can cure all diseases.

518
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,300
But it only works

519
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,040
with the morning dew.

520
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,660
So from now on,

521
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,740
I need to get up early to pick herbs.

522
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,550
Don't go there again.

523
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,230
Why?

524
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,910
Because

525
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,480
it's too hard.

526
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,250
I don't think so.

527
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,090
The herb is useless to me.

528
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,620
You don't even know

529
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,220
what your disease is.

530
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,440
How do you know it won't work?

531
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,550
Picking herbs is too dangerous.

532
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,210
If something happens to you,

533
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:06,730
then you...

534
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,020
I'm a Phoenix now. I can fly.

535
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,190
Are you afraid that I'll fall to death?

536
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,400
All right.

537
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,280
Save your mouth for medicine.

538
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,040
Nice table.

539
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,400
It's brand new.

540
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,970
So big.

541
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,910
What are these?

542
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,270
My Lord arranged all these for you.

543
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,670
You may leave.

544
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:29,660
Yes.

545
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,140
The demons

546
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,440
are so generous.

547
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,420
This is nice.

548
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,200
What are these?

549
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,810
Blades and swords.

550
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,400
I don't know how to use them.

551
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,490
Right.

552
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,490
Sister.

553
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,360
Your hatred,

554
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,670
and your resentment.

555
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,800
Mu Nan knows.

556
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,130
All the pain you suffered before,

557
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,050
I must let him suffer.

558
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,290
My Lord.

559
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,890
I've prepared a feast for you.

560
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,620
You are so beautiful in this.

561
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,940
So you can say

562
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,889
nice words too.

563
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,510
Go. Let's have the feast.

564
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,270
Come on.

565
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,230
Go!

566
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Do you know

567
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,650
that everything related to the Phoenix

568
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,719
is very important.

569
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,420
Once you admit it,

570
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,100
no one can protect you.

571
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,190
I was fond of play and disobedient.

572
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
I insisted on provoking the Phoenix

573
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,680
and brought her into the Devil Realm.

574
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,350
So Demon Realm invaded.

575
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,040
I am willing to be punished

576
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,360
and listen to your order

577
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,300
without any complaints.

578
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,180
Lan Su,

579
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,220
I'll ask you one last time.

580
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,320
Is this

581
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,660
caused by you?

582
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:32,940
Yes.

583
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,690
I'm willing to be punished.

584
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,920
Wife of the Numb Guy.

585
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,710
Why are you still here?

586
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,020
It's raining in the mortal world.

587
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,220
There are falling rocks at the Xiaodongkou.

588
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,310
It sounds like dull thunder,

589
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,420
but the rocks might fall.

590
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,280
Go home now.

591
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,410
Okay, thank you for reminding me.

592
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,060
Go back quickly.

593
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,940
-Okay.
-I'm leaving.

594
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,160
Smell it.

595
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,270
Does it smell good?

596
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,340
Yes.

597
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:25,890
Here.

598
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,220
Cheers.

599
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,980
This is the raspberry wine

600
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,170
that I collected from Demons Ridge.

601
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,260
Actually it was made by me

602
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,370
when I sneaked in here last year.

603
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,640
And all these.

604
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
They are all dishes that go with wine.

605
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,550
Like this.

606
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,930
Rabbit's head.

607
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,380
That one.

608
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,140
Braised boar's feet.

609
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,400
And this dish

610
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,160
is called

611
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,600
heartless. (made with wolf's heart and dog's lung)

612
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:00,940
How is it?

613
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,080
I made them with the ingredients you gave me.

614
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,120
Do you like it?

615
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,090
Next,

616
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,690
the best dish

617
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,880
is about to serve.

618
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,200
Please go this way.

619
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,540
Do you want to try it now?

620
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,350
Here.

621
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,380
This sword

622
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,840
is not for barbecue.

623
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,120
Then what is it for?

624
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,610
From now on,

625
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,640
you are not allowed to step into the Holy Temple.

626
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,570
What's wrong?

627
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,190
You were fine just now.

628
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,630
Why do you become angry now?

629
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,320
Numb Guy.

630
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,820
Lady Hua.

631
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,500
Have you seen Numb Guy?

632
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,630
Numb Guy's wife.

633
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,460
Your husband

634
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,630
went to the market early in the morning.

635
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,620
Don't worry.

636
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,690
He'll be back soon.

637
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,940
He usually comes back

638
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,560
before dark.

639
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,900
I don't know why

640
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,870
he's not home today.

641
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,000
A-Are you going to find him?

642
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,380
But what if

643
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,850
you two miss each other?

644
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Maybe your Numb Guy

645
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,100
is on his way home.

646
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,330
Okay, I'll go further.

647
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,220
I'll come back if I can't find him.

648
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,180
Okay.

649
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,810
Numb Guy is so lucky

650
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,210
to have such a good wife.

651
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,580
I'm back.

652
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,180
You're finally back.

653
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,040
It's getting dark. I'm afraid something might happen to you.

654
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,380
It's okay.

655
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:31,900
Have you forgotten?

656
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,530
I am the Red Sun God.

657
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,580
How could something happen to me?

658
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,280
You're injured now.

659
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,340
I'm afraid you'll...

660
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,150
Enough.

661
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,820
I always heard that you talked about the rice cake in the mortal world.

662
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:42,860
Today,

663
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,910
I finally found it.

664
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,140
So that's why you've been here

665
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,050
for such a long time.

666
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,710
Thank you.

667
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,740
Anyway,

668
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,740
you have to come back

669
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
before dark.

670
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,660
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

671
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,310
♫The autumn breeze twists and leaves turn into letters♫

672

Could it be that

690
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,580

do a magic trick for others?

694
