[Episode 33]

4
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,100
You...

5
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,340
Who are you?

6
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,140
I'm your wife.

7
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
No.

8
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,860
The wife in my memory

9
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,260
is just like you.

10
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,660
But you are not her.

11
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,540
It's me.

12
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,660
We've been living

13
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,540
together.

14
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,260
Have you forgotten?

15
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,700
I only remember

16
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,500
that I was healing

17
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,260
in the Dark Forest alone.

18
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,660
When did you show up?

19
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,820
Mother.

20
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,780
What are you talking about?

21
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,540
Xiaomo.

22
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,500
Tell your father.

23
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,700
F-Father.

24
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,660
Xiaomo.

25
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,660
Is he really our child?

26
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,570
No.

27
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,579
He's not your child.

28
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,250
He's not my child either.

29
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,660
Aren't we happy

30
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,980
living together?

31
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,500
In this world,

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,220
who will be with you forever

33
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,060
and never leave you

34
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,980
except us?

35
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,570
Dear!

36
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,540
Mother.

37
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,420
Demon Queen placed an order

38
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,100
that this woman

39
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,500
must never step into this place again.

40
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,900
Do you think

41
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,140
you can stop me?

42
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,380
Wei Zhi, you go first.

43
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,220
Mother, what happened to your leg?

44
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm fine.

45
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,100
Mother.

46
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,460
Get well soon.

47
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,580
I won't make you angry again.

48
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,010
Don't be afraid.

49
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,780
Your father will find a way

50
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,580
to save me.

51
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,900
Father, please save Mother.

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,900
There's nothing I can do.

54
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,900
Father, do you want to leave Mother?

55
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,780
Do you want to leave me?

56
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,260
Why do you come back?

57
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,580
I came to save my child.

58
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,580
Wait.

59
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,220
You can't leave yet.

60
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,020
Yan Yue, are you alright?

61
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,900
Why did you protect her?

62
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,460
Wei Zhi?

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,020
Because

64
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,900
she is my real wife.

65
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,980
Nonsense!

66
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,140
We are family.

67
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,090
She is the outsider.

68
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,700
Leave.

69
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,340
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,980
Thank you for taking care of me.

71
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,220
Now the Heavenly Curse is broken.

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,020
I can't

73
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,580
stay with you anymore.

74
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,530
Besides,

75
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,100
you should remember

76
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,580
your identity.

77
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,700
Mother.

78
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,460
Mother.

79
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,100
Your hand...

80
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,220
You never love me

81
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,020
but my face

82
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,650
that you miss so much.

83
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,530
I've always been

84
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,980
a pitiful substitute.

85
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,130
No need to say sorry.

87
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,340
I was delusional.

88
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
I'm just the medicinal jade that heals you,

89
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,660
and touched your miss for Wei Zhi.

90
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,140
That's why I was incarnated into a human.

91
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,580
But I want to replace

92
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,900
the person in your heart.

93
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm grateful for her existence.

94
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,100
If it weren't for her,

95
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,580
I wouldn't have existed

96
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,140
in this world.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,900
Yan Yue, save her life.

98
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,220
Don't plead for me.

99
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,260
I've been proud all my life.

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,260
I only bow

101
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,010
to someone worthy of trust.

102
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,580
Now,

103
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,370
our relationship ends.

104
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,820
There's no need

105
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,780
to live on.

106
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,580
Xiaomo.

107
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,900
Go get the jade pendant

108
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
under my mattress.

109
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,380
Give it back to her.

110
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,980
My life is not what I wanted.

111
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,700
My fate is not what I wanted.

112
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,700
But now that your Heavenly Curse is broken,

113
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,500
I will return to the medicinal jade.

114
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,460
Mother.

115
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,100
All things happened in the past

116
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,340
will vanish.

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,620
From now on,

118
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,060
we will never be apart again.

119
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,340
Saintess.

120
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,860
Now the four guardians of Demon Realm are back,

121
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
we will do our best

122
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,060
to help Demon Duke revive the Demon Clan.

123
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,500
Long live the Demon Duke!
Long live the Saintess!

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Long live the Demon Duke!
Long live the Saintess!

125
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,980
Auntie.

126
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,980
I know I was wrong.

127
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,860
Auntie.

128
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,460
I've reflected on myself

129
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,460
these days.

130
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,500
I really know I was wrong.

131
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,820
I've already

132
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,300
copied Heavenly Rules 100 times.

133
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,620
I will never do

134
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,460
something like entering time dust.

135
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,620
Please.

136
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,180
Let me out.

137
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,460
Give me a chance.

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,460
I won't let you down.

139
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,940
Thank you, Auntie.

140
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,860
We know where the Red Sun God is.

141
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,820
It's a piece of good news.

142
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,820
But why does he

143
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,620
still entangle with the Phoenix?

144
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,180
What an ill-fated relationship.

145
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,220
Demon Realm never gave up.

146
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,580
Now they colluded with the Phoenix.

147
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,220
I'm afraid that something

148
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,180
will happen in Three Realms.

149
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,460
Anyway,

150
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,740
if the Phoenix doesn't die,

151
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,180
there will be no peace in Three Realms.

152
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,340
Your Majesty,

153
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,980
please send the Heavenly Soldiers to

154
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,100
wipe out Demon Realm and kill Phoenix

155
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,620
to bring peace to Three Realms.

156
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,460
Yan Yue has been missing for a long time.

157
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,860
He suddenly appeared

158
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,220
in Demon Realm with the Phoenix.

159
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,700
There must be a reason.

160
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,340
It's inappropriate to declare war rashly.

161
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,450
But Yan Yue and Phoenix

162
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,580
are both powerful.

163
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,820
If we lose the opportunity,

164
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,420
I'm afraid they'll be more difficult

165
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,740
to deal with in the future.

166
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,100
For the sake of safety,

167
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,060
I want to send someone to Demon Realm

168
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,100
to check it out.

169
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,860
May I know who is willing to

170
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,220
accept this order?

171
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,060
This...

172
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,580
It's hard enough

173
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,740
to deal with the Phoenix.

174
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,340
Now they have the Red Sun God.

175
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,820
They have no rival

176
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,940
in the whole Heaven Realm.

177
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,810
In that case,

178
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,980
I'll go to Demon Realm

179
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,220
before making a decision.

180
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,620
-It's too dangerous.
-Don't do that.

181
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Don't worry.

182
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,100
Yan Yue is my brother.

183
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,820
He's not a bloodthirsty person.

184
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,820
Besides, this matter concerns

185
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,740
the future of Three Realms.

186
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,580
As acting Heavenly Emperor,

187
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,980
it's my duty

188
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,460
to go there in person.

189
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,700
So Yan Yue has been in Demon Realm

190
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,460
with Wei Zhi.

191
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,820
Auntie.

192
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Cousin Yan Yue appeared in Demon Realm

193
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,940
and became Demon Duke.

194
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,820
Wei Zhi is also in Demon Realm.

195
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,460
I was entangled

196
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,740
with them.

197
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,980
I want to visit Demon Realm.

198
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,220
It turns out

199
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,740
that the Phoenix and Yan Yue

200
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,300
stayed in Demon Realm.

201
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,340
If you

202
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,860
let me go down and have a look,

203
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm willing to get

204
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,100
any punishment

205
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,340
even if you double it

206
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,420
to ground me.

207
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Get up.

208
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,860
I know

209
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,820
you want to see

210
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,060
where he lives,

211
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,980
right?

212
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,060
How could I not know

213
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,460
your thoughts?

214
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
I'm sorry

215
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,460
for letting you worry about me.

216
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,420
Actually, for my visit to Demon Realm this time,

217
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,340
I really want to

218
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,460
see Wei Zhi and Yan Yue.

219
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,820
Wei Zhi is my friend.

220
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,970
Yan Yue changed from the Divine Lord to Demon Duke.

221
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,220
They've been through

222
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,460
too much

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,220
to be together.

224
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,980
It seems that Yan Yue and the Phoenix

225
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,340
have been entangled for several lives.

226
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,980
Whether it's fate or sin,

227
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,580
it's hard to explain now.

228
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,500
But the Phoenix

229
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,050
is the enemy of Heaven Realm.

230
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,730
If she is still alive,

231
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,580
how could Heaven Realm allow her to live?

232
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,220
I heard

233
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,700
that Yan Luo is going to Demon Realm.

234
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,740
I believe there will be an answer

235
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,180
when he comes back.

236
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,500
Luo.

237
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Cousin Yan Luo said

238
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,340
he will go to Demon Realm

239
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,980
before making a decision.

240
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,980
I heard from Yi'er

241
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,300
that you're going to Demon Realm.

242
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,820
Have you made up your mind?

243
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,180
Yes, Mother.

244
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,340
Your Father wanted to

245
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,930
kill the Phoenix.

246
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,460
You're against his will

247
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,460
by doing this.

248
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,310
Father wanted to kill the Phoenix

249
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,060
to maintain the peace of Three Realms.

250
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,220
But the Phoenix is immortal.

251
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,500
She is entangled with

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,620
the Red Sun God for lives.

253
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,700
It won't end

254
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,690
but accumulate

255
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,820
more hatred.

256
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,100
This is definitely not

257
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
what Father wanted.

258
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,180
What will you do then?

259
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,740
I want to find

260
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
a peaceful solution

261
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
that can end this all.

262
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,300
A peaceful solution?

263
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,970
Is there any?

264
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,740
Maybe.

265
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,500
Because I believe in Yan Yue.

266
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,740
Go.

267
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,220
I believe that your Father

268
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,820
will support you

269
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,210
if he knows it.

270
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,940
Thank you, Mother.

271
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,820
You trust Yan Yue.

272
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,180
I trust you.

273
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,820
Why did you

274
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
put away all these wood carvings?

275
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,300
You don't want them anymore?

276
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,460
I won't do wood carving anymore.

277
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
Although I was accompanied by the Demon Queen,

278
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,980
I always feel

279
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,340
there's one thing missing in my heart.

280
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,500
Only wood carving

281
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,820
can ease the anxiety in my heart.

282
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,620
But now with you by my side,

283
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,980
I won't do wood carving

284
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,220
to deceive myself.

285
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,610
I plan to move the wood carvings and medicinal jade

286
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,060
to the Dark Forest.

287
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,260
I think

288
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,220
Demon Queen and you

289
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,700
had a peaceful and happy time.

290
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,369
Now you are going to say goodbye

291
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,140
to the wood carvings and those memories.

292
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,540
Yes.

293
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,500
It's time to say goodbye

294
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,500
to the unreal and confusing days.

295
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,380
I'm glad to see you again,

296
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,380
even if this is a dream,

297
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,380
even if I'll die the next moment.

298
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,450
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,740
We will never

300
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,060
repeat the same mistake.

301
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,980
Yes, Master.

302
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,220
Master?

303
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,940
It's been a long time since you called me that.

304
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
To be honest,

305
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,860
I was always bullied at the academy.

306
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,420
But now that I think about it,

307
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,540
I kinda miss it.

308
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Do you miss it?

309
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,180
I didn't expect that these trees are still here

310
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,980
after so many years.

311
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,780
I remember when you practiced Teleportation,

312
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,940
I was wondering

313
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,740
why you were such a stupid student.

314
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,900
Why are you laughing at me again?

315
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,500
I wish

316
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,220
I were an average student.

317
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,980
By the way,

318
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,370
let me show you something.

319
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,380
What is it?

320
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,460
You'll know later.

321
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,420
[Master is a monster]

322
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,820
Here. Here.

323
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,290
Master is a monster.

324
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,700
Did you carve it

325
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,380
when you were studying in the academy?

326
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,740
I just entered the academy at that time,

327
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,660
and I thought you were a monster.

328
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,540
But

329
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,900
I dare not tell others.

330
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,460
I felt bad hiding it in my heart.

331
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,420
So I came out in the middle of the night

332
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
and carved in the tree.

333
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,220
The world has changed.

334
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,770
Things have changed.

335
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,700
I didn't expect that

336
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,060
we can still be together

337
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,620
after we've been through so many things.

338
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,420
You're right.

339
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,380
After so many years,

340
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,860
we experienced so many things.

341
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,740
It's really lucky to be together.

342
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,860
Kids

343
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,420
of those classmates

344
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,660
at the academy

345
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,060
should be parents already.

346
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,020
When our child grows up,

347
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,500
I want to send our child

348
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,220
to the academy to study.

349
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm thinking

350
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,500
that one child could be too lonely.

351
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,860
We need to

352
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,460
have many children.

353
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,060
Let them go to school together.

354
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Yan Yue.

355
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,220
I find that you are more and more cheeky

356
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,700
after becoming Demon Duke.

357
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,660
I am the son of the Heavenly Emperor.

358
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,140
I was educated to put Heavenly Emperor's

359
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,140
duty first since I was a child.

360
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,500
Now that I think about it,

361
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,060
I live for myself

362
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,220
only in Demon Realm.

363
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,500
Me too.

364
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Before I knew

365
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,180
I was the Phoenix,

366
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,060
I already paid the price

367
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,380
for

368
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,500
the ridiculous prophecy.

369
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,460
So,

370
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,500
I would rather be an ordinary person.

371
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,700
No.

372
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,700
I don't want to be an ordinary person now.

373
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,210
Otherwise,

374
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,700
we'll never meet again.

375
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,060
Yan Luo.

376
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,540
Teacher, why are you here?

377
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,660
Wei Zhi, we meet again.

378
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,980
We're family.

379
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Take a seat.

380
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,980
I didn't expect

381
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,490
you to be together after all these things.

382
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,060
After going through so much,

383
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,620
I've thought it through.

384
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,500
Everything in this world

385
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,980
is not as important as Wei Zhi.

386
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,660
How about you?

387
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,380
Are you used to being Heavenly Emperor?

388
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,940
It's a relief for you.

389
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,700
I have to pretend to be formidable

390
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,020
and deal with those immortals.

391
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,420
It disturbs me every day.

392
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,220
Why don't you think about

393
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
coming back to replace me?

394
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
I won't go back

395
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,940
to Heaven Realm.

396
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,620
Yan Yue,

397
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,460
since the High Immortals

398
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,420
knew you and Phoenix were still alive,

399
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,500
and showed up together in Demon Realm,

400
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,500
they have been very nervous.

401
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,540
Some even suggested sending the

402
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,300
Heavenly Army to wipe out Demon Realm

403
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,300
to prevent future troubles.

404
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,540
If you're here to congratulate us,

405
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,700
we welcome you very much.

406
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,700
But if you're here to declare war

407
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,260
on behalf of Heaven Realm,

408
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,220
then we have to fight.

409
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Yan Yue,

410
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,700
let me finish.

411
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,700
Of course I want you to be happy.

412
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,940
And I never advocate

413
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,380
for solving problems with fighting.

414
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,020
But the High Immortals have

415
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,900
the fear and hatred of Phoenix

416
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,940
since ancient times.

417
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,220
And it also concerns

418
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,740
the order and rules of the Three Realms.

419
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,860
It can't be solved

420
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,980
in a day.

421
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,220
If we can't let their guard down,

422
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,420
you and Wei Zhi

423
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,980
won't have a stable life.

424
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm here today

425
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,220
to find a way

426
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,670
to solve the problem peacefully

427
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,260
with you.

428
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,460
I swear,

429
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,300
Wei Zhi and I will live in

430
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,220
Demon Realm and won't leave forever.

431
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,060
Yan Yue,

432
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,860
think carefully.

433
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,620
As a High Immortal,

434
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,780
you are willing to stay in Demon Realm

435
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
and never return to the Heaven Realm.

436
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,740
What is Heaven Realm?

437
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,020
What is Demon Realm?

438
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,260
As long as I'm with my beloved one,

439
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,140
I'll be satisfied

440
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,700
wherever I am.

441
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,010
Besides,

442
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,860
I only want

443
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,460
Wei Zhi all my life.

444
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,740
Wei Zhi.

445
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,740
Will you marry me again?

446
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,940
I'm not Chen Yan,

447
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,660
not Demon Duke.

448
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm

449
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,100
Yan Yue.

450
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,180
Of course.

451
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,860
Wei Zhi, the Phoenix,

452
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,970
will be with Yan Yue forever

453
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,350
and never leave Demon Realm.

454
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,900
We won't disturb the peace of Three Realms.

455
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,460
In that case,

456
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,860
I'll make a vow together with you

457
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,620
on behalf of Heaven Realm.

458
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,700
Yan Yue, Wei Zhi.

459
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,940
I can't stay

460
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,970
to attend your wedding.

461
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,020
I feel so sorry.

462
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,220
I wish you happiness.

463
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,980
Your effort to promote peace in the two realms

464
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,380
is also the best blessing for us.

465
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,900
Thank you.

466
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,220
Before I return to Heaven Realm,

467
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,740
I have one more thing to do.

468
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,740
I set this seal

469
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,260
for the safety of Heaven Realm.

470
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,780
But now

471
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm willing to believe

472
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,740
your vows.

473
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,220
Yan Luo.

474
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,980
I'll see myself out.

475
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,140
Wei Zhi.

476
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,020
What...

477
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
are you thinking?

478
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,660
Although Demon Realm acts strangely,

479
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,980
there are not many evil deeds.

480
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
I believe

481
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,980
as long as Heaven Realm and Demon Realm

482
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,020
obey the order and stop the war,

483
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,740
the day of peace will soon come.

484
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,020
By the way,

485
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,980
let's

486
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,060
visit Mu Nan later.

487
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,620
OK.

488
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,700
He must

489
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,460
be standing here

490
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,460
and watching Huarong,

491
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,980
missing the precious time

492
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,460
in his life.

493
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,410
He spent his life

494
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,380
to find you.

495
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,020
Mu Nan.

496
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,660
I am going to marry Yan Yue.

497
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,620
It's a pity

498
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,540
that you can't see it.

499
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
I will always remember

500
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,370
what you did for me.

501
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,800
We are

502
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,140
in your debt.

503
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,660
Please rest in peace.

504
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,500
We will

505
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,900
live happily ever after.

506
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,780
I will live up to

507
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,500
your sacrifice.

508
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,130
Mu Nan.

509
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,780
Thank you.

510
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,980
Qing Hua!

511
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,220
Give it back!

512
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,660
It's a joke.

513
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,460
Give it back.

514
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,460
I'm not joking.

515
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,140
This is important

516
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,380
to me.

517
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,940
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,660
I'll give it back to you.

519
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,780
What is this?

520
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,540
Why are you so nervous?

521
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,460
He especially made

522
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,380
this food guide for me.

523
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,420
You mean

524
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,020
Demon Lord?

525
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,740
I didn't expect

526
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,020
him to be so thoughtful.

527
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620
Actually,

528
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,300
he looks fierce,

529
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,140
but he's not a bad person.

530
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,940
I still remember

531
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
the first time I cooked

532
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,540
glow-in-the-dark mushrooms,

533
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,260
I almost destroyed Huarong.

534
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,140
Although he locked me up,

535
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,180
he treated me politely.

536
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
Later,

537
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,020
I accidentally ate poisonous food.

538
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,180
He went to find Elder Mu

539
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
to save me.

540
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,300
He always

541
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,690
said I was stupid,

542
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,780
but

543
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,540
he had been taking care of me.

544
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
After that,

545
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,220
he gave me this book of

546
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,660
Demon Realm food

547
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,220
that he organized for me.

548
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,860
Unfortunately,

549
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,460
I have no chance

550
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,060
to cook dishes on this book

551
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,460
for him.

552
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,020
Don't be sad.

553
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,700
Heavenly Empress Dowager is very worried about you,

554
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,140
so she asked me to accompany you.

555
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,900
I promised Auntie

556
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,460
that I'll move on.

557
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,900
Okay.

558
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,980
I'll help you find the ingredients.

559
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,860
I want to make the best

560
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,300
and most special dishes.

561
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,420
I'll send it to Yan Yue and Wei Zhi

562
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,300
as a gift for their reunion,

563
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,180
on behalf of the Lord and me.

564
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,940
You're so thoughtful.

565
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,020
Let's go.

566
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,620
Yi'er.

567
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,500
Thank you for visiting us.

568
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,700
You and Yan Yue

569
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
are finally married.

570
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,140
I'm so delighted.

571
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,500
If Mu Nan

572
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,060
knows that you are happy now,

573
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,380
he will be happy too.

574
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,980
Fried japchae.

575
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,220
Mo Nan used to

576
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,660
like this dish.

577
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,660
I started to wonder

578
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,780
what kind of person he was

579
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,220
because of this dish.

580
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,060
The more things I knew, the more heartbroken I was.

581
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,900
Yi'er.

582
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,700
I'm fine. Don't worry.

583
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,860
Have you really decided

584
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,980
to live with Wei Zhi

585
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,220
in Demon Realm forever?

586
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,500
I promised Yan Luo

587
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,660
and swore.

588
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,220
How can I go back on my word?

589
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,380
You are

590
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,460
always like this.

591
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,900
You just stay right down

592
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,450
that path you're on.

593
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,220
As for me,

594
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,180
I don't know if I should be envious

595
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,540
or be wistful.

596
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,420
For Wei Zhi,

597
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,740
I have no problem with that.

598
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
I won't be in the Heaven Realm,

599
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,180
you must not slack off.

600
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,260
Help the new Heavenly Emperor.

601
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,460
He is very busy in the Heavenly Realm.

602
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,740
He works hard.

603
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,380
Okay, okay.

604
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,780
Time to eat.

605
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,060
What's this?

606
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,260
Come on.

607
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,270
♫The sunset is just right♫

608
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,980
Lord.

609
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,100
♫It's like a dream♫

610
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,900
I'm here to see you.

611
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,280
♫If you take the beauty♫

612
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:49,070
♫In your eyes♫

613
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,270
♫Don't make the love too strong♫

614
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,220
♫How much it entangles♫

615
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,530
♫The thoughts♫

616
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,140
♫The hourglass along your fingers♫

617
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,090
♫Where do we go from here?♫

618
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,610
Why are you following me?

619
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,060
I...

620
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,700
I'm not following you.

621
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
I'm here

622
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,330
♫Spread out your palm♫

623
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,900
to show you this.

624
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,650
♫If all your obsessions are empty♫

625
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,900
This is...

626
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,110
♫Remembering the past♫

627
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,060
I found it outside the forest.

628
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,770
♫All that you've given me♫

629
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,540
Only it.

630
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,220
I didn't find its home.

631
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,320
♫A little more touching♫

632
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,140
I saw it hurts

633
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
so I brought it here.

634
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,120
♫A little less frightened♫

635
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,140
♫How many times I've been in love♫

636
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,220
Can you heal it for me?

637
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,930
♫The more fate plays tricks on me♫

638
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,850
♫The more I sing the praises of love's nirvana♫

639
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,130
♫A wisp of dust and sorrow♫

640
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,210
♫Blow away like the wind♫

641
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,250
♫Who plays on his heart in tears?♫

642
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,590
♫I can't help but reach out♫

643
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,200
♫To the thoughts♫

♫Don't ask, don't tell♫

645
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,060
Impressive.

646
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,940
♫Just hold each other♫

647
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,050
♫Fold a feather of tenderness♫

648
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,140
Can you be more ridiculous?

649
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,260
♫And it's immortal♫

650
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,180
As the leader of the Heavenly Soldiers,

651
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,870
♫Believe in love and loneliness♫

652
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,220
you can't even do

653
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,260
such a little magic?

654
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,120
♫Learn to be foolish and brave♫

655
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,940
I heard

656
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,380
when people in Demon Realm die,

657
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,280
♫It's hard to turn back♫

658
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,320
♫You don't have to understand if you don't want to hear♫

659
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,060
they will not be reincarnated.

660
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,730
♫Even if it's a dream♫

661
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,380
But they will turn into everything in Demon Realm.

662
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,460
This little bird

663
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,820
outside the top of Demon Realm

664
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,860
might be his incarnation.

665
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,540
Nonsense.

666
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,020
He's so powerful.

667
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,460
Even if he transforms,

668
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,500
he must be

669
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,980
an eagle flying in the sky.

670
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,420
He won't be the weak bird

671
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,260
who doesn't even grow enough feathers.

672
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,730
But even an eagle is

673
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,020
a little bird without feathers

674
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,780
before it grows up.

675
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,550
I feel relieved

676
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,460
seeing you're recovering gradually.

677
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,580
Yan Luo sent a message.

678
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,420
He has found Yan Yue.

679
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,540
Yan Yue is in Demon Realm

680
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,500
with Phoenix.

681
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,500
He cherishes

682
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,140
his peaceful life now.

683
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,660
He and the Phoenix

684
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,260
decided to get married

685
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,460
and promised

686
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,820
not to leave Demon Realm forever.

687
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,860
I know

688
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,500
you'll be shocked

689
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,980
by this news.

690
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,900
But I don't think it's a bad thing.

691
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
At least the threat

692
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,180
from the Phoenix

693
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,780
lasting for a long time

694
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,300
has been lifted.

695
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,620
Yan Luo said

696
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,820
he believes they can keep their promise.

697
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,980
I don't want anything else now.

698
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,460
I just want the children to be safe

699
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,860
and live happily

700
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,660
the way they want.

701
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,900
Can't you sleep?

702
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,940
Yes.

703
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,300
Here.

704
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,620
I don't know what happened.

705
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,620
I'm a little nervous

706
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,500
about tomorrow's wedding.

707
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,130
Me too.

708
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,500
I'm glad we didn't move to the Holy Temple.

709
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,140
At least now

710
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,500
we have a place to relax.

711
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,100
That's right.

712
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,460
This place is meaningful

713
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
to us.

714
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,540
In my last life,

715
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,050
I was happy

716
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,300
to marry you.

717
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,900
But...

718
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,770
Don't say that.

719
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
This time,

720
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,290
we will never be apart.

721
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,060
You can't go back to

722
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,740
Heaven Realm because of me.

723
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,900
Will you regret it?

724
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,500
No.

725
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,620
I hope from now on,

726
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,980
we can be together forever.

727
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,660
Who is it?

728
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,300
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,140
I didn't mean it.

730
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,660
I just can't

731
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,860
sleep.

732
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,020
You finally have a happy ending

733
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,300
and got the beauty back.

734
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,260
But I'm still single.

735
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,060
Can't you sympathize with me?

736
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,260
It's called rainbow comes after a storm.

737
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,860
Unlike someone,

738
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,100
he likes her,

739
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,460
but he doesn't say anything.

740
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,100
She's a High Immortal,

741
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,460
but she can't predict the future.

742
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,780
That's because I can't do barnacle behaviors

743
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,980
like you.

744
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,900
So,

745
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,140
only you are single.

746
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,100
Well...

747
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,500
Yi'er.

748
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,980
Is she in

749
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,340
Ghost Tree Forest?

750
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,520
Ghost Tree Forest?

751
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,100
I guess.

752
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,240
I'll leave you to it.

753
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,300
I'm leaving.
