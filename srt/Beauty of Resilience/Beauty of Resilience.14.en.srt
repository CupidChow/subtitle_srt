4
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,590
Why are you here?

5
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,890
I

6
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,240
happened to pass by

7
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,320
and came to see you.

8
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,740
Yes.

9
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,670
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

10
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,760
Aren't you searching for the Phoenix?

11
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,350
Why are you here?

12
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,910
I just…

13
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,230
It's because of Yan Yue.

14
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
I couldn't find him.

15
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,620
I have to look around.

16
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,170
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

17
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,140
Really?

18
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,130
Yes.

19
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,440
I understand.

20
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,940
Since you have to complete the report of the Heavenly Court,

21
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,800
you can't bear to see Yan Yue suffer either.

22
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,600
And you have to keep it a secret

23
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,339
from the soldiers

24
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,490
who have worked over nothing

25
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,880
and buy time.

26
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,660
There are indeed no harder things

27
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,600
than this.

28
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,540
I don't understand

29
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,050
what you said.

30
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,710
Brother,

31
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,580
listen to me.

32
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,680
No matter how much you help him,

33
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,960
Yan Yue

34
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,850
has to face it himself.

35
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,030
Take care.

36
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,650
I'm leaving.

37
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,140
Yan Yue.

38
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,630
Where have you been?

39
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,170
Thank you.

40
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,260
Thank you for saving me

41
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,130
twice.

42
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,220
Twice?

43
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,080
Yes.

44
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,040
It was you last time too?

45
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,070
Yes.

46
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,380
You are unlucky.

47
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,290
You always get hurt.

48
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,460
I am unlucky.

49
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,380
Then why don't you acquire

50
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,220
a human form

51
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,160
like other devils do?

52
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,230
Why are you laughing?

53
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,150
I'm not a devil.

54
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,020
I'm just an ordinary crow.

55
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,820
Then why

56
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,900
can I understand you?

57
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,140
Because you're Lord Phoenix.

58
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,700
As long as you listen carefully,

59
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,540
you can understand

60
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,730
the language of all birds.

61
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,370
Really?

62
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,930
Lord Phoenix.

63
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,320
You should go home now.

64
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,730
It's not safe here.

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,930
It's okay. My house is not far away.

66
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,240
My home is far away.

67
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,130
It's at the stone bridge in Yu Du's east suburb.

68
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,590
The stone bridge in the east suburb?

69
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,020
Mother.

70
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,700
Ye.

71
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,659
Mother. Ye.

72
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,490
Don't worry.

73
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,310
Take care.

74
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,570
Wei Zhi.

75
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,330
Little crow.

76
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,120
After you return to Yu Du,

77
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,620
please send this letter

78
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,030
to Baishi Bridge in the eastern suburb.

79
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,460
In front of the bridge,

80
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,570
there's a giant tree.

81
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,100
Under the tree

82
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,210
there is a yard with a well.

83
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,510
My mother's family name is Wei.

84
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,180
Or you can give it to my brother,

85
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,950
Wei Ye.

86
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,060
Don't worry.

87
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,220
I know that place.

88
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,320
Baishi Bridge in the east suburb.

89
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,730
Swallows make their nests

90
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,790
under the eaves there in summer.

91
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,890
Thank you.

92
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,180
It's an honor.

93
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,860
Please bless me all the way.

94
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Don't make me the food

95
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,740
for others.

96
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,580
Don't say that.

97
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,820
Mother, Ye,

98
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,760
How are you?

99
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,660
Why did you throw away the clothes?

100
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,750
You scared me.

101
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,990
Why didn't you say anything?

102
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,600
I made you something delicious.

103
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,480
Fried japchae.

104
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,730
Try it.

105
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,340
How is it? Is it good?

106
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,780
You're finally back.

107
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,680
Sister.

108
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,380
In the last life,

109
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,490
I loved you so much

110
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,230
but I couldn't get what I want.

111
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,640
You could never be expected.

112
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,900
In this life,

113
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,840
as compensation,

114
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,700
can you

115
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,930
be nicer to me?

116
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,680
And nicer?

117
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,200
You can forget him.

118
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,470
From now on,

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
you can think of me,

120
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,500
and look at me only.

121
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,000
OK?

122
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,280
I don't understand

123
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,820
what you said.

124
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,460
I know

125
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,880
you don't understand.

126
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,770
But sister,

127
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,660
how could that man

128
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,980
actually make you like him

129
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,130
for so many lifetimes?

130
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,430
Sister.

131
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,050
You don't owe him

132
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,220
in any way.

133
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,770
You only owe me.

134
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,940
Sister.

135
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Why are you doing this

136
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,130
to me?

137
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,380
You could have survived

138
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,000
in that battle.

139
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,390
Do you know how happy I was

140
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,870
when I knew you'd wake up?

141
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,210
But why?

142
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,820
Even if you start over,

143
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,700
even if you become

144
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,510
another person,

145
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,010
why is the ending the same?

146
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,890
The Formula is triggered.

147
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,080
He is in love, isn't he?

148
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,760
You are still in love.

149
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,780
Aren't you?

150
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,650
Lord,

151
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,820
I'm not your sister.

152
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm Yi,

153
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,090
the Kitchen God in the East Kitchen of Heaven Realm.

154
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,700
No.

155
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm cooking for you.

156
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,160
No.

157
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,850
Why...

158
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,050
Why won't you acknowledge me?

159

♫In your eyes♫

For the past ten thousand years,

167
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,840
I've been protecting you.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,040

♫Don't make the love too strong♫

What did you do?

368
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,940
I did something I shouldn't have done.

The Kitchen God in the East Kitchen Yi

370

371
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,870

373
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,230

376
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,560

00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,680
Don't worry.

384
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
The Lord is fine now.

385
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,780
Thank you

386
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,770
for your wine and food.

387
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,550
Got it.

388
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,760
By the way, Miss Yi.

389
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:20,930
Lord

390
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,960
asked me to give this to you.

391
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,780
Demonic Wood.

392
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,740
I forgot

393
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,550
my purpose for this trip.

394
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,380
But he still

395
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,010
remember it.

396
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,410
My good aunt.

397
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,700
You scared me.

398
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,070
This

399
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,490
is a unique wood

400
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,820
of Demons Ridge.

401
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,640
Of course.

402
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,950
You went to Demon Realm

403
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,280
to find it?

404
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,330
Yes.

405
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,730
If that's what you want,

406
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,920
why didn't you tell me earlier?

407
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,930
It's nothing.

408
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,810
I don't want to say it.

409
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,540
The Heavenly Emperor didn't wrong me anyway.

410
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,820
I went there secretly several times.

411
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,110
He locked me up.

412
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,050
I deserve it.

413
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,030
Wait.

414
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,670
You are lively and active.

415
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,700
Normally you can't be locked up in the Heavenly Court.

416
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,470
You'll always find a way to go out.

417
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,060
Why are you

418
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,230
suddenly willing to be grounded for three months

419
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,650
without even a statement?

420
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,860
It's probably because

421
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,160
I've learned a lot during my journey.

422
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,520
I also want time to calm down

423
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,350
and think about things.

424
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
Tell me then.

425
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,070
What have you thought about?

426
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,380
Aunt.

427
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,990
you look so beautiful when you smile.

428
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,280
Look at you.

429
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,420
Why are you

430
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,020
flattering me?

431
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,540
What's wrong with you?

432
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,350
Nothing.

433
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,640
I'm not flattering you.

434
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,630
Aunt,

435
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,400
have you seen the Heavenly Emperor smile?

436
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,740
Not much.

437
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,540
You rarely smile.

438
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,290
So is Yan Yue.

439
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,090
She doesn't smile much either.

440
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,550
Tell me.

441
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,020
Did you exchange something

442
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,480
with your smile?

443
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,740
Why would someone exchange something

444
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,650
with their smile?

445
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,870
Can't they?

446
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,050
Of course not.

447
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,740
I don't think so.

448
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,720
If

449
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,600
someone wants something,

450
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,110
this thing

451
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,660
should be something

452
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,940
that makes him happy.

453
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,700
But

454
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,910
if he gives up

455
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,630
his smile,

456
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,950
how can the thing

457
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,200
make him happy?

458
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,850
What are you

459
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,300
talking about?

460
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,060
Did you do

461
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,300
something strange

462
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
with some weird guy?

463
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,690
No, no.

464
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,760
I just heard something

465
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,290
and don't understand.

466
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,180
Aunt,

467
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,230
give this Demonic Wood to the Heavenly Emperor

468
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,820
and comb his hair

469
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,130
so that he can relax.

470
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,860
And leave me alone.

471
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,680
Some people

472
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,120
have smiles,

473
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,850
but never smile.

474
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,530
Some people want to laugh,

475
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,810
but can't smile anymore.

476
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,060
If only I could give you

477
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,290
half of my smile,

478
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:49,920
so that

479
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,850
I won't feel so sad

480
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,720
when you want to smile.

481
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,240
I've seen Yi.

482
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,310
She went to Demon Realm

483
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,530
not for fun,

484
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,070
but to find this

485
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,870
for you.

486
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,870
If it were in normal times,

487
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,170
Yi was being

488
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,160
commendable.

489
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,850
But now,

490
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,440
the war between Heaven and Demon

491
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,030
is about to start.

492
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,670
At this critical moment…

493
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,100
I understand.

494
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,370
You should

495
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,540
teach her a lesson.

496
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,190
The Phoenix's blood has been activated

497
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,360
for the first time.

498
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,090
If its blood is activated for the second time,

499
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,760
her power

500
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,620
will stand together with the High Immortals.

501
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,220
If it's activated for the third time,

502
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,120
then

503
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,330
she'll come out of Nirvana

504
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,430
and destroy the Three Realms,

505
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,330
all beings will suffer.

506
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,200
But now,

507
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,330
we don't have

508
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,170
many chances.

509
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,950
Your Majesty,

510
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,390
trust Yan Yue.

511
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,370
Yan Yue is my legitimate son,

512
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,400
the God of the Red Sun

513
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,790
I trust the most.

514
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,050
He is also the successor

515
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,650
of Heavenly Emperor.

516
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,780
But now,

517
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,610
I haven't heard from him.

518
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,730
Don't worry.

519
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,230
Yan Yue won't let us down.

520
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,790
I hope so.

521
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,080
Isn't this Prince Ou Ya of the Wolves?

522
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,060
Yes.

523
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,130
I heard he's arrogant enough

524
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,060
to try to get Phoenix Ashes

525
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,300
and violated the law,

526
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,620
angering Demon Realm.

527
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,700
Now,

528
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,930
he's being sent to Demon Realm to get punished.

529
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm afraid

530
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,440
he won't be able to return.

531
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,580
Exactly.

532
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,430
What a pity for

533
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,860
his charming girl

534
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,370
Lan Su.

535
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,790
Yes.

536
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,110
Ye,

537
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,420
peel the corn

538
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,880
and then two petals of garlic for me.

539
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,220
Okay.

540
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,050
Mother.

541
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:20,860
Mother.

542
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,940
Mother, come and take a look.

543
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,540
A letter from my sister.

544
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,410
That crow sent it.

545
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,850
Crow. Crow.

546
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,920
I want to reply to my sister.

547
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,400
Keep your voice down, Ye.

548
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,180
Let's talk inside.

549
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,860
[Minister's Mansion]

550
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,980
Lady Lingyue.

551
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,330
The crow sent a letter to the Wei family.

552
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,420
Really?

553
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,550
Where is that crow now?

554
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,020
At Baishi Bridge.

555
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,380
I heard they were going to reply to Wei Zhi.

556
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,420
So I came back

557
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,000
immediately.

558
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,670
Lady Hua.

559
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,570
What are you doing here?

560
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,120
Miss.

561
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,340
I fell.

562
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,560
Are you okay?

563
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm fine.

564
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,470
How is the Numb guy?

565
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,380
Do the herbs work?

566
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,870
He could get out of bed last night.

567
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,820
So this morning

568
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,930
he went to the market.

569
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,420
Miss.

570
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,700
Here, take it and try it.

571
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,340
This is the honey I made myself.

572
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,980
It tastes good.

573
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,300
Thank you, Lady Hua.

574
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,460
You're welcome. I'm leaving.

575
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,670
Take care.

576
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,070
Lady Lingyue.

577
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:22,910
Lady Lingyue.

578
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,220
Lady Lingyue.

579
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,230
Take a look.

580
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,270
Sir,

581
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,010
can I borrow

582
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,020
your tools?

583
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,270
Please.

584
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:07,970
Thank you.

585
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,220
Lady Lingyue.

586
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,530
Wei Zhi.

587
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,190
You're awake.

588
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,330
It's really you.

589
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,760
Why am I here?

590
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,560
You fainted at the door.

591
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,720
I brought you in.

592
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,440
What happened?

593
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,380
Why are you

594
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,130
here?

595
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,010
Isn't this my letter?

596
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,170
Why do you have it?

597
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,800
It's a long story.

598
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,020
The Demon Clan robbed the academy that day.

599
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,830
you and Master went missing.

600
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,030
The imperial court

601
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,220
believed

602
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,150
the slander,

603
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,940
thought you were seducing the public

604
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,540
and wanted to put your mother and brother

605
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,430
into the imperial prison.

606
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,600
I tried my best.

607
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,270
So they didn't suffer.

608
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,630
The other day, the crow sent a letter.

609
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,830
The lady I sent to check the house

610
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,820
gave me the letter.

611
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,890
I followed the crow here

612
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,280
to inform you.

613
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,880
Unexpectedly,

614
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,560
I met a mountain demon on the way.

615
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,320
Luckily, I escaped.

616
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,470
Lady Lingyue, you've suffered a lot.

617
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,950
Wei Zhi.

618
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,320
There's no time to lose.

619
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,010
Go save your aunt and brother.

620
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,410
Father told me

621
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,530
tomorrow,

622
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,840
the court will…

623
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,310
What will they do?

624
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,950
They'll behead them.

625
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,420
I'll go with you.

626
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,370
You take a rest here.

627
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,110
I can deal with

628
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,950
those guards.

629
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,580
You're right.

630
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,430
I'll be a burden

631
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,830
to you now.

632
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,510
Good.

633
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,270
Leave a message to Master for me.

634
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,460
Master?

635
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,700
He's here too?

636
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,730
When he comes back,

637
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,500
tell him

638
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,850
that I went back to Yu Du

639
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000
to celebrate my brother's birthday.

640
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,750
I'll be back soon.

641
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,580
Well.

642
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,940
Don't tell him

643
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,620
about my family.

644
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,140
He's sick now.

645
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,820
He can't bear to be worried.

646
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,200
Okay, be careful.

647
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,060
Don't worry.

648
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,429
This is...

649
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,510
Wei Zhi?

650
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,730
Could it be

651
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,179
that Master has fallen for Wei Zhi?

652
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,250
You are skillful.

653
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,160
You've learned it after observing it once.

654
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,510
If you live off this,

655
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,090
I'll have the biggest competitor.

656
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,720
[Capital Prison]

657
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,540
Wei Zhi.

658
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,530
Chen Wuchang?

659
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,200
Wei Ye

660
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,420
is locked up somewhere.

661
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,200
Your mother

662
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,090
has been sent to the execution ground in the eastern suburb.

663
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,280
What?

664
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,400
The Phoenix

665
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,340
took the bait.

666
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,430
How confident are you

667
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,780
in this hunting?

668
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,690
Fully.

669
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,910
You don't seem to be smart

670
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,490
to relieve the besieged by besieging the base of the besiegers.

671
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,980
Some chessmen

672
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,330
only work

673
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,140
when they're in the right place.

674
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,730
What are you going to do

675
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,270
after catching Phoenix this time?

676
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,210
I'll find out first.

677
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,500
But

678
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,110
she's a descendant of the Gu family.

679
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,390
But

680
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,760
Gu Chengwu

681
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,440
is dead.

682
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,370
You mean,

683
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,900
if she doesn't know

684
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,140
what happened to Ming Chengwu,

685
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,500
we can

686
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,470
win her over

687
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,800
and make her our man.

688
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,650
Even if she knows,

689
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,460
as long as she still wants

690
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,430
the position of Phoenix,

691
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,080
she must work with us.

692
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:23,840
Master.

693
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,360
You're back.

694
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,910
I'm glad to see you.

695
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,350
Where have you been?

696
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,350
Are you tired? Are you hungry?

697
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,950
I made you some soup.

698
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,750
I don't know if it tastes good.

699
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,540
Wei Lingyue.

700
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,930
Why are you here?

701
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:38,760
Where's Wei Zhi?

702
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,830
Wei Zhi said

703
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,420
she had something to do.

704
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,290
She'll be back soon.

705
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,430
She told you not to worry about her.

706
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,840
She has something to do?

707
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,540
Where did Wei Zhi go?

708
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,750
She said

709
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,060
she went to celebrate

710
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,740
her brother Wei Ye's birthday.

711
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,130
She told you not to worry about her.

712
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,800
Celebrate her brother's birthday?

713
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,620
She is

714
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,670
in the capital now?

715
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,750
Yes.

716
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:00,880
No way.

717
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:01,980
It's too dangerous

718
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,300
for her

719
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,210
to go to the mortal world like this.

720
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,520
I have to find her.

721
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,180
Master.

722
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,330
Master.

723
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,740
You don't have to go.

724
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,230
Why?

725
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,370
Wei Zhi told me

726
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,100
to take good care of you before she left.

727
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,350
How could I need you to take care of me?

728
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,700
She said during the battle at the academy,

729
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,150
Master was injured.

730
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,300
Now

731
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,420
I wonder if you're feeling better.

732
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,760
I'm fine.

733
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:35,980
Master.

734
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,740
Don't go.

735
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,320
She won't come back.

736
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,630
What do you mean?

737
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,620
Wei Zhi said

738
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,990
she didn't want to

739
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,970
stay here. It's torturing her.

740
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,300
She wants to return to the mortal world

741
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,730
and become the Phoenix

742
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,290
admired by everyone.

743
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,690
Impossible.

744
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,270
Nonsense.

745
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,580
The Formula.

746
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,760
Master, do you know

747
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,370
the Formula is the most insidious trick

748
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,460
in the world.

749
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,490
The one who fell into the Formula

750
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,510
must cut off his love

751
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,690
and forget the one he loves.

752
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,250
Otherwise,

753
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,900
he will die

754
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,060
in seven days.

755
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,940
Even High Immortal

756
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,980
has only

757
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,290
49 days.

758
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,820
Don't waste your energy.

759
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,790
It's useless.

760
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,510
Although the Formula is unsolved,

761
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,670
it's also the easiest to solve.

762
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,400
As long as you

763
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,720
forget the one you love.

764
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,100
Do you understand

765
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,140
Lingyue's feelings?

766
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,470
Forget her.

767
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,170
Come with me.

768
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,470
Wei Lingyue.

769
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,840
Before I met Wei Zhi,

770
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,070
I had no regrets

771
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,720
in the world.

772
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,050
If

773
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,320
I live on,

774
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,520
and deliberately forget

775
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,590
someone I love,

776
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,510
someone who has shown me

777
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,710
all the beautiful

778
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,240
and pleasant things in life,

779
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,700
what's the difference

780
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,320
if I was dead?

781
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,430
You won't understand.

782
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,950
It's too late.

783
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,380
She's already dead.

784
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,430
What did you say?

785
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,010
I said

786
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,590
your lover

787
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,270
already died.

788
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,390
Are you heartbroken?

789
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,790
Because you were hit by the Formula.

790
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,190
The more your heart breaks,

791
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,020
the more poisonous it is.

792
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,940
You're one step closer to death.

793
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,940
I should pity you,

794
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,850
but I can't.

795
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,500
Because now

796
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,160
the pain

797
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,910
that happens to you

798
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,300
used to be

799
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,680
cutting on me

800
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,010
like a blade.

801
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,280
Yan Yue.

802
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,850
It seems that I can't get your love

803
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,270
no matter what.

804
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,940
Okay.

805
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,380
Listen.

806
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,960
At noon today,

807
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,410
your lover

808
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,540
has been tricked by us

809
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,940
to Yu Du's execution ground in the eastern suburbs

810
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,570
to save her dying mother.

811
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,410
The trick has been set up.

812
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,500
Even if she is the Phoenix,

813
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,350
she won't be able to escape.

814
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,140
What should you do?

815
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,970
You came back too late.

816
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,390
If you could come back earlier,

817
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,760
or go now,

818
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,010
you can see her for the last time.

819
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,190
So what?

820
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,680
If she dies,

821
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,060
you will die too.

822
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,570
Wei Lingyue.
