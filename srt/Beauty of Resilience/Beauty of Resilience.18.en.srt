decided when we were born?

6
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,980
You married Heavenly Emperor.

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,100
In the future,

8
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,540
I will marry Yan Yue.

9
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,340
But no one ever asked

10
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,420
if we were willing to get married,

11
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,579

This is the heavenly rule.

Why is there no sunset at dusk?

20
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,380
The Demon Realm is a chaotic place.

21
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,579
Although we have day and night,

23
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,860
we are isolated from the Heavenly Realm.

24
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,100
So we can't see the sun.

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Yes.

28
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,940
The Formula.

29
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,700
Shouldn't it be on Yan Yue?

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,260
Did you asked him to pass

31
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,260

Otherwise,

38
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,060
you will die.

39

How did you know the Formula?

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,579
And how do you know that

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,579
the Formula was on Yan Yue?

42
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,660
It was you.

43
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm sorry, Sister.

44
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,060
I didn't expect that

45
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,420
it would hurt you in the end.

Indeed.

It's fine if you don't follow him.

202

But at least don't run around

Don't believe the gossip

She's a girl,

222
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,980

223

On my behalf?

389
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm the commander

390
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,420
assigned by the imperial court.

391
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,660
Why are you representing me?

392
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,260
So you mean

393
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,620
you're going on an expedition with Father?

394
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,300
I...

395
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,980
Mother.

396
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,700
Master.

397
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,460
I think what Wangyue said

398
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,660
makes sense.

399
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,460
In the military camp,

400
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,420
she dresses like a boy.

401
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,700
No one could ever tell.

402
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,780
You often

403
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,140
teach her military skills.

404
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,300
She's learned a lot from you.

405
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,500
If she can fight on Zhaoyang's behalf,

406
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,450
it will always be

407
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,420
the military credit of Sima Mansion.

408
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,260
You don't have to worry about

409
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,380
His Majesty's order.

410
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,460
Nonsense.

411
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,020
Is it a joke

412
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,380
on the battlefield?

413
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,980
Nonsense!

414
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,830
[Large Swan in Sky]

415
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,300
Master! Master!

416
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,260
Father.

417
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,740
I have a question.

418
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,460
What is it?

419
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,700
You always say that

420
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,180
boys and girls are the same.

421
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,060
They all study and practice martial arts.

422
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,220
You always say that I'm better than Brother.

423
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,980
But when it comes to critical moments,

424
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,300
you don't do as you said.

425
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,940
Mu Nan, tell me.

426
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,220
Which part of girls is worse

427
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,290
than boys?

428
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
I don't know.

429
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,180
But I think

430
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,900
you are better than

431
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,700
than all men in the world.

432
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,740
As for other women,

433
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,500
not necessarily.

434
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,700
Why?

435
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,700
Because

436
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,700
they are so annoying.

437
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,860
And

438
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,980
they don't look good.

439
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,460
Mu Nan.

440
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,220
Wangyue.

441
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,740
Father.

442
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,900
What brings you here so late?

443
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,540
I came to see you.

444
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,220
You're still reading

445
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,260
books of military skills?

446
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,860
Do you feel tired after

447
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,940
practicing martial arts for so many years?

448
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,210
No.

449
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,460
Practicing embroidery is tiring.

450
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,700
Girls

451
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,140
should learn some needlework.

452
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,980
Only in this way

453
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,220
can you marry someone good in the future.

454
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,700
Then why did you

455
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,140
taught me military skills since I was young?

456
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,420
I think

457
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,060
you are gifted in martial arts.

458
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,980
It's a pity if you don't learn.

459
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,460
But I regret it now.

460
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,500
It's too late.

461
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,220
Wangyue.

462
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
If I let you

463
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,500
go to the battlefield,

464
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,900
will you be afraid?

465
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,980
No.

466
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,080
You may die

467
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,660
on the battlefield.

468
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
What you hear is the sound of drums.

469
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,780
What you see is the flying flags.

470
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,020
But those are not the real battlefield.

471
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,450
People sacrifice and die.

472
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,770
That's the real battlefield.

473
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,420
But I have a heart

474
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,220
to protect the country and the people.

475
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Every time I think of these,

476
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,220
I get excited.

477
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,460
I'm not afraid of anything.

478
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,460
But pretending to be a man

479
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,260
is deceiving His Majesty.

480
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,260
Father, are you afraid?

481
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
Naughty.

482
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,020
Mu Nan.

483
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,180
Yes, sir.

484
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,540
When you go to the battlefield,

485
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,540
you must protect her.

486
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,540
Yes.

487
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,460
You allow me to go on the expedition?

488
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,660
Great!

489
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,570
[Gu City]

490
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,530
[Get Armed Forces Ready]

491
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,420
Marshal.

492
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,830
Cao.

493
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
You've defended Gu City alone for years.

494
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,500
I appreciated that.

495
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,100
[General Cao]

496
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,100
[Guardian General of Weicang Gu City]

497
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,000
It's my honor.

498
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,980
All I want

499
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,980
is to

500
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,370
follow you all the time.

501
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,380
My people guarding the border

502
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,220
are waiting for you to come,

503
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,900
but we're also afraid to see you.

504
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Because once you arrive,

505
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,380
the peaceful days are over.

506
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,790
By the way, Cao,

507
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,060
Let me introduce someone to you

508
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,700
Zhaoyang,

509
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,060
this is General Cao.

510
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,260
General Cao.

511
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,020
Marshal's son.

512
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,140
It's been a long time.

513
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,380
You've really grown up.

514
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,420
But you seem

515
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,180
a little thin.

516
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,380
Follow me well on the battlefield.

517
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,540
In a few months,

518
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,380
you'll be strong as a bull.

519
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,060
Commander Sima,

520
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,460
I'll give you 500 new soldiers

521
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,860
to set up camps as the front camp

522
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,980
at the first ten miles of Gu City.

523
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,180
They'll set out immediately.

524
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,220
Yes.

Marshal.

526
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,060
It's a heavy duty to be on the front.

527
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,300
Zhaoyang's young.

528
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,780
And it's his first time on the front line.

529
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,460
Is this...

530
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,420
Since the court ask him

531
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,780
to be a commander,

532
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,300
he has to take the responsibility.

533
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,410
By the way,

534
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,460
you can't spoil him

535
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,220
only because you're at his uncle's age.

Are you angry?

[General Qi]

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,130
[Guardian General of Weicang Gu City]

542
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,700
Let me remind you.

543
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,700
From now on,

544
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,220
don't call him Zhaoyang.

545
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,180
Show some respect.

546
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,900
You should call him Commander.

547
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,900
Also,

548
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,660
don't think about the battle achievement

549
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,220
in the frontline.

550
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,980
Can that position be left to you?

551
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,460
Let's go for a drink.

552
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,500
[Wei]

553
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,010
Let's drink.

[Wei]

555
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,860
What's wrong?

557
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,900
Look at you.

558
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,060
Good job.

559
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,220
How could you become a soldier

560
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,380
with such bad eyesight?

561
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,260
Right.

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,380
Like a three-year-old kid.

563
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,860
You can't walk steadily.

564
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,900
Are you okay?

565
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm fine.

566
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,220
What do you mean?

567
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,060
Kid,

568
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,700
you have a little temper.

569
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,940
But let me remind you.

570
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,700
You're new here.

571
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,840

572
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,840
[Veteran]

573
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,460
You should learn to be respectful.

574
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,300
It's right that newcomers should do more.

575
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,420
But that's enough.

576
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,980
It's boring

577
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,700
to make fun of good people.

578
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Every year,

579
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,660
there will always be

580
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,300
some newcomers with short temper.

581
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,380
Guys,

582
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,980
according to our old rules,

583
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,700
what should we do

584
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
when we meet newcomers with short temper?

585
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,900
Cut the crap.

586
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,300
Just teach him how to be a human.

587
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,180
That's right.

588
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,300
Good idea!

589
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,060
Beat him!

590
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,220
Stop!

591
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,980
Get up!

592
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,700
Commander.

593
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,850
Staff Mu.

594
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,500
Commander.

595
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,700
Staff Mu.

596
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,620
What are you doing?

597
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,460
We...

598
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,980
We didn't do anything.

599
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,180
We just want to learn from these guys.

600
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:23,980
Just learn.

601
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
Learn from each other.

602
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,660
Newcomer?

603
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,660
Commander.

604
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,450
My name is Chen Yan.

605
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,740
In Gu City Army,

606
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,500
capability means everything.

607
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,980
Whoever is capable

608
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,980
can speak loudly.

609
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,740
Understand?

610
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,980
Yes.

611
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,740
From now on,

612
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,220
you are the new Group Leader of newcomers.

613
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,980
Do something big

614
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,380
with your guys.

615
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,380
Yes, Commander.

616
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,620
You?

617
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,460
They were clearly fighting.

618
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,900
They were obviously lying.

619
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,540
Why didn't you say it?

620
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,420
If he can't

621
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,500
handle such a small thing,

622
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,980
he's not a good soldier.

623
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,260
Similarly,

624
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,180
If I have to handle a small thing like this,

625
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,020
I'm not a good commander.

626
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,460
Thank you.

627
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,740
It's nothing.

628
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,060
You didn't say anything.

629
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,140
Good job.

630
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,730
You too.

631
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,060
Not bad, Group Leader.

632
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,530
It’s only been a few days.

633
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,250
Just lucky.

634
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,840
What did you do before?

635
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,310
You don't look like a newcomer.

636
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,380
Me?

637
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,590
A bandit.

638
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,910
You're bragging.

639
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,190
Fighting brought us together.

640
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,620
Yes.

641
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,700
Slow down.

642
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,500
Be careful.

643
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,780
Where are you people from?

644
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,860
Where are you going?

645
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,740
We

646
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,420
escaped

647
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,500
from the frontline.

648
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,980
We just to return to our homeland.

649
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,780
We are all good people.

650
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,620
Yes.

651
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,370
We are all good people.

652
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Folks,

653
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,900
this is the battlefield of two countries.

654
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,980
If you want to go to Gu City,

655
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
you need to take a detour.

656
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,620
A detour?

657
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,220
What should we do?

658
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,940
Right.

659
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,380
If we want to take a detour,

660
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,540
we have to cross the mountain.

661
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,500
But old and young people like us

662
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,180
can't walk that long at all.

663
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,700
Have mercy on us!

664
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,060
Let us go.

665
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,980
Let us go!

666
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,490
Let us through!

667
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,260
Let us go.

668
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,660
We want to go.

669
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,780
Let us go.

670
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,180
We can't walk anymore.

671
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,180
Let us go over.

672
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,700
Calm down.

673
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,180
Calm down. Listen to me.

674
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,460
I asked you to take a detour

675
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,730
for the sake of safety.

676
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,220
I will send troops

677
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,180
to take you there.

678
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,700
I'll deliver some food

679
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
to you.

680
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,700
We don't believe it.

681
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,980
You will kill people.

682
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,460
Calm down, everyone.

683
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,300
Stop! Come back!

684
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,140
You can't go over there!

685
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,700
Don't move.

686
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,300
Assassin!

687
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,420
Innocent people, leave!

688
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,700
Kill anyone who disobeys!

689
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,780
Step back.

690
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,660
Staff Mu.

691
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,660
I'll protect Commander.

692
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,170
OK.

693
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,060
Leave this to me.

694
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,180
Lean on me.

695
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,260
Save your strength.

696
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,580
[Wei]

697
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,660
Why isn't he back yet?

698
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,130
Did something happen?

699
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,220
You are finally back.

700
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,700
Commander refused to summon a doctor.

701
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,260
He has to wait for you.

702
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,910
Commander.

703
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,180
How is it?

704
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,020
The spy who infiltrated the refugees

705
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,940
has been caught.

706
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,110
We have no casualties.

707
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,020
What about the refugees?

708
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,220
Don’t worry, Commander.

709
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,700
They have detoured.

710
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,020
Wang Wu is in charge of protecting them.

711
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,460
What's important now is to treat the wound.

712
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,700
Commander, let me take off your armor.

713
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,940
Chen Yan.

714
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,700
What are you doing?

715
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm removing the armor

716
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,180
and treat the wound.

717
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,200
None of your business.

718
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,560
I will...

719
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,630
I'll take care of it.

720
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,420
You're welcome. It's fine.

721
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,220
Staff Mu can help me.

722
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,260
Go back and rest.

723
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,020
OK.

724
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,900
I'm leaving.

725
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,580
Medicine.

726
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,980
Chen Yan. Chen Yan.

727
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,940
Are you looking for me?

728
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,860
You're smart.

729
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,060
How do you know there were soldiers

730
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,020
among the refugees?

731
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,060
I escaped from wars when I was young.

732
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,540
We don't know the rich and noble people.

733
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,460
But I know

734
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,540
what do refugees look like.

735
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
There are despair

736
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,060
and pain

737
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,060
in the eyes of refugees.

738
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,900
There's no way that their eyes are sharp.

739
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,900
Right?

740
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,260
You're really something.

741
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,500
When I get promoted,

742
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,420
I'll bring you guys to have a good life

743
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,980
and enjoy delicious food.

744
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,700
Princess.

745
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,780
Does it still hurt?

746
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,900
I'm fine.

747
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,380
It's just a scratch.

748
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,860
Chen Yan was...

749
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,860
He touched you a lot of times.

750
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,020
That's ridiculous.

751
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,620
He doesn't know who I am.

752
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,740
The one who doesn't know is innocent.

753
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,300
Besides,

754
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
he saved me before.

755
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,060
He's contributed a lot.

756
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,980
Princess.

757
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,980
Mu Nan

758
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,460
killed someone today.

759
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,980
Do you remember what Father said

760
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,380
before we left?

761
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,420
Were you afraid?

762
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,300
Yes.

763
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,740
Me too.

764
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,740
Since young,

765
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,260
we studied military books and tactics.

766
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,700
All we think about

767
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,940
is deployment.

768
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,460
When I went to the battlefield today,

769
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
I realized

770
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,460
fighting with our life

771
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,980
is like this.

772
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,380
Father once said

773
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,260
benevolent people don't lead the army.

774
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,980
I didn't understand before.

775
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,850
But I think today...

776
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,780
I see.

777
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,580
Look at Chen Yan.

778
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,420
He was decisive on the battlefield.

779
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
He has a lot of strength.

780
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,820
Maybe people like him

781
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,860
is born to be on a battlefield.

782
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,980
Chen Yan.

783
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,500
Commander.

784
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,659
Who are you?

785
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,380
Group Leader of Gu City Army of Weicang,

786
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,250
Chen Yan.

787
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,740
I'm asking about your real identity.

788
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,180
Camping, taming horses, fighting.

789
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,340
You were so good at all of them.

790
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,180
Tell me honestly.

791
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,980
What did you do before you came to Gu City?

792
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,780
A thief.

793
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,900
The war between two countries has been more than ten years.

794
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,620
The people are living in misery.

795
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,980
I grew up without parents.

796
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,890
I've been living in refugees.

797
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,020
It was luck to live.

798
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,770
Give it back!

799
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,780
Screw you!

800
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,740
How dare you fight back?

801
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,860
Later, there were bandits in the village.

802
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,300
After the robbery,

803
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,260
they caught the men of each family

804
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,860
and forced us to learn

805
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,300
how to fight with others.

806
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,080
Once on a mission,

807
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,420
they killed a few

808
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,300
helpless villagers

809
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,660
for half a bag of soybean.

810
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,500
I think it's not something

811
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,810
that should be done by a real man.

812
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,740
So I escaped

813
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,820
and ran to Weicang.

814
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,940
I wanted to find a job.

815
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,340
Next.

816
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,660
Name.

817
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,340
Chen Yan.

818
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,580
Okay.

819
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,660
Next.

820
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,980
Later I saw

821
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,140
that Gu City army recruited strong men.

822
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,540
That's why I'm here.

823
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,340
Thank you for saving me.

824
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,860
It's nothing.

825
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,020
It's the duty of every soldier.

826
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,820
to protect the commander.

827
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,620
From now on,

828
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,420
you are the Great Leader.

829
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,380
What? Great Leader?

830
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,580
Just a small promotion.

831
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,540
You're not satisfied?

832
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,100
Of course not.

833
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,580
You said I'm capable.

834
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,740
Of course not.

835
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,900
How arrogant.

836
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,420
One day,

837
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,890
when I become a general

838
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,980
and meet the Emperor,

839
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,620
I want to ask him myself.

840
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,060
Who are you to fight a war?

841
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
Why do you want to fight?

842
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,420
For the sake of the country,

843
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,460
and people.

844
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,300
Commander,

845
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,860
As Great Leader,

846
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,020
I'm going to

847
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,860
go on patrol.

848
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:24,910
[Wei]

849
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,500
I'm going as well.

850
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,950
This is a newcomer's job.

851
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,980
I...

852
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,180
am also a newcomer.

853
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,820
Although I'm familiar with military books,

854
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,500
I don't have much practical experience.

855
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,100
Maybe I’m not as good as you.

856
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,060
Let's start with the patrol.

857
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,260
OK.

858
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,100
Commander.

859
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,660
Have some water.

860
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,060
Commander.

861
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,740
We're arriving at the border

862
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,460
between two countries.

863
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,460
It's a deserted place.

864
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,260
How about

865
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,460
we go back first?

866
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,740
Chen Yan is the warden today.

867
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,780
Follow his arrangement today.

868
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,060
I see.

869
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,660
You are experiencing life.

870
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,420
No, to know more about people's life.

871
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,260
Something's wrong.

872
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,340
It's the army of Jinghe!

873
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,860
Jinghe's food.

874
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Go after them!

875
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,020
What are you doing?

876
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,880
Listen to Commander.

877
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,890
Follow them

878
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,550
and see where they are camping tonight.

879
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
If we want to attack them,

880
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,370
we have to wait until it's dark.

881
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,290
Objection.

882
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,420
Commander,

883
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,860
there are only a few of us.

884
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,290
Besides, you are here.

885
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,260
It’s too dangerous.

886
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,660
How about Chen Yan and I follow them?

887
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,300
When Commander gets the order of Marshal,

888
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
we'll bring reinforcements.

889
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,060
Getting the order?

890
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,340
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

891
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,740
We can’t take away the food

892
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,980
only with these few people.

893
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,300
Unless...

894
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,980
Unless what?

895
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,060
Unless we don't want food.

896
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,980
And destroy it.

897
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,150
It's enough.
