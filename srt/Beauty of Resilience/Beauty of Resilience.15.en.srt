She died.

You'll die too.

10
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:17,950

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,200
Mother, are you alright?

Hold her!

15

Help!

16
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,770
Mother.

17
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,240
What do you want?

18
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,100
If you don't want your mother

19
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,290
to be hurt,

20
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,760
I advise you

21
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,500
to stop resisting now.

22
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,659
I was disfigured

23
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,440
and I lost my father's love.

24
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,510
All of this

25
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,020
is because of you, you witch.

26

27
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,790
I'll make you taste

28
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,090
how it feels to be tortured

29
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,540
in front of your family members.

30
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,340
I forgot that

31
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,890
you aren't afraid of fire.

32
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,980
This is tricky.

33

Come at me!

38
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,840
It has nothing to do with my mother.

39
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,650
Are you scared?

40
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,640
Unfortunately, your brother passed out in shock.

41
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,880
But it's fine.

42
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,650
How about this?

43
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,460
I'll change

44
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,510

Great. You...

You still remember me?

53
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,230
Jingyue, you must be joking.

54
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,890
Of course I remember you.

55
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,020
Brother Ming Lang, aren't you in prison?

56
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,890
Did you escape from the prison

57
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,630
to save this witch?

61
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,150
The death of my father

62
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,660
and the riot in Gucheng

63
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,740
were caused by this witch.

64
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,230
I heard that the Imperial Advisor

65
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,800
had caught the witch.

66
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,750
This is really satisfying.

67

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,560
Respect it!

196
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

197
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,990
Take it.

198
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,780
From the God's blessings, behold the message of the emperor that

199
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,900
the witch and Phoenix, Wei Zhi,

200
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,000
brought disasters to the country and the people.

201
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,160
She colluded with the rebels in Gucheng, the Ming family,

202
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,260
and was in open revolt.

203
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,170
Now,

204
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,780
we're recruiting patriots in the country

205
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,650
to join the army of the Peahen Saintess

206
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,320
[Notice]

207
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,340
and West Conquering General Wei Lingyue.

208
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,940
to eliminate the witch

209
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,600
and serve the country.

210
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,390
How come Phoenix

211
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,700
became a rebel?

212
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,280
Exactly.

213
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,690
Didn't they specially

214
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,950
select 18 students

215
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,300
to go to Egret Academy

216
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,500
to measure their immortal bones

217
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,630
and pick Phoenix?

218
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,910
How come

219
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,620
after all the trouble they went through,

220
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
the chosen Phoenix

221
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,940
became the scourge?

222
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
Sir, your food.

223
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,170
Thank you.

224
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
Mother, Ye,

225
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,740
you must be hungry.

226
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,920
Eat something first.

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,560
You...

228
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,180
Just leave.

229
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,580
Don't implicate us

230
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,590
because of

231
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,750
your identity as Phoenix.

232
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,460
Mother, I don't want her to go.

233
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,030
Mother, I know. I will leave.

234
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,800
But before I leave,

235
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,040
I want you to meet Ming Lang.

236
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,500
I am Ming Lang.

237
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,730
I'm Li Meng.

238
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,810
I'm Zhao Hu.

239
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,700
I am Zhou Quan.

I'm Zhang Long.

242
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,310
Greetings, Mrs. Gu.

243
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,260
Mrs. Gu.

244
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,900
I was framed and imprisoned

245
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,240
for my father's death.

246
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,170
After His Majesty had found out the truth,

247
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,810
I was released.

248
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,900
I wanted to find out what happened.

249
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,430
But

250
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,600
when I sneaked into the archives

251
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,990
and read the files,

252
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,750
I found

253
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,360
the pages related to

254
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,180
the rebellion of the Gu family

255
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,800
were torn apart.

256
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,780
After visits,

257
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,850
I gradually learned

258
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
my father's death

259
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,980
has a lot to do

260
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,660
with what happened

261
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,430
to the Gu family.

262
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,660
My father,

263
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,270
Uncle Gu, and Lord Gu

264
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,570
were just pawns

265
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,760
chosen by the Imperial Advisor.

266
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,260
Mrs. Gu,

267
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,570
no matter whether

268
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,940
my father's death has anything to do with

269
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,890
the Gu family incident,

270
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,370

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,340
OK.

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,260

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,420

338
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,360

339
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,480
It's you.

340
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,780
Do you know

341
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,800
he was poisoned by the Formula?

342
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,750
You know the Formula?

343
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,880
There's good news and bad news.

344
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,050
Anyone poisoned by the Formula

345
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,330
will die.

346
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,390
The only solution

347
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,300
is that another lovestruck person

348
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,510
makes sacrifices willingly

349
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,770
under strong affection.

350
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,830
In this way, the Formula will be transferred.

351
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,230
Is that true?

352
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,230
This is the only way to save him.

353
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,560
But...

354
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,140
But what?

355
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,220
But once the Formula is used,

356
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,240
it can only be transferred

357
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,510
once in a lifetime.

358
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,940
Once it is transferred,

359
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,230
there will be no other solutions.

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,140
♫I'm only waiting for you♫

385
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,340
♫To appear in my dreams♫

386
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,210
♫The courtyard is lush with sycamores♫

387
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,820
♫I only hopes that one day♫

388
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,740
♫There'll still be a phoenix to roost♫

389
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,470
♫I'm still looking for you until the sun stains the clouds♫

390
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,190
♫Like a duckweed waiting to be married♫

391
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,830
♫I'm still looking for you♫

392
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,920
♫No matter how thick the fog is and how hard it is to find the Netherworld♫

393
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:10,400
♫My love for you will never change♫

394
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,610
Why are you awake so early?

395
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm going to cook.

396
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,370
Get some more sleep.

397
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,850
I'll go then.

398
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,510
Wei Zhi.

399
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,540
Look.

400
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,000
The Formula is gone.

401
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,260
It disappeared!

402
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,380
Great!

403
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,600
I think my spiritual power has recovered

404
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,900
and resisted the Formula.

405
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm going to cook.

406
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,830
Do you like it?

407
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,300
Why did you suddenly think of

408
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,240
buying me rouge?

409
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,800
I passed by a cosmetics shop that day.

410
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,230
They were drumming up.

411
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,480
A customer came.

412
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,270
He said his wife

413
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,460
is very beautiful

414
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,080
and doesn't need any makeup.

415
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,780
His words reminded me

416
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,780
of you.

417
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,750
You know what?

418
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,260
The shop owner is a sweet talker.

419
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,450
He is quite suitable for business.

420
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,960
I think so too.

421
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,770
Wei Zhi.

422
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,770
I can't change

423
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,700
your fate and destiny.

424
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,380
I can't change your identity

425
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,360
and your experience either.

426
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,380
I don't even know

427
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,310
the ways of the human world.

428
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,060
So I thought

429
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,130
I should listen to the shop owner

430
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,340
and buy you rouge

431
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,520
like a mortal.

432
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,560
At least when you use it,

433
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,470
you'll

434
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,570
be happier.

435
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,500
I wish we could be like this every day.

436
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,290
Yes, if I can be like this every day,

437
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,780
then I, the Numb Guy,

438
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
won't be the Divine Lord again

439
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,180
nor return to the Heavenly Court.

440
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,120
Wei Zhi.

441
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,210
What's wrong?

442
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,270
I'm okay.

443
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,690
I'll make breakfast.

444
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,170
Wait.

445
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,350
What happened?

446
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,470
Wei Zhi.

447
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,570
Tell me.

448
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,110
What happened?

449
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,180
Tell me the truth.

450
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,740
Why is the Formula on you?

451
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,590
Was it last night...

452
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,570
It was all because of me.

453
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,190
You risked your life to save me many times.

454
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,010
How could I

455
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,100
watch you die?

456
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,710
Why are you so silly?

457
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,630
Don't worry.

458
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,920
I am a phoenix.

459
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,360
The Formula is nothing to me.

460
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,250
Even I can't resist it.

461
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,630
How can you stand it?

462
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,440
Whatever.

463
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,550
With your love

464
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,540
and we being together,

465
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,000
even if I die,

466
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,370
so what?

467
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,840
Wei Zhi!

468
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:42,980
Wei Zhi!

469
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,870
No.

470
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,980
I can't get close to you.

471
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,440
The closer I get to you,

472
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,860
the faster the Formula takes effect.

473
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,470
I will save you.

474
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,190
Yan Yue,

475
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,170
don't go.

476
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,830
Stay with me.

477
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,620
I'll go back to the Heavenly Court and beg Father.

478
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,060
He can save you.

479
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,520
[The Minister's Mansion]

480
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
[Remarkable and Outstanding]

481
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,750
Father.

482
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,570
Here.

483
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,430
I'm so excited

484
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,670
about my appointment.

485
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,280
I can finally get

486
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,250
what I want

487
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,250
and bring glory to our family.

488
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,720
I remember

489
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,020
when I visited you

490
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,120
at the academy last time,

491
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,650
you said you were the chosen one

492
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,580
and someday,

493
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,110
you would become Phoenix

494
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,130
and be my pride.

495
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,710
But now,

496
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,400
you have to face the reality.

497
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,140
You are not Phoenix.

498
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,390
Fortunately, I am not Phoenix.

499
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,050
That Phoenix

500
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,780
colluded with the demons

501
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,740
and harmed the human world.

502
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,100
Now the court has already...

503
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,980
I've been an official for so many years.

504
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,690
You can tell others these words.

505
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,800
But such diplomacy doesn't work on me.

506
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,310
Father,

507
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,140
what do you mean?

508
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,900
Of course

509
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,700
I won't tell these to anyone else.

510
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,580
I'm telling the truth

511
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,150
because I'm talking to you, my father.

512
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,970
Last time in the academy,

513
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I was attacked.

514
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,720
That is the evidence

515
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,520
that Wei Zhi colluded with the Demon Clan.

516
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,980
Forget it.

517
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,390
Let's end the conversation here.

518
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,230
No matter how much I say,

519
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,050
you won't believe me.

520
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,230
I thought

521
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,820
you came here

522
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,590
to congratulate me.

523
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,130
It's been a long time

524
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,020
since we saw each other last time.

525
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,890
Let's not talk about this.

526
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,860
We've already

527
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,740
talked about this.

528
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,390
Lingyue,

529
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,300
you are my only daughter.

530
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,560
No matter what you do,

531
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
you are my greatest pride.

532
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,460
Really?

533
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,950
But...

534
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,630
But what?

535
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,450
It's just that

536
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,180
over the years,

537
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,540
I've seen too many

538
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,140
intrigues

539
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,400
and schemes.

540
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,720
I'm really tired.

541
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,990
I have requested to retire

542
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,700
this morning.

543
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,130
His Majesty

544
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,880
has approved it.

545
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,380
I'm old.

546
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,000
Now, I'm no longer an official.

547
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,020
I'm free.

548
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,130
I plan

549
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,170
to go back to my hometown.

550
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:52,930
From now on,

551
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,170
I can't always protect you.

552
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,200
But actually,

553
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,220
you don't need

554
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,390
my protection.

555
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,410
San'er,

556
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,190
remember my words.

557
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,720
One's obsession is the biggest demon.

558
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,120
I'm here

559
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,510
to ask you one last question.

560
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Are you willing to give all this up

561
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,480
and go back to the hometown

562
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,160
with me?

563
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,310
Alright.

564
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,330
I...

565
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,360
should go.

566
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,250
Father.

567
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,100
Minister.

568
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,350
How come?

569
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:03,900
No.

570
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,870
This can't be true.

571
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,200
How is it?

572
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,210
I don't think my spiritual power has recovered.

573
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,620
Then don't

574
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,530
use your spiritual power anymore.

575
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,410
I'm fine.

576
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,780
Let me think about it.

577
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,600
-I can save you. -Okay. Calm down.

578
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,820
Lady Hua said

579
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,050
there is a spiritual herb

580
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,470
that can cure all diseases.

581
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,940
Wait for me.

582
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,500
First, don't sneak into the human world.

583
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,830
Second, don't kill because of gluttony.

584
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,960
Third, don't break into Demon Realm

585
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,790
or get involved

586
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,690
with the Demon Clan.

587
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,590
My Lord.

588
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,730
Look, this is the new dish I made.

589
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,409
Here, try one.

590
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,210
I want you

591
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,159
to cook this dish for me every day.

592
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,400
For the past ten thousand years,

593
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,690
I've been protecting you.

594
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,900
But you're still thinking about

595
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,460
that man

596
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,699
even though you don't know where he is.

597
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,929
Have you ever considered how I feel?

598
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,659
Day after day, year after year,

599
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,100
I can never

600
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,860
be by your side.

601
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,650
Do you wonder how do I feel about that?

602
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,380
No, no.

603
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,060
Why am I distracted again?

604
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Third,

605
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,100
don't get involved with the Demoon Clang...

606
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,730
Demoon Clang?

607
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,120
Third,

608
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,610
don't get involved with the Demon Clan.

609
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,900
I advise you to

610
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,140
tell us where Phoenix is

611
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,240
so that you won't suffer more.

612
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,440
Where is Phoenix?

613
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,300
Phoenix.

614
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,650
Where is Phoenix?

615
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,210
Where is Phoenix?

616
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,010
I really don't remember.

617
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,830
Itchy.

618
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:54,890
I...

619
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,050
I thought...

620
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,980
I thought the supreme lord of the Demon Clan

621
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,860
was super powerful.

622
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,250
That's it?

623
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,000
Let me tell you.

624
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,850
I feel quite comfortable.

625
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,150
I am very comfortable!

626
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,290
This is Ice Leech.

627
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,230
It absorbs your blood

628
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
from head to toe.

629
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,780
And its bites can release

630
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,750
the cold from the Northern Ocean.

631
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,720
You will become an ice sculpture

632
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,630
within 24 hours.

633
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,020
The Numb...

634
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,930
-Girl. -Lady Hua.

635
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,510
Your husband

636
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,940
asked me

637
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,640
to bring the decoction to you.

638
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,500
What's wrong with you?

639
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,420
Are you not feeling well?

640
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,280
Thank you, Lady Hua.

641
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,770
I'm okay. It's just...

642
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,660
Just a cold.

643
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,820
Isn't your husband

644
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,540
weird?

645
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,980
He picked the herb

646
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,620
and made the decoction himself.

647
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,670
But he didn't want to bring it to you himself.

648
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,980
Instead, he asked me to bring it to you.

649
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,510
What? Did you two fight?

650
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,840
All right.

651
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,890
It's common for couples to have quarrels.

652
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,180
As long as he has you in his heart,

653
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,990
that's enough.

654
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:19,830
Here, take it.

655
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,300
Thank you, Lady Hua.

656
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,280
Drink it while it's warm.

657
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,650
I'm leaving then.

658
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,410
Yan Yue,

659
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,270
where have you been?

660
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,620
[Zihua Book Pavilion]

661
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,970
Come out.

662
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,520
Elder Mu.

663
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,290
Go back.

664
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,630
My Lord.

665
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,610
Why did you say so?

666
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,660
The Formula can only

667
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,290
be transferred once.

668
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,950
You've already used that method.

669
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Unless you don't fall in love again,

670
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,280
this disaster

671
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,380
can't be solved.

672
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:47,360
What do you want?

673
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,750
What do you want?

674
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,260
I want Wei Zhi

675
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,610
to live.

676
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,470
Yan Yue. Yan Yue,

677
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,420
Everyone came to me,

678
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,500
trying to exchange something unimportant

679
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,470
for something important.

680
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,870
Then tell me,

681
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,440
are there such ridiculous deals

682
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,890
in the world?

683
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,600
My principle is

684
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,350
to exchange something good

685
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,520
for

686
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,410
what people think is important

687
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,050
but the most worthless thing.

688
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,720
What do you want from me?

689
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,640
About Phoenix's life,

690
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,240
there's nothing

691
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,160
I can do.

692
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,680
My Lord,

693
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,260
please go back.

694
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,430
What is

695
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,730
this dream?

696
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,170
A deity doesn't dream.

697
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,480
That's destiny.

698
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,290
What do you mean?

699
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,500
People have to face their destiny

700
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,650
sooner or later.

701
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,700
If you deliberately avoid it

702
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,910
or fear to face it,

703
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,000
maybe

704
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,360
it will come sooner.

705
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,650
I don't understand.

706
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,500
No.

707
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,520
You know where

708
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,110
the answer you want is.

709
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,930
It's just that you don't dare to face it.

710
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,440
Impossible.

711
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,250
That's impossible.
