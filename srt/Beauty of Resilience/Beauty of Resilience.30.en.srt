16
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Of course.

17
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,660

23
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,820

If I see him again,

27
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,060

28
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,780
I got injured

29
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,260

31

You took such a big risk

32

35
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,420
I always admire

36
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,780
those who value love and friendship

37
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,020
and those who always follow their own heart,

38
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,980
especially the women who can do it.

39
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,900
It's too dangerous for you

40
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,980
to stay in Demon Realm alone.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Not all demons

42
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,640

43

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,140
Demon Queen.

50
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
They all call you Demon Queen.

51
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,780
So your husband

52
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,340
is the Demon King?

53
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,690
My husband is a Demon Duke.

54
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,140
He only controls part of Demon Realm.

55
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,900
There is no Demon King in Demon Realm.

56
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,100
When demons meet,

57
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,340
they start to fight against each other.

58
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,460
Very chaotic.

It's too hard to find someone there.

63
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,460
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

64
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,810
Right now, the Realm is in turmoil.

65
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,180
Many demons will kill each other

66
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,220

73

74

I'll ask him to see you.

75
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,330

But I don't know her name.

86

88

96

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220

a long time ago?

103
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,900
It is said that the Phoenix

104
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,220
will change the fate of Demon Realm.

105
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,140

those who believe this are incompetent.

107
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,460

Unconsciously,

191
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,310
♫No matter how thick the fog is and how hard it is to find the Netherworld♫

192
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,340
we began to rely on each other

193
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,820
and give each other warmth.

194
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,100
It's me.

195
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,900
♫My love for you will never change♫

196
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,060
But those good times were short-lived.

197
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,700
We were forced to separate.

198
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,580
He broke the rules of his family for me

199
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,100
and got severely punished.

200
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,860
When he knew

201
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,340
I was in danger,

202
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,300
he tried his best

203
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,330
to protect me

204
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,980
and got badly injured.

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,100
He even lost his memories because of this.

206
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,300
Dear,

207
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,580
you must help her

208
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,580
find her husband.

209
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,290
I...

210
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,620
How about this?

211
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,820
You draw a portrait of your husband.

212
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,820
Then

213
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,700
we can look for him

214
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,620
based on the portrait.

215
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,220
I don't know how to draw.

216
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,700
Then it'll be tricky.

217
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,220
What should we do?

218
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,570
I don't think

219
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,620
she should continue to look for him.

220
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,820
He has forgotten you

221
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,820
because you're not important to him at all.

222
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,820
Fine.

223
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,860
Even if he loves you very much,

224
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,860
you've brought him too much pain.

225
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,100
So why don't you just separate forever?

226
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,980
Then both of you will be happy.

227
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Let it go.

228
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,340
Get over him.

229
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,220
I've brought him too much pain?

230
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,740
So letting him go

231
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,390
is for his good?

232
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
That's right.

233
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,620
But it's unfair

234
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,860
to Wei Zhi.

235
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,980
He just forgot everything.

236
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
He forgot his pain.

237
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,340
What about Wei Zhi?

238
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,940
Her husband may be dead

239
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,220
or remarried.

240
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,060
There're many possibilities.

241
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,060
She'll be more painful.

242
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,420
Don't make her lose hope.

243
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,620
Do something.

244
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,100
Maybe Demon Duke is right.

245
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,220
I should think about

246
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,100
whether I should continue to look for him.

247
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,220
What's wrong?

248
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,700
You look absent-minded tonight.

249
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
I am thinking

250
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,820
if you

251
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,100
disappear one day,

252
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,980
I'll be more upset

253
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,180
than Wei Zhi.

254
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,740
Let me tell you,

255
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,100
that day

256
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,940
will never come.

257
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,500
You are the best.

258
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,100
So will you

259
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,980
help Wei Zhi?

260
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,700
I promised her.

261
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,220
I was so worried about you just now.

262
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
I didn't expect you

263
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,740
were trying to make me feel sympathetic for her.

264
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,860
Will you help her or not?

265
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,810
Yes.

266
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,820
Have you

267
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
got any idea?

268
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,740
Out with the old, in with the new.

269
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
Wei Zhi.

270
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,860
I bought you a new outfit.

271
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,060
What for?

272
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
Do you have good news to tell me?

273
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,820
Yes, I do.

274
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,340
You will like it.

275
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,860
What news?

276
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,060
We are preparing

277
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,940
a blind date for you.

278
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Date?

279
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,700
Demon Duke has invited

280
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,820
the four best bachelors

281
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,730
in our tribe

282
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,940
to come.

283
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,180
You may pick one from them as your boyfriend tonight.

284
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,100
I already saw them.

285
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,220
They

286
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,700
are all handsome.

287
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,100
How should I

288
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,490
describe them?

289
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,580
Let me put it this way.

290
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
They are

291
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,340
almost as handsome as Demon Duke.

292
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,740
You know

293
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,700
Demon Duke

294
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,340
is one in a million.

295
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,100
They are almost as good as him.

296
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,580
I can say they are all fantastic guys.

297
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,100
But I really don't need it.

298
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,740
Don't be too nervous.

299
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,740
You'll go there and make friends.

300
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,100
It'll be good if you can find someone you like.

301
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,820
If not, it's okay.

302
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,100
We won't force you.

303
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,060
Right?

304
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,340
Besides,

305
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,580
this is Demon Duke's idea.

306
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,220
You'd better not refuse it.

307
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,820
This is Demon Duke's idea?

308
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,700
So,

309
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,580
please go there for his sake.

310
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,460
Go try it on.

311
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,700
See if it fits.

312
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,340
Okay.

313
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,220
She's so pretty.

314
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
Yes.

315
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,060
Not bad.

316
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,060
Demon Duke,

317
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,300
why are we

318
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,700
having this party?

319
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,730
You've invited a beautiful girl to come

320
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,420
and only single men can attend the party.

321
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,500
Are you being a matchmaker for us?

322
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,940
Yeah.

323
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,740
How many husbands does she want, Demon Duke?

324
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm not the one to answer this.

325
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,820
It's up to her.

326
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,970
Let's see how attractive you are.

327
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,620
We all want her.

328
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,220
We can't wait.

329
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,180
You mortal woman,

330
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,980
show us your charm.

331
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,460
Come on and please us.

332
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,820
Exactly.

333
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,180
You mortal woman.

334
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,500
Dance for us.

335
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,460
Dance. Dance. Dance.

336
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,500
Enough.

337
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,740
She's our guest.

338
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
Behave yourselves.

339
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,090
If you don't want to dance,

340
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,340
it's okay.

341
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,700
If she's not willing to dance,

342
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,420
let her drink with us.

343
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,180
OK?

344
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,340
Yes.

345
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,970
We demons

346
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,700
always drink together

347
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,330
at parties.

348
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,100
Right?

349
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,860
Yes.

350
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,340
Yes.

351
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,820
She is a mortal girl.

352
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,860
She's different

353
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,340
from the girls in Demon Realm.

354
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,580
Don't make her scared.

355
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,300
I'll start first.

356
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,500
Let me propose a toast to you.

357
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Great!

358
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,460
Amazing.

359
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,100
One more.

360
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,980
One more.

361
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,820
One more.

362
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,700
One more.

363
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,980
Okay.

364
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
I'll drink the first three cups of wine.

365
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
You

366
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,100
should drink less.

367
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,580
Don't act like a wine-bibber.

368
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,700
I'll drink

369
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,340
the rest of the wine for her.

370
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,820
Good.

371
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
Demon Duke cares about her wife,

372
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,340
so he won't allow her to drink much.

373
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
They are really

374
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,820
a loving couple.

375
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,220
That's right.

376
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,620
I'm so jealous.

377
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,300
Demon Duke! Demon Duke! Demon Duke!

378
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,580
Yan Yue!

379
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,220
Demon Duke!

380
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Demon Duke, what's wrong?

381
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,100
Are you okay, Demon Duke?

382
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,620
What's wrong?

383
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,580
What's wrong?

384
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,980
What's wrong, Demon Duke?

385
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,820
Careful.

386
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,980
Let him have a seat.

387
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,180
Demon Duke.

388
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,700
Be careful.

389
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
What happened?

390
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,820
Demon Queen is almost identical to me.

391
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,210
This is definitely not a coincidence.

392
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,730
Maybe it's because Yan Yue

393
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,820
still cares about me.

394
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,500
But he can't remember me now.

395
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,100
My appearance has also changed.

396
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,460
He and Demon Queen love each other so much.

397
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,700
I can't deny it.

398
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,580
Whether their love

399
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,340
is fake or not doesn't matter.

400
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,940
I am the unwanted one now.

401
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,420
Who are you?

402
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,700
Why are you in my home?

403
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,100
Your home?

404
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,060
You're the child of Demon Duke and Demon Queen?

405
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,860
Yes.

406
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,380
My name is Yan Xiaomo.

407
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,500
They even have a child.

408
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,859
This is their son.

409
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,540
Are you

410
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,220
the mortal

411
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,380
my mother brought home?

412
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,300
Boring.

413
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,380
I'd better continue to practice my magic.

414
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,260
Don't look at me.

415
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,460
You made me forget how to do it.

416
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,740
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

417
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,780
Everyone's aptitude is different.

418
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,940
If you care too much

419
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,740
how others will think of you,

420
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,500
you'll be distracted.

421
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,740
Then you won't make any progress.

422
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,140
If you can be really concentrated,

423
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,700
you'll make rapid progress.

424
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,180
I did it!

425
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,860
I can practice Teleportation now!

426
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,220
Are you okay?

427
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,220
I'm fine.

428
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Miss.

429
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,620
Aren't you a mortal?

430
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,740
Why can you practice magic?

431
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,020
It's so strange.

432
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,740
After I came to Demon Realm,

433
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,500
my spiritual power

434
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,130
is gradually coming back.

435
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,940
There are many mortals

436
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,060
learning to practice magic.

437
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,780
You'll get a chance

438
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,500
to see them yourself.

439
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,260
The beings in the Three Realms

440
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,980
may be of different races,

441
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
different beliefs,

442
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,980
different levels of power,

443
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,220
and different thinking patterns.

444
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,540
But in the end,

445
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,980
they are all connected.

446
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,260
Although I don't understand

447
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,460
what you're talking about,

448
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,220
it sounds

449
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,060
very cool.

450
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,140
Miss.

451
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,300
Every time my father teaches me,

452
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,740
he'll be very grim.

453
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,980
So I can't concentrate when he's with me.

454
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,500
You're different from him.

455
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,020
When you were teaching me,

456
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,220
you wore a smile.

457
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,180
I could easily remember what you said.

458
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,260
Can you

459
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,500
teach me more in the future?

460
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,780
Sure.

461
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,660
Great!

462
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,900
Then I won't be afraid

463
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,180
my father will shout at me.

464
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,980
I can practice magic now.

465
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,980
I'll be able to fly soon.

466
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,060
I can practice Teleportation now.

467
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,380
Don't think too much.

468
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,420
Don't think about unhappy things.

469
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,220
You hadn't shown the symptom for a long time.

470
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,700
But now you had it again.

471
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm really worried.

472
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,860
It's nothing to be worried about.

473
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,170
You are my remedy.

474
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,620
With you by my side,

475
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,980
I'll always be fine.

476
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,700
Is this a warning sign?

477
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,620
Perhaps,

478
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,500
it means

479
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,380
you shouldn't think too much.

480
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,620
You'll lose sleep if you still worry too much.

481
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,900
If you lose sleep,

482
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,620
you will become ugly.

483
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,180
Stop kidding.

484
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,530
Besides,

485
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,460
you'll always love me no matter how I look.

486
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,090
♫The sunset is just right♫

487
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,960
♫It's like a dream♫

488

♫Where do we go from here?♫

496
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,500
being unable to be with my love

497
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,380
is so painful.

498
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,190
♫Spread out your palm♫

499
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,340

♫Who plays on his heart in tears?♫

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,280

♫Even if it's a dream♫

524
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,860
I just passed by the garden

525
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,300
and saw Xiaomo practicing magic.

526
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,380
Guess what?

527
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,970
He's made rapid progress.

528
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,700
It takes him so much time to make progress.

529
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,380
It's nothing to be happy about.

530
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,140
With a strict teacher like you,

531
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,460
of course he can't improve quickly.

532
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,540
You've never seen

533
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,180
a real strict teacher.

534
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,740
In this world,

535
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,700
there're more strict teachers than you.

536
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,620
My father.

537
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,220
You never mentioned

538
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,130
your father to me.

539
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,060
My impression of him

540
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,780
is also quite unclear.

541
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,020
Why can Xiaomo make rapid progress all of a sudden?

542
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,260
Wei Zhi is teaching him.

543
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,020
It seems

544
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,700
Xiaomo likes her a lot.

545
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
So I

546
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
have a suggestion to tell you.

547
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,740
You and Demon Duke

548
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,700
want me to be Xiaomo's teacher?

549
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,660
I didn't know

550
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,740
you can practice magic.

551
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,700
I learned it in Human Realm.

552
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,660
Not worth mentioning.

553
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
I saw you

554
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,660
with Xiaomo that day.

555
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,700
He is such a naughty boy.

556
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,380
But you could get him

557
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
to listen to you with just a few words.

558
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,740
You are really good

559
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,020
at getting along with children.

560
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,260
Maybe

561
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,940
it's because

562
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,220
I have a younger brother.

563
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,220
I see.

564
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,660
I think

565
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,780
Demon Duke

566
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,980
can teach Xiaomo all kinds of magic

567
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,620
and you assist Demon Duke

568
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,900
and help Xiaomo during the practice session.

569
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,220
Then you can still stay here

570
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,140
and continue to look for your husband.

571
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,460
What do you think?

572
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,140
Although I am staying here,

573
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,220
I can't see Yan Yue

574
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,420
very often.

575
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,700
It's impossible for me

576
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,980
to help him regain his memories now.

577
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,460
If I become Xiaomo's teacher,

578
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,460
I might have more chances.

579
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,780
But...

580
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,060
Demon Queen.

581
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,780
I've never been a teacher before.

582
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,540
I'm afraid I can't teach him well.

583
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,460
You'd better

584
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,700
ask someone else to do it.

585
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,780
Wei Zhi, come on.

586
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,900
Demon Duke is too strict.

587
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,700
Xiaomo gets nervous when he sees him.

588
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,660
Once he gets nervous,

589
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,180
he can't learn anything.

590
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,260
You know what,

591
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,460
they haven't been as close as before

592
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,260
since Demon Duke

593
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,420
began to teach him.

594
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,980
I am very worried.

595
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,780
But I...

596
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,370
Wei Zhi, help me.

597
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,460
Please.

598
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,620
Okay.

599
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,380
I'll tell Xiaomo right now.

600
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,540
He'll definitely be very happy.

601
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
Wei Zhi.

602
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,620
If I forget you,

603
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,380
that is not my intention.

604
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,420
You must...

605
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,460
Yan Yue,

606
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,700
what exactly

607
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,260
were the words you didn't finish?

608
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,980
Do you want me to find you and wake you up

609
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,740
or just let it go

610
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,700
and get over you?

611
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,260
Tao.

612
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Yi'er, what brings you here?

613
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,420
Since Cousin Yan Luo left,

614
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,860
let me help you.

615
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,020
How to use it?

616
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,980
Can you teach me?

617
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,140
You just need to loosen the soil

618
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,900
and it'll be all.

619
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,050
♫The sunset is just right♫

620
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,800
♫It's like a dream♫

621
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,960
♫If you take the beauty♫

622
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,870
♫In your eyes♫

623
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,030
♫Don't make the love too strong♫

624
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,180
♫How much it entangles♫

625
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,250
♫The thoughts♫

626
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,890
♫The hourglass along your fingers♫

627
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,810
♫Where do we go from here?♫

628
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,250
♫Spread out your palm♫

629
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,330
♫If all your obsessions are empty♫

630
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,970
♫Remembering the past♫

631
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,550
♫All that you've given me♫

632
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,160
♫A little more touching♫

633
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,900
♫A little less frightened♫

634
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,920
♫How many times I've been in love♫

635
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,870
♫The more fate plays tricks on me♫

636
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,620
♫The more I sing the praises of love's nirvana♫

637
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,080
♫A wisp of dust and sorrow♫

638
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,140
♫Blow away like the wind♫

639
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,230
♫Who plays on his heart in tears?♫

640
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,270
♫I can't help but reach out♫

641
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,070
♫To the thoughts♫

642
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,110
♫Don't ask, don't tell♫

643
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,260
♫Just hold each other♫

644
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,730
♫Fold a feather of tenderness♫

645
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,840
♫Time flies by♫

646
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,780
♫I'd rather not keep anything to myself♫

647
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,660
Yi'er, take a break.

648
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Have some tea.

649
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,980
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

650
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,020
♫Learn to be foolish and brave♫

651
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,340
♫It's hard to turn back♫

652
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,210
♫You don't have to understand if you don't want to hear♫

653
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,810
♫Even if it's a dream♫

654
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,460
Your Majesty.

655
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,700
Have a seat.

656
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,860
How many times have I told you?

657
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,180
Call me Yan Luo.

658
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,180
Yan Luo.

659
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,540
I just came back from my trip.

660
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,700
Why are you so sad and drinking your wine?

661
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,460
Being the Heavenly Emperor is really

662
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,220
the most miserable job in the world.

663
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,500
I don't know when I can get rid of it.

664
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,220
What's your matter?

665
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,140
Looking at you

666
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,740
and thinking about how Yan Yue looked,

667
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,300
I feel a little emotional.

668
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,420
Did you see Yan Yue?

669
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,260
Where is he? Is he okay?

670
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,460
Why didn't you bring him back?

671
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,380
He is in Demon Realm.

672
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
He...

673
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,180
All these years, the world has been peaceful.

674
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,020
So, I never gave up

675
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,180
looking for Yan Yue.

676
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,660
Of all places of the Three Realms,

677
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,700
I only didn't go to Demon Realm.

678
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,420
So a few days ago,

679
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,700
I went there.

680
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,900
Demon Duke.

681
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,500
That was a great battle.

682
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,660
Yes.

683
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,620
You guys also contributed.

684
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,100
Come on. Cheers.

685
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,610
Cheers.

686
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,860
Cheers! Cheers!

687
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,700
Yan Yue!

688
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,500
Today,

689
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,220
let's get drunk together.

690
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,460
Demon Duke! Demon Duke! Demon Duke!

691
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,540
He's become a demon.

692
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,980
And then

693
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,940
I had been following him for several days.

694
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,260
He is no longer

695
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,700
the Yan Yue he used to be.

696
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,300
He is so happy and carefree.

697
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,780
I meant to show up

698
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,860
and wake him up several times.

699
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,780
But his smile

700
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,900
stopped me.

701
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,900
That is a smile

702
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,220
that Yan Yue never had

703
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,540
in Heaven Realm.

704
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,700
Yan Luo,

705
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,540
do you think I shouldn't do that?

706
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,700
Are we going to just let him

707
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,740
stay in Demon Realm?

708
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,700
When he was in Heavenly Realm,

709
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,380
he suppressed his feelings

710
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,980
and took heavy responsibilities.

711
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,660
That was not good for him.

712
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,250
If he continued to stay in Heaven Realm,

713
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,140
he wouldn't have that smile.

714
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,130
Hearing this from you

715
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,740
makes me feel relieved.

716
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Then Yan Luo,

717
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,140
you'll have to

718
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,220
be the Heavenly Emperor forever.

719
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,530
Yan Yue has done so much

720
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,900
for Heaven Realm.

721
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,660
If he can be happy now,

722
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,740
I'm willing to help him

723
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,980
shoulder the responsibility.

724
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,420
Remember,

725
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,460
you haven't seen Yan Yue.

726
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,620
I don't know where Yan Yue is either.

727
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,140
After the war,

728
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,460
the Phoenix is dead.

729
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,900
Yan Yue is still missing.

730
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,060
Yi'er.

731
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,620
Take a break.

732
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,060
If you don't take a break,

733
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,380
you'll be exhausted.

734
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,700
Since you came to Yingzhou,

735
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,940
you have been reluctant

736
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,890
to talk to anyone.

737
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,940
What you said is only

738
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,460
"Tao, more water there" or

739
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,380
"Tao, turn over the soil."

740
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,740
You used to be a talkative person.

741
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,260
Are you sure you're not unhappy?

742
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,860
I'm not unhappy.

743
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,180
It's just that

744
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,940
nothing

745
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,660
excites me.

746
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,060
I've lived for so many years.

747
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,020
Now,

748
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,260
it seems that I've begun

749
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,980
to be more like an immortal

750
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,020
with no feelings of love

751
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,980
like Heavenly Empress Dowager described.

752
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,500
Being unable

753
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,540
to feel sad or happy

754
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
is okay for me.

755
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
Yi'er.

756
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm really fine.

757
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,220
Tao.

758
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,460
Look.

759
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,300
That Tree of Lovesickness begins to bear fruits.

760
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,690
So beautiful.

761
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,620
Its fruits are beautiful,

762
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,940
but not edible.

763
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,780
You've grown so many of them.

764
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,860
Don't you think

765
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,980
it's a waste of land?

766
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,500
Tao.

767
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,060
I hope everyone

768
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,420
can be as carefree

769
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,420
as you.

It's class time.

774
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,220
Why aren't you practicing magic with Xiaomo?

775
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,500
What are you writing here?

776
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,460
Demon Duke.

777
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,380
Xiaomo has already practiced

778
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,420
for six hours.

779
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,740
I asked him to have a rest.

780
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,220

Art of talismans.

783
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,620
They are kinds of magic

784
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,260
practiced by immortals.

785
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,139
Xiaomo has improved a lot recently.

786
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,060
I want to prepare some new lessons for him.

787
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,860
How do you know the magic of immortals?

788
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,460
How did you recognize it?

789
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,420
It's obvious.

790
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,060
Xiaomo's been practicing the magic of Demon Realm.

791
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,100
If you teach him magic of Heaven Realm,

792
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,380
I'm afraid the two kinds will conflict with each other.

793
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,139
Then your efforts will be in vain

794
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,020
and Xiaomo can't improve at all.

795
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,179
All kinds of magic share something in common.

796
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,980
Whether it's immortals' magic or demons',

797
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,940
it comes from the heaven and earth after all.

798
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,889
All kinds of magic are the same.

799
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,820
How can immortals and demons

800
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,580
be the same?

801
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,860
Your spiritual power is very strong.

802
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Do you want to give it a try?

803
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,620
The magic of Heaven Realm

804
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,860
can so easily mastered

805
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,300
by a demon.

806
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,780
Ridiculous.

807
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,660
The skills of Deity Arts

808
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,980
seem easy to learn.

809
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,260
But if one is to master it,

810
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,740
he or she has to work hard and practice it often.

811
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,980
You can practice it easily.

812
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,660
It is very likely that you studied it before.

813
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,860
How is that possible?

814
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,020
I don't remember I ever learned it.

815
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,890
I heard that

816
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,620
mental methods had been taught

817
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,140
in the Egret Academy in Human Realm.

818
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,380
Then I'm more sure that I didn't learn it.

819
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,100
I've never been to

820
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,180
the Egret Academy in Human Realm.

821
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,260
Then how did you

822
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,460
pick it up?

823
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,140
Why can't I

824
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,460
remember anything about it?

825
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,460
Demon Duke, are you all right?

826
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,460
Demon Duke, stop thinking about it.

827
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,140
That is not important.

828
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,740
No.

829
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,540
I must remember it.

Demon Duke.

833
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,820
Demon Duke, how are you?

834
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,660
You're here.

835
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,420
You should take a rest.

836
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,780
Let's go.

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,580

839
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,460
Is Demon Duke okay?

840
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,980
I finally calmed him down.

841

Wei Zhi.

842
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:07,970
What happened

843
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,060
today?

844
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,660
We talked about the magic of Heaven Realm.

845
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,380
He wanted to recall

846
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,140
how he had learned magic.

847
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,050
Then...

848
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,940
After Demon Lord died,

849
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,740
one of his four major subordinates

850
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,540
got missing.

851
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,380
The other three were always fighting

852
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,300
for territories.

853
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,460
No one yielded.

854
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,900
Demon Realm broke up.

855
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,940
There were killings all over the Realm.

856
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,100
To survive in Demon Realm,

857
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,740
one must become strong enough.

858
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,460
That's how Demon Duke

859
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,140
conquered this territory.

860
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,980
He has countless old injuries.

861
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,620
Only the wound on his chest always relapses.

862
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,020
How did he get that wound?

863
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,860
I asked him, but he didn't know either.

864
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,260
I really

865
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,660
miss the old days.

866
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,020
Although that was a difficult time,

867
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,180
we loved each other

868
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,540
and faced danger together.

869
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,170
You and Demon Duke love each other so much.

870
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,580
I'm jealous.

871
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
But now everything has changed.
