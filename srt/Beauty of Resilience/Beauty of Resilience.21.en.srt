[Episode 21]

4
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,100
I was too naïve.

5
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,060
I thought it was simple.

6
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,660
Since I came to Gu City,

7
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,100
I've been making mistakes

8
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,420
and disgracing you.

9
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,860
But do you know

10
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,140
why you made so many mistakes?

11
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,060
Maybe

12
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
women shouldn't come into the army.

13
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,579
Do you

14
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,490
mean it?

15
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
It's normal to make mistakes.

16
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,660
People make mistakes.

17
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,060
This

18
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,120
has nothing to do with gender.

19
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,820
A person's success

20
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,420
can't be easily achieved.

21
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,130
We learn

22
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,260
and grow up

23
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,700
through series of mistakes.

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,820
I've made countless mistakes

25
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,860
in my army life.

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,980
But

27
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,260
there is one thing

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,380
I can't be wrong about.

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,540
That is

30
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm not wrong about my daughter.

31
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,230
Remember,

32
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,820
whether it's in the Gu City

33
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,780
or back to the capital,

34
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,540
as long as I'm here,

35
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,860
you don't have to be afraid of anything.

37
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,340
Is there anything wrong?

38
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,020
Black Wind Castle attacked our army on the west road.

39
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,140
It's understandable

40
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,700
that they're off guard.

41
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,340
But on our way here,

42
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,780
we haven't even seen a solider

43
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,700
on the high ground.

44
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,690
Something is wrong.

45
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,659
General Cao,

46
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,900
you worry too much.

47
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,020
Now the arrow is on the string,

48
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,780
we can't

49
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,100

it shouldn't be him.

But in the battle at Xifeng Stronghold,

110
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,340
he proposed

Cao

120
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,860
is indeed short-tempered

121
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,450
and has a sharp tongue.

122
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,820
But for so many years,

123
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
he has been loyal

124
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,740

125
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,220

127
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,700
I've been hiding it

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,100
in my heart

129
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,980

00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
That day,

132

I drank with him.

00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,460
When I was drunk,

134
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,300
I accidentally revealed

135
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,620
the fact that Commander was a woman.

136
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,700
Rumor spread in the army then

137
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,420
and even made the old soldiers resent her.

138
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm afraid

139
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,220
that Cao thought

140
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,980
the Princess

141
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,340
was stealing his achievements and fame

142
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,820

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,820
it's the crime of treason.

Without solid evidence,

146
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,340
we can't draw a conclusion.

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,460
or the heartache

200
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,620
you caused me by locking me up?

201
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,380
I mean

202
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,460
the leg injury for you protecting

203
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,700
on the battlefield.

204
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,260
Leg injury?

205
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,420
It's serious.

206
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm afraid I may be disabled

207
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,540
for the rest of my life.

208
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,220
What should we do?

209
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,860
You saved me so many times.

210
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,620
I don't know

211
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,660
how to repay you.

212
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,940
Yes.

213
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,860
It's really hard to repay.

214
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,220
How about

215
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,660
marrying me?

216
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,860
I was just kidding.

217
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,460
Forget it if you don't want to.

218
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,500
Who said I didn't want to?

219
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,780
Take a walk with me.

220
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,460
I...

221
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,980
Let's go.

222
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,290
No.

223
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,140
I can walk by myself.

224
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,380
Then go by yourself.

225
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,780
So many people are watching.

226
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
I'll lose face.

227
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,660
Slow down.

228
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,730
How do you feel?

229
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,660
Are you okay?

230
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,700
I'm fine.

231
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
Let me see.

232
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,540
No.

233
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,420
It's inappropriate.

234
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,780
Why not?

235
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,260
This wound is disgusting.

236
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
I'm not afraid.

237
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,900
We live

238
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,460
in this world full of pain.

239
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,060
You should see ugly things

240
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,700
as little as you can.

241
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,700
That's not like you.

242
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,300
Really?

243
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,860
Maybe it's because

244
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,260
I'm crippled.

245
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,860
To be honest,

246
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,540
I always feel

247
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,300
there must be a lot of things

248
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,020
behind your glib tongue.

249
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,220
Don't worry. I won't ask you.

250
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,900
Everyone has

251
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,220
something they don't want others to know

252
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,940
or to mention.

253
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,180
Some are beautiful.

254
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,890
Some are painful.

255
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,740
Just like the bud

256
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,500
is wrapped inside a flower.

257
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,460
That doesn't feel like

258
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,700
what you say normally either.

259
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,220
Traitor Chen Yan,

260
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
I knew

261
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,220
you had an evil intention.

262
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,500
You've wasted our sincerity.

263
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,530
You deserve to die.

264
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,300
What are you thinking?

265
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,420
I...

266
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,740
I was thinking

267
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,610
why there was a war.

268
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,780
To protect our country, of course.

269
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,460
Really?

270
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,660
Every warrior in Gu City

271
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,620
that passed away

272
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,540
sacrificed their lives

273
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,980
to protect the people of Weicang.

274
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,980
Yes.

275
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,460
Who doesn't have a country

276
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,220
and who

277
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,060
doesn't have a home?

278
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,700
If the enemy hadn't known

279
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,860
our plan,

280
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,490
the battle wouldn't be

281
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,420
such a mess.

282
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,500
I must find out

283
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,660
the informant,

284
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,300
put his head in public

285
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,020
and then strike back.

286
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,540
I'll avenge the soldiers

287
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,540
with victory.

288
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Yes.

289
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,740
The day you want

290
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,620
will come.

291
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,780
General Cao.

292
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,500
I have something to discuss with Marshal.

293
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,620
Please report.

294
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,660
Marshal is asleep.

295
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,460
So early?

296
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,300
If you have something urgent,

297
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,460
I can send the message for you.

298
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,020
There's nothing urgent.

299
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,300
I'll come back tomorrow.

300
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,700
Tell Marshal.

301
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,780
Yes.

302
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,920
[Wei]

303
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,220
Marshal,

304
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,380
you summoned me back

305
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,700
to Gu City from the frontline.

306
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,610
What's the matter?

307
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
The other day,

308
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,460
you had a conflict with someone

309
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,020
for Wangyue.

310
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,260
Do you know

311
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,980
whose men those people are?

312
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,660
They are

313
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,900
old soldiers stationed in Gu City

314
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,460
and mostly are General Cao's men.

315
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,540
Marshal.

316
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,460
A letter from the palace.

317
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,980
His Majesty pardoned Wangyue's accusation

318
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,980
of disguising as a man in the army.

319
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,260
Great.

320
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,840
Pass my order.

321
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,460
The banquet will be held in three days.

322
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,180
People above the decurion must attend the banquet.

323
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,860
Also,

324
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,700
all the soldiers in the army

325
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,420
will be rewarded half a catty of meat and a pot of wine.

326
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,460
Yes.

327
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,980
Mu Nan.

328
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,900
I want to write an invitation

329
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,940
to General Cao.

330
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,500
Send it here

331
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,220
as a token of appreciation.

332
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,620
Yes.

333
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Song is here.

334
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,260
Where is the liquor I ordered?

335
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,900
Where is the toilet?

336
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,260
Over there.

337
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,220
You two.

338
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,180
Move the liquor in.

339
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,610
Hurry up.

340
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Old man.

341
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,380
General.

342
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,860
Where is the good liquor I asked you to find?

343
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,220
It's not here.

344
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,060
It's been ten years

345
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,980
and carried from

346
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,940
the best liquor cellar.

347
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,850
Here.

348
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,180
Old man.

349
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,220
If it's not good,

350
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,220
I'll cut off your tongue.

351
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,460
Don't worry.

352
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,620
It's good liquor.

353
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,990
[Liquor]

354
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,220
Brothers,

355
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,300
the battle at Black Wind Castle

356
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,220
was tough.

357
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,690
[Liquor]

358
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,220
As the marshal,

359
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,860
I made a serious

360
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,890
strategic mistake.

361
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,370
I'm sorry for my deceased brothers.

362
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,660
Today,

363
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,540
I'm holding a banquet for the whole army

364
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,220
to first

365
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,900
apologize to the dead brothers

366
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,500
and also thank the soldiers.

367
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,540
Here.

368
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,260
Cheers to all of you.

369
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,180
Cheers.

370
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,260
Cheers.

371
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,980
I

372
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,660
want to ask you a question.

373
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,860
Why did you

374
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,540
join the Gu City Army?

375
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,540
General Qi.

376
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,020
Why?

377
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,980
Tell me.

378
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,740
Fine.

379
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,700
I'm the Number One Scholar of Weicang.

380
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,300
I follow you

381
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,500
to make contributions

382
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,650
and serve the court.

383
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,970
It's my duty to join the army.

384
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,180
Marshal,

385
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,420
a toast to you.

386
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,220
OK.

387
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,380
Wang Wu.

388
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,860
Tell me.

389
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,380
Marshal,

390
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,380
my father and brother were killed by the bandits of Jing.

391
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,860
I just wanted to avenge them.

392
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,220
Marshal,

393
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,540
let me propose a toast to you.

394
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,220
I have no ambition.

395
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,460
I just want to make a living

396
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
to support my family.

397
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,940
You're a

398
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,460
responsible man.

399
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,700
That's good.

400
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Marshal,

401
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
a toast to you.

402
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Liu.

403
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Tell me.

404
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,460
I...

405
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,980
I joined the army

406
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,500
because they said

407
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,020
the Gu City Army

408
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,860
treated soldiers with meat occasionally.

409
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,020
What's the result?

410
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,980
It turned out

411
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,500
to be better than what they said.

412
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,700
We have meat every day.

413
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,860
Well said.

414
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,220
Maybe you don't know.

415
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,700
In Weicang Army,

416
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,740
only the Gu City Army

417
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,660
is highly valued by His Majesty.

418
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,180
No matter what your purpose was

419
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,420
when you applied to join the army,

420
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,420
don't forget

421
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,180
our original intention.

422
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,420
I hope

423
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,300
from now on,

424
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,980
no matter what ancestral home it is,

425
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,220
no matter the rank,

426
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,980
whether it's a man or a woman,

427
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,260
we must live in harmony,

428
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,620
treat each other sincerely,

429
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,060
never fight with

430
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,420
or intrigue against each other.

431
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,420
Can you do it?

432
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,740
Yes!

433
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,940
Come.

434
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,020
For the Gu City Army.

435
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,730
[Wei]

436
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,060
Move forward

437
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,460
and kill countless enemies.

438
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:49,970
Cheers!

439
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,460
Cheers!

440
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,660
Today,

441
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,460
His Majesty not only

442
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,180
exempted Wangyue,

443
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,860
but also rewarded her.

444
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,220
So I want

445
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
to

446
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,900
give a toast to Wangyue,

447
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,300
not only because

448
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,180
you're my daughter,

449
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,220
but you're also a brave warrior

450
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,300
in Weicang Army.

451
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,500
Commander! Commander!

452
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,460
Your words

453
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,500
made me

454
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,140
feel ashamed.

455
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,460
As your general

456
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
for years,

457
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,020
I have to

458
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,060
tell you something.

459
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,940
Today

460
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,060
I must apologize to you.

461
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,060
General Cao.

462
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,420
Get up.

463
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,300
We've been brothers for years.

464
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,460
If you have anything to say,

465
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,980
just

466
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,020
tell me today.

467
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,740
OK?

468
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,180
To be honest,

469
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,260
I was the one

470
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,940
who leaked the news of the Commander's identity as a female.

471
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,740
When Qi told me

472
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,460
you were a woman,

473
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,220
I couldn't be convinced.

474
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,780
I thought it was biased.

475
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,460
So...

476
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,460
So I deliberately spread the news

477
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,260
to embarrass Commander and Marshal.

478
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,490
But I didn't expect

479
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,500
the Commander risked her life

480
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,780
in Black Wind Castle,

481
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,460
and even

482
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,260
saved me

483
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
and the soldiers.

484
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,980
I...

485
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,700
Today,

486
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,220
I want to apologize

487
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,540
to Commander and Marshal.

488
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,020
General Cao.

489
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,180
It's all in the past.

490
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,620
Cao.

491
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,180
It's good that you said it.

492
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,380
Do you have anything else to say?

493
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
No.

494
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,900
Are you done?

495
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,220
Anything else?

496
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,620
I'm done.

497
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,500
Right.

498
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,740
Also,

499
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,740
I have a jar of good liquor

500
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
for you.

501
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,620
This is the ten-year-old liquor in the spring.

502
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,420
Marshal.

503
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,490
Cheers.

504
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,020
Cao,

505
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,780
aren't you

506
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,900
toasting to the wrong person?

507
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,260
Please forgive me.

508
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,940
General Cao.

509
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,980
You don't have to do this.

510
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
General Cao.

511
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,220
The commander is not a good drinker.

512
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,660
I'll drink on her behalf.

513
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,220
You...

514
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,060
Mu Nan has been Wangyue's partner

515
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,780
since childhood.

516
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,380
He dotes on her more than I do.

517
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,500
Staff Mu drank it for Commander.

518
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,540
It's the same.

519
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,980
It's the same.

520
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,940
Thank you, General Cao.

521
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,380
This...

522
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,860
Mu Nan.

523
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,540
Mu Nan.

524
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,460
What's wrong with you?

525
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,060
Mu Nan.

526
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,700
The liquor...

527
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,500
Is poisonous.

528
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,900
Cao.

529
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,700
How dare you!

530
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,980
Guards, arrest him!

531
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,040
It has nothing to do with me, Marshal.

532
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,750
Take him away.

533
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,660
Trust me.

534
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,940
Hurry! Call the military doctor!

535
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,140
Marshal! Marshal!

536
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,300
Marshal, it has nothing to do with me.

537
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,660
Doctor, how is it?

538
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,690
General,

539
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,900
the poison in Staff Mu

540
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,500
is a rare poison

541
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,540
known by the Jinghe sorcerers.

542
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,380
If there is no antidote,

543
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,980
he will die.

544
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,740
Besides,

545
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,180
only the poison-maker

546
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,260
can detoxify it.

547
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,300
So there is a saying,

548
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,380
one poison can cure one person.

549
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,780
Stop talking nonsense.

550
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,980
Can we save him?

551
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,220
Sir,

552
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,220
I've done what I should do.

553
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:01,780
But...

554
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,500
If there is no antidote,

555
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,020
there's nothing I can do.

556
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,060
What do you mean?

557
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,660
He's right here. You...

558
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,700
I know. You may leave.

559
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,700
I'm leaving.

560
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,740
I'm going to kill

561
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
that ungrateful bastard.

562
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,020
Wangyue, calm down.

563
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
How can I calm down now?

564
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,380
You need to calm down

565
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,220
at this moment.

566
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,700
Ruthlessness

567
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,140
is the first lesson

568
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,940
war has taught you.

569
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,730
It's not the weapon to kill your enemy,

570
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
but

571
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,140
the weapon of facing

572
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,700
losing your loved one.

573
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,290
If

574
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,700
you can't even do that,

575
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,460
you don't know

576
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,460
what war is.

577
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
I don't want to hear

578
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
these principles.

579
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,260
But now,

580
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,420
learn to understand.

581
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,740
Don't you have anything to say?

582
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,380
I didn't poison it.

583
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,260
It wasn't me.

584
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,420
Up to now,

585
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,060
I don't think

586
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,020
you could do such a thing.

587
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,860
Then why did you arrest me?

588
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,780
Why would I poison Commander?

589
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,020
Why?

590
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,980
I don't have to.

591
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,180
The liquor

592
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,060
was supposed to be for me.

593
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,620
Marshal,

594
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,980
why would I poison you

595
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
in front of so many people

596
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,620
at the banquet?

597
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,410
Who did you reveal the plan of

598
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,940
Black Wind Castle to

599
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,140
except us?

600
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,420
No. Who could I reveal it to?

601
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,100
You suspect I colluded with the enemy?

602
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,739
Is it Qi?

603
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,460
Qi said it was me, right?

604
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,380
Why didn't you suspect him?

605
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,659
He was there too

606
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,060
when discussing the tactics.

607
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,659
Or do you blame it all

608
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,820
on me

609
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,500
still because of your daughter?

610
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,260
Cao.

611
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,739
Don't talk nonsense.

612
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
If you weren't

613
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,060
my peer,

614
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,020
I'd…

615
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,980
What did you do to me?

616
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,179
Punish him.

617
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,380
Kill me.

618
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,340
I'm not afraid of this.

619
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,260
Come on.

620
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,380
Let them come.

621
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,580
If you have any dirty tricks,

622
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,020
do it.

623
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,860
Punish him.

624
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,460
Yes.

625
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,390
[Wei]

626
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,740
Wangyue.

627
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,860
Is it cold

628
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
outside today?

629
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,860
Why do I

630
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,140
feel

631
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
so cold?

632
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,900
It's freezing.

633
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,020
Have a rest.

634
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,460
I'll get you a quilt.

635
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,100
Wangyue.

636
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,540
Don't go.

637
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,780
Don't leave me alone.

638
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,940
Fine, I won't leave.

639
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,580
I won't leave.

640
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,780
Wangyue.

641
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,340
Don't be sad.

642
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,740
Actually, I think

643
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,140
it's worth it

644
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,980
to have the poisoned liquor

645
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
for you.

646
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,300
Don't talk nonsense.

647
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,540
You won't die.

648
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,260
Do you know

649
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,020
what the happiest thing is

650
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,980
in life?

651
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,020
The happiest thing

652
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,300
in life

653
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,380
is not to have money,

654
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,460
or fame and fortune,

655
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,390
but to die

656
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,460
with the most beloved person

657
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,500
by his side.

658
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,260
Stop it, Mu Nan.

659
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,860
I'm afraid

660
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,970
if I don't say it now,

661
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,540
I won't have a chance anymore.

662
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,300
Take a good rest.

663
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,860
Give it to me.

664
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,780
What?

665
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,580
The antidote!

666
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,460
Give me the antidote.

667
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,620
For the sake

668
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,500
of your brotherhood with my father,

669
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
I won't give you a hard time.

670
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,740
Otherwise…

671
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,620
When I went to the battlefield,

672
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,460
you were still

673
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,780
unborn.

674
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,660
My father has a bitter hatred

675
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,980
because of your betrayal.

676
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,860
So many brothers on the battlefield

677
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,980
died in vain.

678
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,100
And Mu Nan.

679
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,500
He just wanted to drink for me.

680
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,460
But he was poisoned by you.

681
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,620
Are you taking it out or not?

682
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,340
Nonsense!

683
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,390
Traitor!

684
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,860
Today, I will avenge

685
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,420
for those brothers.

686
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,980
There's always a reason to punish me.

687
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,180
Hit me!

688
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,860
Come on!

689
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,980
You'd better kill me.

690
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,510
I've been working hard

691
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,380
for so many years.

692
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,180
I'm not afraid of the pain.

693
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,060
Come on.

694
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,180
If anything happens to Mu Nan,

695
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,860
I will skin you

696
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,050
and behead you in public.
