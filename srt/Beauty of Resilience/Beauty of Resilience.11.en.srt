4
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,979
So our Devil Realm

5
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,580
is the safest place.

6
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,370
Just rest assured.

7
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,770
What about the Devil King's ban?

8
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,620
Ban?

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,920
What ban?

10
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,980
The Devil King ordered

11
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,070
all devils

12
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,710
should stay away from the Phoenix matter.

13
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,790
Are you possessed?

14
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,200
I...

15
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,820
I'll tell the Devil King now.

16
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,230
No.

17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,040
Lan Su. Lan Su.

18
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,010
Lan Su.

19
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,150
Are you going to tell the Devil King?

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,190
If something

21
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,940
happens to me,

22
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,900
won't you worry about me?

23
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,579
Fine.

24
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,560
I'll give you another chance.

25
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,250
As long as you send them away now,

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,620
I'll pretend it never happened.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,600
No.

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,660
They're already here.

29
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,600
How can I send them away?

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't I have face?

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,340
Are you trying to

32
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,450
force them to die?

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,260
No, don't.

34
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,829
Are their lives more important

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,030
or yours?

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,620
Anyway,

37
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,250
if you tell the Devil King,

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,410
we will...

39
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,520
break off the engagement, or rather, all relations.

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,530
What did you say?

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,300
I said

42
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
if you tell the Devil King,

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,140
we will...

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,230
break off our engagement and all relations.

45
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,440
I see.

46
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,780
You're good.

47
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,740
I've been engaged to Ou Ya since childhood.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,510
I love him wholeheartedly.

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,950
But you stole away his heart

50
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,200
without doing anything.

51
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,090
You misunderstood.

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,000
You…

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,579
She loves you wholeheartedly.

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,730
How could you do that?

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,270
I...

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,230
Go apologize now

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,070
and cheer her up.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,490
Maybe she'll be fine.

59
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,870
Okay. Okay.

60
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,480
Lan Su!

61
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,750
Lan Su!

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,420
Lan Su!

63
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,880
Master.

64
00:03:59,370 --> 00:03:59,750
Let's go.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,040
What's wrong?

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,950
[Yi Li, Prince of the Fox Clan]

67
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,880
Ou Ya again?

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,550
Brother!

69
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,149
Don't block my way.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,510
I must teach this ungrateful guy

71
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,610
a  lesson today.

72
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,860
He didn't make me cry.

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,740
Don't go.

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,730
Except for him,

75
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,700
who else in the Devil Realm

76
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,660
can bully you like this?

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,340
The Wolf Clan has been arrogant

78
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,600
because of their relationship with the Devil King.

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,220
Normally I can let it go,

80
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,890
but I can't tolerate it if he bullies you.

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,040
He is the prince of the Wolf Clan,

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,870
but you are also

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,780
the princess of our Fox Clan.

84
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,500
You love him so much,

85
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,740
but he doesn't appreciate it.

86
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,030
I'm so mad.

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,210
If I don't smash up

88
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,020
his den today,

89
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,190
I won't let it go.

90
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,980
Just leave us alone.

91
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,610
OK?

92
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,860
Sit down.

93
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,860
I didn't expect

94
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,810
I can't even perform

95
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,360
a lower-level magic.

96
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,290
I'm really a jinx.

97
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,840
When I was little, I dragged my family down

98
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,300
and caused Gucheng to be destroyed.

99
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,990
Now I made you to be seriously injured.

100
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,290
My injury had nothing to do with you.

101
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,190
Finding the Phoenix is my mission.

102
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,330
I should do my best

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,080
to protect you.

104
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,180
Master, you don't have to comfort me.

105
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,310
Now I know it all.

106
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,340
Because I'm a phoenix,

107
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,390
I've always been different from others,

108
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,540
and I even had my family destroyed.

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,230
Maybe in others' eyes,

110
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,140
it's a great honor to be the Phoenix.

111
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,690
But for me,

112
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,420
everyone around me suffered because of that

113
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,780
and I could do nothing about it.

114
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,290
I couldn't even

115
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,110
protect the only thing

116
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,060
left by grandpa.

117
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,280
Wei Zhi.

118
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,440
May I have a look?

119
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,730
Master,

120
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,520
the priority for you now is to recuperate.

121
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,820
When you recover,

122
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,020
you can fix this piece of jade for me.

123
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,760
There's no hurry.

124
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,560
No.

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,100
I can't fix it,

126
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,830
not because I'm injured.

127
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,840
Its spiritual power is enormous.

128
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,500
Have you been wearing it

129
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,680
and never been away from it?

130
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,450
I could see things

131
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,750
that others couldn't since I was little.

132
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,430
Sometimes,

133
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,180
I got into trouble by starting a fire.

134
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,700
After grandpa gave it to me,

135
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
I've always been wearing it.

136
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,990
Although I can still see

137
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,900
strange things,

138
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,340
those

139
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,320
inexplicable flames

140
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,040
were gone.

141
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,990
No wonder.

142
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,670
It can suppress your Phoenix power

143
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,570
and cover up your Phoenix scent.

144
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,100
That's why when I measured your immortal bones,

145
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,409
there was nothing unusual.

146
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,030
That means

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,710
Grandpa knew I was a phoenix long before.

148
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,300
I don't know about that.

149
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,010
He must have known

150
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,360
you were extraordinary.

151
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,460
He gave you this jade bracelet

152
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,490
to protect you.

153
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:01,710
So,

154
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,540
you should live a good life.

155
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,080
Don't wallow in self-pity.

156
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,610
That way you'll waste his effort.

157
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,140
So in the future,

158
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,680
can I become a powerful one

159
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,980
like you?

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:13,980
Sure.

161
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,960
Then

162
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,710
I can protect my mother and my brother.

163
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,200
Don’t worry.

164
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,090
No matter how many disasters and hardships are ahead,

165
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,560
don't be afraid.

166
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,430
Wei Lingyue won the first place

167
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,870
in this Mid-Autumn Exam.

168
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,590
Sister, you are amazing.

169
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,300
I knew

170
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,260
you would definitely be the first.

171
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,940
It's my fault.

172
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,920
I underestimated you.

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,990
You're

174
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,880
well worth the title of the Phoenix.

175
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,010
Look at her.

176
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,270
How does she have a face to come back?

177
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,940
Exactly.

178
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,100
How does she have a face to come back?

179
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,350
Is she out of her mind?

180
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,890
Does she really think she's the Phoenix?

181
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,590
I told you she's not the Phoenix.

182
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,800
Why is she back?

183
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,510
Why is she still sitting there?

184
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,650
You are not the Phoenix.

185
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,100
You're just

186
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,960
a lowly peacock.

187
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,190
I'm not a peacock.

188
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,540
I am the Phoenix.

189
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,540
Huarong

190
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,210
will never make any mistake.

191
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,640
Take her away.

192
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,860
Go!

193
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,940
Let go of me!

194
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,150
Let go of me! I'm really the Phoenix!

195
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,440
Whether it's the glory of being the Phoenix

196
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,300
or Master's favor,

197
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,500
anything that belongs to me,

198
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,860
no one can take away from me.

199
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,290
Wei Zhi.

200
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,380
What happened?

201
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,820
It turned out Wei Lingyue is not the Phoenix.

202
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,240
Didn’t you say

203
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,840
all ghost talks are nonsense?

204
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,060
Didn't you say you could decide

205
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,300
who the Phoenix would be?

206
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,810
This is great.

207
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,200
A golden phoenix is born

208
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,600
in the chicken nest.

209
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,210
Could it be

210
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,060
there really are divine creatures?

211
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,160
I don't care whether it's god,

212
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,650
immortal, devil or demon.

213
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,070
Even if they can summon wind and rain,

214
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,840
they can't really do whatever they want.

215
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,640
Otherwise, what's the use of farming and reading?

216
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,070
What's the use of strategies?

217
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,880
And why did wars break out?

218
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,070
Even if there are

219
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,810
divine creatures or monsters,

220
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,580
they can't really interfere the matters in the mortal world.

221
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,870
For us,

222
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,270
the most important thing

223
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,550
is the people and the things in front of us.

224
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,540
But now everyone in the court

225
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,250
is talking about it.

226
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,100
The ones who saw the Phoenix in person

227
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,220
are just those students in the academy

228
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,170
and their parents.

229
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,790
Later,

230
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,210
I'll just scare them with a Speech Prohibition Order.

231
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,450
Then naturally, they won't dare to say anything.

232
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,890
As for the rest,

233
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,150
I have my own plans.

234
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,910
Don’t worry.

235
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,390
Lord Imperial Advisor,

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,500
Miss Wei Lingyue requests to see you.

237
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,470
Why does she come here?

238
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,130
Sister.

239
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,600
I will find you.

240
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,170
Do you really like Chen Yan?

241
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,810
Chen Yan.

242
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,750
Greetings, My Lord.

243
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,830
[Youxing, one of the four guardians of Demon Realm]

244
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,900
My Lord.

245
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,790
We have been sleeping for thousands of years.

246
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,640
Now the Phoenix finally reappeared.

247
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,410
We're at your disposal.

248
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,400
Since the Heaven Realm

249
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,520
is also looking for the Phoenix,

250
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,460
it means the Phoenix

251
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,310
must be missing.

252
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,640
That's easy.

253
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,310
[Sening, one of the four guardians of Demon Realm]

254
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,390
I'll bring my men

255
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,980
to search every inch of land in the Three Realms

256
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,880
and find the Phoenix.

257
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,440
Since the Heaven Realm

258
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,700
is already looking for the Phoenix,

259
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,910
we shouldn't make a big fuss

260
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,850
and attract attention,

261
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,700
in case we become the cat's paw.

262
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,420
Red Girl.

263
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,190
[Red Girl, one of the four guardians of Demon Realm]

264
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,640
Yes.

265
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,230
You are in charge of finding the Phoenix.

266
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,170
Remember,

267
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,550
don't alert others.

268
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,180
Yes.

269
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,300
Youxing.

270
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,350
Yes.

271
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,110
I want everyone who is looking for the Phoenix,

272
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,540
no matter who he is,

273
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,000
to suffer.

274
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,610
Yes, My Lord.

275
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,270
What about me?

276
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,200
Lord.

277
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,270
What should I do?

278
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:57,860
Stand by.

279
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,660
No.

280
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,920
What brings you here

281
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,070
today?

282
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,420
I came here

283
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,500
to remind you something.

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,550
Go ahead.

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,530
The Phoenix was born,

286
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,140
but no auspicious sign appeared.

287
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,830
Instead, the evil demons were drawn here

288
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,290
and had a big fight in the academy.

289
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,180
We can't determine

290
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,050
whether the Phoenix is evil or not.

291
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,570
We don't know

292
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
if it will bring disasters.

293
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,880
Is that what you want to remind me?

294
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm just a girl.

295
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,460
My knowledge is limited.

296
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,670
If I said anything wrong,

297
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,090
please forgive me.

298
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,620
I wonder

299
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,270
if your father

300
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,140
knows that you come here today.

301
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,340
No. I didn't tell him.

302
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,180
My father is my father.

303
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,290
I am me.

304
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,950
Although I'm not gifted,

305
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,700
I learned some skills

306
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,950
in the academy.

307
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,000
Although I'm a woman,

308
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,520
I still care about the country.

309
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,580
If this Phoenix did anything

310
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
like harming the country or the people,

311
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,150
I will definitely

312
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,320
be at your service.

313
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,540
I admire

314
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,640
your heroic spirit.

315
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,590
If you mind

316
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,820
my father's position,

317
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,670
and have concerns about

318
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,790
my sincerity for that reason,

319
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,610
I will do my best

320
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,660
to eliminate your worries.

321
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,700
Please wait for my news.

322
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,530
The selection of the Phoenix

323
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,810
was in our hands.

324
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,430
But I didn't expect that...

325
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,550
it was that girl from the Gu family.

326
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,340
Back then,

327
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,860
Ming Chengwu was already the scapegoat.

328
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,780
But about the mistake I made about the Phoenix,

329
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,770
His Majesty will definitely punish me.

330
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,730
We really need someone

331
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,140
to get out of

332
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,500
the plight.

333
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,650
Why didn't our Lord

334
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,600
give me a mission?

335
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,680
Do you want to know why?

336
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,010
Why?

337
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,850
Because finding someone

338
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,300
needs to use the brain.

339
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,210
But you don't have one.

340
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,810
Right.

341
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,580
Indeed I have no brain,

342
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,930
but I'm healthy and strong.

343
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,930
Our Lord is injured.

344
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,560
The situation is a bit tricky.

345
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
Be alert, everyone.

346
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,440
Don't worry.

347
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,349
Those jerks in the Heaven Realm

348
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,460
are nothing to be afraid of.

349
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,819
You must have forgotten,

350
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,190
after the last battle between immortals and demons,

351
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,890
how long you've been

352
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,589
staying in the stone wall.

353
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,270
I...

354
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,349
I'm leaving.

355
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,810
After thousands of years,

356
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,410
Youxing is still so disagreeable.

357
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,900
You can't make him utter a word

358
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,000
even by beating him with a club.

359
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,780
Let's go.

360
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,560
Get to work.

361
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,920
Master.

362
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,630
Come in.

363
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,070
Don't do

364
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,430
these things anymore.

365
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,710
I'm used to it anyway.

366
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,420
You look well today.

367
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,140
I think I can recover

368
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,610
within ten days.

369
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,540
Wei Zhi.

370
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,630
Wei Zhi!

371
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,610
What's wrong?

372
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,300
Sit down.

373
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,230
Breathe.

374
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,820
Are you feeling better?

375
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,970
It's the first time your blood has been simulated,

376
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,390
but your cultivation

377
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,640
can't merge it yet.

378
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,850
Therefore,

379
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,250
it'll harm your health,

380
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,870
or worse, your life will be in danger.

381
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,570
From today onwards,

382
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,460
you have to practice the skills of

383
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,250
Deity Arts repeatedly every day.

384
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,330
Only by improving your spiritual power

385
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,170
and strengthen your cultivation quickly,

386
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,460
can you use it freely.

387
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,520
You finally came to me.

388
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,740
Thousands of years have passed,

389
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,350
and you still smell so good.

390
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,830
Let's get down to business.

391
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,750
Isn't this a serious matter?

392
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,330
It's the time of lust.

393
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,260
I want you to find someone for me.

394
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,370
I'm not looking for a man.

395
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,030
Help me check

396
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,750
if there are a strange man and a strange woman

397
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,350
in your Devil Realm recently?

398
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,850
The man is an immortal.

399
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,970
As for the woman,

400
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,340
she's kind of a mortal.

401
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,350
If they are not devils,

402
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,770
they won't be able to get in.

403
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,370
I'm the same.

404
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,780
But I enter your Devil Realm at will.

405
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,550
You are different.

406
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
You are a weirdo in the Three Realms.

407
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,730
You have the heart of the Demon Clan,

408
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,170
but the blood of the Devil Clan

409
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,340
and the bones of the Heavenly Clan.

410
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,170
What you're lack of is a bit of humanity.

411
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,210
There's no other clues

412
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,260
other than that they're a man and a woman?

413
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
The man is seriously injured.

414
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,280
The woman is quite pretty.

415
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,810
Look how nervous you are.

416
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,950
Is it your lover that

417
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,100
ran away with another woman?

418
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,010
Isn't my lover you?

419
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,290
Will you help me or not?

420
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
It's a piece of cake.

421
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,610
But

422
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,020
it depends on your performance.

423
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,250
Now it's getting serious.

424
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,630
This is very important.

425
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,950
You have to pay attention to it.

426
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,940
Don't worry.

427
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,220
Leave it to me.

428
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,980
I got it.

429
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,110
I got it.

430
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,150
She's so pretty.

431
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,500
Yes, she is.

432
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,770
I haven't seen her before.

433
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,570
Exactly.

434
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,640
The princess of the Fox Clan looks the same.

435
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,740
I really want to take her home.

436
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,630
Little female.

437
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,110
Which family are you from?

438
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,040
I've never seen you before.

439
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,370
Come with me.

440
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,410
Master.

441
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:15,820
Let's go.

442
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,700
Stop!

443
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,790
What?

444
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,210
You also like this female?

445
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,040
Fine.

446
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
Let's follow

447
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,400
the rules of the Devil Realm.

448
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,820
Let's fight.

449
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,110
The winner

450
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,150
can take her away.

451
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,350
Fight! Fight!

452
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,180
I'm fine.

453
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,470
Do you want to die?

454
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:12,990
You...

455
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,280
How dare you touch my people?

456
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,940
Get lost!

457
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,610
Are you okay?

458
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,420
Let's go.

459
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,130
[Wolf Howling Cave]

460
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,280
Come in.

461
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:57,790
Sit.

462
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,420
Sit down.

463
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,230
Here.

464
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,680
Master, are you alright?

465
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,660
Are you angry?

466
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,460
I was not slacking off.

467
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,640
I went out after practice.

468
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't be angry.

469
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,220
Why is he angry?

470
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,490
Obviously,

471
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,580
he's jealous.

472
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,180
I didn't expect a divine lord

473
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,090
to get jealous

474
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,560
with a bunch of little devils outside.

475
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Don't talk nonsense.

476
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,880
You think too much.

477
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,380
Do I?

478
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,700
Or you don't want to admit it?

479
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,530
You know what it truly is deep inside.

480
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,120
First, I'm her master.

481
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,080
Second, I have the responsibility of the Heaven Realm

482
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,150
to protect her.

483
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,380
So,

484
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,460
it's reasonable

485
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,800
I'm nervous

486
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,460
about her safety.

487
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,920
Anyway, you can explain,

488
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,650
but I'll have my own opinion.

489
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,250
Right?

490
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,860
Wei Zhi

491
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,980
is so charming now.

492
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,180
I'm a strong competitor.

493
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,050
It's good to lose a competitor

494
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,860
like you.

495
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,760
Am I right, Wei Zhi?

496
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,060
It's just

497
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,480
caused by the Phoenix scent.

498
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,120
The Phoenix scent

499
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,300
is unique in the Three Realms.

500
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,120
When you devils smell it,

501
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,940
you can't help but be fascinated head over heels.

502
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,410
So what?

503
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,030
Besides,

504
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,180
Wei Zhi has the Phoenix scent now.

505
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,300
That's also part of her charm.

506
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm obsessed with her charm.

507
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,820
Unlike someone,

508
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,900
even if they're obsessed,

509
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,660
they just won't admit it.

510
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,180
Right?

511
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,900
I only know

512
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,460
if we let the Phoenix scent spread and don't control it,

513
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,900
not only everyone in the Devil Realm will be drawn here,

514
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,260
but also the Demon Clan.

515
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,520
Yes.

516
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,980
I never thought about it.

517
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,900
What should we do?

518
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,150
There is only one way.

519
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,190
Melt the heart of a beauty of the Fox Clan

520
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,840
and the throat bone of a sea devil,

521
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,540
then inject pure spiritual power into it,

522
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,350
and make it into elixirs.

523
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,830
After that,

524
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,460
just take the elixirs.

525
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,170
The heart of a beauty…

526
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,900
Okay.

527
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,440
I'll get them ready.

528
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,360
One hundred each.

529
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,370
What?

530
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,100
One hundred!

531
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,520
One hundred each?

532
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,110
No.

533
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,830
This is a rare thing.

534
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,420
One or two are fine.

535
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,630
If you want one hundred,

536
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,020
where can I get them for you?

537
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,740
You're in charge of finding all the materials.

538
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,900
One hundred.

539
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
This...

540
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,110
Well...

541
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,270
Well...

542
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,780
In that case,

543
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,640
you can only find all these things

544
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,610
in one place in the whole Devil Realm.

545
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,140
[Treasure House]

546
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,320
If we do this,

547
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,420
will we look like that

548
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,590
we are parading in the street?

549
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,740
No, we won't.

550
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,420
Let me tell you.

551
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,720
The rule of the Treasure House is

552
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,550
to garantee the privacy of every buyer.

553
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,980
So, inside it,

554
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,220
everyone wears a mask.

555
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,780
Are you sure there's no problem

556
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,810
about Wei Zhi's Phoenix scent?

557
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,190
Don't worry.

558
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,700
I used the best spice

559
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,890
of the Fox Clan on her.

560
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,380
It can even cover the fox stink,

561
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,890
not to mention the Phoenix scent.

562
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,480
However,

563
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,820
it can't last too long.

564
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,410
Okay.

565
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,050
Let's make it quick.

566
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,860
Long time no see.

567
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,540
Have a seat.

568
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,740
Come, have a seat.

569
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,470
Please.

570
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,260
This seat is nice.

571
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,460
You're a poor guy. Why do you come?

572
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Why can't I come?

573
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
Come on. Let's sit together.

574
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
This way.

575
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,850
Okay.

576
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,380
Brother, why are we here?

577
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,730
Do you have anything to buy at the auction?

578
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,270
Who said that you have to buy something

579
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,290
in the auction house?

580
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,860
Then what are you doing here?

581
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,440
To join in the fun.

582
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,810
When there are many people,

583
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,160
there will always be a good show.

584
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,780
Why is this smell

585
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,300
so familiar?

586
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,800
Lan Su!

587
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,900
No way.

588
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,660
Why is Yi Li also here?

589
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,840
Just wait and see.

590
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,780
We're determined to get it.

591
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,300
Who can compete with us?

592
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,620
Exactly.

593
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,020
Look.

594
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,160
[Master Skunk, owner of Treasure House of Tianyao City]

595
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,810
This is the owner of the auction house.

596
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,450
She's a famous treasure merchant.

597
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,450
Master Skunk.

598
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,830
She stinks,

599
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,610
but

600
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,710
many people covet her treasure.

601
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:18,890
So,

602
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,570
they all came here, attracted by her fame.

603
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,950
You said she stinks.

604
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,250
Why can't I smell it?

605
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,420
You're wearing this.

606
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,730
That's why you can't smell it.

607
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,820
All the people who can sit here today

608
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,890
are regular customers.

609
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,460
As usual,

610
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,180
bid with your spiritual power. And it will not be refunded if you fail.

611
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,360
Place your bet and don't regret it once it's done.

612
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,040
Now let's start

613
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,580
with Lot 1.

614
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,260
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

615
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,740
pick the best one to go.

616
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,500
Ginseng fruit.

617
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,600
You can gain 1,000 years of cultivation after eating it.

618
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,820
The starting price is only 5 years of devil cultivation.

619
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,720
Place your bet and don't regret it once it's done.

620
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,200
In the Devil Realm,

621
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,980
is it always that it will not be refunded if you fail?

622
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,770
This is the self-evolution of the Devil Dlan.

623
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,940
The fittest survive and the inferior are eliminated.

624
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,210
Me!

625
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,350
I bid 5 years of devil cultivation for it.

626
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,540
With only 5 years of devil cultivation,

627
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,300
you want to get

628
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,860
a ginseng fruit that is worth 1000 years of devil cultivation?

629
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,030
You wish!

630
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,710
100 years.

631
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,420
You...

632
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,140
You already have

633
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,500
1,500 years of devil cultivation.

634
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,530
Why do you fight with me?

635
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,690
300 years.

636
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,090
800.

637
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,560
You...

638
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,990
I'll fight with you to the end!

639
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:03,970
1,000!

640
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,830
That much?

641
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,220
Is he really bidding or acting in a fit of pique?

642
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,180
This guest

643
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,790
with 1,500 years of devil cultivation,

644
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,320
would you like to raise your bid?

645
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,060
If not,

646
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,140
you will lose

647
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,460
800 years of devil cultivation,

648
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,870
which leaves you only 700 years of it.

649
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,750
And your opponent

650
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,930
will lose 1,000 years of spiritual power

651
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,520
and then gain 1,000 years,

652
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,740
You will have 300 years less

653
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,370
than he.

654
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,580
I bid 1,100 years of spiritual power.

655
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
Really?

656
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,470
1,100 years, calling once.

657
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,530
1,100 years, calling twice.

658
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,770
1,100 years, last calling.

659
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,140
No, no, no!

660
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,350
There are too many idiots

661
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,390
like him every year.

662
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,830
Next,

663
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,820
the second lot today:

664
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,500
100 Linglong hearts

665
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,370
and 100 throat bones of the sea devils.

666
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,110
If you make them into elixirs,

667
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,980
It can transform you completely

668
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,740
and change your fate.

669
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,360
The starting price is

670
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,020
100 years of devil cultivation for one piece.

671
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,190
200 years.

672
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,230
300 years.

673
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,310
Ou Ya?

674
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,390
400 years.

675
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,270
500 years.

676
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,010
600 years.

677
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,280
Brother, why do you want those?

678
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,820
I don't want them,

679
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,570
but he does.

680
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,570
My cultivation is 100 years more than his.

681
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,430
I'll make him not only unable to get the things,

682
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,800
but also lose all his cultivation.

683
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,060
I'll make him pay a double penalty.

684
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,460
700 years.

685
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,070
800 years!

686
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,460
Brother, that's enough.

687
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,350
I want to avenge you.

688
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,740
I'm not angry anymore.

689
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,780
1,000 years.

690
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,300
No.

691
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,630
Hey, Stinky Fox.

692
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,460
What do you want?

693
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,530
Let's fight if you dare.

694
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,460
What is this that you

695
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,050
compete with me for the lot here?

696
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,980
Are all you foxes so despicable?

697
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,050
Who are you calling despicable?

698
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,960
Shut up your foul mouth.

699
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,280
Can all these treasures

700
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,760
only be bought by you wolves?

701
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,940
Buy them if you are capable.

702
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,140
If you're not,

703
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,380
don't complain here.

704
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,960
Get lost.

705
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,270
2,000 years.

706
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,989
3,000 years.

707
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,770
3,000 years?

708
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,659
That would cost a lot.

709
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,610
3,000 years, first calling.

710
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,850
3,000 years of devil cultivation, second calling.

711
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,389
Looks like there's no higher bid.

712
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
10,000 years.

713
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,639
10,000 years?

714
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,060
That would be two million years for 200 pieces.

715
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,260
Does he even have so many years of devil cultivation?

716
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,199
Yeah.

717
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,639
10,000 years of devil cultivation, first calling.

718
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,260
10,000 years of devil cultivation, second calling.

719
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,120
10,000 years of devil cultivation, last calling.

720
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,440
I doubt their ability to redeem it.

721
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,280
Two million years of devil cultivation.

722
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,660
That means

723
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,900
he's one out of a hundred thousand devils

724
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,020
and he can become immortal.

725
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,540
Master Skunk.

726
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,820
Aren't you afraid

727
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,970
once your little hammer is down,

728
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,330
the crystal ball

729
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,140
can't get

730
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,340
two million years of devil cultivation?

731
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,380
My honored guests, would you please come inside with me?

732
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,420
I'll go.

733
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,440
Don't worry.

734
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,480
I'll see to what end you're gonna wind up.

735
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,940
Stinky Fox,

736
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,150
I'll tell you today.

737
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,250
Wipe your eyes

738
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,000
and take a good look.

739
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,440
Today, I...

740
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,280
Oh no.

741
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,830
It took too long.

742
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,870
The Phoenix scent is coming out.

743
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,810
Dear guest,

744
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,300
may I

745
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,650
measure your devil bones first?

746
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,030
So that I can

747
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,170
have a rough estimation.

748
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,450
As for the devil cultivation,

749
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,900
I don't even have one year of it.

750
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,910
Do you know

751
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,660
once the hammer's down,

752
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,930
if there is no corresponding devil cultivation,

753
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,370
you'll have to pay with your life.

754
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,890
What about a treasure?

755
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,230
Do you take it?

756
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,720
It's not from me.

757
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,710
Did you make Lan Su sad

758
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,460
for this female?

759
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,950
She must be exceedingly beautiful.

760
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,460
Why don't you let her take off her mask

761
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,460
so that I can have a look too?

762
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,250
Stinky Fox.

763
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,890
Show some respect here.

764
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:05,810
How is it?

765
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,270
Don't worry.

766
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,080
I'm fine.

767
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,560
My two honored guests,

768
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,450
whoever dares to fight here

769
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,570
will be thrown out in their original form.

770
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,860
Do you want to have a try?

771
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,220
Congratulations to the distinguished guests at Xuan Table

772
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,670
on winning the bidding.

773
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,170
Ou Ya.

774
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,180
Let's go.

775
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,250
The relationship between they two

776
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,910
seems special.

777
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,920
So,

778
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,800
Ou Ya is still mine.

779
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,250
Take it.

780
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,800
It can cover your Phoenix scent.

781
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,120
Thank you, Master.

782
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,640
But you just recovered.

783
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,910
And now you wasted your energy on making medicine for me.

784
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,200
I didn't do it for you,

785
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,210
but to fulfill

786
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,270
the mission the Heavenly Emperor gave me.

787
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,380
This elixir can make the Demon Clan

788
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,470
unable to detect your scent,

789
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,680
and make your blood

790
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,860
seem like that of an ordinary devil.

791
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:48,980
Master,

792
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,610
do you really have two million years of devil cultivation?

793
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,700
No.

794
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
I traded it with something.

795
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,130
What is so valuable?

796
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,540
Just some trinkets.

797
00:38:59,170 --> 00:38:59,560
By the way,

798
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,890
after taking the elixir,

799
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,730
you have to rest immediately.

800
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,200
I'll get going.

801
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,540
I can clearly feel

802
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,900
Master cares about me.

803
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,590
But why does he

804
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,090
always treat me coldly?

805
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,300
What about a treasure?

806
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,740
Do you take it?

807
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,590
What treasure can be

808
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,580
better than the lot at the auction?
