[Episode 31]

4
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,340
I really

5
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,820
miss the old days.

6
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,340
Although it was hard,

7
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,260
we shared everything

8
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,579
and lived and died together.

9
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,100
You and the Demon Lord are deeply in love.

10
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,500
I envy you.

11
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,100
But everything has changed.

12
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,100
Why do you say that?

13
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,940
Or,

14
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,060
he hasn't changed,

15
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,820
but I have.

16
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,540
Back then,

17
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,340
when a day was over, we didn't know

18
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,860
if we could live the next day.

19
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,420
We didn't think about anything,

20
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,140
except trying every way

21
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,420
to live on.

22
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
We have everything now,

23
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,980
but I feel that

24
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,220
I can't get into his heart.

25
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,980
I know nothing about his past.

26
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,540
And he never mentioned it to me.

27
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,540
I always thought I knew him well.

28
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,100
Actually, I know nothing about him.

29
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,380
Demon Queen,

30
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,980
did you mention these thoughts of yours

31
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,580
to Demon Duke?

32
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,980
I dare not.

33
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,810
I'm afraid if I make it too clear,

34
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,220
there would be no turning back.

35
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,860
Demon Duke is right.

36
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,660
I always think too much.

37
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
We're an old couple,

38
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
yet I still worry about these things.

39
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,820
I'm really sorry

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,380
to make you listen to me for so long.

41
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,940
I'll get going then.

42
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,980
Wei Zhi,

43
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,540
it's your arrival

44
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,980
that caused Yan Yue's old injuries to relapse,

45
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
and made Demon Queen feel insecure.

46
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,980
You made everyone

47
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,540
in pain again.

48
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,899
Demon Queen brings peace and joy

49
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,579
to Yan Yue.

50
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
She and I have the same face.

51
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,380
This is also

52
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,700
a beautiful dream,

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,660
which makes the love between me

54
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,820
and Yan Yue

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,340
continue in another form.

56
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Maybe

57
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,140
I really should let go.

58
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,820
Let go of myself,

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,700
and let go of

60
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,580
everyone else.

61
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,140
Look.

62
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Butterfly orchid.

63
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,700
Your favorite flower.

64
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
It is also Xi Cai's favorite.

65
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,260
I think you love it because of her.

66
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,540
In the past,

67
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,780
I would never

68
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,820
tell you this.

69
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,820
But now,

70
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,900
with you lying down like this,

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,690
I could open up

72
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,900
to you instead.

73
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,460
You can actually

74
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,900
use your spiritual power.

75
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,659
Then your five senses must be recovering, too.

76
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,020
Maybe soon

77
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,330
you will wake up.

78
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,140
Why are you here?

79
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Heavenly Empress Dowager is worried about the East Kitchen God,

80
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,020
so she asked me to check on her.

81
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,220
How is she?

82
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,340
Not good.

83
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,460
She works hard every day,

84
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,700
but doesn't talk much.

85
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,770
We can't see her smile anymore.

86
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,260
Since she came to Yingzhou,

87
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,900
this is the first time

88
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,140
that she sleeps.

89
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Everyone wants to be an immortal.

90
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,020
But only when you have been one,

91
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,330
you can know if it's good or not.

92
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,460
Look at the East Kitchen God

93
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,659
and the new Heavenly Emperor.

94
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,980
Which one of them is happy?

95
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,380
Let alone

96
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,340
the former God of the Red Sun.

97
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,140
Is it your place to comment on that?

98
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,020
You're too old to talk senselessly like that.

99
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,580
It's just because I've lived a long life

100
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,980
that I don't care about many things.

101
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,020
Is it my place to say it? I don't think about it.

102
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,700
What matters to me is whether it's the right thing to say.

103
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,100
Let me ask you.

104
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,980
Are you happy in the Heaven Realm?

105
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,460
What are you talking about?

106
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,900
Just treat everything with a normal mind.

107
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,580
Then you won't have that many complaints.

108
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,820
I can't communicate with you.

109
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,220
You have no humanity,

110
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,460
following Heavenly Empress Dowager for so long.

111
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,220
Why didn't you give up your immortal status

112
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,460
and return to the mortal world?

113
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,340
The Heaven Realm is the model of the Three Realms.

114
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,500
It's because of love and righteousness

115
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,059
that I stick to the responsibility.

116
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,179
Otherwise,

117
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,580
I would have long gone to be reincarnated.

118
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,860
That's the truth.

119
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,500
Tao.

120
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,340
I'll leave the East Kitchen God to you.

121
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,220
I’m leaving.

122
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Leave it to me.

123
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,980
Tao.

124
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,460
I'll visit you again.

125
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,340
All things sprang from existence.

126
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,700
That existence sprang from non-existence.

127
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,700
The beginning of existence

128
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,620
is based on non-existence.

129
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,500
From now on, you must recite

130
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,420
and study hard.

131
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,980
Understand?

132
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,980
Teacher,

133
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,620
didn't you say

134
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,500
magic is about

135
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,460
applying what one has learned and achieving mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject?

136
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
But why

137
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,220
do you want me to recite it every day?

138
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,700
Because it's a special technique.

139
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,090
It will help you a lot.

140
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,980
As long as you remember it,

141
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,860
in the future,

142
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,980
when I'm not around,

143
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,500
you can learn it by yourself.

144
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,500
Teacher,

145
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,460
are you leaving?

146
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,460
I'm just saying.

147
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Teacher.

148
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Please don't leave, okay?

149
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,980
I will study hard.

150
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,580
That's all for today.

151
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
Go play.

152
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
Xiaomo,

153
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,820
I'm leaving soon.

154
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,980
I can't urge you

155
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,340
to study every day.

156
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,580
Everything depends on you.

157
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Don't make your father angry anymore.

158
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,580
In this way,

159
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,220
your mother will feel better.

160
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,220
Let's go for a drink.

161
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,100
Let's go.

162
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,100
We had a good fight today.

163
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,690
We must have a good drink.

164
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,100
Let's go.

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Those people

166
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,100
can't beat us, but they always come.

167
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,980
Yeah.

168
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,620
We have to beat them up!

169
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,820
What happened?

170
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,420
The adjacent piece of land

171
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,410
is like being cursed.

172
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,740
They always make a scene on the first day of the lunar moon

173
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,700
and were never absent.

174
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
We just defeated them.

175
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,620
Let's go have a drink.

176
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,100
Let's go.

177
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Let's go.

178
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,580
The first day of the lunar month.

179
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,580
Today is the first day of March.

180
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,740
It's my birthday again.

181
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,050
Demon Duke.

182
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,980
Smells good.

183
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,740
Do you

184
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,820
miss your husband?

185
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,740
I've sent more men to look for him for you.

186
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,340
Just wait a little longer.

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
No need.

188
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,100
If he remembers me

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
and wants to look for me,

190
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,690
he'll come to me.

191
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,220
Otherwise,

192
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,420
why should I push for it?

193
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,300
If you really think so,

194
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,100
you won't cry.

195
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Don't worry.

196
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,420
I won't laugh at you.

197
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,820
You don't have to pretend to be strong.

198
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,100
If you want to eat anything,

199
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
just tell the kitchen.

200
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,980
You don't have to cook it yourself.

201
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,980
Today is my birthday.

202
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,700
In the mortal world,

203
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,860
you should eat noodles on your birthday.

204
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,730
It symbolizes longevity.

205
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,100
I didn't want to trouble others,

206
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,700
so I did it myself.

207
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,220
I see.

208
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm hungry.

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,980
I can try

210
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,340
the longevity noodles

211
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,460
from your mortal world.

212
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,460
The rice, noodles,

213
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,620
and spices in Demon Realm,

214
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,100
are very different from those in the mortal world.

215
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,500
Try it first.

216
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,580
Not bad.

217
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,300
Actually,

218
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,580
growing up,

219
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,460
I have only celebrated my birthday once.

220
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,580
My husband celebrated it for me.

221
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,420
He kept me company and cooked noodles for me.

222
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,580
We watched the sunset once.

223
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,700
That was the most beautiful sunset

224
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,580
I've ever seen.

225
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,420
Longevity noodles.

226
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,340
Have I…

227
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,300
eaten it before?

228
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,340
But later I found out

229
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,340
that day

230
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,570
was the day he had to

231
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,980
leave me.

232
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
When he

233
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,740
did all those things for me,

234
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,460
what torture it must have been for him.

235
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,980
Yan Yue,

236
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,500
thank you for everything you've done for me.

237
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,100
Now it's my turn

238
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,340
to do something for you.

239
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,180
I will leave.

240
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,500
You must live well.

241
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,100
Demon Duke.

242
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,460
As the saying goes, if you eat other people's food, you own them a favor.

243
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,740
Tell me.

244
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,700
What birthday gift do you want?

245
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,690
I don't want any.

246
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,180
If I offered it,

247
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,500
you must want it.

248
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,940
What?

249
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,860
Are you looking down on me?

250
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,300
If possible,

251
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,700
I want to see the sunset again.

252
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,740
Did you come to the Demon Realm

253
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,060
just to make things difficult for me?

254
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,700
One minute you look for someone,

255
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,860
and the next you want to see the sunset.

256
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,340
This is the Demon Realm,

257
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,580
a place of chaos.

258
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,820
There's no sunset.

259
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,740
I just said I didn't want any gifts.

260
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,940
It's you that

261
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,980
insisted on me making a request.

262
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,100
Thank you for the noodles.

263
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,820
What is that?

264
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,700
Look, the sun.

265
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,460
How can the demon clan have the sun?

266
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,980
Happy birthday.

267
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Thank you.

268
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,460
You're welcome.

269
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,820
This is not the sunset you want.

270
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,420
I know.

271
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,700
This is a visual trick of yours.

272
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,220
This

273
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,580
is a fake sunset.

274
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,340
No.

275
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,060
It's the morning sun.

276
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,980
It's sunrise,

277
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,700
which represents hope.

278
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,980
People should look forward.

279
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,300
Demon Duke.

280
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,180
Don't cry.

281
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,300
I hate women crying.

282
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
So annoying.

283
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,580
If you must cry,

284
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,060
cry after I leave.

285
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,580
What are you thinking about?

286
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,420
Why are you here?

287
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,580
I was thinking,

288
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,980
a long time ago,

289
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,340
we watched the sunrise together.

290
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,500
You thought about a thing so long ago.

291
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,180
Yes.

292
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,100
It's been too long.

293
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,100
Now that I think about it,

294
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,700
it's vague where I was,

295
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,100
and what year it was.

296
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,500
Do you remember?

297
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,700
If you don't remember some things,

298
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
just stop thinking about them.

299
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,220
You said

300
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,660
that the seas can run dry, the rocks can crumble, and stars can change places.

301
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,180
Everything changes.

302
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,180
The only thing that never changes...

303
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,020
The only thing that never changes

304
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,740
is you and me.

305
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,300
Wei Zhi?

306
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,900
Are you Wei Zhi?

307
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,380
At this rate,

308
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,220
I can't tell

309
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,500
which one is Wei Zhi.

310
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,780
Everything you see is fake.

311
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,220
The sunrise is fake.

312
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,460
The Demon Queen is fake.

313
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Yan Yue's happiness is fake.

314
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,620
Fake is fake.

315
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,540
You can't let them

316
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,900
pretend to be real.

317
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,460
You have to stay

318
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,260
to find the truth and wake him up.

319
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,060
But...

320
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,460
What should I do?

321
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,940
Mother.

322
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,460
This is a birthday flower ring I made.

323
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,220
Look.

324
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,060
Does it look good?

325
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,980
Not bad.

326
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,300
Mother,

327
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,460
is my birthday coming?

328
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,700
When my birthday comes,

329
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,940
I also want my father

330
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,220
to conjure up the sun.

331
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,420
Soon.

332
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,700
I'll tell you when it's your birthday.

333
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,900
Then you must remember.

334
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Mother.

335
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,220
What about your birthday?

336
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,060
Is it coming soon?

337
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
I...

338
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,940
I don't have a birthday.

339
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,890
No.

340
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,940
I heard from my teacher that

341
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,460
everyone in the world

342
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,980
has their own birthday.

343
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,740
You must be mistaken.

344
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,420
Think about it.

345
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,060
Okay, I'll think about it.

346
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,940
Go play.

347
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,980
Do you remember

348
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,460
how we met?

349
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,980
What?

350
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,260
Are you testing me again?

351
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,940
Seriously.

352
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,780
Why are you so serious?

353
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,620
Okay.

354
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,940
I remember

355
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,660
at that time,

356
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,700
I was injured.

357
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,220
So I escaped to the Dark Forest.

358
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,980
You saved me.

359
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,020
And

360
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,700
you cured me.

361
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,380
Yes.

362
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,780
It's the Dark Forest.

363
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,700
The trees are dense and the grass smells nice.

364
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,780
It's my home.

365
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,620
What's wrong?

366
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,460
Are you homesick?

367
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,260
Let's go back together next time.

368
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,180
No need.

369
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,940
I'm just saying.

370
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,140
It's okay.

371
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,500
What happened?

372
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,620
It's weird.

373
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Demon Queen.

374
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,060
What's the matter?

375
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,180
Have a seat.

376
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,860
I have something to ask you.

377
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,060
Go ahead.

378
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,620
Do you mortals

379
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,220
have a disease

380
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,980
that once you catch, you'll forget everything?

381
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,980
It's possible.

382
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,460
Maybe

383
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,140
when somebody's severely stimulated.

384
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,060
Why do you suddenly ask me this?

385
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,220
I don't know.

386
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,500
I just feel

387
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,300
both Demon Duke and I are strange.

388
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,740
He knows nothing about his past.

389
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,700
Me too.

390
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,180
I don't even remember

391
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,980
Xiaomo's birthday.

392
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,980
But I'm his mother.

393
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,100
I vaguely feel

394
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,460
there's a secret

395
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,370
hidden.

396
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,860
Or…

397
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,540
forgotten.

398
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Demon Queen,

399
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,980
do you want to find out this secret?

400
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,930
Yes.

401
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,060
But I'm also afraid.

402
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,780
I think

403
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,220
whether you're a human,

404
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,260
a devil,

405
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,140
an immortal,

406
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,060
or a demon,

407
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
anyone would want

408
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,380
a complete self,

409
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,220
instead of an incomplete,

410
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,370
or even modified skin.

411
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,460
You're right.

412
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,250
But now,

413
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,620
I don't even have a clue.

414
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,620
I don't know

415
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,060
where to start.

416
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,980
Maybe

417
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,380
you can go to the original place

418
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
to have a look.

419
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,660
The original place?

420
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,380
Mother.

421
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,260
Where are we going?

422
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,660
To our hometown.

423
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,420
What does that mean?

424
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,500
Well...

425
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,380
The place where your father and I met.

426
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,980
Also where you were born.

427
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,780
I see.

428
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,260
Is this the place?

429
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,980
Yes, it is.

430
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,730
Why is this place so shabby?

431
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,740
Your father and I

432
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,020
met here.

433
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,730
I don't know

434
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,940
why it became like this.

435
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,740
Mother, I found the treasure.

436
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,500
This is the medicinal jade.

437
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm here for it.

438
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,780
Xiaomo.

439
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,980
Mother.

440
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,980
Your face

441
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,420
changed color.

442
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,460
And your hand.

443
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,460
Let's go.

444
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,740
Honey.

445
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,540
What are you doing?

446
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,780
Nothing.

447
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,370
Why do you want to take it out?

448
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,980
I gave it to you

449
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,060
when we got engaged.

450
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,700
But you never wore it.

451
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
I thought

452
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,260
you didn't like it.

453
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,300
Who said I don't like it?

454
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,620
I'm just afraid

455
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,610
I'm too clumsy

456
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,980
to break it accidentally.

457
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,260
How is it? Is it pretty?

458
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,940
Yes.

459
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,780
I didn't notice

460
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,940
there was a crack.

461
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,780
It doesn't matter.

462
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,060
Fine.

463
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,140
Since you like it,

464
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,980
wear it more in the future.

465
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,180
Tao.

466
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,460
What are you doing?

467
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Are you going to grind lovesickness bean flour

468
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
to make cakes?

469
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,420
You

470
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,020
are indeed the East Kitchen God.

471
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
In the mortal world,

472
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,500
lovesickness beans are the symbol of lovesickness.

473
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,530
Legend has it that

474
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,300
someone who misses his lover very much

475
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,860
sheds tears under the tree.

476
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,140
The emotions are too strong to dissipate.

477
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,220
In the end,

478
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,140
they turned into lovesickness beans.

479
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,460
Lovesickness.

480
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,220
They are as hard as diamonds,

481
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,700
and as red as blood.

482
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,500
Look.

483
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,980
Does it look like a heart?

484
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,060
Yes.

485
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,900
It's really similar.

486
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
Tao.

487
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,380
Do you miss someone too?

488
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,660
In the mortal world,

489
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,140
people say that if you wear the lovesickness beans

490
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,180
on your wrist,

491
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,860
you'll meet the person you miss.

492
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,060
My Lord.

493
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,930
Yi'er.

494
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,260
Tao.

495
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,220
Thank you for taking care of me

496
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,260
during this period.

497
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,420
I'm leaving.

498
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,460
Yi'er.

499
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,900
Kitchen God.

500
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,540
Tao.

501
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,140
Don't worry about me.

502
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,780
I hope you can meet

503
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,940

00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,470
♫You don't have to understand if you don't want to hear♫

577
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,200
♫Even if it's a dream♫

578
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,260
Heavenly Empress Dowager,

579
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,060
I...

580
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,460
How dare you!

581
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,260
You broke into the time dust without permission?

582
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,220
Do you know

583
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
what the consequences will be?

584
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
I'm sorry.

585
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,460
I miss him so much.

586
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,500
I can't control myself.

587
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,020
Don't say sorry to me.

588
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,300
Do you really want to

589
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,020
be locked

590
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,420
in the time dust

591
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,260
and never able to leave for him?

592
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,380
Are you willing to be like that?

593
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,900
Even if I'm locked up for the rest of my life,

594
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,660
as long as I'm with him,

595
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm willing.

596
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,780
Love is just vanity.

597
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,860
I've heard this too many times.

598
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,620
Aunt,

599
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,260
do you really believe it?

600
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,980
Are you really willing

601
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,260
to live a heartless and loveless life

602
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,500
like this?

603
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,180
Yi'er!

604
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,460
If I can hold my lover's hands,

605
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,980
if we can be with and help each other even in hard times,

606
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,060
I'd rather give up my immortal status

607
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,180
and give up immortality.

608
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,260
How dare you!

609
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,900
I don't want to

610
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,260
hear words like those again.

611
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,060
Aunt.

612
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,220
Heavenly Empress Dowager,

613
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
you transfer your spiritual power

614
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,900
to Heavenly Emperor every day.

615
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,700
It'll be a great loss for yourself.

616
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,900
It's bad for your health.

617
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,940
It's okay.

618
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,540
I'll be fine after some rest.

619
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,460
Let's go back.

620
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,140
Okay.

621
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,620
Aunt.

622
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,420
Aunt.

623
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,420
I beg you.

624
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,380
Let me take another look at him.

625
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,420
Just one look.

626
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,260
Aunt.

627
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,860
The teacher said

628
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,460
not only need you to be proficient in spells,

629
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,420
but also focus on your heart.

630
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,860
In this way, you can conjure up

631
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,860
what you want the most.

632
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,260
Father, have a try.

633
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,460
What is this strange thing?

634
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Father,

635
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,900
when you did it,

636
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,940
what were you thinking about?

637
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,730
Nothing.

638
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,940
The golden feather fled away.

639
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,620
Why do I have the impression

640
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,260
that I've seen this before somewhere?

641
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,900
Why is there a Phoenix Feather here?

642
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,020
Teacher!

643
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,929
The golden feather fled to your house.

644
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,340
Catch it!

645
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,060
Teacher!

646
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,900
My feather.

647
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,300
My golden feather.

648
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,620
Demon Duke, Demon Queen.

649
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,300
Just now, Xiaomo

650
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,340
taught us magical spells.

651
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,370
I can't do it at all.

652
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,540
But Demon Duke

653
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,500
has conjured up…

654
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,260
A golden feather.

655
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,739
A flying golden feather.

656
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,980
This is not a golden feather.

657
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,460
This is Phoenix Feather.

658
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,170
The deity's skills and the illusions are all from people's hearts.

659
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,020
At that time, what you thought

660
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,969
will reflect on the thing you conjured up.

661
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,179
Demon Duke, you really don't know this?

662
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,420
Phoenix.

663
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,420
How could I know it?

664
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,370
Phoenix is an ancient divine creature.

665
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,940
Its soul is passed down to the world.

666
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,620
It has a strange connection

667
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,340
with the sacred Huarong in the Demon Realm.

668
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,860
The Phoenix

669
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,460
is feared by the Heavenly Realm

670
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,460
which is the leader of the Three Realms.

671
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,740
The Heavenly Court sent the Red Sun God

672
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,900
to kill the Phoenix.

673
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,060
But destiny makes fools of the people.

674
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,100
The Red Sun God

675
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,660
committed an unforgivable crime.

676
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Teacher,

677
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,460
go ahead.

678
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,900
What happened to the God of Red Sun?

679
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,740
What crime did he commit?

680
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,380
He fell in love with

681
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,980
his sworn enemy Pheonix.

682
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,420
Love?

683
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,620
Love is marriage,

684
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,460
like my father and mother.

685
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,780
They were married in one life.

686
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
But later,

687
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,490
for justice and responsibility,

688
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,500
he had to kill Phoenix.

689
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,460
Justice and responsibility.

690
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Father,

691
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,420
what do these words mean?

692
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,980
Dear,

693
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,460
if it were you,

694
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,660
what would you choose?

695
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,260
The God of Red Sun

696
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,500
is too weak.

697
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,620
If it were me,

698
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,260
I wouldn't have cared about justice

699
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
or responsibility.

700
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,460
I will put everything aside

701
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,060
and be with the one I love

702
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,860
forever.

703
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,420
Xiaomo,

704
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,900
we've done the magical skills,

705
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
and heard the stories.

706
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,620
It's time to go.

707
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,020
Say goodbye to Teacher.

708
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,300
Goodbye, teacher.

709
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,380
See you tomorrow.

710
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,180
Where did you

711
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,580
get this?

712
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,180
Why did you go there secretly?

713
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,940
What do you mean secretly?

714
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,780
I heard you mention that place.

715
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,980
I was curious,

716
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,460
so I went there.

717
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,380
What did you see?

718
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,980
Ruins.

719
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,290
It doesn't look like someone has lived there.

720
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,340
Only this container…

721
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,380
looked like it had been thrown there.

722
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,180
Is this yours?

723
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,980
I don't remember.

724
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,460
It's just a container.

725
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,340
If it's gone, it's gone.

726
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,420
Why did you bring it back?

727
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,050
When I saw it,

728
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,260
I felt

729
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,820
familiar.

730
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,660
I think I've seen it somewhere,

731
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,940
but I don't remember.

732
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,820
Really?

733
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,820
I'll tell you when you remember.

734
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,100
By the way,

735
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,140
I advise you

736
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,380
not to wander around again.

737
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,060
If you are in danger again,

738
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,300
I can't save you.

739
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,660
Where have I seen it before?

740
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,980
It hurts.

741
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,410
Let go! Let go!

742
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,460
It hurts.

743
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,380
Do you know what time it is?

744
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,660
You're still sleeping?

745
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,180
It's still early.

746
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,740
Let me sleep some more.

747
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,900
Stop sleeping.

748
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,140
Go check the Phoenix Egg.

749
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,620
Phoenix egg.

750
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,300
Phoenix egg.

751
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,660
No, this...

752
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,980
This is clearly a bad omen.

753
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,940
Bad omen?

754
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,940
You mean this bird egg…

755
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,300
Phoenix egg.

756
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,300
This phoenix egg...

757
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,140
It can't be doomed, can it?

758
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,900
Stop talking nonsense.

759
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,980
Think of something for me.

760
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,020
What can I do?

761
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,060
This bird egg

762
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,300
has been here for so long.

763
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,780
The son of a phoenix.

764
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,140
Don't say bird egg.

765
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,180
Phoenix egg. Phoenix egg.

766
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,020
Why do you only grow old

767
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,180
but never grow sensible?

768
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,300
You've lived so long for nothing.

769
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,460
I think

770
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,420
we should find someone wise

771
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,460
to ask.
