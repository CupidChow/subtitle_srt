1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,833
Give it your all, Vee. This project,

2
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,900
We definitely have to beat Jinta’s team.

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,166
Khun Chan, Khun Pad’s calling for a meeting.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,833
Damn it, meetings all day.

5
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,666
This is the old man I told you about.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,100
What a coincidence! Let me have your IG.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,766
- My account’s private.
- Sis!

8
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:42,233
I’m really happy to be in Kitakyushu with you.

9
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,500
I like Kitakyushu too.

10
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,033
Especially when you’re here with me.

11
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:31,733
You’re not setting private anymore?

12
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,566
Nope, not anymore.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,700
What make you change your mind?

14
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,700
You wouldn’t even let me follow you before.

15
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Well, now you can. Isn’t that good?

16
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:52,966
It’s good.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,566
I love it.

18
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,066
Pick up, sis.

19
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,333
Hello, Khun Mind.

20
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:23,933
May I ask what business you have WITH MY P’Aokbab?

21
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,300
Babe, tell her we’re on our honeymoon.

22
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,866
If there’s nothing else, we’ll hang up now.

23
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,500
We’ve got more romantic time to spend.

24
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,033
Sayonara, Khun Mind-san!

25
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:58,033
Bleh!

26
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,666
What on earth are you doing?

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,766
Talking to Mind-san, what else?

28
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:05,900
Ugh.

29
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,800
Ugh, it’s so cold, sis.

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,266
Let me hug you.

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,233
My hands are freezing.

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,100
Hey, let go!

33
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,400
But it’s cold!

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,266
Come on, just a little.

35
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,566
Fine, fine—come here, it’s cold anyway.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,366
Yahh—

37
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
You okay?

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,400
I’m not drunk.

39
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,066
See? I still walk straight.

40
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:17,633
Such a romantic night, isn’t it?

41
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,233
Yeah.

42
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,966
Do you think—

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,066
we should kiss again?

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,266
What—hey!

45
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,300
Khun Ming wouldn’t do that.

46
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,733
We’re walking on the street, have some shame.

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,633
Why be shy? The more people see, the better.

48
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,333
Let everyone see how much we love each other.

49
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,533
Stop right there, you little puppy.

50
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,100
I’m not a puppy, I’m a little kitty—meow.

51
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,700
Haven’t you had enough?

52
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,400
Think of it as payment.

53
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,966
For saving you from that old hag earlier.

54
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,666
You call that saving me?

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,100
I knew you didn’t want to talk to her.

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,300
Yeah?

57
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,166
Still, don’t you think that was too much?

58
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,166
I was just doing my duty.

59
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,333
What duty?

60
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,766
Protecting the one I love.

61
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,966
You’re really in character, Khun Ming.

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,700
I’m serious though.

63
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,533
I’m actually flirting with you.

64
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,566
Hm?

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,366
Isn’t that enough already?

66
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,166
That kiss was just roleplay.

67
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,866
But now—

68
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,033
I want a real one.

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,466
Hey—

70
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,166
We’ve got to pack tonight.

71
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,466
We’re flying back tomorrow.

72
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,466
- No! You’re not going anywhere! Come here!
- Hey—!

73
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:55,333
- Rin, let go!
- hehe!

74
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:57,066
Rin, the beer’s gonna spill!

75
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,500
What are you doing, you crazy pup—Rin!

76
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:04,100
It’s spilling—stop, stop! That’s enough!

77
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,100
What are you doing?!

78
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,800
Rin!

79
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,733
Ugh, people are watching!

I’m here!

Breakfast’s ready.

92
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:30,100
Look, I brought you some souvenirs!

93
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,133
- Ooh, you got sweets?
- And this one!

94
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:35,100
And this— a special gift just for you, P’Prim.

95
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,833
- Custom-made from Kitakyushu!
- Aww!

96
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,566
One of a kind—made by me.

97
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,400
That’s so cute!

98
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,466
Oh!

99
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,733
How is it?

100
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,433
Thank you!

101
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,400
You're so adorable.

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,933
So, how was—

103
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,933
your Japan trip? Fun?

104
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,133
So much fun!

105
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,266
I got to do a lot of research too.

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,066
The weather was perfect, and the food—amazing.

107
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,833
- Sounds dreamy!
- I wanna go too.

108
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,300
But still—nothing beats Thai basil stir-fry!

109
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,500
True that, I’ve never even been there!

110
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,133
So…

111
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:15,133
How are things with Khun Aokbab? Getting along better?

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Well—

113
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,600
It’s good. Everything’s smooth.

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,066
Hmm.

115
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,066
Ever since you started working with her—

116
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,033
you’ve really changed, you know?

117
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,833
Changed? I’m the same as always.

118
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,500
Maybe, but—

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,000
I can see you’re a lot happier.

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,233
And more thoughtful about others, too.

121
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,733
You’re exaggerating.

122
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,166
You’ve never bought me a gift before, have you?

123
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,200
See?

124
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,133
Really? Never?

125
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Nope, never.

126
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,800
Totally surprised—but hey,

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
thank you.

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,366
Uh—

129
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,033
Can I ask you something?

130
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,266
- About what?
- Hmm...

131
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,600
- Let’s say, hypothetically, hypothetically!—
- Okay.

132
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:07,800
If I like someone,

133
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,733
but I don’t know if they feel the same,

134
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,700
is there a way to tell what they think?

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Well…

136
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
It’s simple.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
If you care about them,

138
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,600
and they care about you too—

139
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,966
that means—

140
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,233
wow.

141
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,266
That’s it?

142
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,700
Yep.

143
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,833
Here!

144
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,333
Here it goes!

145
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,300
Eat up.

146
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,066
Hey, I think I’ll use some gimmicks—

147
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:28,400
inspired by the places Khun Rain and Khun Ming visited—

148
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,866
and blend them into the design.

149
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,400
I want that feeling to stay in their home when they’re together.

150
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,266
What do you think?

151
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,400
- I like it.
- Sounds good. What else did you bring back from the trip?

152
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,666
I feel like…

153
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:45,400
I need to pay more attention to what’s around me.

154
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,666
All this time,

155
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,900
I think I’ve overlooked something important.

156
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,866
The heart was right in front of me, but I couldn’t see it.

157
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,200
Are you talking about work—

158
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,800
or something else?

159
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,933
Work, obviously. What else would I mean?

160
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,433
Ever since you came back from Japan—

161
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,133
you’ve seemed different.

162
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,100
Hm.

163
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,633
You never talk about work during meals.

164
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:21,566
True.

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,933
Yeah!

166
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,000
if we wait till after, we’ll starve.

167
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,733
- So are you and Rin still going to stay at Khun Rain’s house?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,633
Probably for a little longer.

169
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,966
Until the design feels just right.

170
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,166
And that’s the only reason you’re staying? Work?

171
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,066
Or is there… something else?

172
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,266
Oh crap.

173
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,933
Khun Rain’s throwing a birthday party for Khun Ming.

174
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,266
He invited us. You coming?

175
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,500
Uh… not really my thing. You guys go ahead.

176
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,400
Where should we meet tomorrow, Sis?

177
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,100
[Sighs]

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,933
Chan! Chan!

179
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,466
- Huh?
- Hmm, the pork’s kinda sweet today, right?

180
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,000
Sweet pork? What?

181
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:37,733
Hey, we picked that out precisely, okay?

182
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:38,700
It’s food wasted, you know.

183
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,266
- Yeah...yeah.
- Even the mushrooms taste sweet.

184
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:47,033
- Hey, stop it!
- It’s pork tongue. We should stop teasing her, man. Let stop teasing her!

185
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,900
Did you get home yet, Sis?

186
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,166
I’ve finished packing.

187
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,033
I’m so excited.

188
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,333
Good night.

189
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,100
I think I need to start paying more attention to the things around me.

190
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,466
All this time—

191
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:28,966
I’ve overlooked something… even though the heart was right in front of me.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,533
But I just couldn’t see it.

193
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,766
Ever since you came back from Japan—

194
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,533
you’ve really changed.

We don’t have much time left at Khun Rain’s house.

209
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,866
We’d better hurry up and finish the project.

210
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,266
And if we can’t finish in time?

211
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,566
Where should we continue?

212
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,800
- Your place?
- My place.

213
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,966
Okay, and...

214
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,500
what if it gets late?

215
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,666
- Sleep in your...
- You can sleep in my room.

216
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,600
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

217
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,900
Are you okay?

218
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,100
Your hand…

219
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,700
Ah…

220
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,766
Sorry—

221
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,400
I didn’t mean to!

222
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,533
It’s okay.

223
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,566
I’m totally fine.

224
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,166
Fine about what?

225
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,400
Just… fine with everything.

226
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,700
Really. Don’t worry.

227
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,500
Okay?

228
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah.

229
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:43,133
What are you doing?

230
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,633
Isn’t that Khun Rain’s house?

231
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,666
Yeah.

232
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
What do you think if I stay at the office for a while?

233
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,366
Why would you do that?

234
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:23,933
I don’t think I can work properly.

235
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
I’m uneasy about this Khun Rain project.

236
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,100
You know our companies are rivals.

237
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,233
You don’t trust me, do you?

238
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,233
It’s not that—I just feel…

239
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,500
If we had our own house—

240
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,900
we’d each have our own workspace.

241
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,866
And we wouldn’t have to keep doubting each other like this.

242
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:42,866
But we don’t, Tis.

243
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:01,800
I’m sorry.

244
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,766
Please don’t be mad at me.

245
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,500
Still mad at me?

246
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:03,466
I’m not anymore.

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,733
What are you doing?

248
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,000
Hold still—don’t move or you’ll mess it up.

249
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:24,366
There, looks good.

250
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,633
I’m heading out.

251
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,800
Drive safely, and—

252
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,666
don’t stress too much about the house.

253
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,400
Okay.

254
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,166
Go on, get to work.

255
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,400
Love you.

256
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,066
Bye-bye.

257
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,866
Ugh, call center again—so persistent.

258
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:11,766
Hello?

259
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,700
You scammers who feeding off people’s misery.

260
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,133
You’re Khun Pad’s secretary, right, Khun Tertis?

261
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:18,466
Wow, you even know my job title now?

262
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,333
Of course. We’ve met quite a few times already.

263
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,866
Who is this?

264
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,700
This is Thee from Mind Space.

265
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,533
I just wanted to invite you out for lunch.

266
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,966
I have a proposal I’d like to discuss.

267
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,933
It might just help you and Khun Vee—

268
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,366
afford the house of your dreams.

269
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,666
Coffee’s here, my love.

270
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,833
Careful, it’s hot.

271
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,666
Thanks.

272
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Hey, sis—

273
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:24,233
I’ve been thinking about Khun Rain’s house.

274
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,533
What if we use Japanese home-building techniques?

275
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,900
And for the interior, add some Kitakyushu vibes.

276
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,333
I think Khun Rain and Khun Ming would love it.

277
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,466
I was thinking the same thing.

278
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,133
Really?

279
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,033
We are in sync, right?

280
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,733
What are you looking at?

281
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,433
Nothing. I wasn’t looking.

282
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,733
You feeling okay?

283
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,000
- You’ve got a fever? Let me check—
- Eh—

284
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,366
Eh— no, I’m fine.

285
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,533
It’s just the weather.

286
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:29,933
You look flushed though.

287
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,300
It’s hot!

288
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,633
Hmm.

289
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,700
Hey, sis—

290
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,133
We’ve been to Japan together for days.

291
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:44,366
So,

292
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,033
We’re pretty close already, right?

293
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,066
I guess so.

294
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:52,466
So, um—

295
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,433
the guest room ceiling is leaking.

296
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,500
Still not fixed.

297
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:01,033
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

298
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,700
The guest room

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,266
It’s leaking,

300
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,100
Uh-huh.

301
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,533
And when we sleep—

302
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,366
can I cuddle you?

303
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,366
What kind of question is that?

304
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,566
Are you crazy?

305
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,100
What? You’re so silly.

306
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,233
Where are you going? That’s mine!

307
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:35,500
Sorry!

308
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,866
You didn’t say no, so I’ll take that as a yes.

309
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,466
- Hello.
- Hi there.

310
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,166
Oh, thank you.

311
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,166
Hello.

312
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:00,566
Please, make yourself comfortable.

313
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,033
Hello, Khun Ming. Happy birthday.

314
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,366
Thank you so much.

315
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,333
Thanks again.

316
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:06,433
That’s so sweet of you.

317
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,866
Hello, Khun Rain, Khun Ming.

318
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,833
Hi there.

319
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:09,933
Happy birthday.

320
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,166
I carefully picked this birthday gift—

321
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,533
especially for you, Khun Ming.

322
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,800
Thank you, that’s so lovely.

323
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,200
About the house renovation design—

324
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,900
Is there any particular feature you’d like?

325
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,133
Or any details you’d like us to finalize, please let us know.

326
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:25,500
- Sure.
- Of course.

327
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,400
You really take good care of the clients, don’t you, Khun Thee?

328
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,533
Hello there.

329
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,066
- Hello.
- Hi.

330
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:35,966
Oh, you both came too, Khun Chan, Khun Pad?

331
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,566
Of course, we had to be here.

332
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:39,900
Why wouldn’t we?

333
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,200
Hey, guys! Check this out —

334
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,900
I’ve got something to show you!

335
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,700
What is it?

336
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,700
Whoa.

337
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,566
- It’s our company sign!
- Whoa!

338
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,900
Damn, that looks great.

339
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,933
Sammitr Co. (Three Brotherhood Co.) is gonna be huge, I’m telling you.

340
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:07,666
- Yeah.
- We’ll make it together. Our future’s bright.

341
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,666
Here, grab your glasses! Hold them up!

342
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,733
Let’s drink to this — we’ll never betray or abandon each other.

343
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:18,966
- I’m counting on you, seniors!
- Cheers!

344
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,600
What the hell did you do, Thee?!

345
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,766
- How could you make a deal behind our backs?!
- Why didn’t you tell us first?!

346
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:27,766
I already talked to the client! What was I supposed to do?

347
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:30,866
You know damn well that budget isn’t enough to finish the project.

348
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
I’ve already taken it.

349
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,233
You just have to make it work.

350
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,466
How can you be so damn irresponsible?

351
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,400
You’re always bragging about—

352
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,300
How good you are

353
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,166
prove it like you said!

354
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,533
What the hell are you saying, man?!

355
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
Hey, what are you doing?!

356
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,966
If you’re gonna keep deciding everything on your own,

357
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,166
We’re done. We quit.

358
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:52,866
Hey, you can’t just walk away like that!

359
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:54,533
- I already accepted the job!
- Enough!

360
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,000
What a stupid decision, man.

361
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,266
- I don’t want to work with you anymore.
- Where are you going?!

362
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,600
I’m out. Let go of me.

363
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,000
I already accepted... Fuck whatever!

364
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,733
Go ahead, just leave!

365
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,433
Just leave! All of you!

366
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:09,566
Fine! I’ll do it myself! Don’t come crawling back!

367
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,966
I told you, didn’t I?

368
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,566
It was never going to work.

369
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,366
No wonder they dropped the deal.

370
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,366
If you came here just to talk shit,

371
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
then get lost.

372
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,433
You’ve got some nerve, huh?

373
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,900
We quit—

374
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,733
and now you still took our project to finish it yourself.

375
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
What did you expect me to do?!

376
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,700
The company was falling apart after you left!

377
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:56,233
I did everything I could to keep it alive!

378
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Tell me—

379
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
where was I wrong?!

380
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,000
- You bastard!
- Chan!

381
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,200
You hit my brother, huh?!

382
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,033
- Shit—

383
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,733
- Chan! What the hell are you doing?!

384
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,800
- You want some?!

385
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,333
- Stop it! Enough!

386
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
You wanna hit me, you asshole?!

387
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,566
- You—
- Shit!

388
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,566
- Chan, that’s enough! I said stop, Chan!

389
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:35,033
- Stop! Stop!

390
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,000
- You think you’re tough, huh?!
- Damn it!

391
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,566
- Stop! Both of you!

392
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,133
I said stop!

393
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,166
- You—
- That’s enough!

394
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,933
Stop it, both of you!

395
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,500
Have you been here long?

396
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,300
We just got here, actually.

397
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,766
Perfect timing, too.

398
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:12,866
Oh—here, this is for you, Khun Ming.

399
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,566
- Thank you.
- Wishing you lots of happiness.

400
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:17,100
Just having you here makes me happy already. Thank you so much.

401
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,466
- It’s my pleasure.

402
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,566
The dessert’s here!

403
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Thanks.

404
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,100
[Sigh]

405
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:40,733
it’s just work.

406
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,600
Kidding.

407
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,766
If you’re gonna bring up what happened earlier,

408
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,800
I’m not answering.

409
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:02,833
P'Prim said I should get the HPV vaccine—

410
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:04,433
Cervical cancer prevention.

411
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,866
Come with me, please? I’m scared of needles.

412
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,133
Or… we could go together!

413
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Eh—no way, I’m not going.

414
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,966
Are you trying to jinx me or what?

415
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:15,533
I’m not!

416
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:18,533
I’m just worried about you.
I want us to stay together for a long time.

417
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:22,500
So…

418
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,866
about that cuddling—

419
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:27,833
Answer, hurry!

420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,633
No answer means permission granted,

421
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:35,866
Okay

422
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,966
Hold on, I’ve got to take this call.

423
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,766
Hey, Stop calling me.

424
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,300
We’re not in a position to be talking like this.

425
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,733
You’re not coming to the party?

426
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Didn’t you get what I said?

427
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:12,033
Stop calling me.

428
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,233
Why can’t I call you?

429
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,400
We haven’t even broken up yet.

430
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,466
I still want to talk to you.

431
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:56,600
I’m looking forward to seeing your work.

432
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,933
You all seem very dedicated.

433
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,966
Yes, especially since Khun Rin and Khun Aokbab

434
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,333
even moved into the house themselves.

435
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,666
I’m excited and can’t wait to see the design.

436
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,566
Yes.

437
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,533
How long have they been there?

438
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,166
For a little while now.

439
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,066
Please, make yourselves at home.

440
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,533
Hello. Thank you so much for coming.

441
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,500
When do we have to pay them?

442
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,100
I’ll take care of it right away.

443
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,033
Okay.

444
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,333
What’s up? Something wrong?

445
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,033
What’s the matter, hmm?

446
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:14,400
You know you can always talk to me, right?

447
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,166
I…

448
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,666
It’s just…

449
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:33,533
We shouldn’t keep secrets from each other.

450
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,666
I have a proposal for you.

451
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,800
It might let you and Vee—

452
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,833
Finally buy your dream home.

453
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,600
What is it?

454
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:05,533
Are you okay?

455
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,433
Nothing.

456
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,766
Can you make me some porridge? I’m hungry.

457
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,033
Now?

458
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,100
Please… make it for me.

459
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,833
This house has so many little corners.

460
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,633
It makes cleaning really difficult.

461
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,566
Even with housekeepers, I doubt they can get every spot.

462
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,066
This one—

463
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
The kitchen.

464
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:37,466
I think...

465
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,033
We should have a center island like this.

466
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,666
Move the range hood to the center.

467
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,133
So when they cook—

468
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,533
Khun Ming can reach everything easily.

469
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:50,166
Like this.

470
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:53,866
What do you think?

471
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,266
Mmm, that’s nice.

472
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:07,366
When they’re cooking together—

473
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,700
They can do it like this too.

474
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,000
What are you doing here?

475
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,300
I’m going to stay here.

476
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:58,833
No way.

477
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,400
You’re not welcome here.

478
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,266
If you have the right to stay in this house—

479
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,666
then so do I.

480
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,300
I already asked Khun Rain for permission.

481
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,733
This house has quite a few damaged areas, doesn’t it?

482
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,100
Just from the outside, I can already see leaks and water damage.

483
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,666
I bet there are more inside.

484
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Have you checked them yet?

485
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:32,133
Already did.

486
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,833
Every bedroom’s leaking right now.

487
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,966
There’s no room left for anyone else.

488
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Then I’ll just sleep with Aokbab.

489
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:42,066
We used to share a room all the time when we traveled together.

490
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,200
Unfortunately, P'Aokbab’s room isn’t available right now.

491
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:48,833
Because I’m sleeping next to her.

492
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,466
We even cuddle when we sleep.

493
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:56,866
I think once you’ve finished your inspection, you should head back.

494
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,833
I’m staying overnight.

495
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,766
I can sleep on the sofa.

496
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,800
Fine, do whatever you want.

497
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,333
Aokbab—

498
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,500
Show me around the house.

499
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,233
I’ll take you.

500
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,100
I’ll show you every single corner.

501
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,733
How’s that sound, Auntie Mind?

502
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:20,766
Let’s go.

503
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:32,333
After you, Auntie.

504
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,466
I know what you're trying to do.

505
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,733
But let me tell you—it’s not going to work.

506
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,666
I’m just here to work.

507
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,633
I want everything to be fair.

508
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:12,866
That’s all.

509
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,400
Fair?

510
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,066
You mean, farewell?

511
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,433
The only thing P'Aokbab still has for you—

512
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:26,233
is hatred. Nothing else.

513
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:27,733
You should know that.

514
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,000
And you think she loves you?

515
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,866
I know Aokbab very well.

516
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,766
She’s someone who—

517
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,200
Always knows what she likes and doesn’t like.

518
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,166
If she hesitates—

519
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:51,366
it means she doesn’t like you.

520
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,100
No matter how hard you try to care about her—

521
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,200
she doesn’t like younger people.

522
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,966
Do you want shrimp, sis? I’ll peel it for you.

523
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,966
Mhm.

524
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,733
Crab from the same place we used to go to.

525
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:02,233
I’ll peel it for you.

526
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:12,800
Try it, see if it still tastes the same.

527
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,200
Sis—

528
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,800
Have this shrimp instead — I peeled it for you.

529
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,000
Shrimp’s better anyway.

530
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,566
Aokbab likes crab.

531
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,233
Not always.

532
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:33,966
Maybe she doesn’t like the same old things anymore.

533
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,966
New things might only taste good the first time.

534
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,566
- And how would you know?
- Rin.

535
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:40,466
If you’re done eating—

536
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,333
Go work upstairs first.

537
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,066
- I’m not done yet.
- Rin.

538
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:49,966
Go.

539
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:03,866
I’ll peel it for you.

540
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,966
I’ll ask you straight — what do you want?

541
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,066
I want things to go back to how they were.

542
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,066
It’s not the same anymore, P'Mind.

543
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,366
How could it not be the same?

544
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:31,666
We never even broke up.

545
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,700
You still can’t forget her, can you?

546
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,066
What about me?

547
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,933
What am I to you?

548
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,833
Just your subordinate?

549
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:52,800
Answer me.

550
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:56,966
Between us…

551
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,000
What else could it possibly be?

552
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,866
I have a proposal for you.

553
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,833
A proposal? What kind?

554
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,700
I want you to report every move Jinta makes.

555
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,433
You and Vee want to buy a house, don’t you?

556
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,500
I can make that happen this year.

557
00:44:35,766 --> 00:44:36,800
Okay, All of you, come and have some!

558
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:39,800
Hurry up, it’s your favorite!

559
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,066
- Don’t worry.
- There’s plenty.

560
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,766
Tertis, come join us for dessert.

561
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,133
Yong’s gonna eat it all.

562
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,600
Huh?

563
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,666
It’s okay—

564
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,700
I’m not hungry.

565
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,500
Don’t you think Tertis is acting strange?

566
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,066
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

567
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:11,966
Yes, P’Thee.

568
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:14,233
How’s it going? Got anything yet?

569
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,733
I’ve only been here one day. Haven’t gotten much so far.

570
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,100
If there’s nothing, just come back.

571
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,100
No point wasting time.

572
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Uh…

573
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,333
Let me stay another two days. Then I’ll go back.

574
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:32,066
Be honest with me.

575
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:34,866
You still love Aokbab, don’t you?

576
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,666
Don’t let that ruin the job.

577
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:47,800
It’s nothing.

578
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:49,733
Work is still work.

579
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:45,766
Why are you drawing me?

580
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:00,066
Well…

581
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:03,033
When we used to travel together, I always drew you like this.

582
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey.

583
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,233
P’Mind, are you drawing me?

584
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,333
Yeah.

585
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:43,233
Then I’ll…

586
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:45,566
be your model, okay?

587
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,133
Which pose should I do?

588
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,733
How about this?

589
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,333
You really don’t love me anymore?

590
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:47,866
Aokbab…

591
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,300
You really don’t love me anymore?

592
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:57,733
- Wait! ///- Hey!

593
00:49:58,233 --> 00:49:59,633
Don’t take advantage of her!

594
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:08,733
I’m not letting the person who took my first kiss—

595
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:10,600
—be with someone else!

596
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,700
You— / Sis—

597
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:14,933
I’ve got an idea for Khun Rain’s house!

598
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:17,500
We don’t need to stay here anymore.

599
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:18,966
Let’s go.

600
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,900
But Aokbab, you know…

601
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,700
that I still love you, right?

602
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:47,633
Vee, I don’t think this is it.

603
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:49,666
It’s not what we discussed at all.

604
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,166
You’re planning to change the team in charge of Khun Rain’s house, right?

605
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,066
I’m Mind, an architect from Mind Space.

606
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,133
And today’s concept is—

607
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:02,933
“Love Life Balance.”

608
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,966
Hey—this is our design!

609
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:09,933
This is the exact same layout as ours!

610
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,933
- What the hell
- How does she have our blueprint?!

611
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:28,266
[Music]

612
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:34,033
Love — I don’t know when it began, but it’s already here.

613
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:38,366
I don’t really understand why… but it had to be you.

614
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,266
I don’t know why — just seeing your smile feels like a beautiful painting.

615
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,266
Like colors filling my heart with clarity.

616
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,500
We might not always fit perfectly,

617
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,800
But still, I just want to stay close to you.

618
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,433
You feel the same way, don’t you?

619
00:53:01,466 --> 00:53:08,133
Just having you by my side makes everything perfect today.

620
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,800
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you.

621
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:20,000
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

622
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,733
The one I choose today… is you.

623
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:56,000
From not knowing my own heart, I found that you’re the love I’ve been searching for all my life.

624
00:53:56,033 --> 00:54:02,133
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

625
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,000
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you.

626
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,966
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

627
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,166
The one I choose today is you.

628
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:22,466
How should we love each other?

629
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,366
Let’s design it with our hearts.

630
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:31,066
Because that’s how we’ll build a life together.

631
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:38,900
From now on, every day will be colored with our love.

632
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:44,966
Just having you by my side makes everything perfect today.

633
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,266
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you (the answer is you).

634
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:56,966
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

635
00:54:56,966 --> 00:55:02,733
The one I choose today is you.

636
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:08,133
I want you right here beside me.

637
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:12,800
Always.
