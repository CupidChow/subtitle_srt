1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,160
You two must get married first.

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Get married?

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,920
Go back to where you first met. Start from there.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,000
There’s no ring, sis.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,320
I’ve always known you were trying to buy me a ring.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,120
– I wanted a simple platinum ring.
– Just that already makes me so happy.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,880
Then… can I propose to you with a drawing?

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,560
Will you marry me?

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,600
My love.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
Thank you.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,760
For creating this love with me.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,560
Babe.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Yess?

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,760
Don’t forget my drawing tools, okay?

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
And also…

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,040
The anniversary card you wrote me.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
Keep it safe… I don’t want it to get lost.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,520
I know. I already put it in a box.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
And labeled it.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,240
– “Tertis’ treasure." Will never lose
– Ohh…

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,480
Then I should put you in the box too.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,440
– You’re my treasure, after all.
– Oh wow…

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
Afraid I’ll disappear?

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,520
Mhm…

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,720
Where could I ever go?

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,280
It took us so long to finally meet.

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
Destiny brought us together.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
I really believe that.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
Otherwise… we would’ve never ended up loving each other like this.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
[Back then…]

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,160
[I never believed in that stuff.]
Yes.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
I just got home.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
I’ll revise it and send it right away.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
[The only thing I believed in…]
Okay.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,880
[…was hard work.]

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
[For the people I love.]

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,280
Yes, Mom.

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,760
I’ll transfer the money right away.

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,200
Don’t worry about the money.

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,280
I’ll take care of it.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
It’s okay, it’s okay.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,400
After we hang up, I'll go take some medicine, okay?

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, goodbye.

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
[But who would’ve thought…]

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,080
[…that an illness would lead me to…]

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,920
[…my true love.]

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,840
I moved the deadline forward. Can you finish it tonight?

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,600
Yes, I can.
I had a small issue last night.

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,840
I’ll send it right away. I’m sorry.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,840
When you get home, you need to take your medicine, okay?

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,280
And drink lots of water.

52
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,520
The medicine will help you fight that mean fever.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,840
And once you get better—

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,040
You have to eat healthy food too, okay?

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,720
Understand?

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,280
So your body gets stronger.

57
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,920
And I’ve got candy for my little warrior.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,600
Ms. Waleerat?

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,920
Please come inside.

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,560
I have a treat for you, sweetheart.

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
– Thank you.
– Thank youuu.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,760
So cute… kids are adorable.

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,480
Your initial blood test today looks normal.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
Only your electrolytes are slightly low.

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,520
As for the dizziness—

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,840
It’s likely due to what you described:

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,280
working too hard, lack of rest, and not drinking enough water.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,600
For now, there’s nothing serious to worry about.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
But I recommend drinking more water.

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,600
And getting enough rest.

71
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,960
I’ll prescribe some medicine for your symptoms.

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
And I’ll give you electrolytes as well.

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Okay, doctor.

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,160
And most importantly—

75
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,360
Try to adjust your habits.

76
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,720
– Yes, doctor. Thank you.
– Sure.

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,560
[MUSIC]

78
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,810
[MUSIC] You’re my midnight sun in the sky

79
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,010
No matter how long, you’re glowing through the night

80
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,130
Warm like daylight soft and kind, never burning too bright

81
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,410
Holding you this close, I never need anything more

82
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,210
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

83
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,290
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

84
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,460
Staying right here by my side

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,340
Chasing all the darkness deep inside

86
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,620
Would you be my midnight sun forever...

87
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,760
In my life? [MUSIC]

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,830
Are you looking for something?

89
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,430
No, not at all

90
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,910
Then please have a seat while we prepare your medication.

91
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,270
Okay.

92
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,300
Fabulous.

93
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,780
Break, break, break!

94
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,860
Hey, what time is the call tomorrow?

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,740
Standby at 9:30.

96
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,420
The performance starts at 11, but we need to be there at 7.

97
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,940
To allow time for makeup and hair.

98
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,500
Damn, 7 a.m.?

99
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,820
– That’s so early.
– I’m gonna die.

100
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,420
Don’t complain.

101
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,980
Jobs are already hard to come by.

102
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,420
Oh, and next week—

103
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
Don’t forget to get the HPV shot I told you guys about.

104
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,260
Okayyy.

105
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,780
Do I really have to?

106
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,820
I mean, it’s not like I’m into girls—you know that.

107
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,500
That has nothing to do with it.

108
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,620
HPV doesn’t discriminate by gender, you know.

109
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,340
Male–female, female–female, male–male…

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,020
Anyone can catch it — and more importantly,

111
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,460
this virus…

112
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,460
can lead to cancer if you get infected.

113
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,980
Prevention is better than cure.

114
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,100
The sooner you get vaccinated, the better.

115
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,260
It’s only three shots.

116
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,420
Piece of cake.

117
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,540
Okay.

118
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,700
Yes ma’am, got it.

119
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,140
Sure.

120
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,900
Tertis dear,

121
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,020
We need to cancel tomorrow’s event for now.

122
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,940
Shit.

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
What’s going on?

124
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,700
They just texted to cancel tomorrow’s job.

125
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,300
Why are they telling us now?

126
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,340
So we wasted the studio fee for nothing.

127
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Should we look for another gig?

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,100
Tis.

129
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Did she reply yet?

130
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,060
Ugh…

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,460
She hasn’t even read it.

132
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,660
God…

133
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,860
Come on, girls.

134
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Just think of it as not having to wake up early tomorrow.

135
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,300
If you can stay this positive…

136
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,380
You’ll end up sleeping in every day at this rate.

137
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,740
Ugh… can’t find a full-time job.

138
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,260
My side gigs keep getting canceled.

139
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,300
Can I just wake up rich tomorrow?

140
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,180
In that case—

141
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,180
Go find a rich guy tonight.

142
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,260
Then you’ll wake up rich tomorrow, babe.

143
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,460
Are you insane?

144
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,980
You know I hate that.

145
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I know.

146
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,980
Just in case you change your mind. Miss “True Love Believer”—

147
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,060
might switch teams once her bank account hits zero.

148
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,340
If I’m broke, I’ll just find work. There’s plenty out there.

149
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,540
Ugh, and what about love? You gonna make a move or not?

150
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,020
No thanks.

151
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,340
If it’s meant to come, it’ll come.

152
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,500
So you’re waiting for destiny to deliver true love to you or what, Tis?

153
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,860
Maybe it’s somewhere out there.

154
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,460
Or maybe…

155
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,500
My soulmate hasn’t even been born yet.

156
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,620
Girls!

157
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,300
Try this app. Seriously.

158
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,380
Let me tell you something.

159
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,020
I met my current boyfriend from this app.

160
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,620
Oh my god, no.

161
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,020
Then that’s not destiny anymore!
Oh come on!

162
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820
You’ll never know if you don’t try.

163
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Destiny might show up in a new form, you know.

164
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,620
Like… AI matching and stuff, babe.

165
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,500
Trust me.

166
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,460
Yeah.

167
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,140
Just take a look first. Look—

168
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,380
Look at these guys, so handsome.

169
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,380
This one—

170
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,700
A sweet, sincere cutie.
What—

171
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,020
And this one— abs for days!
Oh my god—

172
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,740
Hot.

173
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,100
I told you guys, that’s not my type!

174
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Ughhh
Girls, he’s TOO much.

175
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,020
Who would even know?
Look, look! This one! Another one! Here—this one!

176
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,580
Here you go.

177
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Thank you.

178
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
– How are you, gorgeous?
– I’m good.

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,180
What would you like to order?

180
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,260
Matcha latte, no syrup please.

181
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,500
– Okay, matcha latte, no sweet.
– Mm.

182
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,580
Coming right up.

183
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,580
[I have a café I go to all the time.]

184
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
[But we never once noticed each other.]

185
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,140
Okay.

186
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,700
Hello? I’m here.

187
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,180
- Where are you?
- So for this.

188
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,620
How would you like the background to be?

189
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,780
- Like how?
- Thought you said you were almost here.

190
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,940
- Uh…
- When will you actually get here?

191
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,060
- Could it look like a brick texture?

192
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,420
- Sure, and—
- Are you on your way or not?

193
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,460
What kind of texture do you want?

194
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,860
See? You’re late.

195
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,140
Thirty minutes isn’t enough for anything. Hurry up!

196
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,780
- Okay…
[We used to be so close…]

197
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,940
- Hey, hurry!
[Yet we never truly met.]

198
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
Oh—

199
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,900
I almost forgot.

200
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Come here, take it here. This angle is perfect.

201
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,820
One, two, snap!

202
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,860
Damn, what a pity.

203
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,700
Someone in the back got in the shot.

204
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,020
Want another one? I’ll take it for you.

205
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,820
[It felt like… it just wasn’t the time yet.]

206
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,020
[Not the moment that destiny had written for us.]

207
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,740
Back then, I almost gave up, you know?

208
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,180
I thought I’d never see you again.

209
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,300
But we eventually did, right?

210
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,140
You should thank me, you know.

211
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,420
For downloading that app.

212
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,500
I don’t usually use apps like that.

213
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,220
Then why did you suddenly try it?

214
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,580
I don’t know.

215
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,860
Something just nudged me, I guess.

216
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,820
But it brought us together, didn’t it?

217
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,980
Yeah.

218
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,540
I never asked you this.

219
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,260
How many people did you chat with before me?

220
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,220
I already told you.

221
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,660
You were the first person I ever tapped the heart for.

222
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
And the only one I talked to.

223
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,420
My first ever, you know?

224
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,340
Which one?

225
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Tell us.

226
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,620
Which one? Come on.

227
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,620
Here you go.

228
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,220
Excuse me.

229
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,260
Today…

230
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,260
The singer who plays guitar…

231
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,580
The one who sings really well… isn’t coming?

232
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,900
Oh—

233
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,540
She’s off today.

234
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,980
Sorry for the inconvenience.

235
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,700
Thank you.

236
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,380
Hey, I’m going to the bathroom.

237
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
– I’ll go too.
– Let's go.

238
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,660
Coming?

239
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,980
Hey, I wanna go too!

240
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,300
– What?
– Bathroom run.

241
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,980
Hurry back.

242
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,500
Try this app.

243
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,060
My current boyfriend—

244
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,260
I met him from this app.

245
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,380
Destiny might come in a new form, you know.

246
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,900
AI might match you two.

247
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,860
Trust me.

248
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,380
She’s a singer…

249
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,020
And an architect too?

250
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,620
Hi! I’m Tertis

251
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,900
Hi! I’m Vee.

252
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,540
Whoa—

253
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,780
She replied so fast… like she's guarding the chat.

254
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,220
Is she a flirt or what?

255
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,700
You’re the one who plays music at the bar—

256
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,100
Right?

257
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,500
[And at that moment, destiny…]

258
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,900
[…opened the path for the two of us to meet.]

259
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,900
You’ve been working so much.

260
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,100
Take a break and think of me too, okay?

261
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,220
I don't need a break to miss you.

262
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,420
No need for syrup—it's sweet enough already.

263
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,140
Ugh, your chat keeps popping. Go reply!

264
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,500
Sorry—

265
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,620
See?

266
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,900
She’s really head over heel.

267
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,220
Hello, auntie.

268
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,620
Oh, hello dear.

269
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,940
Here, let me help you pick this up.

270
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,780
You haven’t come by in a while.

271
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
What are you praying for today?

272
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,740
Well…

273
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I’m not asking for much.

274
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,340
Oh my—praying for love, right?

275
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,980
How did you know?

276
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,780
With that glowing face? What else would it be?

277
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,620
So what are you asking for?

278
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,540
Praying to get married?

279
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,260
Oh, auntie—

280
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,980
Let us date first. We haven’t even met in person!

281
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,100
Marriage is too fast.

282
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,900
Then go and meet her in person, dear.

283
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,180
Destiny doesn’t come around often, you know.

284
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,180
I’ll ask her out now, okay?

285
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,140
P’Vee, are you free this evening? Would you like to have dinner together?

286
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,420
Yes.

287
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,820
Of course.

288
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,740
Always yes.

289
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,180
Thank you, goddess.

290
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,300
So miraculous.

291
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,260
Please bless this love of mine to come true.

292
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,100
Amen.

293
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,660
Have you waited long?

294
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,300
P’Vee.

295
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,900
Not long, Tertis.

296
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,020
I just got here.

297
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,180
You’re so cute.

298
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,660
You too.

299
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,980
Thank you for dinner today.

300
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,620
It’s okay, I’m happy to.

301
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,020
Tertis, you know…

302
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,820
I’m really happy.

303
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,500
Thank you for asking me to meet.

304
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,740
But I didn’t even do anything.

305
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,100
Just the fact that we got to meet…

306
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,540
To talk…

307
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,860
And spend time together…

308
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,540
For me…

309
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,900
That alone is more than enough.

310
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,140
Well then…

311
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,140
I’ll get going then.

312
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,500
Tertis.

313
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,100
Yes?

314
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,420
Um…

315
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,460
Tertis…

316
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,620
Tertis, would you like to be my girlfriend?

317
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,340
Huh?

318
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,380
You don’t have to answer me right away.

319
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,820
I just…

320
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,980
N-no, it’s okay. Don’t worry about it.

321
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,660
I don’t want to go home alone anymore.

322
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,820
Huh?

323
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
From now on…

324
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,500
P’Vee, will you send me home every day?

325
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,500
[And in the end, we finally became a couple.]

326
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,700
Here you go.

327
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,220
So, how is it?

328
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,220
Do you really like it that much?

329
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,860
I love it so much.

330
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,580
Then come have it every day.

331
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,940
I’m serious, you know.

332
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
Would you like to move in with me?

333
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,260
You mean…

334
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,660
Sleep here with you…

335
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,340
Every day?

336
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,220
No, that’s not what I meant.

337
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,100
I meant… come live here.

338
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,940
Do you even need to ask?

339
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,100
For real?

340
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,180
You’re not lying to me, right, Tis?

341
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Of course.

342
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,380
But…

343
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,500
No matter what happens…

344
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,180
We must never let go of each other.

345
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,420
I won’t.

346
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,900
– Promise?
– Promise.

347
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,820
[Our love had never once faltered since we got together.]

348
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,620
Yes.

349
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,460
Sure.

350
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,580
Just let me know when you want me to start.

351
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,060
I’ll be working at Jinta Architect.

352
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,900
What if our companies end up competing…

353
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,180
Hmm.

354
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,460
If that really happens…

355
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,100
…then we’d have to break up.

356
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,180
I already sealed it with a kiss.

357
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,660
I’m not breaking up with you, no matter what.

358
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,020
[Who would’ve thought...something we joked about…]

359
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,900
[…would turn into reality.]

360
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,860
[We ended up working at rival companies.]

361
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,380
[And they hated each other.]

362
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,380
We agreed, didn’t we?

363
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,660
That we wouldn’t talk about work details.

364
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,980
Come on—let's go play in the water.

365
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,700
I love you.

366
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,220
I love you too, P’Vee.

367
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,380
[We believed in our love completely.]

368
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,940
[No matter what obstacles came our way.]

369
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,420
[But then, destiny sent us another test.]

370
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,580
[And a big one, too.]

371
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,940
Oh—

372
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,340
Sorry.

373
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,020
– P’Vee?
– Love.

374
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
What a coincidence.

375
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,380
How many years has it been since we last met?

376
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,300
Right?

377
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,100
How have you been? Doing well?

378
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,220
I’m doing good.

379
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,020
And you? Still working at the same place?

380
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,020
Yeah, I’m still there.

381
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,580
And you graduated already, right?

382
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,700
I just finished my master’s. I’m job hunting now.

383
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,700
Oh—do you want to work at Mind Space? I can help.

384
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,260
Babe.

385
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,860
Coming.

386
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,900
Not eating?

387
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,100
Isn’t this your favorite?

388
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,860
Guess it’s not as good as your little “Love,” huh?

389
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
We just know each other.

390
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,660
Know each other—or used to date?

391
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,660
If she’s your ex…

392
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,500
Then it’s more than “just knowing,” isn’t it?

393
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,220
Tis…

394
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,940
We broke up years ago.

395
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,860
And we haven’t talked ever since.

396
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,260
So you admit it now?

397
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,940
You only tell me because I pushed you?

398
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,500
Why didn’t you tell me from the start—

399
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,820
—that you had a girlfriend before?

400
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,900
Tis… I’m in my twenties.

401
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,780
Of course I’ve had relationships.

402
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,900
But I’ve never had one!

403
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,500
Then what do you want me to do?

404
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,820
You still have to ask? If you can’t figure it out—

405
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,380
—then don’t come cuddling me at night.

406
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Tis…

407
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,100
Don’t be ridiculous.

408
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,100
Yeah.

409
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,860
I am being ridiculous.

410
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,340
So I’ll go be ridiculous somewhere else.

411
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,580
Hey—where are you going?

412
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,140
Don’t follow me.

413
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,420
If you follow me, I’ll be mad.

414
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,060
P’Man.

415
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,020
Did Tertis come here today?

416
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Haven’t seen her.

417
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,260
Thank you.

418
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,140
Mm-hmm.

419
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,060
Last time I came here wishing for love, and it came true.

420
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,180
Please help me find my love again this time.

421
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,540
Please let me find her… please…

422
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,500
Ouch.

423
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,500
Tertis!

424
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,820
Miraculous!!

425
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,220
Let me see.

426
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,620
Where does it hurt?

427
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,020
Let me check.

428
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,460
Why did you throw that at me?!

429
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,420
I told you not to follow me!

430
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,140
Why did you follow me anyway?!

431
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,140
How could I not follow you?

432
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,380
My girlfriend disappeared on me.

433
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,500
And you—

434
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,500
Why are you here?

435
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,220
I wasn’t planning for you to see me.

436
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,260
I just… followed you secretly.

437
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,620
Wait—

438
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,780
You’ve been following me this whole time?

439
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,460
Well…

440
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,020
I wasn’t gonna let you find me that easily.

441
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,860
Tis…

442
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,940
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

443
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,180
Don’t ever do this again, okay?

444
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,740
I’m sorry…

445
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,940
I’m sorry too.

446
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,020
For calling you ridiculous earlier.

447
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,420
I didn’t mean it like that.

448
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,180
Can you forgive me?

449
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,140
I was being ridiculous too.

450
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,220
I’m sorry…

451
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,980
But do you know how much I love you?

452
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,100
And how worried I was?

453
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,180
[The hardships only made our love stronger.]

454
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,380
[If destiny brought us together—]

455
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
[—then I will never]

456
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,500
[let this person go.]

457
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,900
Do you believe me now?

458
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,140
That destiny really exists?

459
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,180
I have something to confess.

460
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,420
Hm?

461
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,460
Actually… I’ve believed in it for a long time.

462
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,140
Otherwise why would I go pray at the shrine?

463
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,780
Hmph.

464
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,940
Wait—

465
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,820
Did you trick me?

466
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,140
You’re such a little troublemaker, aren’t you?

467
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,340
You know what I think?

468
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Destiny—

469
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,180
It’s just like when we were—

470
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,380
—house hunting.

471
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,780
You never know which house—

472
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,820
—is meant to be our.

473
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,740
Not until—

474
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,700
You stand in front of it and see it with your own eyes.

475
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,020
That’s when—

476
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,460
You realize this house—

477
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
—is the one for us.

478
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,340
Thank you, destiny…

479
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,620
…for bringing us together.

480
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,740
P’Vee…

481
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,540
Do we really have to role-play like P’Aokbab and Rin did?

482
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,820
Of course we do.

483
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,300
You’re the one who told me to.

484
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,300
You said if we want our love to turn out beautifully like theirs—

485
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,460
—then we should give it a try.

486
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,700
Fine…

487
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
Shall we start?

488
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,180
P’Vee…

489
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,380
What are you looking at? Why are you smiling like that?

490
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,180
It’s nothing.

491
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,460
Hey, look at that!

492
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,220
P’Vee…

493
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,100
Please marry me?

494
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,940
[Thank you, P’Aokbab and Rin—]

495
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,820
[—for showing us how beautiful love can be.]

496
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,620
[Maybe our story began with destiny.]

497
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,340
[The destiny that brought us together.]

498
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,980
[But from now on—]

499
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,420
[I want our story—]

500
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,300
[—to be more than just dsetiny.]

501
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,740
[I want to write it myself—]

502
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,460
[with our own hearts.]

503
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,340
– Thank you.
– Thank you.

504
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,720
[MUSIC] Midnight’s near, just a few more minutes away

505
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,540
But my eyes still find their way to you every day

506
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,590
Cause the lights around me shimmer endlessly

507
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,140
But none of them shine as bright as you for me

508
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,980
When you walk right in, my heartbeat stops in place

509
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,810
Feels like you turn the darkest night into day

510
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,150
Never met anyone, not a single one who

511
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,980
Feels like you

512
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,780
Cause you

513
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,120
Are

514
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,540
A Wonder

515
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,700
One that’s rare and true

516
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,890
You’re my midnight sun in the sky

517
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,850
No matter how long, you’re glowing through the night

518
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,160
Warm like daylight soft and kind, never burning too bright

519
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,470
Holding you this close, I never need anything more

520
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:40,100
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

521
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

522
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,490
Staying right here by my side

523
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,370
Chasing all the darkness deep inside

524
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,980
Would you be my midnight sun forever...

525
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,710
In my life?

526
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,220
Far away, if you try to find one in the sky

527
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,500
That midnight sun exists only in dreams passing by

528
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,160
But I found something real the moment you came near—when I met you

529
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,050
Cause you

530
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,850
Are

531
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,980
A Wonder

532
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,910
One that’s rare and true

533
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,980
You’re my midnight sun in the sky

534
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,300
No matter how long, you’re glowing through the night

535
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,380
Warm like daylight soft and kind, never burning too bright

536
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,680
Holding you this close, I never need anything more

537
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,320
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

538
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,520
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

539
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,670
Staying right here by my side

540
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,610
Chasing all the darkness deep inside

541
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,820
Would you be my midnight sun forever...

542
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,840
In my life?

543
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,780
You’re my midnight sun in the sky

544
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,980
No matter how long, you’re glowing through the night

545
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,100
Warm like daylight soft and kind, never burning too bright

546
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,380
Holding you this close, I never need anything more

547
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,180
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

548
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,260
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

549
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,430
Staying right here by my side

550
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,310
Chasing all the darkness deep inside

551
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,590
Would you be my midnight sun forever...

552
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,390
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

553
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,470
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

554
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,640
Staying right here by my side

555
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,520
Chasing all the darkness deep inside

556
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,800
Would you be my midnight sun forever...

557
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,980
In my life? [MUSIC]
