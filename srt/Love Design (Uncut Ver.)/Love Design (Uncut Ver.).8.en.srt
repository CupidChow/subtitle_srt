1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,930
So… do you guys know who's the mole yet?

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
We need to catch them red-handed.

3
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,000
Auntie, you take the hard disk and give it to Thee.

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,800
But don’t let him know you’ve been caught.

5
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,370
We won’t take action against you.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,200
Uh… so does that mean we’re throwing away the first design?

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,900
No. We’re not throwing it away.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,430
We’re going to use it to bait Mind Space.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,570
As for Khun Parat’s project—

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,900
let’s compete fair and square.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,130
Looks like we finally get to compete for real this time.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,370
You’re competing with me, too.

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,070
Hello.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,070
I’m Mind, from Mind Space.

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,870
We can’t deny that in this era…

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,070
technology is becoming more and more a part of our daily lives.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,430
It’s practically a part of us now, and it’s clear that…

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,800
our world — and the way we live — is about to change.

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,470
Which brings us to today’s concept —

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
Smart Hotel.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
A hotel that brings together technologies of the future…

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,600
to provide the highest level of convenience for every guest.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,300
Sis.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,700
She's not using the design that they take from us.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
But it still maintains the distinctiveness—

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,400
—the luxury and perfection—

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
—that define The Eraside.

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,970
In an age where privacy matters most,

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,900
The Eraside will minimize the use of staff—

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,070
—while still catering to every guest’s needs, twenty-four hours a day.

31
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,900
To deliver true comfort and happiness for every guest.

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
So that they’ll experience absolute ease—

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,400
—especially the new generation, our guests of tomorrow.

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,370
Why didn’t you use the design I gave you?

35
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,300
I’m just doing what’s right—

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,670
—and what’s best for our company.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,970
Mind.

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,970
So… what do you think of her work?

39
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,100
Honestly, I’m glad she showed her own skills.

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,670
But after seeing it—

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,670
I have to admit… she’s really talented.

42
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,500
You’re amazing, and so am I.

43
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,900
Our whole team is amazing—

44
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,630
everyone’s giving their all on this project.

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,030
And I believe it’s going to turn out great.

46
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,570
Come here— energy recharge!

47
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,700
Be confident.

48
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,200
Thanks.

49
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,370
Anytime.

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,100
Honestly… I’m nervous.

51
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,470
Charging up!

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,270
You got this.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,500
It’s like…

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,300
a five-star buff.

55
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,270
I thought you were—

56
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,700
—casting a spell or something.

66
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,200
Hello, I’m Aokbab from Jinta Architects.

67
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,970
I’m Rin.

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
When we talk about the hotel of the future—

69
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,300
what’s the first thing that comes to mind?

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Modernity? Futuristic innovation?

71
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,130
Or perhaps something entirely new?

72
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,130
The word future can be interpreted—

73
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,470
—in endless ways, right?

74
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,570
Today, Jinta Architects—

75
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,900
—will present a new vision of the hotel of the future.

76
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,570
Our concept is—

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,730
“Anything Is Possible.”

78
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,400
At The Eraside, anything is possible.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Through our research—

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,430
studying customer needs and feedback,

81
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,870
both from existing guests and new potential customers,

82
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,700
we found that a five-star hotel doesn’t just mean—

83
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,100
rankings of luxury,

84
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,570
or having complete facilities.

85
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,970
It means—

86
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,870
five stars in the hearts of our guests.

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,800
With air pollution this bad, how do we even get rid of it?

88
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,000
We can’t. Not while humans are still here.

89
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,430
Huh?

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,100
Since humans created this problem—

91
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,170
and can’t undo it—

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,500
we let nature do the cleanup.

93
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,970
Rebuilding

94
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,800
Restoring the planet.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,370
Our first star—

96
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Green spaces and clean, breathable air.

97
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,070
Thailand is currently facing serious air-pollution issues.

98
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,770
Guests who stay at a hotel—

99
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,670
besides wanting to relax,

100
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,370
to escape the chaos—

101
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,200
they also long for soothing, refreshing nature.

102
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,670
and clean, pollution-free air.

103
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,370
We aim to design the space with as much greenery as possible.

104
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,200
Using large trees to reduce heat and dust.

105
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,870
To provide cleaner and fresher air for our guests.

106
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
We will also design the building to—

107
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,800
—utilize renewable energy,

108
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
reducing energy consumption

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,200
by applying natural mechanisms such as—

110
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,700
wind direction and natural lighting.

111
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,130
Our second star—

112
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,770
Comfort and exceptional service.

113
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,670
At The Eraside, convenience begins—

114
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,100
from the moment our guests walk through the door.

115
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,300
Every room’s interior—

116
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,670
beautifully designed and fully functional—

117
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,670
truly meets guests’ needs.

118
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,070
ensuring the highest level of comfort.

119
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,800
Our third star—

120
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,330
health, happiness—what we define as—

121
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,870
Happy Wellness.

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,770
A life of wellbeing and genuine happiness.

123
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,500
We’ve designed a full healthcare center—

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,430
within the hotel zone, ready to support guests’ health—

125
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
and address any medical needs they may have.

126
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,830
But wellness here doesn’t only mean physical health—

127
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,570
we also focus on lifestyle design—

128
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,170
that supports both emotional and physical wellbeing.

129
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,570
The fourth star — value.

130
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,770
Guests expect satisfaction equal to —

131
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,400
or greater than what they pay.

132
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,500
But value means different things to different people.

133
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,730
Which brings us to the final star — the heart of our hotel.

134
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,870
The experience itself.

135
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,300
That’s why we designed the new Eraside —

136
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,730
to deliver experiences that feel fresh,

137
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,870
meaningful, comfortable, and exceptionally serviced.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,500
Something no other hotel has offered before.

139
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
Every room is uniquely designed —

140
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,200
to match each guest’s lifestyle and personal taste.

141
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,800
We want a five-star hotel to be accessible to all ages and groups —

142
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,470
because everyone is an important guest.

143
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,900
We believe that listening to guests —

144
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,900
and designing with empathy and heart —

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,530
is what allows —

146
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,200
“Anything is possible” at The Eraside.

147
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
The hotel of the future — for everyone.

148
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
After discussing with all the judges,

149
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,100
there were two projects whose votes —

150
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,470
truly stood out —

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,670
among the panel.

152
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
They are —

153
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,470
Mind Space.

154
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,500
And —

155
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,470
Jinta Architect.

156
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,000
As the owner of The Eraside,

157
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,000
I will cast —

158
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,500
the final deciding vote for the winner.

159
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,470
Jinta Architect.

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,300
Mind Space.

161
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,870
Both companies delivered designs that —

162
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,570
clearly represent the hotel of the future,

163
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,770
with a distinct identity that feels complete.

164
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,200
The Mind Space team —

165
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,930
created a concept that fits perfectly with the modern era of hospitality,

166
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,870
integrating advanced and forward-thinking technology.

167
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,970
But what I personally like the most —

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,400
is how they captured the luxury of —

169
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,600
The Eraside in such an exceptional way.

170
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,470
As for Jinta Architect,

171
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,000
they delivered something truly distinct —

172
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,670
a vision we never expected The Eraside could become.

173
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,900
But it is filled with sincerity,

174
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,300
something they genuinely want to give every guest.

175
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
This kind of design lets us clearly see the future —

176
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,970
the direction The Eraside will take moving forward.

177
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,770
And because of this —

178
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,830
I want to choose the best hotel concept for —

179
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,370
my guests.

180
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,070
And while the hotel proposed by —

181
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,700
Mind Space may be lacking in one area…

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,970
Technology —

183
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,470
may not always meet the needs of every age group.

184
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,530
I firmly believe that in the hotel business —

185
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,970
the heart of hospitality still matters the most.

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,870
And service is the element I value above anything else.

187
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,730
Therefore, my final decision goes to —

188
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,770
Jinta Architect!
Woo!

189
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,170
Thank you very much

190
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,470
Congratulations.

191
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,870
Due to an unexpected incident…

192
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,030
The Eraside would like to…

193
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,470
take some time to verify the facts, and postpone the contract signing with the winner.

194
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,200
- Hey
- Hey, what's going on!?

195
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,700
What?

196
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,830
What happened?

197
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,600
What's going on?

198
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
They’re guessing the people in the leak…

199
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,170
…are Khun Aokbab, and Khun Mind.

200
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,030
Who the hell spread this nonsense?

201
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It’s that page again.

202
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,800
They always post gossip to attack and discredit other companies.

203
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,170
Before this…

204
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,930
they’ve already caused trouble for so many companies.

205
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,570
I wasn’t the one who did this, Aokbab.

206
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,770
The thing I regret most in my life…

207
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,070
is knowing someone like you.

208
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,100
Khun Prim…

209
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,200
Have you seen this news?

210
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh god…

211
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,430
Slandering people like this…

212
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,270
If you want to take legal action…

213
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
…you can.

214
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,100
I’m really worried about Rin.

215
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,000
I keep calling but she won’t pick up.

216
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,430
Wanna go see her? I can drive for you.

217
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
I think I'll pass.

218
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,070
It’s not like I can help anyway.

219
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
I’ll just send her some desserts instead.

220
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,000
Good idea. Maybe some food support will help her de-stress.

221
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,870
Okay.

222
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,070
—Want me to help?
—Sure.

223
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,200
That rumor page…

224
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,470
That was you, wasn’t it?

225
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,400
How would you know?

226
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,000
Because you’re always discrediting other companies.

227
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,400
If you’re still gonna lie…

228
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,770
Want me to check your computer?

229
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,900
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

230
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,870
Our company isn’t losing anything.

231
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,630
And no one knows it’s my page anyway.

232
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,230
It’s not just about the company!

233
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
My name is in the middle of all this.

234
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I don’t want people digging up this stuff.

235
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,670
If you want to survive…

236
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,700
you do whatever it takes, right?

237
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,900
If you’re gonna kill a snake—finish th...

238
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,170
Stop it, P’Thee.

239
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
I told you this since the day we started this company.

240
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,000
This is how the designing industry works.

241
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,630
And you were the one who told me—

242
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
that you wanted to be successful.

243
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,930
Wanted recognition.

244
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,370
Well, now you have it.

245
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,770
Success comes with a price, doesn’t it?

246
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,900
I must have made the wrong decision.

247
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,230
I’m resigning.

248
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,600
Resign?

249
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,700
Someone like you…

250
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,070
You don’t have the nerves to walk away from everything you built.

251
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,370
Don’t let me find out who owns that shitty page.

252
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,500
Do you have any proof—

253
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
That the design really belongs to you?

254
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,370
I don’t.

255
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,230
Even if I got the drawing back from P’Mind—

256
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,100
it still wouldn’t count as proof that I drew it.

257
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,200
Everyone—

258
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,230
Guys,

259
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,200
Look at this.

260
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,170
Khun Thee.

261
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,200
What?

262
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,670
Are you quitting following your senior?

263
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,470
I’m not letting you resign.

264
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,370
I don’t like the way you run things, Khun Thee.

265
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
What did you say?

266
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
From the rumors that have been spreading—

267
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,300
today, I want to tell everyone the truth.

268
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,100
Ten years ago…

269
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,000
Khun Aokbab and I really did have an issue.

270
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,200
Just like everyone suspected.

271
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,170
Today, Mind would like to tell everyone the truth.

272
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,330
Ten years ago…

273
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,070
What’s going on?

274
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,570
I don’t know.

275
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,870
But the person who stole the work…

276
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,370
wasn’t Khun Aokbab.

277
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,970
It was me.

278
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,270
I used Khun Aokbab’s design and submitted it to the competition.

279
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,200
And that architect gossip page that leaked the news…

280
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,670
was actually Khun Thee’s doing.

281
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,470
Khun Thee owns those pages.

282
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,700
He uses them to spread rumors and destroy his competitors’ reputations.

283
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,500
Out of the way! Out of the way!

284
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Mind! Open the door! Mind! Mind!

285
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
What the hell is wrong with you, Mind?!

286
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,500
I told you to open the damn door!

287
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,770
Where’s the key? Go get it! Now!

288
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,970
Open it!!

289
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
And besides that—

290
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,770
Khun Thee has been using dirty tricks to sabotage and steal other companies’ work.

291
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,700
Taking their designs and claiming them as his own.

292
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,400
I have all the evidence—

293
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,770
enough to incriminate Khun Thee completely.

294
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,000
After this live ends—

295
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,870
I will send everything to the reporters immediately.

296
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,100
Mind!

297
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,970
Damn it, Mind!

298
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,300
Mind!!

299
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,400
I know that what I’m doing right now—

300
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,270
…can’t undo the terrible things I did in the past.

301
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,370
But I want to finally do the right thing.

302
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,570
And I want to sincerely apologize to Khun Aokbab—from my heart.

303
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Aokbab…

304
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,470
I’m really sorry.

305
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,600
See? I told you.

306
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,100
I told you before—the truth is the truth.

307
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,870
- Ow!
- What the hell are you doing!? huh?

308
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,900
I’m just taking responsibility for what I did.

309
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,830
Whatever happens to you… that’s on you.

310
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,700
- Mind, you little—
- Let go!

311
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,800
- Khun Thee—
- What?

312
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,070
The Board of Directors needs you in the meeting room immediately.

313
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,930
Everyone is waiting for you, sir.

314
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,930
You're removing me from this company?

315
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,770
I'm afraid that's the only decision.

316
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,100
You're believing the nonsense from that employee—

317
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,430
who went live just now?

318
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,730
I built this company.

319
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,900
You have no right to throw me out.

320
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,070
Before Khun Mind went live,

321
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,400
she sent me copies of the documents.

322
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,400
I reviewed them myself.

323
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,970
I truly didn't expect…

324
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,000
that someone like you…

325
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,370
would dare do something so unethical in your own profession.

326
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,670
All for the sake of the company’s reputation.

327
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,970
Mind Space is no longer yours.

328
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,400
You're believing that lunatic?

329
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
There’s no proof behind anything she said!

330
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,500
Someone left a letter for you, Khun Thee.

331
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,670
It's done, Khun Pad.

332
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,070
Yes, it’s been delivered to Khun Thee.

333
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,470
Oh, it’s nothing. Just a small matter.

334
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,300
If there’s anything else, just let me know — I’ll handle it for you.

335
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,030
Yes, yes. Okay.

336
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Yes. Goodbye.

337
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,170
Thank you so much for taking care of this.

338
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,800
My pleasure.

339
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,200
Well then…

340
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,370
Would you like a cup of coffee? I can make one for you.

341
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,900
That sounds great.

342
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Uh… Khun Prim.

343
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,400
Yes?

344
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,670
Uh… could you teach me…

345
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
…how to make coffee?

346
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,000
I mean… in case…

347
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
one day I might apply to be…

348
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,270
…a barista here or something.

349
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,770
I’d be happy to.

350
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,470
Okay.

351
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,970
– That’s the coffee handle.
– Yes.

352
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,000
First, we have to take this part out.

353
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,570
Then we grind the beans from here.

354
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,400
And then fill it from this side.

355
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,770
Lock it in, then tamp it lightly.

356
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,270
Congratulations.

357
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,670
Thank you for trusting Jinta Architect.

358
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,070
We’ll make your hotel the very best we can.

359
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,800
I’m counting on you.

360
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,470
Yay!
Yay!

361
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,470
Oh right—everyone, I forgot to tell you.

362
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,500
– I have something important.
– What is it?

363
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,430
Today…

364
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,600
we’re not working!

365
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
– I’m taking everyone out to celebrate!
– Woo!

366
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,270
– Really?
– Yay! Then let’s hurry!

367
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,800
It would be bad if P’Pad changes his mind!

368
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,570
Congratulations.

369
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,400
For winning Khun Parat’s project.

370
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,030
Aokbab…

371
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,370
– If I asked for your forgiveness…

372
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,170
– I forgive you.

373
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,670
It’s all over now.

374
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,770
The past is the past.

375
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,670
Can I keep this one?
I’ll take another photo for you.

376
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,500
You’ve always been my inspiration.

377
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,070
I wanted to be an architect as good as you.

378
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,200
And after this…

379
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,000
what will you do next?

380
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,400
I’ll probably stay abroad for a while.

381
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
To rethink everything.

382
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,530
Then…

383
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,270
Good luck.

384
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,500
I’m leaving then.

385
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,800
Let’s go eat.

386
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,200
A hug… to give you strength.

387
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,700
Giving encouragement… to someone who just lost her job?

388
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,070
Mm-hm.

389
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,070
You’re… not stressed at all?

390
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,400
I don’t have a job anymore, you know.

391
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,700
I don’t even know how I’m supposed to take care of you.

392
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,430
It’s okay.

393
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,570
I’ll take care of you instead.

394
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,970
And I believe someone as talented as you…

395
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,300
anywhere you apply, they’ll accept you.

396
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,970
My P’Vee is super talented already.

397
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,700
Oh—

398
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,870
So now you might get to work with me, right?

399
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,400
Would Jinta really hiring me?

400
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,470
They won’t accept me...

401
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,470
But you never know unless we try.

402
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,730
Just watch me.

403
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,600
I’ll psycho Khun Aokbab until she hires you.

404
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,930
And if she still refuses…

405
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,370
I’ll threaten to quit.

406
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,200
That far, huh?

407
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,400
Yup.

408
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,870
I may be tiny—

409
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,470
but I’m good at everything, you know.

410
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,770
…or am I wrong?

411
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,900
Finally…

412
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,070
everything’s over now, Sis.

413
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,970
Yeah…

414
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,500
It’s finally over.

415
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,000
Thanks, Rin.

416
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,700
Thanks for…

417
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,200
Well…

418
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,870
thank you for working with me.

419
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,000
That’s it?

420
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,970
[Sigh]

421
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,370
Thank you for designing love… for me.

422
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,970
Designing love…

423
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,500
sounds really nice.

424
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,530
Do you love Aokbab (Designing)?

425
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,470
Rin really loves designing.

426
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,900
And…

427
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,700
do you love this P'Aokbab?

428
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,370
This P'Aokbab?

429
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,400
I love you more than anyone in the world.

430
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,170
From now on…

431
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,800
From now on…

432
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
let’s design our love story together.

433
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,500
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

434
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,170
Bee.

435
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,670
- Yess?
- Come here a sec.

436
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,800
Just a moment.

437
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,830
What is it?

438
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,100
Let me fix this part, then you can send it to the client.

439
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,000
Okay.

440
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,200
Lip color looks pretty, right?

441
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,700
Of course

442
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,500
Whoa— tone it down, please.

443
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,870
My sugar level’s rising.

444
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,800
Seriously, I’m gonna puke from the sweetness.

445
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,370
Ugh, way too sweet. Diabetes is coming for me.

446
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,870
I can’t. The love in the air stinks too strong.

447
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,000
I’m reporting this to Khun Aokbab.

448
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,900
She should set a rule—no flirting at work.

449
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Hey, no way.
This CEO’s girlfriend does NOT approve.

450
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,400
Why am I the only single one here…

451
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,970
Then hurry up and find someone.

452
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,070
Wait— or maybe…

453
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,900
Oops.

454
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,570
That could work.

455
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,900
- Yeah, that works.
- Heyy, what's going on?!

456
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,670
Huh?

457
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,600
It's alright Yong.

458
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,770
What??

459
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,170
We are ending up single together.

460
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,700
Are you guys crazy or what?

461
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,070
Who’s ending up single?

462
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,500
No way.

463
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,270
What would you like to order?

464
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,470
Can I order you… to be my girlfriend?

465
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
No.

466
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,100
…don’t know why I even refused.

467
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,370
These days, Khun Prim…

468
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,670
…your jokes are getting so much better.

469
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,370
I learned them from you, Khun Jade.

470
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,370
- The stairs here are pretty sturdy.
- Yes.

471
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,470
I remember you like roses.

472
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,370
Yes, I do.

473
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,470
Do you like these?

474
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,870
I do.

475
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,670
I mean…

476
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,000
Do you like me too?

477
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,870
Excuse me, are you Khun Pad from Jinta Architect?

478
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,400
No problem at all. Please, have a seat.

479
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I’m NhomPang, the one with the appointment.
- Yes.

480
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,370
My house… will the budget be okay?

481
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,100
Please~ help me out...

482
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,400
P’Pad…

483
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,500
Sure, then…

484
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,100
Let me take a look for you.

485
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,500
You’re really beautiful… hmm.

486
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,170
I mean Khun NhomPang

487
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,670
Let's make it more minimal

488
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,970
About things like…

489
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,570
Like the kitchen, um…

490
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,000
This plan,

491
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,070
The toilet.

492
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,270
Are you alright?

493
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,670
If it's like this, I'm ok.

494
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,770
Damn it!

495
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,200
I hope you choke on your coffee and die!

496
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,600
You…

497
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,900
You…

498
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,570
You…

499
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,770
You…

500
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,600
I hate you!

501
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,570
I can hear you, you know.

502
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Sorry.

503
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,170
Thought I was alone.

504
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,370
Your voice is loud enough to reach my tent.

505
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,100
What are you doing here?

506
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,930
What do you expect me to do?

507
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,470
I’m heartbroken right now.

508
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,870
Heartbroken?

509
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,430
Yeah.

510
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,270
He brought me here for coffee…

511
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
And then suddenly dumped me right here.

512
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,700
So I came here to curse him to my heart’s content.

513
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,900
What's your name?

514
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,300
Blue.

515
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm Chan.

516
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,500
How about this?

517
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,970
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

518
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,200
When you're done drinking, you stand right here and yell at him again.

519
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,970
Shout at him right here.

520
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,630
I'll stand here and yell with you.

521
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,330
What beans do you use?

522
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,630
Colombia medium roast.

523
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,970
The taste notes are chocolate and caramel.

524
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,470
Is that okay for you?

525
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,370
Works for me.

526
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,070
You have a great taste.

527
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,000
Come on, follow me to my tent.

528
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,670
Here you go.

529
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,000
You love watching me drawing that much?

530
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,170
I like both —

531
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,430
I like both you and the drawings you make.

532
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,900
And what are you drawing now?

533
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,600
I’m…

534
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,500
designing our love.

535
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,170
Hm?

536
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,900
I’m…

537
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,900
designing our future home…

538
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,000
the home we’ll live in together in the future.

539
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,870
Let me see.

540
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,570
Whoa…

541
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,770
It’s beautiful.

542
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,100
But I think…

543
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,500
I might hire a Master architect to help designing it.

544
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,370
But I’m not sure will she accept this project.

545
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,700
Why pay someone? Why not do it yourself?

546
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,070
And how much is her fee, huh?

547
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,770
Money probably isn’t enough… you might need another offer.

548
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,170
And what if…

549
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,430
I offer both my heart and body?

550
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,270
Would that be enough?

551
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,400
If she agrees, we can sign the contract tonight.

552
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,470
Tonight?

553
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,800
Can we do it right now instead?

554
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,900
Like—right now.

555
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Rin

556
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,230
I'm gonna fall

557
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,500
I'm nearly fall!

558
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,400
…That’s cute.

559
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,100
Did you know, I'm alittle bigger

560
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,500
What do you think?

561
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,200
This is the place.

562
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:08,500
Nice location.

563
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,430
Perfect for the house you designed.

564
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,100
The house we designed together.

565
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,530
I love you, Rin.

566
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,870
I love you too.

567
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,130
You really called a Feng Shui master?

568
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,600
Well…

569
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,670
P'Pad insisted it’s a must.

570
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,900
Master, is this area not good?

571
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,100
The land itself has no problem.

572
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,070
This land will bring happiness…

573
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,000
…and wealth flowing in.

574
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,000
However…

575
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,630
You cannot build the house right now.

576
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,970
Huh? You just said it was good.

577
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,070
You two must get married first.

578
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,300
If you don’t marry within this year…

579
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,700
…you’ll definitely break up.

580
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,600
Get married!?

581
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,400
You two must get married first.

582
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,900
Get married!?

583
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,200
I want to get married.

584
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,670
I'm not really into ceremonies.

585
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,200
Listen to me.

586
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,170
If two people truly love each other—

587
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,670
Something this small—

588
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,100
—won’t make them break up.

589
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,900
…Hopefully.

590
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,230
My girlfriend—

591
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,470
She doesn’t really seem to want to get married.

592
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,300
Where did you two first meet?

593
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,870
Then start from there.

594
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,270
Whatever makes you happy—

595
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
I want to do that for you.
