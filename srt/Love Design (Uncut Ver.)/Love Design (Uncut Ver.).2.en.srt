Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink

want to renovate their vacation home.

6
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,209
I have a close friend.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,628
She's getting famous on IG right now.

8
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:28,264
Are you okay?

9
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:30,065
I really liked it.

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,837
The way you talked about your company.

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,950
But I would never work with you.

12
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,082
Why don't you try taking her out for a nice meal?

13
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:37,230
She lives for food.

14
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:40,519
Finish this entire jar of plum wine.

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,633
I might consider working for you.

16
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:47,185
Why did you kick me?

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,434
Whose clothes are these?

18
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:49,402
They're my clothes.

19
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:50,909
Why are you wearing them?

20
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,514
What happened?

21
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,796
Why is the world spinning, lady?

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,437
Same thing.

23
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:14,440
Lady, where are you going? Wait up.

24
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,745
Did you call a Grab yet?

25
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:18,258
Ouch.

26
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:19,853
So cute.

27
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm not a cat.

28
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:22,918
So kind.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,542
Should we talking about work?

30
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:31,141
Whose shoe is this? Damn it.

31
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,213
Oh, wait.

32
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:37,420
No!

33
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,917
Wait, wait, wait.

34
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,854
Ow, go!

35
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,010
You should be thanking me.

36
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,302
Otherwise, you would've ended up sleeping on the street.

37
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,070
Fine, thank you.

38
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:22,600
Damn it.

39
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,365
Can you please speed up a bit?

40
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:49,743
I'll give you a big tip.

41
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,050
Thank you so much.

42
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,445
Uh, hey you.

43
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:58,499
About last night

44
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,882
just forget about it, including the offer.

45
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,062
Let's pretend I never said anything.

46
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,272
As for the clothes, just give them back to Tertis.

47
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:05,315
Have you called a ride yet?

48
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,015
Lady, wait a sec.

49
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,330
Have you ever been to Kitakyushu?

50
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,297
Why are you asking?

51
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,240
Just answer me. Have you been there?

52
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:21,900
Yes, I have. Three years ago.

53
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:31,182
Hey, hurry up and get out.

54
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,833
Yes, I'm on my way out.

55
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,852
When you're done, get out quickly.

56
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,014
I'm about to lock up the house.

58
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,110
I think we should go with a Muji feel.

59

Like a wooden

60
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:08,456
I think you can adjust this part more.

61
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,566
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

62
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,010
Hey, you're only a little late.

63
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,248
It's no big deal.

64
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,843
It is. You have to be punctual for work.

65
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,224
Oh.

66
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,286
Do you?

What about Rin, Ms. Aokbab?

69
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:23,560
Did she agree to work with us?

70
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,024
Did we miss?

71
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,383
She probably didn't agree.

I have an answer now.

75
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,716
I'll work for you.

76
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,554
Are you really going to work here?

77
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:48,169
You're not messing with me again, are you?

78
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,482
When I'm serious, you don't believe me.

79
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,506
But you were so against it before.

80
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,811
Why did you suddenly agree to work here?

81
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,410
Why I'm here isn't important.

82
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:01,687
What's important is

83
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:04,034
you're the one who needs me, right?

84
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:06,429
Well, yes.

85
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,788
But before I agree

86
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:10,501
I have three conditions.

87
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,193
First

88
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:15,797
I will not work overtime under any circumstances.

89
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,596
Second

90
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,949
I will not answer messages

91
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,742
or phone calls after work hours.

92
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,535
Third

93
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,088
you have to take me out for delicious food every week.

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,923
What kind of conditions are these?

95
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,156
If you don't agree

96
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:29,993
I won't work here.

97
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,560
Fine.

98
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,000
I accept your conditions.

99
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,415
Then it's a deal.

00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:38,717
I know.

107
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:41,529
I know it'll be hard at first.

108
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:44,487
Just take your time to adjust, okay?

109

She's talking to rocks.

112
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,198
Don't even try to understand her.

113
00:09:58,658 --> 00:09:59,729
You won't get it.

114
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,695
- Do you want to be in the middle?
- What's do you mean?

115
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,707
You're being difficult again.

116
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:06,667

This is May from accounting.

119
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,452
And this is Yong, an architect.

120
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,057
If you need anything, you can ask them.

Welcome to JINTA Architect, Rin.

122
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,887
We're like a family here. We all help each other out.

123
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,299
That's okay. I don't want to be family.

124
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:30,593
Oh, why not?

125
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,441
I've heard that

126
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,411
if a company says they're like a family

127
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,888
they usually end up in disaster.

128
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:42,610
So I think it's better if we just stay as regular employees.

129
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:48,807
Where can I get some water?

130
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:50,670
Over there.

131
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:51,834
Okay.

132
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:54,400
Disaster?

The project I want you to work on

134
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,177
is the renovation of Rain and Mink's vacation home.

135
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,336
It's an old house.

136
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:05,683
But it's still beautiful.

137
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:07,845
Initially, they

138
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:10,190
want it to be a vacation home

139
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,625
where he and his wife can relax together.

140
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:17,724
Wait, hey, don't use your shirt.

141
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:19,144
There are no tissues.

142
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:20,325
It's too late.

143
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,089
It's all wet now.

144
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:25,847
You're so clumsy.

00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:28,044
As for the details

146
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:31,310
they'll probably call us in for a briefing soon.

147
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:32,575
Anyway

148
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,960
please prepare some references and basic information.

149
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,635
In the meantime, you can

150
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,293
help others in the company with their work.

151
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,567
Okay.

Lady, take me to get Japanese food.

154
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,523
It's your first day and you're already demanding it?

155
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:49,850
But you already agreed.

156
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,094
Are you going to back out?

157
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,192
Well

158
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,582
I'll order a bento box from my usual place for now.

159
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,507
Is that okay?

160
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:03,741
Fine.

161
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,265
I'll let it slide since it's a first day.

162
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:08,928
Let get back to work.

163
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:12,316

Yes, we do.

00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,589
Hey!

174
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,648
Damn it.

175
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,343
Oh.

176
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:36,930

184
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,230
No.

185

[Tell your boss that, too.]

00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:47,515
I'm asking you to answer your phone, reply to texts

191
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,823
when people really need your help.

192
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,770
There are eight hours in a workday.

193
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:52,827
Why not ask during that time?

194
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,948
Why do you have to ask after work? I don't get it.

195
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,250
If it wasn't important, they wouldn't have asked you.

196
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,676
You're still young, so you probably don't know yet.

197
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:00,795
In professional life

198
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,606
not everything can go the way you want it to.

199
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,110
But we had an agreement.

200
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,872
I hope an adult like you wouldn't forget that.

201
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:27,730
Let me ask again.

202
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,800
Do we really need this kid named Rin?

203
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,415
Can't we just fire her?

204
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,063
Calm down.

205
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:37,150
Kids these days are just cheeky like that.

206
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,735
In all my life

207
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,223
I've never met a kid so disrespectful.

208
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,394
If we were in Japan

209
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:43,965
this kid wouldn't have a place to stand.

210
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:47,264
We still need Rin's help, Aokbab.

211
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,066
Try to be nice to her.

212
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,269
You can't be harsh with kids these days.

213
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:52,954
If you scold them, they won't listen.

214
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,350
Then what should I do?

215
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,868
You have to make them see that what they think

216
00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:58,626
has many different perspectives.

217
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,733
If you're going to use young grass, you have to be patient.

218
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:01,851
It takes a lot of tolerance.

219
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,057
Don't you mean a gentle approach?

220
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,500
You just said "young grass."

221
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,646
I said "gentle approach."

222
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,553
Don't argue, I heard you said "young grass."

223
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,255
What? I said "gentle approach."

224
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,178
You said it. Don't argue with me.

225
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,907
I told you, I said "gentle approach."

226
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, fine.

227
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:20,625
I'll try the gentle approach like you said.

228
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,608
Please complete all of these CAD drawings.

229
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:31,788
I need them by today.

230
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,354
Giving me this now? How am I supposed to finish?

231
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,455
Someone as talented as you

232
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,133
should be able to finish it in time.

233
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:45,452
But if you can't finish it, that's okay too.

234
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:47,977
You can just carry it over to the next day.

235
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:51,116
Let it pile up with your other tasks. I understand.

236
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,025
Because you have to go home at 6.

237
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,533
Yes.

238
00:16:58,316 --> 00:16:59,854
You can wait for the work.

239
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,595
Because I'm going home at 6.

240
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,857
If you can do it, then try.

241
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,590
Now you see why our classmates called her Master Rin.

242
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,503
The work is done, Ms. Aokbab.

243
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:21,339
Oh.

244
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,533
It's exactly 6 o'clock.

245
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:26,059
Time to clock out. I have to go home.

246
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,973
But it seems like your work

247
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,677
still has a lot left.

248
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,910
Well, good luck.

249
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,802
Good bye.

250
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm home!

251
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,705
Wow.

252
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,840
Why are you so happy today? What did you do?

253
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,246
Be careful. I'll hold it.

254
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:02,237
Go ahead.

255
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,056
Someone tried to challenge Master Rin today.

256
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,161
So I had to show them what's up.

257
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,187
Hey, Rin.

258
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:19,268
Work

259
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,467
isn't about one-upping each other

260
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,303
or taking your emotions out on one another.

261
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,840
Here.

262
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,061
You have to rely on each other to move forward.

263
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,302
Just like how you're helping me right now.

264
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,799
Suddenly you're a life coach.

265
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,561
Why don't we just hire a handyman?

266
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,155
Good point.

267
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:47,855
Yeah.

268
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:50,040
So?

269
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,018
I don't know.

[JINTA Architect]

271
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:00,843
Yong.

272
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:01,637
Yes?

273
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:04,531
Please check the wooden wall here for me.

274
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:05,927
Right here in this area.

275
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,928
And then take the actual materials

276
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,144
and compare to see if this part matches.

277
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:11,920
Got it.

278
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:12,653
Thanks.

279
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,685
Sure, no problem.

280
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:15,899
Ms. Aokbab.

281
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:17,802
Mr. Rain's secretary just called.

282
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,733
He wants to schedule an urgent meeting for this evening.

283
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:21,349
Today?

284
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:26,124
Okay, you can go ahead and confirm.

285
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:27,217
Okay.

286
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:28,791
Then I'll go with you, Ms. Aokbab.

287
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,317
Wait.

288
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:31,857
You stay here.

289
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:34,263
Okay.

290
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:38,718
Rin.

291
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:40,591
Get your bag.

292
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,040
It's only 4. Are you letting me go home already?

293
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,081
You have to go to a meeting.

294
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:50,965
But if we have the meeting now

295
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,377
I won't get off work on time.

296
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:54,766
But it's not the end of the workday yet.

297
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,952
So you should be able to go.

298
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:57,685
Right?

299
00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,640
Meet you downstairs.

300
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:19,855
Rin.

301
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,212
Mr. Rain, Ms. Mink, hello.

302
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,065
- Hello.
- Hello.

303
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:27,298
Thank you.

304
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:30,583
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

305
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:35,293
I'm Aokbab, from JINTA Architect.

306
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:37,490
And this is Rin, an architect from our team.

307
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:39,898
Ms. Rin.

308
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,324
That name sounds familiar.

309
00:21:43,464 --> 00:21:45,750
Rin is the owner of the Instagram account "Rinchitect."

310
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:47,625
Oh, Ms. Rin!

311
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,430
The one whose work I always show you.

312
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,224
I'm a big fan of her work.

313
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:52,899
Oh!

314
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:55,990
My wife is a huge fan of yours.

315
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,125
Can I shake your hand?

316
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,942
Meeting you in person

317
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,899
Thank you.

318
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,266
I love her so much.

319
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,919
It's my first time meeting.

320
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,080
Make yourselves comfortable.

321
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,278
We're just waiting for another team to arrive.

322
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,816
Hello, Mr. Rain, Ms. Mink.

323
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,225
Why did you do this to me?

324
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:58,482
Answer me.

325
00:22:58,724 --> 00:22:59,904
Mind.

326
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,658
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

327
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:05,784
Not at all. Please, have a seat.

328
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:22,738
Ms. Mind, this is Ms. Rin and Ms. Aokbab

329
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,397
from JINTA Architect.

330
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,526
I'm not sure if you two teams have met before?

331
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,701
- We have.
- We haven't.

332
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,644
Well then

333
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,860
I'd like to start the briefing now.

334
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,340
Okay.

335
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:47,649
Actually, this house

336
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,649
belonged to my grandmother.

337
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,650
I intend to turn this house

338
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,108
into a vacation home for the two of us.

339
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:56,140
The design concept is

340
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,749
"Love makes a home."

341
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:21,183
Aokbab.

342
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:26,940
It's been a long time.

343
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,342
How have you been?

344
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,737
You two know each other?

345
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,160
You're Rin, "Rinchitect" Instagram, right?

346
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:45,259
Yes. Do you know me?

347
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,864
My company wanted to hire you.

348
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:49,710
But I heard you declined.

349
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:52,745
I didn't expect you to be working with JINTA Architect.

350
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,427
That's because our company is better.

351
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,024
That's why Rin chose to be with us.

352
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:01,802
You're as confident as ever.

353
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:02,890
Yes.

354
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,626
I'm confident in my company and our work.

355
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,339
I think we'll be seeing each other more often.

356
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:16,110
I don't think there will be any need for us to meet.

358
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:33,852
Everyone.

00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,519
No overtime today.

360
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:37,087
Let's all go home and rest.

361
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:38,507
We can tackle the work again tomorrow.

362

You've all been working hard for days.

363
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,589
Get some proper rest.

Can I keep this one for myself?

369

I'll take another one for you.

00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:10,970
Why did you do this to me?

375
00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:16,504
Answer me. Why did you do this to me?

376
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:32,493
The design world is a tough place.

377
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,049
If you want to survive

378
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,066
you have to do it.

379
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:41,715
But that was my work that I gave to you.

380
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,603
Not for you to enter into a competition.

381
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,646
Why did you do this to me?

382
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,133
Answer me.

383
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,924
Why did you do this to me?

384
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,077
Hey.

385
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:10,810
Mind.

386
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,603
Mind.

387
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,083
How could you do this to me, Mind?

388
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,276
Rin.

389
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,071
Cockroach!

390
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:55,935
Help!

391
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:58,702
Get it away from me!

392
00:31:58,727 --> 00:31:59,533
Lady, stop!

393
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:01,813
I'll hit it. Calm down.

394
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,630
Lady!

395
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:19,517
Where did it go?

396
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:25,597
Where did it fly off to?

397
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:31,349
What the...

398
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:32,109
Rin.

399
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:33,198
Wait, wait, wait.

400
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,725
What?

401
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:35,980
It's on your back.

402
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,400
Stay still.

403
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,436
Ahh! Lady!

404
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:54,323
Lady.

405
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:56,122
Are you messing with me?

406
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:57,844
Sorry.

407
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:04,426
Are you okay?

408
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,170
My shoulder is broke.

409
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:08,110
You're exaggerating.

410
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:27,587
Nice house.

411
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:31,744
My parents designed it themselves.

412
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,036
Your parents are architects?

413
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:35,748
No.

414
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,368
My dad was an engineer.

415
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:38,701
He's up there now.

416
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:41,470
And my mom loved decorating.

417
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:43,384
She's an angel now.

418
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,218
It's just me and my sister Prim.

419
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,157
Why were you crying, lady?

420
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:04,789
Were you spying on me?

421
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:08,802
No, I just happened to see you.

422
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,504
People have their sad moments, that's why they cry.

423
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,161
You can tell me if something's wrong.

424
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:25,596
Alright.

425
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:28,057
If you don't want to talk, I won't ask anymore.

426
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,198
You and that person named Mind

427
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:32,952
Hey.

428
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:36,150
I thought you said you weren't going to ask.

429
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,558
That was a different question.

430
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:39,609
Just let me ask.

431
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:42,681
You and Mind seemed close.

432
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:44,799
Have you known each other for a long time?

433
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:50,215
What happened today and what you saw

434
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,022
don't you dare tell anyone.

435
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:54,689
That's an order. Understand?

436
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:03,743
Don't be late tomorrow.

437
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,362
What's up?

438
00:36:28,392 --> 00:36:31,534
Vee, do you remember the girl with Aokbab JINTA Architect?

439
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:34,475
The one named Rin.

440
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:37,504
Can you find some more information about her for me?

441
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:39,134
I can do that.

442
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,510
And what's the status of the site visit to Rain's house?

443
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:43,590
We have a date set now.

444
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,363
I've already informed the team to prepare for the site visit.

445
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:47,574
Thanks a lot, Vee.

446
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,500
You're welcome.

447
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,556
What's up, Pad?

448
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:09,460
Hey, sorry, Aokbab.

449
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:11,933
I can't go with you to the site visit tomorrow.

450
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,483
One of the professors called in sick unexpectedly.

451
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:15,945
So I have to cover for them.

452
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,437
Okay. No problem.

453
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:20,483
I'll try calling Chan.

454
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,652
Okay, thanks. Sorry about that.

455
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:30,125
What's up, little sis?

456
00:37:30,485 --> 00:37:31,530
Hey, Chan.

457
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,750
Pad is busy tomorrow.

458
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:36,267
Can you go to the site visit with me instead?

459
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:39,015
Oh, I'm actually out camping.

460
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,154
About 2-3 days before I'm back to the office.

461
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:45,410
Hey, why didn't you tell me you were going somewhere?

462
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:47,935
So I have to go to the site visit alone, is that it?

463
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:51,175
Sorry, sis.

464
00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:52,391
Hey.

465
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:53,764
Why don't you ask Master Rin to go with you?

466
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:55,932
No way. She's so annoying.

467
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:56,932
Hey.

468
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:57,951
Your intention

469
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,202
was to have Master Rin help with this project, wasn't it?

470
00:38:00,355 --> 00:38:02,455
This way, you two can get to know each other's working styles better.

471
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:05,065
Yeah, okay. I'll think about it.

472
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,613
And you, hurry back to work.

473
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,353
Yes.

474
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:12,925
Yes, Mom!

475
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,965
Why do I have to take her out to eat like this?

476
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:24,233
Such a waste of work time.

477
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:25,211
I heard that.

478
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,566
But you agreed, lady.

479
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,106
Condition No. 3, remember?

480
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:38,805
Hey, Rin.

481
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,918
I have to go to a site visit at Rain's house tomorrow.

482
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:41,900
I'm going.

483
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:44,415
I haven't even finished my sentence.

484
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:45,730
I can read your mind, lady.

485
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:46,875
So, how many days are we staying over?

486
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,790
It's a day trip.

487
00:38:51,055 --> 00:38:52,375
Why aren't we staying over?

488
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,999
Hey, why would we stay over?

489
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:55,270
No one does that.

490
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:56,895
We're going to another province,

491
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,238
we should make it worthwhile.

492
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,014
We're going for work, not for a vacation.

493
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,596
But tomorrow is Friday.

494
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,887
We can do some sightseeing on weekend.

495
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,948
If you're not going, that's fine.

496
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:10,496
I can go by myself.

497
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,323
Fine.

498
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,730
Just one night.

499
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,442
We'll come back in the morning, okay?

500
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,703
Yay! You're so kind, lady.

501
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,590
Let's get a nice hotel. A 5-star one.

502
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:26,684
5-star.

503
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:32,389
Lady, can I order more?

504
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,334
I don't think this is enough.

505
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:35,975
How many days?

506
00:39:36,233 --> 00:39:38,193
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

507
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,300
This is a surprise.

508
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,273
You barely go anywhere.

509
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,006
Especially not with people you're not close to.

510
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,335
What made you agree to go?

511
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,278
Ugh, I didn't want to go.

512
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:49,930
But it's for work, so I have to.

513
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,011
I'm being forced by my professional duties.

514
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:01,619
I know you well.

515
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,349
Someone like you can't be forced by anyone.

516
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,435
Not unless you want to go yourself.

517
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:06,317
Power bank!

518
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:08,430
I should go get it before I forget.

519
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:10,289
Power bank.

520
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,076
I'm here.

521
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,678
You're 5 minutes late. Be on time next time.

522
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:24,684
Lady, it's just 5 minutes.

523
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,089
Lady, give me a hand.

524
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:33,284
When we get there, let's eat first.

525
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:34,991
I've already searched for the best spots.

526
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:37,010
Is your life all about eating?

527
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,330
An army marches on its stomach.

528
00:40:41,462 --> 00:40:42,543
Let's go.

529
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:46,374
Did you just trick me into carrying your bag?

530
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:47,579
No.

531
00:41:27,982 --> 00:41:28,921
Whoa.

532
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,503
The view is amazing, lady.

533
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:34,231
The location is incredible.

534
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,803
But a house by the sea like this

535
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,830
has both its pros and cons.

536
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,175
There's the sun, the wind

537
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,574
and then there's the humidity.

538
00:41:44,744 --> 00:41:46,430
Hello.

539
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,460
Hello.

540
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:50,298
You must be the architects

541
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:51,906
here to see Mr. Rain's house, right?

542
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:52,720
Yes, we are.

543
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:53,888
I'm Mun.

544
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,020
Mr. Rain asked me to assist you.

545
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,950
I'll give you a tour of the house.

546
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,249
Thank you for your help.

547
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:01,104
This way, please.

548
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,088
Please, come in.

549
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,310
This house actually

550
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:17,577
belonged to Ms. Mink's late grandmother.

551
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,090
She left it to Ms. Mink as an inheritance

552
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:21,150
back when Ms. Mink was still in school.

553
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,930
Before her grandmother passed away

554
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:27,149
Ms. Mink still used to visit this house.

555
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,867
But it's a shame no one lives here now.

556
00:42:34,788 --> 00:42:38,190
The house has fallen into disrepair, as you can see.

557
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:42,984
Well then...

558
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:45,996
I'll leave you to your work.

559
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,491
If you need anything, just let me know.

560
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,998
Thank you.

561
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:51,298
I'll be on my way then.

562
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:03,697
Shall we start?

563
00:43:20,802 --> 00:43:22,790
Lady, move a bit.

564
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:23,550
Move what?

565
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:26,010
I'm measuring. Your head is in the way.

566
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:28,950
Move it. Look at the wall.

567
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,394
I'm measuring this part.

568
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:32,110
This part is more important.

569
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:39,027
Whatever you say.

570
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,102
Lady.

571
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:52,155
What?

572
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:14,150
I was going to say there's a water leak.

573
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,143
Oh, over there?

574
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:22,178
I'll go check.

575
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:00,589
Thanks, lady.

576
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,028
Take pictures of the surroundings

577
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:13,520
and measure the interior and exterior areas.

578
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,766
Then send it all to Vee.

579
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,174
I told you we'd be seeing each other a lot.

580
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:24,827
Have you been here long?

581
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,153
Want to take a look inside together?

582
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:32,450
I think it's better if we work separately.

583
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:36,918
I just wanted to talk to you.

584
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:38,345
But I don't want to talk to you, Mind.

585
00:45:40,106 --> 00:45:41,486
Please, feel free to look around the house.

586
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:43,750
JINTA Architect is done here.

587
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:46,071
Rin, let's go.

588
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,242
It reminds me of the time we went to the beach together.

589
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:53,440
Do you remember, Aokbab?

590
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,284
Let's go get something to eat.

591
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,029
You're hungry, right?

592
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:11,674
I'm hungry?

593
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:12,915
Yes.

594
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:22,836
I'm always down for food. Let's go.

595
00:46:51,616 --> 00:46:53,713
Lady, what are you doing? You're making a mess.

596
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:55,648
You don't know how to crack it?

597
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:59,273
Give it here. I'll do it for you.

598
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:00,727
Such a waste.

599
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:09,401
How did you grow up without knowing how to do this?

600
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,323
What do you do when you go out for seafood?

601
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,527
I order the kind that's already shelled.

602
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:15,791
And if there isn't a shelled option?

603
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:17,284
I have someone else do it for me.

604
00:47:17,477 --> 00:47:19,612
Don't tell me that someone is Mind.

605
00:47:35,664 --> 00:47:37,604
Mind, you're so good at cracking crabs.

606
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:41,282
Well, if I can't do it

607
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,827
who's going to do it for you?

608
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:47,114
Then...

609
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:51,191
can you crack crabs for me forever?

610
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,874
She really used to do it for you, didn't she?

611
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,276
Don't eat it.

612
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:56,784
You can't eat this shrimp either.

613
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:58,451
What is wrong with you?

614
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:00,132
Tell me first.

615
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,246
What's about you and old hag from Mind Space?

616
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,585
Watch your words.

617
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:05,145
Are you defending her?

618
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:07,655
Give it here. You're not eating any.

619
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,221
Whatever is between us is my business.

620
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:12,178
Give it here.

621
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:12,684
Let go.

622
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,895
Give it to me.

623
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:23,736
What a waste.

624
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:25,623
What are you doing?

625
00:50:26,005 --> 00:50:27,225
You're the one.

626
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:29,626
Peel another one for me.

627
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,676
Don't eat it.

628
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,962
But this is my money.

629
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,375
I'm your subordinate.

630
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,395
I'm your boss. I'm treating you to this meal.

631
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,041
You can't just order everyone around.

632
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:40,052
This is my hand.

633
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,339
There's no reservation name Aokbab in system.

634
00:50:56,036 --> 00:50:58,207
How can that be? I already made a reservation.

635
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,649
But there's really nothing in the system.

636
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:03,042
Can I see the booking confirmation, please?

637
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:05,666
Here it is.

638
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:12,290
[Sunday, June 29, 2025]

639
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:15,764
[May]

640
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,165
The reservation you made is for next month.

641
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:22,663
Not for this month.

642
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,678
[Sunday, June 29, 2025]

643
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,889
[May]

644
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:35,813
So Tertis booked the wrong date.

645
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:37,085
What was he thinking?

646
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:40,733
Do you have any available rooms for tonight?

647
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:42,558
Our hotel is fully booked tonight.

648
00:51:42,582 --> 00:51:44,756
Every room is occupied.

649
00:51:45,627 --> 00:51:47,222
Are there any other hotels around

650
00:51:47,246 --> 00:51:48,294
here you can recommend?

651
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,455
I'm not sure.

652
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,929
I'm very sorry.

653
00:51:51,602 --> 00:51:53,451
I can share my room, if you want.

654
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,612
I can go sleep with my team member.

655
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:02,186
That's okay.

656
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,181
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

657
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:04,995
Let's go.

658
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,973
Can you stop tapping?

659
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:42,430
Lady, why did you turn it off?

660
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,950
I don't like listening to music.

661
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:53,680
So the story goes like this.

662
00:52:53,787 --> 00:52:56,971
My friends and I like to go to the beach.

663
00:52:57,384 --> 00:53:00,032
The road is quite rural.

664
00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:02,773
Suddenly, my car...

665
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,631
- ran over something.
- Can you turn that off?

666
00:53:04,717 --> 00:53:06,370
- Lady, I'm listening.
- At the front desk

667
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,547
there was only one room left, number 13.

668
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:10,304
And when we opened it

669
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:12,058
it smelled so musty.

670
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:14,255
And there were sacred threads hanging everywhere.

671
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:16,114
Hey.

672
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:18,053
Why did you turn it off, lady?

673
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:19,819
I just want to drive in silence.

674
00:53:27,629 --> 00:53:29,089
That's enough. Just sit quietly.

675
00:53:32,873 --> 00:53:33,973
Oh, lady...!

676
00:53:35,238 --> 00:53:37,618
Aha! you knew it.

677
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:46,309
Are you sure this is the right way?

678
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:50,119
This is what Google Maps said.

679
00:53:50,496 --> 00:53:52,231
You're scared of ghosts, aren't you?

680
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:53,775
Boo!

681
00:53:54,072 --> 00:53:55,789
Ow, can you not do that?

682
00:53:55,813 --> 00:53:56,927
It's dangerous.

683
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,344
I thought you said you weren't scared of ghosts.

684
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,516
Busted.

685
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,799
Just admit you're scared.

686
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,447
Lady, what's wrong with the car?

687
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:27,192
It says there's a problem with the tire.

688
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:29,894
Oh.

689
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:42,285
Lady, the tire's flat.

690
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:51,350
Try to find the number for a garage around here.

691
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,600
- A garage?
- Yes.

692
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,772
I have no signal.

693
00:54:56,843 --> 00:54:57,704
What do we do?

694
00:55:00,581 --> 00:55:02,029
I don't have any either.

695
00:55:03,192 --> 00:55:04,402
What do we do?

696
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:06,504
What do we do?

697
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:09,019
I think we have to walk.

698
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:12,440
Walk to the nearest hotel.

699
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:14,495
I think there was one nearby on the map earlier.

700
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,707
Right now?

701
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,276
Do you want to sleep here instead?

702
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,002
There's no other choice.

703
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,087
This place is even scarier.

704
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,750
Hurry up, lady. Stop thinking.

705
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:24,333
Let's go.

706
00:55:24,357 --> 00:55:25,700
Open it. How to open?

707
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:55,388
It's just like the haunted hotel

708
00:55:55,412 --> 00:55:56,435
from the show we listened to today.

709
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:59,062
Why aren't you sleeping in your own room?

710
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:00,697
Don't tell me you're scared of ghosts.

711
00:56:02,098 --> 00:56:04,888
Do you think we can beat Mind Space?

712
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,657
Of course. We will not lose.

713
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,190
Why can't we lose?

714
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:09,609
Because the person named Mind

715
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:11,642
is the person I hate the most.

716
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,118
I helped you get away from that old hag.

717
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:15,792
Aren't you going to say thank you?

718
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:17,681
Rin.

719
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:20,364
I'm going to erase Mind from my life.

720
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:22,770
And I will take back everything that's mine.
