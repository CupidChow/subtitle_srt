1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,720
It's been a while.

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,120
How have you been?

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,620
You two knew each other?

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,590
You can tell me anything, okay?

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,020
Can you go to Khun Rain’s house with me instead?

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,250
Why not ask Master Rin to come along?

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,150
Sure.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,020
How many nights are we staying?

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,350
Told you, we’ll be seeing each other a lot more.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,850
Better if we just focus on our own work.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,690
That booking isn’t for this month.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,020
Are you sure this is the right way?
Scared of ghosts?

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,350
What’s wrong with the car?

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,190
Hey! The tire’s flat.

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,190
Where the hell are we?

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,250
Try calling a garage around here.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,890
No signal.

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,050
You got any, lady?

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,550
Nope, same here.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,920
Where the hell are we?

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,120
I think we'd better walk.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,850
Right now?

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,550
Or do you want to sleep here? That’s even creepier.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,450
No other choice then.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,990
Let’s walk. Come on, hurry up.

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,490
It’s late. How do I open this?

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,620
Please take care of the car, P’ Wan.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,350
Thanks, P’.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,620
He was so nice.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,620
Thanks again, P’.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,550
Go on, lady.

32
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,650
Whoa, lady, this place looks haunted, like the one from that ghost show we listened to today.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,250
Uh, no staff here, we should leave.

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,150
[Scream]

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,950
Hello, how may I help you?

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,590
Any chance there are two rooms available?

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,990
Lucky you, there are exactly two rooms left.

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,580
Lucky number, too!

39
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,920
I’ll give up the lucky one for you, lady.

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,150
Let’s go.

41
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,190
Bye, lady.

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,120
That night, the hotel was fully booked.

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,020
Only one room left. Number 13.

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,790
There was a Taowessuwan talisman on the door.

45
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,120
And the room was filled with weird stuff.

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,190
At first, I wasn’t scared.

47
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,620
But the moment I opened the door—

48
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,020
a musty smell hit me hard.

49
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,350
There was even a Buddha shelf above the bed.

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,190
And that’s not all.

51
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,390
There were nine one-baht coins.

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,490
They were placed right on the headboard.

53
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,950
I’m sure someone must’ve died in that room.

54
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,450
[Scream]

55
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,990
Hey!

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,940
[Scream]

57
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,250
Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Oh my god, Rin!

58
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,890
Can I sleep here?

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,190
Why not sleep in your own room?

60
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,490
Don’t tell me you’re scared of ghosts?

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,090
It smells musty. I can’t sleep in there.

62
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,590
Then open the window.

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,720
The bed… it’s so hard.

64
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,350
How about this —

65
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,850
if you admit you’re scared of ghosts,

66
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,190
I’ll let you sleep here.

67
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,120
I’m not scared.

68
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
[Scream]

69
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,550
Rin… Rin Rin Rin
Rin, please open the door!

70
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,350
Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Rin! Open up!

71
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,620
Rin! Rin! Rin!

72
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,990
Okay okay! I’m scared! Let me sleep here!

73
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,790
Rin! Open the door!

74
00:05:51,220 --> 00:06:00,220
[Music]

75
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,150
[Music] Just having you by my side today makes everything perfect.

76
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,620
Your heartbeat tells me, The answer is you.
(The answer is you.)

77
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,520
There’s no reason why I love you,

78
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,920
It just has to be you.

79
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,120
The one I choose today is you.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,590
I want you beside me,

81
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,550
Always.

82
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,650
What are you doing, lady?

83
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,320
Getting ready to sleep. We’ve got work early tomorrow.

84
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,020
Then why are you sleeping on the bed?

85
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,820
- What, you expect me to sleep on the couch?
- Exactly.

86
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,750
You should sleep on the couch. I should sleep on the bed,
because, this is my room!

87
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,720
But I’m the one paying for this room.

88
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,820
And for this whole trip.

89
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,520
Including your meals, too.

90
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,220
Fine! I’ll let you have it this time.

91
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,820
Yeah right, now you bring up money.

92
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,790
Hope a ghost paralyzes you.

93
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,520
Boo!

94
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,580
Hope it paralyzes you too.

95
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,760
Not! Scared!

96
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,820
[Sigh]

97
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,450
Can you stop moving? You’re too noisy. I can’t sleep.

98
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,520
It’s just not comfortable.

99
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,550
Ah!

100
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,720
Ow— okay okay, you can sleep on the bed.

101
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,890
But don’t move, okay?

102
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,220
Really?

103
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,190
Hey, sis.

104
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,590
Do you think we can beat Mind Space?

105
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,090
Of course.

106
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,090
We’re not gonna lose.

107
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,220
Why not?

108
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,590
Why can’t we lose?

109
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,720
Because the one named Mind

110
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,780
is the person I hate the most.

111
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,450
And also your first love, right?

112
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,450
You can tell me about it.

113
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,950
You’ve been holding it in for a long time, haven’t you?

114
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,150
Trying to act strong.

115
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,790
Because that old hag hurt you, right?

116
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,620
I may talk a lot,

117
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,490
but I’m a good listener.

118
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,850
And I’m, a great secrets keeper too.

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,390
P’Mind used to be my p' tutor when I was in Senior High.

120
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,990
We spent a lot of time together after school.

121
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,420
Is this okay, P’Mind?

122
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,790
I told you, there’s no right or wrong. Just keep drawing.

123
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,550
Okay, P’Mind.

124
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,420
P’...

125
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,420
Yes?

126
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,750
Nothing. Let’s keep drawing.

127
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,920
On the last day I studied with P’Mind,

128
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,920
- I drew a picture of a house for her as a gift.
- You eat like a kid, you’ve got stuff all over your mouth.

129
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,290
I really put my heart into it.

130
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,500
Thank you.

131
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,920
P’Mind.

132
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,840
I have something to show you.

133
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,490
What is it?

134
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,320
Here.

135
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,420
Open it.

136
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,850
I drew this house to thank you for tutoring me.

137
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,020
You’re my inspiration, P’Mind.

138
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,390
I want to be a great architect like you.

139
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,220
P’Mind.

140
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
You don’t like it?

141
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,790
It’s beautiful.

142
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,500
Who would’ve thought…

143
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,720
that P’Mind, the one I admired,

144
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,290
would betray me.

145
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,020
I don’t know what you were thinking,
but copying someone else’s work for your portfolio—

146
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,320
that’s a very serious matter.

147
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,950
But I drew that myself, Professor.

148
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,220
Look at this.

149
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,190
I was one of the judges in that competition.

150
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,100
I could tell at a glance.

151
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,620
What you did, affects your university admission.

152
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,790
I only found out on the day of my interview.

153
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,180
That P’Mind had submitted my work to the competition
without telling me a thing.

154
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,600
I tried to prove myself.

155
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,540
Tried to show it was my work.

156
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,650
But no one believed me.

157
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,450
While I was disqualified...

158
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,150
from the university I dreamed of,

159
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,960
P’Mind went on to study, became famous,

160
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,220
opened her own company, and got recognition.

161
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,350
Why didn’t you expose her? You still can, you know.

162
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,050
I wanted to.

163
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,220
But there’s no evidence left.

164
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,120
That drawing of the house, I gave it to her long ago.

165
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,620
She has it.

166
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,820
Don’t lose hope yet, sis.

167
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,190
I believe the truth is still the truth.

168
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,020
If you just sit and do nothing, how will you get your revenge?

169
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,390
If there’s anything I can help with, tell me!

170
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,690
I’ll go fight for you myself.

171
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,420
Then you better work hard.

172
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,950
Win against Mind Space in this contest.

173
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,950
Bring it on! Now I’m fired up!

174
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,820
I hate those cheaters!

175
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,590
I’ll kick their asses.

176
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,920
Like this!

177
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,390
What are you laughing at? I was trying to be nice!

178
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,220
So… what about you? What was your first love like?

179
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,440
I forgot.

180
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,260
Don’t lie, or you’re paying for your own meal tomorrow.

181
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,220
Fine, I’ll tell you.

182
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,620
But don’t laugh, okay?

183
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,750
Well…

184
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,290
I once liked someone from a painting.

185
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,850
But I never even saw their face.

186
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,750
Wait—

187
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,920
Hmm?

188
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,350
You mean you liked their art style?

189
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,390
Something like that.

190
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,990
I just felt that

191
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,750
they must be such an interesting person.

192
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,790
Wait—

193
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,950
Uh…

194
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,050
That’s not really love, is it?

195
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,120
That’s just admiration.

196
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,590
More like being a fan.

197
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,920
Don’t judge me like that.

198
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,150
You talk like you’re some kind of love expert.

199
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,020
Well, I know more than you, kid.

200
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,490
I’m going to sleep. I’m tired.

201
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,090
Don’t move, or I’ll send you back to the couch.

202
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,650
[Japanese] - Excuse me.
[Japanese] - Yes?

203
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,890
[Japanese] Where is it?

204
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,820
[Japanese] Straight ahead.

205
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,690
[Japanese] - Thank you!
[Japanese] - You’re welcome!

206
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:19,950
[Japanese] I found this. If anyone’s looking for it, please let me know.

207
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,990
[Japanese] Okay, sure.

208
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,520
[Japanese] Please wait a moment.

209
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,590
[Japanese] Can you include this too?

210
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,990
[Japanese] Of course, gladly.

211
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,820
[Japanese] Thank you so much.

212
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,990
Rin, take some photos outside for me, okay?
I’ll handle the inside.

213
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,250
Okay.

214
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,250
Aokbab

215
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,040
Here.

216
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,760
What now?

217
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,240
A-lua snacks.

218
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,740
I remember you liked them.

219
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,620
It’s fine.

220
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,160
Keep them.

221
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,960
Take them. I bought them for you.

222
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,340
When someone says no, it means no, Khun Mind.

223
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,700
In case you didn’t know, just because she once liked you,

224
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,920
doesn’t mean she still do now.

225
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,760
Not always true.

226
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,540
Sometimes the old things are still the best.

227
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,200
If they were really good, you wouldn’t call them old.

228
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,600
Wake up.

229
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,580
Let’s just live our own lives.

230
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,260
We’re not in a position to talk or give gifts anymore.

231
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,020
You know exactly what you’ve done.

232
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
I know.

233
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,920
That’s why I’m trying to make it right.

234
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,800
There’s no fixing it now, it’s too late.

235
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,460
I hate you.

236
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,860
And I’ll never forgive you.

237
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,440
Can you really hate me?

238
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,900
Why couldn’t we?

239
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,540
Our companies are rivals now, competing against each other.

240
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,280
It’s normal to hate your competitors.

241
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,540
From now on, please stay away from P’Aokbab.

242
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,240
Got it?

243
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,740
Let’s go.

244
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,640
What a waste of time.

245
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,400
Where are you taking me now?

246
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,200
Hey, I just saved you from that old hag.

247
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,900
Aren’t you going to thank me?

248
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,740
I don’t need help from a kid like you.

249
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,200
But I saw it, you froze up back there.

250
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,180
I’ll ask you straight.

251
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,380
Do you want to beat Mind Space?

252
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,540
If you do,

253
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,360
I’ll give you special help.

254
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,900
But there’s one condition.

255
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,280
What condition now?

256
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,940
You have to forget the person named Mind.

257
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,840
Forget that you ever loved her.

258
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,260
If you can do that, I’ll help you win.

259
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,080
That’s your job anyway.

260
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,060
I hired you, pay you a salary, so do it well.

261
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,320
Now get back to work,

262
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,180
so we can finally go home.

263
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,740
Thanks for dropping me off, lady.

264
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,160
Can you really hate me?

265
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,300
That’s why I’m trying to make it right.

266
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,900
Do you want to beat Mind Space?

267
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,640
You have to forget the person named Mind.

268
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,280
If you can do that, I’ll help you win.

269
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,760
Rin.

270
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,840
I agree.

271
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,540
Agree to what?

272
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,340
I’ll erase P’Mind from my life.

273
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,120
I want to defeat Mind Space.

274
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,460
I’ll take back everything that’s mine.

275
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,560
Let’s team up.

276
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,400
Then I’ll be counting on you, sis.

277
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,840
Let’s take down Mind Space together.

278
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,520
Right here, Aunt Joom, make sure this counter is spotless.

279
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:58,690
- Yes.

280
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,380
- And underneath too.
- Yes.

281
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,780
- And underneath too.

282
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,620
Clean up all the snack crumbs, okay?

283
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,590
Spray insecticide everywhere.

284
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,980
- Yes
- Every corner, Auntie.

285
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,050
- Yes, sure.

286
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,960
Especially this area, Auntie Joom.

287
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,500
Clean up all the trash completely.

288
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,420
Don’t let even a single crumb around here.

289
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,460
Please make it spotless!

290
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,540
Bugs Spray extra strong, okay?

291
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,260
Not a single cockroach left.

292
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,450
Yes, cockroaches.

293
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,620
- Cockroaches
- Got it.

294
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,090
Good job, Auntie!

295
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,490
Hahaha!

296
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,450
For real, bro?

297
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,090
Yeah, really.

298
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,990
They asked if I preferred dark roast or medium roast, and I said spicy roast.

299
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,450
Oh wow.

300
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,050
They stopped selling to me immediately.

301
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,420
Haha, serves you right, bro.

302
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,820
Hey.

303
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,890
Wait a sec.

304
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,650
- Whoa,
- Is this really our office?

305
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,120
- Should be.
- Hmm.

306
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,690
Not bad at all.

307
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,490
Hold on.

308
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,620
Did our office ever look this nice?

309
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,790
No way, bro.

310
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,890
From now on, let’s keep it clean, okay?

311
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,590
Time to get to work.

312
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,490
Yes.

313
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,420
Yes, sir.

314
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,850
Hey, get to work, you guys!

315
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,920
- Spread out.
- And keep it clean like my little sis.

316
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,620
Why don’t you keep it clean like her too?

317
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,920
I do sometimes.

318
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,120
I just forget.

319
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,220
Why didn’t you reply to my Line?

320
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,000
What time will you be arriving at the office?

321
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,090
5 a.m.

322
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,020
Sis, that’s 5 a.m.

323
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,980
Who’s even awake to reply at that hour?

324
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,860
Someone like you.

325
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,800
From our on-site visit,

326
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,680
We found several issues, many parts need adjustments.

327
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,260
Khun Rain has already said everything can be modified.

328
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,820
We can add extensions to the house.

329
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,700
Anyone with great ideas, feel free to shared them.

330
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,000
He's very open-minded.

331
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,120
That’s good.

332
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,420
If you're blank, sugar time.

333
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,450
N'Rin, come sit with us.

334
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,090
I’m fine, thanks.

335
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Hey, Rin.

336
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,690
There’s salmon sushi too.

337
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,500
[Japanese] Itadakimasu!
[Ready to eat]

338
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,450
Hey, can we do that again?

339
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,590
One more time.

340
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,450
Yeah.

341
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,390
a, i, What was that again?

342
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,460
Itadakimasu (Let’s eat).

343
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,820
Yeah.

344
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,450
Shall we toast?

345
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,020
Let’s do it.

346
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,440
- Cheers!
- Ahh.

347
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,580
Hmm.

348
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,140
Your boyfriend?

349
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,820
It’s my grandma.

350
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,700
- I’ll be right back.
- I can see it says “Babe.”

351
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,990
P’May, I’m pretty sure it’s just like I said.

352
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,920
- Sure.
- Right?
- For sure.

353
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,020
About what?

354
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,220
Me and Yong.

355
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,320
- We’re guessing Tertis probably has a boyfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,590
Having a boyfriend isn’t weird though, is it?

357
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,900
What’s weird is how sneaky she acts.

358
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,080
And she keeps lying that she doesn’t have one.

359
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,720
So I think she’s seeing someone who’s already taken,

360
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,850
or maybe someone married.

361
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,290
That’s crazy, shouldn't be possible.

362
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,890
If you want to stay in this company, no romance allowed.

363
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,920
Why?

364
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,490
Because you’ll get gossiped and nonstop.

365
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,420
I really hate people who—

366
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,990
Hmm

367
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,320
Don’t judge others, Chan.

368
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,650
You’re the worst gossip of all.

369
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,590
Not just gossiping, you love stirring it up.

370
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,490
Back when Tertis first joined,

371
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,890
you tried to ship her with Yong.

372
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,850
It's me

373
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,850
Who are you shipping Rin with this time?

374
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,320
- Maybe Aokbab.
- Wow.

375
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,860
If everyone spent less time gossiping love lives

376
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,360
and more on working,

377
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,440
we’d have finished ages ago.

378
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,050
- Hello, Pad?

379
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,420
What, an urgent meeting?

380
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,790
- Yeah. Shall we go now?

381
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,690
- Yeah, hurry.
- Yeah, perfect timing.

382
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,650
Yeah, the audit just dropped by.

383
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,380
- Right, let’s go! let’s go!
- Must be a big one.

384
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,250
Keep tomorrow free.

385
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,690
If I knew we're going on-site visit the same day as Jinta,

386
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I wouldn't be go.

387
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Come on, I just want to meet them head on

388
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
So they will know we’re not in the same league.

389
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,820
Too bad Pad isn’t there.

390
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,500
Next time,

391
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,040
At least give me a heads-up first.

392
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,190
Yeah.

393
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,490
I’ll give you a heads-up next time.

394
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,850
Anything else?
I’ve got to get back to the meeting.

395
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,120
That’s all.

396
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,320
I’m here, woo!

397
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,220
You’re late.

398
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Only five minutes, sis.

399
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:07,920
Late is late.

400
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,050
Be on time next time.

401
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,790
Okay~

402
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,390
Didn’t you say we’re going to find inspiration?

403
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,720
For the house design — where?

404
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,190
Right here.

405
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,020
The National Library? Seriously?

406
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,920
Be honest, sis.

407
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,090
Why come to a library for research?

408
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,790
Isn’t it easier to just look up online?

409
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,990
Kids these days only want convenience.

410
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,990
And adults these days love making things harder.

411
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,050
Not everything can be found online, Rin.

412
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,720
Books can give us great ideas.

413
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,850
Sometimes they spark things we’d never think of.

414
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,290
You talk like you’ve been here a lot.

415
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,090
Who did you come here with?

416
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,260
I said focus on the book, not on my face.

417
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,000
Ah, P'Mind! Don’t stare at me.

418
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,090
I’m reading~

419
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,900
You were just looking at me.

420
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,450
I wasn’t!

421
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,660
Then what were you looking at?

422
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,900
The book.

423
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,790
Why are you covering my eyes?

424
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,620
Keep them closed.

425
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,090
Don’t open them.

426
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,560
Hey sis!

427
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,450
What’s wrong? Why did you go silent?

428
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,050
Come on, let’s go find the books.

429
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,520
Everything here’s so old.

430
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,740
Will this even work?

431
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,850
There are both old and new,

432
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,590
Have you even tried looking yet?

433
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,090
Typical kids these days.

434
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,320
You sure like saying that.

435
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,440
So, can you answer now?

436
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,720
Answer what?

437
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,980
The thing I asked earlier.

438
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,990
You still haven’t answered me.

439
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,790
Who did you come here with?

440
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Why do you want to know?

441
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,320
I just wanna know.

442
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,890
Come on, it’s not a secret.

443
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,190
Who did you come here with? Tell me!

444
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,050
Knowing won’t do you any good.

445
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,700
Use your time finding something useful instead.

446
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,790
Extra overtime for me

447
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
You make it worth every penny.

448
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,790
I know who you came here with!

449
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,520
Keep it down. What, Who?

450
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,850
Not telling. I’ll let you wonder.

451
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,390
Can you really forget that Mind?

452
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,300
What kind of question is that?

453
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,940
Answer me first.

454
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,580
Can you really forget?

455
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,560
Look me in the eyes and answer.

456
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,060
Look at me.

457
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,660
Look at me.

458
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:53,850
Hello?

459
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,850
Hey, sis, I’ve got something to tell you.

460
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,220
What is it now?

461
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,420
I’ve got a new idea.

462
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:00,920
Set up a meeting with Khun Rain for me.

463
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:02,850
What for?

464
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,520
Just do it, please.

465
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,420
Trust in Master Rin

466
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,220
It’ll work out for sure.

467
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,450
One hundred percent! Guaranteed!

468
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,800
What on earth are you thinking? Huh?

469
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,320
You’re asking to stay at the client’s house?

470
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,360
Why didn’t you talk to me first?

471
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,120
Good thing I didn’t go along with your crazy plan.

472
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,740
Khun Rain didn’t say anything though.

473
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,700
He just said he'll ask Khun Ming first.

474
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,650
Because no one does that!

475
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,720
Exactly! that’s why we should.

476
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,820
Hey, Khun Rain!

477
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,400
Khun Ming agreed!

478
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,380
She said she loves Rin’s idea.

479
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,220
See? Khun Ming likes it!

480
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,740
Sis, I think we really need to live with our work.

481
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,740
Be surrounded by it to understand what the house needs.

482
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,740
Didn’t you say you wanted to beat Mind Space? This is our chance.

483
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,780
We’ve got to do something different.

484
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,560
Trust me.

485
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,500
You’re crazy.

486
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,940
Crazy! But productive!

487
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,220
Ha, can’t even argue with that. And so she leave.

488
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,620
Careful, or I’ll fire you.

489
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:32,850
Mm-hmm.

490
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,790
Do you really need to bring your coffee drip set?

491
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,820
How long are you staying?

492
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,400
A full week.

493
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,000
Just the two of you?

494
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,260
You sure you can handle that?

495
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,140
Why wouldn’t I?

496
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,060
I raised you, I know you too well.

497
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,280
I know you inside out.

498
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,100
I just don’t want you to have problems with Khun Aokbab.

499
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,220
Don’t worry about that.

500
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,850
We’re not hating each other anymore.

501
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,250
I even wonder what it would be like if we lived together.

502
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,360
Hey, Let's bring the hand cream and give some to her too.

503
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,940
If you get alcohol on you, your skin will peel off.

504
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:32,480
Alcohol, alcohol! Where’s the hand cream?!

505
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,900
- Hello.
- Hello!

506
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,020
Please take care of Rin for me, Khun Aokbab.

507
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,780
Please be patient with my sister.

508
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,090
But if she’s too naughty, you can call and complain with me anytime.

509
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,400
P'Prim!

510
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,920
I’m just afraid Khun Aokbab won’t
be able to stand you and fire you.

511
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,190
I’ll do my best, Khun Prim.

512
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,980
Ugh, you’re just the same, both of you.

513
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,400
Go back inside already.

514
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,100
Aren’t you baking cookies? They’ll burn.

515
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,490
Oh right, I’ll go now.

516
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,720
I’m leaving.

517
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,190
Let's go.

518
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,140
Hey, wait before you go.

519
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,840
I have a condition I want you to follow.

520
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,890
What?

521
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,700
About us staying at Khun Rain’s house.

522
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,460
I want you to keep it a secret.

523
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,060
Don’t let anyone at the company know.

524
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:19,690
Sure, that’s easy. Let’s go.

525
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,390
Oh, Tertis is calling.

526
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,320
Hey, What’s up?

527
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,590
Hey, Rin, can you grab a coffee from me?

528
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,650
I’m not going to the office today, I'm feeling sick. Sore throat.

529
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,220
Ouch.

530
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,490
You’re sick? Where are you going then? You’re in the car right?

531
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,250
I’m going to the hospital, it’s bad.

532
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,620
Okay okay, I won’t bother you. Get well soon.

533
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:58,850
Done.

534
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,420
She's not suspicious, right?

535
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,200
Mhm.

536
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,390
P'Pad!

537
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,020
Just answer it.

538
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,120
It might be something urgent.

539
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,220
Hey! Sis! This is my house!

540
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,390
Hey.

541
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,020
It’s duplicating.

542
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,890
Just in case they are together...

543
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,220
In case Tertis catches it.

544
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,790
What’s up, P'Pad?

545
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,220
Can you reach Chan? He’s not picking up again.

546
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,220
He’s probably out in the woods camping again.

547
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,940
Oh P'Pad, I’m not going to the office this week.

548
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,320
- I’ll be doing work at Khun Rain’s house.
- Oh.

549
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,590
Oh, okay, sure.

550
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,920
Yeah yeah, alright, w-we’ll talk later. Bye.

551
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:02,450
First, let’s make the house feel more alive.

552
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,760
I didn’t think decorating a house would be this tiring.

553
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,040
Way more exhausting than moving stuff in the software.

554
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,220
Hey, why are you leaning on me?

555
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:31,390
I’m tired.

556
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,620
Let me lean on you a bit.

557
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,190
Since we’re—

558
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,420
Already close.

559
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,920
Right?

560
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,720
Just a little, okay?

561
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,420
Aren’t you getting a bit too close?

562
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,990
Mmm.

563
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,420
Well, since we’re already living together—

564
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,220
How about we pretend to be Khun Rain and Khun Mink?

565
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:56,090
For what?

566
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,900
So we can know what it’s like for lovers living under one roof.

567
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,860
What that feels like.

568
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,860
Uh… not really necessary.

569
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,460
It is!

570
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,660
Didn’t you say—

571
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,300
You said you wanted to beat Mind space.

572
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,090
Hey.

573
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,520
Why do you keep bringing that up?

574
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,090
Because it’s true.

575
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,690
You can’t deny it.

576
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,880
I think we should change the dining table.

577
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,960
Since Khun Rain and Khun Mint live here just the two of them,

578
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,980
If we make the table smaller, we’ll have more space.

579
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,600
And the room will feel less cramped.

580
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,050
Why change it though?

581
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,050
A vintage table like this is really rare, you know.

582
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,520
Did you really live in Japan for years?

583
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,760
Well yeah, that’s exactly why—

584
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,200
I know how important usable space is.

585
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,660
Their homes aren’t as spacious as ours.

586
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,490
You have to think carefully before placing any furniture, right?

587
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,690
But you forgot one thing, sis.

588
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,850
Japanese people value their belongings deeply.

589
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,920
They’d never throw away a beautiful table like this—

590
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,920
especially one passed down from their grandmother.

591
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,880
You see this table as a problem.

592
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,860
But I see it differently.

593
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,740
Khun Rain and Khun Ming

594
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,320
maybe they actually like the tight space.

595
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:04,520
Eating right here, with a view of the sea like this—it’s lovely.

596
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,590
What you said does make sense.

597
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,640
But before we decide whether this table,

598
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,340
should stay or not,

599
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,590
it’s your job to design and think it through carefully.

600
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,890
Not just fooling around.

601
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,850
I’m not fooling around.

602
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,320
I’m seriously working.

603
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,420
Who’s fooling around?

604
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,890
Look at my face, so serious!

605
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,250
Hey, What? Where are you going?

606
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,190
The sun, It's hot!

607
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:56,050
You rather looking at me from the left side?

608
00:57:58,690 --> 00:57:59,920
I'll eat in the kitchen instead.

609
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,290
Wow, you’re that embarrassed?

610
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,080
No need to be shy, it’s just us.

611
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,450
Ah! Shit! Shit!

612
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,360
Sis!

613
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,690
Can I sleep here with you?

614
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,790
I’m scared of thunder.

615
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,320
Huh?

616
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,800
I’m scared, sis.

617
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,460
Help me.

618
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,120
Whoa, this bed’s so soft.

619
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,290
Ugh, be quiet, I’m trying to sleep.

620
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:27,850
So grumpy.

621
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,090
Hey, tell me about the company.

622
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,320
If I tell you, you’ll going asleep, won’t you?

623
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,790
I’ll pass out.

624
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,190
Why do you wanna know?

625
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,220
Well, I work here.

626
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,220
I just wanna know the history of the company.

627
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,920
Didn’t you say your mom was the founder?

628
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:00,820
Yeah.

629
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:02,990
My mom was an architect.

630
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,320
The name “Jinta” actually came from my mother’s name.

631
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:18,620
She loved design, and she was an amazing artist.

632
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,200
My brothers and I have been trying to keep this company alive.

633
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,140
Because it’s the last thing she left for us.

634
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,020
So that’s why you’re so good at drawing, huh?

635
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,700
I’ve never shown you my drawing, have I?

636
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,780
You’ve seen any of my drawing?

637
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,280
You graduated architecture from Japan.

638
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,020
Of course you’re good at drawing.

639
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,990
I get it though.

640
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,190
That feeling of wanting to preserved every memory of someone who’s gone.

641
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:23,720
My mom had cancer. She passed away when I was little.

642
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,880
I don’t have any memories of her at all.

643
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,420
I envy you, sis.

644
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,250
You have so many memories of your mom, more than I ever could.

645
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:56,920
But sometimes, when I think about my mom, I actually feel guilty.

646
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:01,650
Guilty about what?

647
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,890
I once promised my mom

648
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,790
that I’d take her to Japan.

649
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,590
But I never got the chance.

650
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,590
After her funeral,

651
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,220
I went back to Japan again.

652
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,740
I went to Kitakyushu—

653
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,700
the place my mom said she wanted to visit.

654
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,120
I tried to follow my mom’s dream.

655
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,220
Until I found a house…

656
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,450
It made me miss her so much I couldn’t even explain it.

657
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:12,450
It felt like she was right there with me.

658
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,720
[Japanese] Here’s the menu.

659
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,380
[Japanese] Are you feeling okay?

660
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,780
[Japanese] Is something wrong?

661
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,660
[Japanese] I’ve lost something very important.

662
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,820
[Japanese] Please wait a moment.

663
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,260
[Japanese] Is this the one?

664
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,840
[Japanese] It was left here in our care.

665
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,000
[Japanese] Thank you so much. What a relief.

666
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,190
Who would’ve thought—

667
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:12,920
that I’d be able to smile again because of a message from a stranger.

668
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:19,890
It’s such a shame.

669
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,490
I never got the chance to thank him.

670
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,460
They didn’t even leave the name—

671
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,460
or any way to contact them.

672
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,060
And if you had the chance—

673
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,180
what would you want to say to them?

674
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,960
I guess…

675
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,960
I’d thank them.

676
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,120
Because that notebook meant so much to me.

677
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,040
I’d tell them that—

678
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,140
the message they wrote…

679
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,140
really gave me the strength to move forward.

680
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,020
After losing my mom.

681
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,120
Do you still remember what the message said?

682
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,620
Of course. It said—

683
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,620
- “I really love your drawings.”
- “I really love your drawings.”

684
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:31,390
“They remind me of my mom who passed away.”

685
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:38,790
“Thank you for creating art like this.”

686
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:50,650
“Please keep drawing.”

687
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,620
How did you know that?

688
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,120
Because I was the one who wrote it to you.

689
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,040
At Kitakyushu, three years ago.

690
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,260
I was the one who found your notebook.

691
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,360
[Japanese] Thank you so much.

692
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,940
Between the two of us—

693
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,640
I guess it really was destiny.

694
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,420
What’s up?

695
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,090
- Oh, my dear sis! Are you home?
- Uh…

696
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,690
Sis, I forgot to ask, how sweet do you want your drink?

697
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,090
Are you sure about this?

698
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,720
Yeah, I’m sure.

699
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,240
“Sure” as in what we think means,

700
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,860
You’re going with Master Rin, just the two of you, right?

701
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:08,490
P’Vee, it’s urgent!

702
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,380
I think this Grab driver’s acting weird.

703
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:16,380
Come on, let me kiss on the cheek.

704
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,120
What’s wrong with you?

705
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,220
My hand slipped!

706
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:30,420
[Music End Credit]

707
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,620
Love, don’t know when it started, but it’s already here.

708
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,080
I don’t quite get why it has to be you.

709
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:51,460
I don't know why, Just seeing you smile feels like a beautiful painting,

710
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:55,660
like colors filling in my heart.

711
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,740
We might not always fit perfectly,

712
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,900
but as long as we’re close—

713
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:07,700
you feel the same, right?

714
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:14,180
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

715
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:18,680
Listen to your heart, you’ll hear the answer is you.

716
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:25,560
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

717
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,400
The one I choose today is you.

718
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,400
How should we love each other?

719
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,440
Let’s design it with our hearts.

720
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,060
Because it’s how we’ll live together,

721
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:50,880
from now on, every day, colored with our love.

722
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:57,000
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,500
Listen to your heart, you’ll hear the answer is you
(The answer is you).

724
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:08,700
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

725
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:14,080
The one I choose today is you.

726
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,460
I want you right here by my side,

727
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,480
Always.
