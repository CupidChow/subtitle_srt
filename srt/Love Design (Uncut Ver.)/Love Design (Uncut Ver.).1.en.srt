[JINTA Architect]

2
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:41,669
Hey, let me join.

3
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:04,675
I'm not fixing it.

4
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:05,949
You have to fix it, Chan.

5
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:06,942
But I'm not going to.

6
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,160
Chan, you have to.

7
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:09,008
This is your project.

8
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,886
Chan, listen to me.

9
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:12,970
Why are you being so unreasonable?

10
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,510
You're being self-centered again.

11
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,965
Revising a design for Feng Shui?

12
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,158
Who is this master anyway?

13
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:18,259
What right does he have to ruin my work?

14
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,764
What about my aesthetics?

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,825
You know the client believes in Feng Shui.

16
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:23,918
I know.

17
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:25,542
But I'm not fixing it.

18
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,702
You have to fix it.

19
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:27,303
I won't.

20
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:28,635
Are you two going to argue much longer?

21
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,320
Aokbab.

22
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,041
So, let me get this straight.

23
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,847
The client already okayed the design...

24
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:59,417
but a Feng Shui master said it had bad energy.

25
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,561
So now the client wants to change the interior design...

26
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:02,857
based on his advice.

27
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:04,390
But Chan refuses to fix it...

28
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,054
because it ruins the look. Correct?

29
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:07,949
Yes.

30
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:09,918
That damn Feng Shui master is ruining my work.

31
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,016
But if you don't fix it, it won't get approved.

32
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,758
The deadline is getting close.

33
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:15,424
I wouldn't call this a revision.

34
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:16,762
This is a complete do-over.

35
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,715
There's no way I can make your deadline.

36
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,249
We're in the same boat here.

37
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:20,905
You...

38
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:22,658
Can you two stop biting each other's heads off?

39
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:23,838
I can't think.

40
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,007
Chan.

41
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:40,142
Try changing the living room's color scheme.

42
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,373
Is that hard?

43
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,772
It's not hard, but I think...

44
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,059
Just do it.

45
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,752
Why don't you give it a try?

46
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:50,297
Didn't the client say they want to enhance the water element?

47
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,234
Try changing the living room's color scheme to light or dark blue.

48
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,615
- Ugh, that's not...
- Chan.

49
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,253
Alright, I'll show you.

50
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:15,982
There, something like this.

51
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,232
Can I see the garden area?

52
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:47,397
Can we try moving these trees?

53
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:48,902
And putting a fountain here instead?

54
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:51,330
- We could, but I think it's...
- Don't argue.

55
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,705
And add 9 koi fish.

56
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,443
- Does it have to be 9?
- Yup.

57
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:07,753
Okay, send it like this.

58
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,442
Show the client a rough draft.

59
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,051
Tell them we've made the enhancements.

60
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,178
The living room is now a blue tone...

61
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:15,371
to boost the water element.

62
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,693
The pond in the north also adds to the water element.

63
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,887
Plus, we've included 9 auspicious koi fish.

64
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,214
Do you think they'll be okay with this?

65
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:22,407
If they are...

66
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,869
we can work on the details.

67
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,049
Ask for an extension.

68
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:27,642
That way, Chan can't complain about the deadline.

69
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:30,403
And Pad, you won't lose the client. Okay?

70
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,984
Well? Is it okay or not?

71
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:37,731
- Okay.
- Totally okay.

72
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,304
Damn, Aokbab is brilliant.

73
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,027
Hey, I think it's okay.

74
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:55,937
It's beautiful.

75
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:06,916
One moment, please.

76
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,649
The client just messaged. The Feng Shui master is okay with it.

77
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,377
We can proceed. And we got an extension.

78
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,872
So, what's the deal with you?

79
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,940
You just got back. Why didn't you go home and rest?

80
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:29,582
Why did you come to the office?

81
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,657
If I hadn't come...

82
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:32,362
you two would probably still be at each other's throats.

83
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,374
What kind of company owner are you?

84
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:36,520
Your management is terrible.

85
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,949
Yeah, Pad, you're the worst.

86
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:39,562
You too, Chan.

87
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,602
Your indie attitude needs a limit.

88
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,998
I know you could have fixed it, but you just wouldn't.

89
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,234
You were just being lazy, weren't you?

90
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,072
And if I hear you two arguing again...

91
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,560
I'm going back to Japan.

92
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,867
Hey, calm down.

93
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,733
We still need your help.

94
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:01,975
So, how long will you be staying to help with the company?

95
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,736
Until the company is no longer a total disaster...

96
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,694
that you two have created.

97
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,837
I don't want our mother's company...

98
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:12,877
to go bankrupt on our watch.

99
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,774
If you feel that way...

100
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,131
you should just stay and help us permanently.

101
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,208
Pad can't handle it anymore.

102
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,325
You're the real problem. Don't make me...

103
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,452
You're much worse than me.

104
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,086
You're the problem...

105
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,409
If you two don't stop arguing...

106
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,601
I'm going to stab you with this fork.

107
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,522
Let me make myself perfectly clear.

108
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,207
I am here...

109
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,722
only to temporarily manage Mom's company.

110
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,041
Once everything is better and the company is out of this crisis,

111
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:41,279
I'm going back to Japan.

112
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,416
Then come help with the design work.

113
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,611
I know how talented you are.

114
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:46,644
Yes.

115
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,313
And you know I stopped drawing a long time ago.

116
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,328
Hey, where are you going?

117
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,847
To the restroom. Wanna come?

118
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:02,186
I thought she was going back to Japan.

119
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:05,247
You're the real problem.

120
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:20,866
[Mind - Pattarasaya Pitiworakul]
[Co-Founder]

121
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:24,522
When it comes to leading architectural firms today,

122
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:27,562
Mind Space is a name that has risen very quickly.

123
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,507
And today, our show has the opportunity...

124
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,402
to speak with a passionate, new-generation architect.

125
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,214
In the world of architecture,

126
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,140
she's considered something of a rare find.

127
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,182
Let's meet her now.

128
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:47,692
The origin of Mind Space?

129
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,018
Well, Mind Space...

130
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,563
didn't start with just me.

131
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,230
I have to thank Mr. Thee, who is my senior,

132
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:55,810
and also the partner who helped establish this company.

133
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,517
I see.

134
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,388
It's incredible. From a small company...

135
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,037
that started with just two people...

136
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,033
in less than 10 years,

137
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:05,160
Mind Space is now...

138
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,666
one of the most renowned names...

139
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,186
in residential design in the country.

140
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:10,761
So, Ms. Mind, do you think...

141
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,460
you have achieved success yet?

142
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,933
I'd rather say the company is growing well.

143
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,542
The word "success"...

144
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,652
feels very limiting to me.

145
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:23,467
I want to keep developing my work...

146
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,372
for all of Mind Space's clients.

147
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,107
Amazing.

148
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,758
Is this a promote?

149
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,342
Hey, are you okay?

150
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,315
Rin.

151
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,614
Come help me with the delivery orders.

152
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:36,186
Okay.

153
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,942
Whoa.

154
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,018
The picture you drew got this many likes?

155
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,563
That's a lot.

156
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,509
Hey.

157
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,099
Go get a real job, Rin.

158
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:11,178
How many years did you study architecture?

159
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,877
So many people have reached out to you with job offers.

160
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,817
Why end up selling coffee with me?

161
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:21,258
I just haven't found a company that feels right.

162
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,941
And recently, a famous company contacted me,

163
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,299
but I just turned them down.

164
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,177
And you have the nerve to be proud of it.

165
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:33,898
Go on.

166
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,606
Make yourself useful for once.

167
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,945
Go pick up the pastries from the next alley for me.

168
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,082
Tell them we'll settle the bill at the end of the month.

169
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:44,122
Making me run errands again.

170
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:45,901
Or would you rather not get paid for it?

171
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,407
Let's go.

172
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:36,902
Hello. What can I get for you?

173
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,828
I'll take two of these, please.

174
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,602
And an Americano to go.

175
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,728
To go?

176
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:51,303
Takeaway.

177
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,011
Okay.

178
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:56,493
That will be 290 baht in total.

179
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:02,728
Done.

180
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:04,841
Please wait a moment.

181
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,375
Here you are.

182
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:32,612
Thank you.

183
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,217
Uh, excuse me.

184
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,012
Has this shop been open long?

185
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,740
About five years.

186
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:41,210
And during those five years, have there been any modifications...

187
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:43,348
or extensions made to the building?

188
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:46,444
No, I don't think so.

189
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,548
It's been like this for as long as I've been here.

190
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:51,736
Judging by the cracks,

191
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,662
it's likely caused by foundation settlement.

192
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:56,399
You should have the structure inspected...

193
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,862
before it gets more dangerous.

194
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,525
The load-bearing structures...

195
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,927
should be reinforced immediately.

196
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,133
From what I can see, the wooden beam is starting to sag.

197
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:04,868
You should add steel or wooden supports...

198
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:06,681
to strengthen the beam.

199
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,860
Also, when I walked into the shop earlier,

200
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,111
the AC didn't feel very cool.

201
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:11,690
You should check the AC's BTU.

202
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:12,985
It's probably not powerful enough.

203
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,038
And have a technician seal the gaps in the wood panels.

204
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,771
That should stop the cool air from escaping.

205
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:19,626
That might help as well.

206
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:22,811

Are you trying to hustle me for a job, lady?

211
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:38,578
Lady?

212
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,467
Who are you referring to? Me?

213
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:42,694
Yeah, you.

214
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:44,694
You're the only "lady" standing here.

216
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,034
It's not going to work.

217
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:49,919
I'm not trying to sell anything.

218
00:15:49,943 --> 00:15:50,998

219
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:52,485
Just walking in and rattling on and on...

220
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,969
and then handing out your company's IG?

221
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:58,124
- I was just offer some advice...
- Don't make excuses.

222
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:59,411
If you're going to renovate a building...

223
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,231
without getting the owner's permission first,

224
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,463
that's illegal.

225
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:03,742
Did you know that?

226
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,429

227
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,224
Are you an architect?

228

You seem to know a lot.

229
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:16,945
I could see you were trying to sell your services from a mile away.

230
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,801
I told you, I wasn't.

231
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,459
Hey, watch your mouth.

232
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,553
Show some respect for your elders.

233
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,765
When you can't win, you play the age card.

234
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:31,749
And do you know something?

235
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,627
Do you know how I got to be this old?

236
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,466
Because I'm not a smart-mouth like you.

237
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,003
That's how I've lived so long.

238
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:40,949
A mouth like that...

239
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,529

Is this your scooter?

243
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:08,659
Yeah.

00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,178
Oops, there are so many of them.

Oh, I forgot.

Well...

00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,154
Recently...

284
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,090
our company has had...

00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:53,268

288
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:58,922
is Mind Space.

289
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,192
Their method is...

290
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,276
they'll bid whatever it takes to undercut everyone else...

291
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:05,396
to steal the clients.

00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,456

there's no way to finish the job.

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,145
Ms. Prae, is there a problem with something?

368
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,968
Because at first, it seemed like you...

369
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,728
were very pleased with our work.

370
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,053
I was.

371
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,659
But now, I'm not.

372
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:31,877
Actually, if there's any part of our work you're not satisfied with,

373
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:34,098
we can provide another revised draft for you...

374
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,851
at no additional charge.

375
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,011
You should go, Ms. Aokbab.

376
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:40,246
I'll settle the remaining payment as soon as possible.

377
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,264
May I ask for the real reason?

378
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:48,763
Did another company...

379
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,756
offer you a better price than us, Ms. Prae?

380
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:01,223
[Ms. Mind, Mind Space]

381
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,127
[Ms. Mind, Mind Space]

382
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:20,546
I hope we'll have the chance to work together again in the future.

383
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:29,866
Hey, Thee.

384
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:32,878
What's the situation with the new hire you're sending to help my team?

385
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,338
So I can brief my team properly.

386
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,491
At first, I was aiming for a kid named Rin,

387
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:37,903
the award-winning one.

388
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,410
But she refused to work with us.

389
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:41,555
So I got someone else.

390
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,846
But this person is okay too.

391
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,326
I'll have HR send you their resume.

392
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:45,649
Why?

393
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:46,880
Was the salary not high enough?

394
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,535
No.

395
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,484
She just said she didn't want to work with Mind Space.

396
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,864
A rookie dared to reject us?

397
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,431
Forget it. It's just one person.

398
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,206
Remember this, Mind.

399
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:01,556
If you want to grow,

400
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,413
don't waste your time on just one person.

401
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,201
And if you want something,

402
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,074
take the whole company.

403
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,939
Can you stop buying other companies?

404
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:12,884
We can barely manage what we have.

405
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,117
We have so much work already.

406
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,776
We don't have that many people to manage it.

407
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:18,667
If we start losing money,

408
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:20,393
we're all going to be exhausted.

409
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:22,641
Hey, don't worry.

410
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,925
I can handle it.

411
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,740
I'll make Mind Space a national name.

412
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,394
Trust me.

414
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,277
I forgot I don't need one.

415
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,426
It's a new model.

416
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:27,368
Not old like you, lady.

417
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,799
It's all because of that damn brat.

[JINTA Architect]

419
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,199
Okay, everyone's here.

420
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:52,654
I've called this meeting today...

421
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:54,976
because I have good news and bad news.

422
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:56,509
Let's start with the good news.

423
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,292
Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink,

424
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,319
the famous high-society couple...

425
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:02,933
Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink...

426
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,431
want to renovate their vacation home.

427
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:07,597
The bad news is...

428
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,266
we have to win the pitch against other firms.

429
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:13,728
Only then will we get this project.

430
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:18,297
Even though it's a small project,

431
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,982
just renovating one house,

432
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,303
everyone must remember that Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink...

433
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,250
are well-known public figures.

434
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:25,798
They have a lot of connections.

435
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:27,916
This means if we get this project,

436
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:31,463
our company has a chance to get many jobs from them in the long run.

437
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:37,092
So who will be the lead on this project?

438
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:38,838
I was planning to have Yong take care of it.

439
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,326
I don't think I can handle it.

440
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,239
Anyone else?

441
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:48,348
Is this all the architects we have?

442
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:51,088
Actually, I've already posted job openings.

443
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,134
But no one has applied yet.

444
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,959
I have a close friend.

445
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:05,586
She's so good that our classmates called her 'Master Rin'.

446
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:07,994
In class, she was always in competitions.

447
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:09,505
She swept up awards every year.

448
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:11,216
She's getting famous on IG right now.

449
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,246
I think I've seen her before.

450
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:29,357
I really like her work.

451
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,914
What do you think?

452
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:04,122
Tertis,

453
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:05,790
could you contact her for us?

454
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:09,661
Yes.

455
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,706
But...

456
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:16,826
there's one thing I have to tell you first.

457
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,976
Thee, are you really asking me to oversee a single-house renovation?

458
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,757
There are so many other major projects.

459
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:34,476
Can't a smaller team handle this?

460
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,404
It's not just any house.

461
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:39,301
It's Mr. Rain's house.

462
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:40,682
That's why I want you to be in charge.

463
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:46,518
Which other companies are pitching for this job?

464
00:30:50,911 --> 00:30:52,374
This is so damn annoying.

465
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,746
Mr. Rain also invited JINTA.

466
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:56,827
I really hate that bastard Pad.

467
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:58,221
And his weirdo brother.

468
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:04,327
Anyway, Mind,

469
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,318
I'm leaving this project in your hands.

470
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:07,781
As for the pitching day,

471
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,286
we'll decide later if you'll go or not.

472
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,019
Got it.

473
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:20,517
I heard that Pad brought his younger sister...

474
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,142
back to help at the company.

475
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:31,238
How did you know?

476
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:33,142
Vee told me.

477
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,507
So I did some digging.

478
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:37,128
It seems his sister flew back from Japan...

479
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:38,739
specifically to help with the company.

480
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,196
In that case,

481
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:45,615
I'll go to the pitch myself.

482
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,274
I'm counting on you.

483
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:06,501
Here's your drink, customer.

484
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,254
You took your time.

485
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:09,768
You're lucky I brought it to you at all.

486
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:10,714
Tip me.

487
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:12,061
Thank you.

488
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:17,879
It's sour. Is this spoiled?

489
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:19,619
Then don't eat it.

490
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:31,369
Sushi from near the university.

491
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:33,086
Your favorite place.

492
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:38,153
Bringing me an offering like this...

493
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:40,961
What do you want? Spit it out.

494
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:42,694
Okay, I'll be direct.

495
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:45,344
As someone who's been your friend since freshman year...

496
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:48,102
please let me finish before you freak out.

497
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:55,206
Still tastes amazing.

498
00:32:56,431 --> 00:32:57,804
Fine. Go ahead.

499
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,634
Right now,

500
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:02,100
my company is looking for a new architect.

501
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:04,226
Your skills are god-tier...

502
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:06,972
and you happen to have the exact qualifications we're looking for.

503
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:09,307
I want to invite you to work with us. Interested?

504
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:11,657
You know...

505
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,977
that I don't want to join any company.

506
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:16,205
Rin.

507
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:17,782
Let me ask you seriously.

508
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:19,712
Why won't you get a job?

509
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,236
You're so talented.

510
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:23,261
Why keep all that skill to yourself?

511
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,633
I just haven't found a company I like.

512
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:27,637
You might like my company.

513
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:29,966
Come on.

514
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,786
At least give it a chance.

515
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,538
Just talk to my boss first, can you?

516
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,547
How about this?

517
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:42,274
For the sake of our friendship since freshman year...

518
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:45,788
The Pritt glue, the Nitto tape,

519
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:46,741
the foam board,

520
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:47,716
the steel ruler you borrowed from me...

521
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,029
and never replaced...

522
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:50,508
See how much money I lost?

523
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:51,627
I never asked for it back.

524
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:54,273
And all the sushi you stole from me for four years...

525
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:55,411
I never asked for that back either.

526
00:33:57,684 --> 00:33:58,737
Fine, I'll do it.

527
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:04,695
You said it.

528
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:06,521
Don't you dare take it back.

529
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,679
But I'm only agreeing to talk.

530
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,711
I'm not promising I'll join the company.

531
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:13,033
That's up to you.

532
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,414
My boss graduated from Japan, you know.

533
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,939
Now that's a little more interesting.

534
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:30,821
What day are you free?

535
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,549
I'll set up a meeting at the office for you.

536
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,008
Who said I was coming to your office?

537
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:38,335
Huh?

538
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:39,467
If not at the office,

539
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,026
how are you going to talk to my boss?

540
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:50,786
Rin...

541
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,085
You want me to go to her?

542
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,161
Yes.

543
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:08,076
If they want me,

544
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,523
they have to come to me.

545
00:35:10,813 --> 00:35:12,942
If you really want to hire her,

546
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,141
Ms. Aokbab has to go see her in person.

547
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,732
Only then will she agree to talk.

548
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:26,011
Is this how people work in Thailand?

549
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,450
This is ridiculous.

550
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,788
The employee makes the employer come to them.

551
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,747
But we're the ones who want to hire her, right, Aokbab?

552
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,128
It wouldn't be that strange to go see her.

553
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,538
Just go and try.

554
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,131
I did some research.

555
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,845
Mr. Rain follows 'Master Rin' on Instagram.

556
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:50,217
That means Mr. Rain...

557
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,570
is a fan of Master Rin's work.

558
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,651
If we can get this kid to work with us,

559
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:57,878
it means our chances of winning will increase.

560
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,086
But if you won't do it for me,

561
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,796
do it for the numbers in our bank account.

562
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,923
Red.

563
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,190
Red.

564
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:12,710
Red.

565
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,276
Red.

566
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:16,503
Alright, alright!

567
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:17,838
I'll go.

568
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,807
Okay, I'll send you the location.

569
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:21,448
Aren't you coming with me?

570
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:24,181
Rin said the boss has to come alone.

571
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:27,976
Also, I bought you some pastries from Rin's shop.

572
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,000
Excuse me.

573
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:35,399
You, I'm not playing. Please let me through.

574
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,374
Hey! What's your problem?

575
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:38,381
Let go.

576
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:39,897
Let go.

577
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:40,884
Let go!

578
00:37:41,877 --> 00:37:43,330
What is wrong with you?

579
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:51,975
Hey, you!

580
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:53,865
You, are you okay?

581
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:54,736
You!

582
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,743
Rin!

583
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,233
Rin!

584
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,177
How do I open this?

585
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,483
Where is it?

586
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,836
Rin! Rin!

587
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:29,713
How are you? Are you feeling better?

588
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:50,891
Lady. What are you doing here?

589
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,568
Rin! Address her properly.

590
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:56,427
Please forgive my sister's behavior.

591
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,323
Prim, why are you apologizing?

592
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:02,389
This lady clearly attacked me.

593
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:04,531
It's more like you did it to yourself.

594
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:06,311
Who's the one acting weird,

595
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,133
standing in the sun in a hot costume?

596
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:10,863
If she hadn't helped you,

597
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,916
you'd be in the hospital by now.

598
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,267
What are you here for?

599
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,468
I'm Tertis's boss.

600
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:24,893
Then you can leave.

601
00:39:27,624 --> 00:39:28,978
I'm not talking.

602
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,194
We need to talk.

603
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:38,603
Sit.

604
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,352
I'll go get some water for you.

605
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:01,330
The reason I came here today...

606
00:40:01,671 --> 00:40:04,085
is because I want to recruit you to work for our company,

607
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:05,483
at JINTA Architect.

608
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:06,721
Give me a reason.

609
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,234
Why?

610
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,170
Our company...

611
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,482
particularly admires your style and your work.

612
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,398
We see that you have potential...

613
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,749
and would be a perfect fit for one of our projects.

614
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,627
So you're saying...

615
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,752
I'm talented, right?

616
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,381
Let's just say you have what our company needs.

617
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:34,005
In that case,

618
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:36,679
lady, try praising me first.

619
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,206
Say that I'm talented.

620
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:46,298
If you don't say it...

621
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:48,218
you can just leave.

622
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,455
Fine.

623
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,564
As a fellow architect,

624
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:06,652
I admit that you are skilled.

625
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,310
Are you satisfied now?

626
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:10,802
Satisfied.

627
00:41:10,826 --> 00:41:12,060
Very satisfying.

628
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:13,706
But...

629
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:17,334
I'm not going to work for your company, lady.

630
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:19,559
Honestly?

631
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,858
Every company that's approached me is the same.

632
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:22,971
Including yours.

633
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,096
Our JINTA Architect is not like the others.

634
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,203
How is it different?

635
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,456
What makes it so special?

636
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,863
Did you add an egg or something?

637
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:38,452
It's true.

638
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:41,562
Our company might not be more special than others.

639
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:44,602
It's just one small company.

640
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:51,736
Our company grew...

641
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,061
from my mother's love for design.

642
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,207
Even though my mother has passed away,

643
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:05,586
we are trying to carry on her legacy.

644
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:08,688
We always strive to do our best work.

645
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,973
Our company works like a family.

646
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,959
I promise you,

647
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:35,672
that I will be fair to all our employees.

648
00:42:35,696 --> 00:42:37,938
Including you, if you agree to work with us.

649
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:39,666
What do you think?

650
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,658
Are you interested in working with us?

651
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,763
I am interested.

652
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:18,171
Let's go.

653
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:28,862
Lady.

654
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:30,880
I have something to tell you.

655
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:33,880
What is it?

656
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:37,527
What you just said...

657
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,207
it was really good.

658
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:41,523
I really liked it.

659
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:43,168
The way you talked about your company.

660
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:55,011
But I would never work with you.

661
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:58,745
Go sell your dream to someone else.

662
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:00,421
Bye-bye.

663
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:12,944
This bag is expensive!

664
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:16,012
You little brat.

665
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:22,253
[JINTA Architect]

666
00:44:22,278 --> 00:44:23,379
Look at this.

667
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:25,874
This is getting weird.

668
00:44:25,898 --> 00:44:27,058
How did it go?

669
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:30,396
What do they think I am? Made of stone?

670
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,047
They keep asking to hold. For what?!

671
00:44:35,754 --> 00:44:37,550
Don't tell me there's more bad news.

672
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,560
It's the client.

673
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:43,658
Another one just called to put their project on hold.

674
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:45,930
But what about you?

675
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:47,401
How did your talk with Master Rin go?

676
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:50,983
Don't say that kid's name again.

677
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:54,761
Oh. Why?

678
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:02,441
Ms. Aokbab.

679
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,201
How did it go?

680
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:09,690
It is what it is.

681
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:11,018
Tertis.

682
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,110
What now?

683
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:14,340
Is there any way...

684
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:16,185
to make your friend change her mind?

685
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:17,944
Well...

686
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:20,505
Rin is a big foodie.

687
00:45:20,836 --> 00:45:22,744
Last time, I had to bring her a food offering.

688
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,026
That's the only reason she agreed to talk.

689
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:25,401
How about this?

690
00:45:25,694 --> 00:45:27,863
Why don't you try taking her out for a nice meal?

691
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:28,949
She might soften up.

692
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:30,590
She lives for food.

693
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:33,607
So now I have to take that brat out for a meal?

694
00:45:33,632 --> 00:45:34,733
For what?

695
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:36,059
For our company.

696
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:37,782
Just keep this in mind.

697
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,248
Mr. Rain likes Master Rin's work.

698
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:41,741
If we get her,

699
00:45:41,765 --> 00:45:43,024
our company will be saved.

700
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:44,447
Didn't you say it yourself?

701
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:46,129
That you came back to manage the company?

702
00:45:46,338 --> 00:45:48,470
This is management.

703
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,892
You have to fight for it.

704
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:51,571
Just remember: for the company.

705
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:53,649
For the company, for the company.

706
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:56,173
We absolutely have to get her?

707
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:57,912
Isn't there a better option?

708
00:45:58,014 --> 00:45:58,818
Yes.

709
00:45:58,842 --> 00:45:59,869
For the company.

710
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:11,231
Fine.

711
00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:14,212
I'll do it for Mom's company.

712
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:16,018
But as soon as this job is done,

713
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:18,171
I'm going back to Japan.

714
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:19,989
Hey!

715
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:39,814
Prim, let's eat. I'm hungry.

716
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,279
Lady, what are you doing here again?

717
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:54,931
Let's go eat.

718
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:57,099
I know a really delicious restaurant.

719
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,667
Not going.

720
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,278
Prim already made dinner for me.

721
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:03,217
Oops, it's all spilled. No dinner for you now.

722
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:04,529
You'll have to find something to eat on your own.

723
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:06,786
What are you doing?

724
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:10,709
Let's go. I'm sure you'll like it.

725
00:47:13,614 --> 00:47:14,778
Not going.

726
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:15,831
Not eating.

727
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:17,049
Not hungry.

728
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,157
Hey, don't think I'm going to cook for you.

729
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:21,872
I'm tired and sleepy.

730
00:47:21,896 --> 00:47:23,156
I'm about to close the shop.

731
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:25,571
You're totally forcing my hand.

732
00:47:26,294 --> 00:47:27,586
So, are you going or not?

733
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,742
Fine, I'll go.

734
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:38,229
But, absolutely no talking about work.

735
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:39,389
- Got it?
- Deal.

736
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:42,752
Where are you going?

737
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,017
To get my bag.

738
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:48,815
Please take care of Rin for me.

739
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:11,233
Hey.

740
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:12,995
Why aren't you getting out?

741
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:14,274
Aren't you hungry?

742
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,727
Hurry up, I'm about to lock the car.

743
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:36,785
We're here. Come on in.

744
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,258
Ah, welcome.

745
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,917
Please wait a moment.

746
00:49:05,941 --> 00:49:07,919
Ahh.

747
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:09,179
Hello.

748
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:10,481
Please take care of us.

749
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:12,022
Thank you for the great service.

750
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:13,929
It's our pleasure.

751
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:18,342
Is this the lady who you said likes Japanese food?

752
00:49:19,078 --> 00:49:20,451
Yes, she is.

753
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:26,114
Then please have a seat right here.

754
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,005
Please.

755
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,113
Okay.

756
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,112
You speak Japanese quite well.

757
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:46,546
Here you are. Fried tofu in broth,

758
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,082
sashimi,

759
00:49:49,107 --> 00:49:51,206
and salmon roe sushi,

760
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,132
and eel sushi.

761
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:55,571
Yes.

762
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:58,939
Please, enjoy your meal.

763
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:06,441
- I'll enjoy having this.
- I'll enjoy having this.

764
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:11,339
Why are you copying me?

765
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:12,890
You're the one who's copying me.

766
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,489
Do you know what the heart of Japanese cuisine is?

767
00:50:39,284 --> 00:50:40,171
What?

768
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:42,563
Simplicity.

769
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:45,201
There's no need for excessive seasoning.

770
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,829
It focuses on highlighting the flavor of the ingredients.

771
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:51,199
So we get to taste their true essence.

772
00:50:53,454 --> 00:50:55,467
Makes sense, since you graduated from Japan.

773
00:50:58,734 --> 00:51:00,081
Of course.

774
00:51:06,526 --> 00:51:08,093
So, how did you know?

775
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:10,043
That I like Japanese food?

776
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,890
Hey.

777
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,382
Ms. Aokbab?

778
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:33,129
Is Rin at the shop right now?

779
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,632
Yes, she is. Is something wrong?

780
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:41,169
I'd like to invite her out for a dinner.

781
00:51:41,194 --> 00:51:43,960
And I was hoping to discuss work with her again.

782
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:49,267
Then, I'll help you, Ms. Aokbab.

783
00:51:50,419 --> 00:51:51,973
Thank you so much.

784
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:55,189
Ms. Prim,

785
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,860
Actually,

786
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:00,088
I've been meaning to ask you since this afternoon.

787
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:03,545
Did you design this shop yourself?

788
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,000
It's very lovely.

789
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:07,630
I didn't expect to find a shop like this around here.

790
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:09,541
It wasn't me.

791
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,240
Rin was the one who designed it.

792
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:14,413
At first, she wanted a Japanese style.

793
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,416
Because she's really into Japanese things.

794
00:52:16,441 --> 00:52:18,571
But I prefer a Cottage style.

795
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:20,853
She was very accommodating.

796
00:52:21,194 --> 00:52:22,908
So we agreed that,

797
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:25,145
she would do the drafting herself.

798
00:52:25,254 --> 00:52:28,041
And she supervised almost all of the construction.

799
00:52:28,165 --> 00:52:29,832
And another thing,

800
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:32,405
she tried to design everything,

801
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,697
exactly as I wanted.

802
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,765
Here you go. Please.

803
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:06,318
It's very delicious.

804
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:14,553
No.

805
00:53:14,577 --> 00:53:16,153
Try saying it again.

806
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:17,599
Slowly.

807
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:27,159
It's very delicious.

808
00:53:31,593 --> 00:53:33,659
It's very delicious.

809
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,076
It's very delicious.

810
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:39,227
It's very...

811
00:53:39,251 --> 00:53:40,300
It's very...

812
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:41,293
It's very...

813
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:42,277
It's very...

814
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,263
It's very delicious.

815
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:47,178
It's very delicious.

816
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:48,547
Stop it, lady. Are you messing with me?

817
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:49,843
I said it right the first time.

818
00:53:50,348 --> 00:53:51,529
I said it right.

819
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:58,726
Thank you.

820
00:53:59,514 --> 00:54:01,001
You could speak Thai and didn't say so.

821
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:07,328
This is plum wine.

822
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:11,053
My wife brewed it herself.

823
00:54:11,893 --> 00:54:12,983
This...

824
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,205
is a complimentary treat for our special customers.

825
00:54:16,229 --> 00:54:17,930
One glass each.

826
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,812
Thank you.

827
00:54:45,236 --> 00:54:46,676
About my offer...

828
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,163
will you reconsider it?

829
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,464
I really do like your work.

830
00:54:52,773 --> 00:54:54,310
I thought we weren't going to talk about work.

831
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:57,425
Please think about it.

832
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:59,191
I'll be waiting for your answer.

833
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:24,796
How about this, lady?

834
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:28,491
Let's have a competition.

835
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:31,255
What kind of competition?

836
00:55:32,691 --> 00:55:34,698
Finish this entire jar of plum wine.

837
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:37,061
If you can hold your liquor...

838
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,011
I might consider working for you.

839
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:48,218
But if you lose, it's over.

840
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:53,612
You're on.

841
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:02,842
Can I buy this whole jar?

842
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:04,491
Okay!

843
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:08,566
The wine's all gone.

844
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:10,414
What now?

845
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,015
If it's gone, order more.

846
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:21,584
Chef!

847
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:24,665
Bring us the strongest liquor in the house!

848
00:57:25,507 --> 00:57:26,708
Right away!

849
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:28,931
A legend is born!

850
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:32,478
Cheers!

851
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:34,670
Next up is sake!

852
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:37,447
Cheers!

853
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,238
How about this?

854
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,863
Whoever can stand up straight...

855
00:57:56,422 --> 00:57:57,662
is the winner.

856
00:57:58,377 --> 00:57:59,236
Deal.

857
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,961
On the count of three,

858
00:58:00,986 --> 00:58:02,475
whoever can stand up straight...

859
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,693
wins.

860
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:08,192
One...

861
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:09,356
Two...

862
00:58:10,974 --> 00:58:12,194
Three!

863
00:58:25,748 --> 00:58:26,708
Look.

864
00:58:35,582 --> 00:58:37,536
So weak.

865
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,716
Why did you kick me?

866
00:59:59,918 --> 01:00:01,825
Lady, what are you doing?

867
01:00:02,093 --> 01:00:03,514
And how did I get here?

868
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:05,098
Whose clothes are these?

869
01:00:05,551 --> 01:00:06,977
They're my clothes.

870
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,578
Why are you wearing them?

871
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:10,538
How should I know?

872
01:00:14,576 --> 01:00:15,985
What happened?

873
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,447
Is it possible to fall in love by a drawing?

874
01:01:19,404 --> 01:01:20,778
You're the one who should thank me.

875
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,090
Otherwise, you would've been sleeping on the street.

876
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:24,550
Regarding the offer you asked about,

877
01:01:24,575 --> 01:01:26,261
I have an answer now.

878
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:27,930
I'll work with you.

879
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,885
We still need Rin's help, Aokbab.

880
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,353
Try to be nice to her.

881
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:32,352
Fine, whatever.

882
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,269
Ms. Aokbab,

883
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:36,687
Mr. Rain's secretary wants to meet with you urgently.

884
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:37,970
Make yourselves comfortable.

885
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,970
We're just waiting for one more team.

886
01:01:41,154 --> 01:01:43,161
Hello, Mr. Rain, Ms. Mink.

887
01:01:45,308 --> 01:01:47,628
I think we'll be meeting a lot more after this.
