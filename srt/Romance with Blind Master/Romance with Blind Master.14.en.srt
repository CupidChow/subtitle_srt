00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,350
Hey, Xinxin.

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,280
How is it?

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,430
Don't worry.

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,310
Ren Haoming

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,140
was fully under my control.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,640
Didn't he suspect you?

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,370
You must not let him find out.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,400
Everything is under control.

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
I have something to do.

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,580
Bye.

14
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,660
Xinxin.

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,300
Xinxin!

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,670
Haoming.

17
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,990
To celebrate

18
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,520
your eyes recovery,

19
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,550
I made this cake for you by myself.

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,080
Thank you.

21
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,790
Why is it so dark?

22
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,430
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,740
I'm not that delicate.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,390
Come on.

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,320
Try it.

26
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,620
Thank you for your effort.

27
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,850
As long as you're happy,

28
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,610
I am happy too.

29
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,860
Maybe next time.

30
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,650
I have a meeting tomorrow.

31
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,540
Be good.

32
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,380
Rest early.

33
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,089
I wonder how he is.

34
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,190
He should be awake.

35
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,560
Will he look for me everywhere?

36
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,870
He won't think

37
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,350
that I would be at such a horrible place, right?

38
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,770
Hello, everyone.

39
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm going to announce

40
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,240
an important news today.

41
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,270
The news is

42
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,430
Ren's Group and Ruan's Jewelry

43
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,260
will participate in the International Jewelry Contest together.

44
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,110
We also urge

45
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,659
more passion jewelry designers

46
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,520
to join us

47
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,090
and bring our jewelry design to new height.

48
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,610
You have stolen my life.

49
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,500
So this is your plan.

50
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,980
You are...

51
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,750
I'm old.

52
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,260
It's time for me to rest

53
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,680
and play golf sometimes.

54
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,780
I'll leave the company business

55
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,620
to you.

56
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,990
Don't worry, Father.

57
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,350
Your brother

58
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,830
has turned himself in.

59
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,710
The money is at the door.

60
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,700
Come out and get it yourself.

61
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:53,900
Okay.

62
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,990
I'll be right there.

63
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,700
Don't tell me that you have infectious disease.

64
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm just having an allergy.

65
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,870
You are allergic to money?

66
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,230
None of your business.

67
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,130
Let me count it for you.

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,130
You look quite suffering.

69
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,230
What are you trying to pull?

70
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,430
I'm already like this.

71
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,880
What can I do?

72
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm just too bored.

73
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,659
There are only a few TV channels.

74
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,120
What era is it now?

75
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,040
Why are they still trading with cash?

76
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,250
Cash

77
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,960
is not easy

78
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,700
to be traced, I guess.

79
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,280
Of course

80
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,620
I know!

81
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,840
Why are you rubbing so hard?

82
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,190
Do you have a grudge against money?

83
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,070
Where are my ID and phone?

84
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,710
You want to keep quiet?

85
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,310
Okay, I'll tell you.

86
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,200
Xinxin.

87
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,160
Are you looking for me?

88
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,240
Where is Ruan Qingtian?

89
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,170
We

90
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,870
sent her abroad, didn't we?

91
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,750
Look at this.

92
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,840
How dare you lie to me!

93
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,540
You don't even know

94
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,730
where Ruan Qingtian is now.

95
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,960
Xinxin.

96
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,380
Qingtian is also my child.

97
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,320
How could I harm her?

98
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,320
Boss.

99
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,650
Ruan Qingtian is gone.
