About the price,

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,310
you've raised five base points again.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
It's our honor

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,970
to work with Ren's Group.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,110
We only want the best and the most expensive.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,540
Mr. Wang, you're so generous!

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,550
I heard that Mr. Wang is here.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,470
I guess

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,550
I didn't disturb you, did I?

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,840
Haoming.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,170
Why are you here?

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,300
I was in a meeting.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,760
Isn't it inappropriate for you

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,730
to just walk in like this?

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,320
Luoke has always been maintaining high standard

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,650
in jewelry purchase.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,010
Mr. Wang,

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,890
you have a discerning eye.

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,710
I believe you must be interested

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,470
in my work.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,600
You have a new design?

25
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,950
This is a design from five years ago.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,550
It was the first design

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,320
from the designer, Olivia, when he debuted.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,950
Why is it in his hand?

29
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,640
This is the best thing I've ever seen in China.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,100
Amazing.

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,110
This work is called The Origin.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,940
Not only is the design concept advanced,

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,320
and unique,

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,259
it can make people appreciate it to the fullest.

35
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,640
It is indeed valuable like someone's first dream.

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,200
I can't believe that this was designed five years ago.

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,340
I really want to meet the designer.

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,240
No one knows

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,160
the real identity of Olivia.

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,900
If you're interested,

41
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,100
I have

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,890
another work from her.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,990
Really?

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,310
I got it from an online auction a few days ago.

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,860
This work is called

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,020
the True Love series.

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,130
He actually bought that set too.

48
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,320
He is my die-hard fan, isn't he?

49
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,020
Mr. Wang,

50
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,829
should we

51
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,210
deal with the current business?

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,329
Sorry.

53
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,670
I think

54
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,240
I need to reconsider

55
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,990
our cooperation.

56
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,770
What's wrong?

57
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,280
Is the contract not going well?

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,050
Ren Haoming has a trump card.

59
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,570
Since he's hard to deal with,

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,780
we can deal with Ruan Xinxin first.

61
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,960
After all, she cares about

62
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,560
that old man the most.

63
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,740
Do you remember what you asked me before?

64
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,500
Guang Hua, Hua Nan, Shun Tian.

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,329
These three hospitals

66
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,720
are all invested by Ren Group.

67
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,980
You know what to do, right?

68
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,930
Do you like watching movies like this?

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,330
I pressed it by accident.

70
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,080
Do you know

71
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,840
if Olivia is a man or a woman?

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,330
A woman.

73
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,610
How did you know?

74
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,320
Men can't draw this kind of design.

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,480
Well,

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,170
do you like her?

77
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
Are you jealous?

78
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,920
Impossible!

79
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,370
What if she's an old lady?

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,890
Hello, doctor.

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,940
How is my dad

82
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,880
this week?

83
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,870
Your father has been transferred today.

84
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,100
Where is he transferred to?

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,500
Well...

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,700
I don't know either.

Isn't this the hospital arranged by Haoming?

89
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
Where else can he go?

90

I don't know.

Hello, Haoxuan.

93

I've searched all the three hospitals

94

but still can't find him.

95
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,460
Okay, I got it.

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,850
Let's go.

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,530
Miss Ruan.

98
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,200
Don't be nervous.

99
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,010

Miss Ruan.

He is right here.

104
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,909
Don't worry.

105
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,730
The doctor just checked.

106
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,050
Your dad is out of danger.

107

Just now, Ruan Xinxin took someone to the hospital

108
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,070
and wanted to take dad away.

109
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,000
That's why I'm prepared earlier.

110
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,400
Thank you.

111

In future,

112
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,330
don't come out alone at night.

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,300
just leave it to me.
