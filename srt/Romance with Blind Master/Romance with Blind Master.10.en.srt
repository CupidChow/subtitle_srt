4
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,230
Why is there a power outage?

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,580
A power outage?

6
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,300
Ren Haoming?

7
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,440
Ren Haoming?

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,110
What's wrong?

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,110
The power is out.

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,420
It's okay. I'm here.

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,070
Where is the electricity box?

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,860
It's at downstairs.

13
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,650
Let me take you there.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,830
Okay.

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,510
Be careful.

16
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,310
What's wrong?

17
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,300
My phone is dead.

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,890
Here.

19
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,509
Give me your hand.

20
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:39,530
I'll take you there.

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,710
Be careful.

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,680
Be careful.

23
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:53,990
Here's another flight of stairs.

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,180
I kind of like power outage.

25
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,820
Why?

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,380
Let's go.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,450
In the dark,

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,220
we have nothing different.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,520
But I'm afraid of the dark.

30
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,870
Then I can take care of you.

31
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,730
We are at the switching room.

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,770
Watch out for the step.

33
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,470
I saw it.

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,770
You've taken care of me a lot.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,250
Move your flashlight to the left.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Lower.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,500
Lower.

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,620
A little higher.

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,290
And...

40
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,940
And what?

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,350
What's wrong?

42
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,610
You have to hurry.

43
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,910
We're out of tricks.

44
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,660
Ren Haoming's personal seal.

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,550
What are you going to do with it?

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,140
I know this villa well.

47
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,170
I know where the switch is.

48
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,530
I found it.

49
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,800
I really fell in love with him.

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,020
But he's Ruan Xinxin's fiance.

51
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,700
The swap of our identities will be found out

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,740
sooner or later.

53
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,040
What should I do?

54
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,990
Help me.

55
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,070
Bend down.

56
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,680
The company will have a meeting later.

57
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,260
Come with me.

58
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,430
Why should I go to your company's meeting?

59
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,600
Aren't you one of us?

60
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,990
I need to get changed.

61
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,610
How can I change my clothes if you are here?

62
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,900
No worries.

63
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,680
I am blind.

64
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,440
I asked you all here today

65
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,160
because I have something to announce.

66
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,250
Is Haoming going to get promoted?

67
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,330
In the past two years,

68
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,250
Haoming has managed the subsidiary.

69
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,570
He has made great progress.

70
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,659
He has attracted many clients

71
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,820
for our company.

72
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,250
I'm really glad.

73
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,340
I want

74
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,510
Haoming to return to the headquarters

75
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,980
to be the general manager.

76
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,120
Do you have

77
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,590
any objections?

78
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,990
Like father, like son.

79
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,580
His cooperation with Luoke Group

80
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,500
brought our design

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,980
to a new height.

82
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Everyone knows how capable Haoming is.

83
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,230
I have no objections.

84
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,170
With Haoming's help,

85
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,460
the stock price of our Group

86
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,340
increased by 50%

87
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,570
in half a year.

88
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,970
Everyone is happy.

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,020
Thank you all.

90
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,990
Objection!

91
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,160
Ren Haoming colluded with outsiders in private

92
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,790
to sell the company's shares at a low price.

93
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,590
There shouldn't be such a person in the company.

94
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,500
Haoxuan, don't talk nonsense.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,740
Dad.

96
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,390
This is the evidence.

97
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,230
Just have a look.

98
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,090
You'll know if I'm talking nonsense.

99
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,480
Haoming.

100
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,420
Explain it to me.

101
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,470
Explain it.

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,360
I know nothing

103
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,680
about these accusations.

104
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,940
This is really a private seal.

105
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,990
Look.

106
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,840
Selling the stocks of the company in private

107
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,820
has seriously damaged

108
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,110
the interests of Ren Group.

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,710
Let me have a look.

110
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,350
I think this is illegal.

111
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,950
Dad.

112
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,560
Give the project which my brother was in charge of

113
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,730
to me.

114
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,970
I'll do my best to serve the Group.

115
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,320
Mr. Ren.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
It's of great importance.

117
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,380
I don't think

118
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,320
we should jump to a conclusion

119
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,180
before we investigate into it.

120
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,780
I announce

121
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,720
the suspension of all Ren Haoming's duties.

122
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,150
It must be thoroughly investigated.

123
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,030
I'll give you a satisfactory reply.

124
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,549
I didn't expect Ren Haoming to be such a person.

125
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,500
Let's wait for the chairman's investigation.

126
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,740
This is slander.

127
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,050
Why didn't you explain?

128
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,120
It doesn't matter

129
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,980
whether it is true or not.

130
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,890
I lost this time.

131
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,500
He won.

132
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,490
That's all.

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,570
But...

134
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,000
He only cares about winners.

135
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,060
He's always like that.

136
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,930
Who?

137
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,300
Let's go home.

138
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,850
What's going on?

139
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,100
Didn't the chairman say to investigate?

140
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,800
Why did Ren Haoxuan

141
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,160
throw your things out?

142
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,720
What's wrong?

143
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,790
Our luggage was thrown out.
