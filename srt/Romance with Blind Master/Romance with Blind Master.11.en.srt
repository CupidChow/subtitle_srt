[Episode 11]

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,390
Young Master.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,540
I'm afraid you'll have to stay here for now.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,690
It's fine.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,580
Staying at your place for the time being

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,260
can keep me away from the strife in my family.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,390
This house of mine is a bit old,

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,400
and it's been too long since anyone lived here.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,810
I'm sorry you have to live here for a while.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,740
Not at all.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
It's good enough for us to have a place to stay.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,230
Boss Ming.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,780
Song.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,190
You can leave now.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,380
Boss.

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,900
I'll leave after cleaning this place up.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,190
I won't be in your way.

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,870
I mean,

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,700
you can leave me and go about your own business.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,860
Boss,

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,560
I've been following you for so long.

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,129
No matter what happens,

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,610
I will always be by your side.

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,340
Spiders!

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,000
Let me clean it up first.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,500
As expected,

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,910
this house has a new look after cleaning.

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,330
Boss,

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,660
it's late.

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,630
How are we going to fix dinner?

33
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,570
How about

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,650
ordering some takeout?

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,740
Okay.

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,420
No need.

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,820
I'll do it.

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,220
When I studied abroad,

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,160
I learned how to cook.

40
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,620
Well,

41
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,460
I suddenly remembered

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,300
that my mom is cooking at home.

43
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,420
I'll go back first.

44
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,140
Just wait for a moment.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,920
Are you looking at me?

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,300
You are

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,690
just like a young master in distress.

48
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,020
This is not how we trim vegetables.

49
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:38,820
Really?

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,660
Teach me then.

51
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,579
This is the root of the celery.

52
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,620
Here

53
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,579
is the stem.

54
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,940
On top is the leaf.

55
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,140
Take off the leaves.

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,050
There you go.

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,940
Thank you.

58
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,470
If you're not used to staying here,

59
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,990
you can go home.

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,100
So?

61
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,420
You feel sorry

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,670
for dragging me down?

63
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,530
Yes.

64
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,650
I don't feel burdened or difficult.

65
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,070
With such a house and such a life,

66
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,760
we are already much better off than other people.

67
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,340
At night,

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,970
we can light a small lamp

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,329
and listen to the music.

70
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,140
Don't you think

71
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,540
living like this is better now?

72
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,000
Actually,

73
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,180
I just need you

74
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,340
by my side.

75
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,909
Come on.

76
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,500
Move.

77
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,720
What's wrong?

78
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,290
Did you burn yourself?

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,160
Better?

80
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,230
Why are you smiling?

81
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,370
Idiot.

82
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,540
It's this hand.

83
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,100
If the light hadn't broken,

84
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,700
I wouldn't have lit so many candles.

85
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,900
However,

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,070
this house is small,

87
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,650
but it's quite romantic.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,100
You won't think it's a waste, right?

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,100
Of course not.

90
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,290
You're afraid of the dark.

91
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,659
What are you going to do now?

92
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't think it's the right time.

93
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,980
You already know

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,370
how to deal with Ren Haoxuan?

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,880
Actually,

96
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,230
there's nothing enjoyable about

97
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,350
winning over your own brother.

98
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,680
We

99
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,850
are all just

100
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,220
pawns

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,120
for the Ren Group.

102
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,020
Well,

103
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,240
do you have any goal?

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,300
Yes.

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,100
I hope

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,620
the Ren Group can become

107
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,180
a world-class jewelry company.

108
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,810
Maybe that's not my goal at all.

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,700
This is only a goal my dad has instilled in me since I was a kid.

110
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,430
When I was five,

111
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,220
my mom taught me

112
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,800
to draw my first jewelry design.

113
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,230
Then I took a pseudonym,

114
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,600
Princess Sissi.

115
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,960
Maybe I was influenced by my mother.

116
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,390
So,

117
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,650
I wanted to be a jewelry designer.

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,890
But gradually, I realized

119
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,200
I chose this path

120
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,320
because I really liked it.

121
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,210
I believe

122
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,110
you have been following your own path

123
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,950
as well.

124
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,570
It's just that you haven't realized it yet.

125
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,750
As the saying goes, the meaning of life

126
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,190
should be created by ourselves.

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,860
I'm glad you're by my side.

128
00:07:59,250 --> 00:07:59,970
And I'm glad

129
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,550
you are the one who is engaged to me.

130
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,390
If...

131
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,590
If what?

132
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,060
Nothing.
