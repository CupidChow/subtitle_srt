[Episode 7]

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,410
You said you prefer the eastern style.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,090
Then I want to ask you

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,190
which country is the origin of the orchid.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,320
China, of course.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,670
But the purple orchid only exists in the Philippines.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,420
There are many kinds of orchids.

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,410
It's possible that they exist abroad too.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,560
Let me ask you again.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,090
Presenting the petals is very difficult.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,130
How are you going to make it?

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,370
It's simple.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,440
Just use normal coating…

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,490
As far as I know,

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,970
this effect can only be

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,210
achieved by enameling.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,690
The diamonds are embedded in the stems.

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,880
This is obviously

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,740
Olivia's style.

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,370
Plagiarism.

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,510
Plagiarism?

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,730
Actually,

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,289
this is not your original design,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,250
and you know nothing about jewelry.

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,080
Right?

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,310
Miss Ruan,

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,610
is this really Olivia's design?

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,250
I heard you studied jewelry abroad,

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,370
but how come you confused some basic concepts?

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,580
We need an explanation.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,620
Say something!

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,360
This is too much.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,039
Exactly.

36
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,850
She has the gall to stand up there!

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,720
Come down now.

38
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,130
Shameless!

39
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,009
Exactly.

40
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,289
She couldn't answer those questions.

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,729
How did you know she plagiarized?

42
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,180
Because

43
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,730
I'm very familiar with her style.

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,010
Who are you talking about?

45
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,590
Let's go.

46
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,040
Say something.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,310
How dare she call herself a jewelry designer?

48
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,550
How dare she stand up there?

49
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,450
Come down now.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,710
Shameless!

51
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,370
Mr. Ren saw through her trick today

52
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,220
and prevented us from suffering losses.

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,680
Haoming,

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,810
I'm looking forward to working with you.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
Miss Ruan, drink with us.

56
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,560
Haoming has drunk a lot.

57
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,210
I'm allergic to alcohol.

58
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,690
I'll drink for her.

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,920
Miss Ruan,

60
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,700
I'd like to drink a toast to you.

61
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,550
It's okay. I'll drink for her.

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,650
Cheers.

63
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,100
Haoming,

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,329
one more glass.

65
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,180
One more.

66
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm happy.

67
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,890
Drink some more, Mr. Ren.

68
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,900
Let me refill your glass.

69
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,100
One more.

70
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,410
Here.

71
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,190
Mr. Wang,

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,600
we should watch out for each other

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,050
and support each other in the future.

74
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,990
Of course.

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
You can't hold your liquor,

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,600
but you drank so much for me.

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,540
I can easily drink you under the table.

78
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,659
Ruan Xinxin.

79
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,060
Ruan Xinxin.

80
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,480
Ruan Xinxin.

81
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,250
Pour me a glass of water.

82
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,159
Wait a moment.

83
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,900
He can't see me anyway.

84
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,640
I'd better satisfy him first.

85
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,220
Coming.

86
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,040
Is this

87
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,820
an illusion?

88
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,580
I told you not to drink so much.

89
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,870
Both men and women

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,400
should be careful when drinking outside.

91
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,540
If you met

92
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,760
a drunk lecher,

93
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,770
you'd be doomed.

94
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,610
What are you doing?

95
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,270
Your hand!

96
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,370
Am I dreaming?

97
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,690
Damn you!

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,870
I...

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,820
It's weird.

100
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,130
I lost my sight again.

101
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,640
I heard

102
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,920
Young Master

103
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,450
has sealed the deal with Wang Mo.

104
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,530
Haoming?

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
Wang Mo

106
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,210
values

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
good designs very much.

108
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,440
It seems

109
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,760
that Haoming

110
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,430
has really put effort into it.

111
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,700
I've heard that Second Young Master

112
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,640
has contacted Wang Mo as well.

113
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,110
Compared to Haoming,

114
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,280
Haoxuan

115
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,880
is not capable enough.

116
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,570
What's wrong?

117
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,620
Are you still thinking about the press conference?

118
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,720
Ren Haoming.

119
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,250
has taken his side.

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,210
He and Ruan Qing…

121
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,290
Ruan Xinxin

122
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,510
are not that easy to deal with.

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,790
Just a blind man

124
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,800
and a useless woman.

125
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,580
There's nothing to be afraid of.

126
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,440
Since

127
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,380
Ruan Xinxin has become

128
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,920
Ren Haoming's eyes,

129
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,220
we should get rid of her.

130
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,760
Don't worry.

131
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,270
I have a plan.

132
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,950
Boss,

133
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,940
signing the contract is so important.

134
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,970
Why didn't Miss Ruan come with you?

135
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,669
She's making fish at home.

136
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,540
For you?

137
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,460
Cut the crap.

138
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,910
What time is it now?

139
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,700
It's five minutes

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,230
past the agreed time.

141
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,800
Hello.

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,060
We made an appointment with Mr. Wang to sign the contract here.

143
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,980
Why hasn't he come yet?

144
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,040
Don't you know that the signing ceremony has been canceled?

145
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,990
Canceled?

146
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,200
Yes.

147
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,380
Yesterday, your fiancée

148
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,290
Miss Ruan Xinxin

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
came in person

150
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,930
and said it was your idea.

151
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,190
The Ren Group doesn't want to lose this deal,

152
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,300
so your brother Ren Haoxuan's company

153
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,490
will take your place

154
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,430
to collaborate with us.
