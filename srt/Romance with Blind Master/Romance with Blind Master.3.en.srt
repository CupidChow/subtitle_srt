4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,210
Help me

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,250
take off my clothes.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm not the one getting taken advantage of anyway.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,510
Why should I feel uncomfortable?

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,440
He has abs?

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,330
Turn around.

10
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,940
Get me the bath salt.

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,240
I didn't mean it.

12
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,940
Stop pretending. You did it on purpose.

13
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,000
Ruan Xinxin.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,060
You deliberately married into my family.

15
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,259
What's your motive?

16
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,130
Let me tell you.

17
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,830
You'd better give up on that.

18
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,280
It's good for both of us.

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,560
Can't you see it from a different point of view?

20
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,590
Well,

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,110
we're on the same boat now.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,759
We can work together

23
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,770
and get what we need.

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,780
What can you get for me?

25
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,680
I can...

26
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,289
I can be your eyes.

27
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,190
We were never on the same boat.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,250
Give me the towel.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
Hurry up.

30
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,190
Close your eyes.

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,030
Forget it. You don't have to.

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,140
You can't see me anyway.

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,380
But you can see me.

34
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,900
Qin Yunzhu asked me to replace Ruan Xinxin.

35
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,740
I'm afraid her real purpose

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,310
is to send me away.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,170
Dad, are you looking for me?

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,550
I asked you here

39
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,850
to tell you that

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,330
she is your biological mother.

41
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,990
This is your sister.

42
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:17,880
Xinxin.

43
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,610
Actually, you two are twins.

44
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,420
About this matter...

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,440
I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

46
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,400
I was afraid you couldn't handle it.

47
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,210
That's why I never...

48
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,910
Xinxin is a poor child.

49
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,960
She has never had a father.

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,100
She's not as lucky as Qingtian.

51
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,560
Zhongquan.

52
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,840
Promise me

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,280
you won't be biased.

54
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,320
Xinxin has to have whatever Qingtian has.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,650
Consider it as compensation for us.

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,830
Okay, I promise you.

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,600
Xinxin, address your father.

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,390
Dad.

59
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,380
I can't expose my identity.

60
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,210
My dad is still in her hands.

61
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,630
She may attack my dad at any time.

62
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,790
I must come up with a plan.

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,940
You need to remember all the names,

64
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
appearances and information

65
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,820
in here.

66
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,740
I will take you to

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,640
a business cocktail party tomorrow.

68
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,820
Didn't you say that you want to be my eyes?

69
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,250
If you can do it,

70
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,520
I'll reconsider what you said.

71
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,680
Is he

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,190
testing me?

73
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,110
Wang Mo,

74
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,100
the General Manager of Luoke Group,

75
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,100
Liu Guofang, the Vice President of Ruimin International.

76
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,610
These people have all had business dealings

77
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,300
with the Ren Group.

78
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,510
Moreover, they are all business secrets.

79
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,810
Ren Haoming actually entrusted these to me.

80
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,580
Sister,

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
you kicked me so hard.

82
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,480
Who are you?

83
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,490
How dare you barge into my house?

84
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,980
Hello, my name is Da Dong.

85
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,450
I'm your makeup artist.

86
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,550
Let me introduce them.

87
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,750
These are my team members.

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,780
Manager Ren asked them to come

89
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,850
to make you look good.

90
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,030
Say hello.

91
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,300
Honey.

92
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,380
We don't have time.

93
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,630
Stop playing around. Get changed.

94
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,500
Come on, girls.

95
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,830
Too red.

96
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,140
Too tacky.

97
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,700
Too silly.

98
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,890
This is the one.

99
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,850
Boss.

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,840
Miss Ruan is very beautiful today.

101
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,700
She's like a star.

102
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,750
You two are a perfect match.

103
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
You'll be the most gorgeous pair at the event.

104
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,730
Did I ask you?

105
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,020
I think

106
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,160
you really wanted to ask,

107
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,810
so I told you.

108
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,520
Thank you for hiring the stylists for me.

109
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm very satisfied with the outcome.

110
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,470
Unfortunately,

111
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,210
you can't see me.

112
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,110
But I can smell you.

113
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,710
When you come to the company,

114
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,820
let's talk about it in detail together.

115
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,930
Wang Mo,

116
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,030
the General Manager of Luoke Group,

117
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,600
is at your two o'clock.

118
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,180
See you then.

119
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,580
He's coming.

120
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,250
Looks like he's going to shake hands with you.

121
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,900
Young Master Ren.

122
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,500
It's been three months.

123
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,950
I have good news for you.

124
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,700
Did the material review pass?

125
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,590
Yes.

126
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,590
I just received the notice.

127
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,720
We can finally move on to the next step.

128
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,850
I wonder if your company

129
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,860
is willing to continue?

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,490
Of course.

131
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,070
I'll find time to give you more details.

132
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,030
Then we'll discuss it at a later time.

133
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:46,820
No problem.

134
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,440
This must be Miss Ruan.

135
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,470
Nice to meet you.

136
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,960
Mr. Wang,

137
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,290
the Ballet Butterfly series

138
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,460
that you made with titanium alloys is very stylish.

139
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,370
I like it very much.

140
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,000
There are only a few people who know my design.

141
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,270
Miss Ruan.

142
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,230
You know me well.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,980
Take care of yourself.

144
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,490
You too.

145
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,080
Liu Guofang.

146
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,900
He was the head of Ruimin International Marketing Department previously.

147
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,040
He just got promoted to Vice President.

148
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,190
He talked to you about the co-branding jewelry before.

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,750
I'll get going then.

150
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,790
He's coming towards you,

151
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,040
holding a glass of wine.

152
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,550
Long time no see, Mr. Liu.

153
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,970
A few days ago,

154
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,370
I also asked your father

155
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,000
about you.

156
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,630
It seems that you're fine now.

157
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm relieved.

158
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,730
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Liu.

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
You're an outsider if you call me Mr. Liu.

160
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,870
Call me Uncle Liu from now on.

161
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,750
Uncle Liu.

162
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:52,970
Ren,

163
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,860
come visit more often.

164
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,970
Okay.

165
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,330
I thought you weren't close to him.

166
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,750
We're not close.

167
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,940
Let's go.

168
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,250
Ruan Xinxin.
