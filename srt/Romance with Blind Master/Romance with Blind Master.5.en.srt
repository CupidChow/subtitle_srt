4
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,170
How did you get in?

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,720
This is also my villa for vacation.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,940
Why can't I come in?

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,910
I forgot.

8
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,110
You can't see.

00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,520
Ren Haoxuan.

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,370
Why do you come to me?

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,200
If you want to chat,

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,310
forget it.

13
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm busy.

14
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,700
We're brothers.

15
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,840
Why does dad

16
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,630
only care about you?

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,539
Now you are blind.

18
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,130
It's hard to tell

19
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,690
how dad will treat us in the future.

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,360
Still no sugar?

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,710
Ren Haoxuan,

22
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,539
why on earth do you come to me?

23
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,530
Nothing.

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,330
Give the black-gold pass card

25
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,210
to me.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,720
You're not qualified yet.

27
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,630
Ren Haoming.

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,220
Dad has given me

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,860
the position of general manager.

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,940
The battle is over.

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,000
You have nothing.

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,850
What are you doing here?

33
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,220
How could you

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,079
leave my brother alone at home?

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,010
What if he's in danger?

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,160
I think you are the danger.

37
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,570
Ren Haoxuan.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,730
Before I run out of my patience,

39
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,329
you'd better leave.

40
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,480
Look at you now.

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,890
Why are you so arrogant to me?

42
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,460
Second Young Master, don't say like that.

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,310
Shut up.

44
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,220
It's none of your business.

45
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,710
Ren Haoming.

46
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,050
Your era has gone.

47
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,980
You have nothing.

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,030
Although your brother is blind,

49
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,510
he is an upright man.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,810
As for you,

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,290
even under the sun,

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,360
you are dark inside.

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,670
You are really good at defending him.

54
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,079
Why are you so proud?

55
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,410
You're always in this dark room.

56
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,130
You can't even get out of the door

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
on your own.

58
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,640
Then you should also experience

59
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,500
the darkness.

60
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,040
What are you doing?

61
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,570
Turn on the light.

62
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,250
What is it?

63
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,579
What is it?

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,180
Where is my fine handicraft?

65
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,820
My fine handicraft.

66
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,330
Where is

67
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,790
my fine handicraft?

68
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,500
Turn on the light.

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,460
Hurry!

70
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,260
Here it is!

71
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,910
Song.

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,740
You're just a bumpkin.

73
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,480
You are his henchman.

74
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,050
Watch your mouth.

75
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,620
You.

76
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,880
You.

77
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,810
And you.

78
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,950
All of you,

79
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,470
wait and see.

80
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,110
You've gone too far.

81
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,940
But you did a good job.

82
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,880
Ruan Xinxin.

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,470
How many times are you going to surprise me?

84
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,080
Although your brother is blind,

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,340
he is an upright man.

86
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,720
As for you,

87
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,530
even under the sun,

88
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,730
you are dark inside.

89
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,150
By the way,

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,980
don't get involved in anything.

91
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,270
Otherwise, you'll get yourself into trouble.

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,910
Do you understand?

93
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,180
Ruan Xinxin.

94
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,210
Ruan Xinxin.

95
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,740
Ruan Xinxin.

96
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,970
Dad.

97
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,430
Just wait.

98
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,220
Dad.

99
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,910
Dad.

100
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,770
Dad.

101
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,110
Dad.

102
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,240
What did you say?

103
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,310
Ruan Zhongquan is missing?

104
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,820
Xinxin.

105
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,300
It's already like this.

106
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,650
Let's stop.

107
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,690
Mom.

108
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,210
We can't stop now.

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,050
We can't give up what we have now.

110
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,460
But you...

111
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,180
It must be her.

112
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,750
Ruan Qingtian.

113
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,010
She has a helper now.

114
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,780
Hello, Second Young Master

115
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
Last time you said

116
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,520
you needed some design drafts.

117
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,460
I happened to have some.

118
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,350
I look forward to working with you.
