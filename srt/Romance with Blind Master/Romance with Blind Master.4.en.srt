00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,840
Ruan Xinxin?

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,640
You got the wrong person.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,820
I'm Ruan Qingtian.

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,760
I've been abroad.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,470
I just came back recently.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I see, you are twins.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,220
No wonder you're so elegant.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,120
I've heard that Miss Ruan

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,410
is very excellent.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,950
She's a genius in jewelry design.

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,830
My name is Ren Haoxuan.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,960
We are a family, aren't we?

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,510
Why is she here?

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,090
What a coincidence.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,600
Let's go.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,450
Let's go say hello.

20
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,570
In your three o'clock.

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,150
There are two people approaching us.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,210
Who?

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,710
Ren Haoxuan and

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,470
Ruan Qingtian.

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,070
Why did you come out today?

26
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,830
Didn't dad ask you to rest at home?

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,270
Haoxuan.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,520
Didn't I tell you

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,310
that you shouldn't put too much pressure on yourself

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,789
when it comes to work?

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,120
It's good to relax

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,100
sometimes.

33
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:58,850
After all,

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,370
dad has never counted on you.

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,370
Brother Ren, have your eyes recovered?

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,120
Not yet.

37
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,340
But during this time,

38
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,570
although I can't see with my eyes,

39
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,510
I see clearer with my heart.

40
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,800
I become better at recognizing people

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,770
who have ulterior motives.

42
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,290
Sister,

43
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,700
why didn't you

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,610
call home

45
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,510
these days?

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,390
Mom and I are worried about you.

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,079
Worried about what?

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,550
Of course we're worried that you didn't do well.

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,000
After all, everyone says

50
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,260
twins

51
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,100
are connected.

52
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,390
Yes.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,040
We're twins.

54
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,420
Maybe even if you

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,920
marry Haoming on behalf of me,

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,590
no one can tell the difference.

57
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,350
Please enjoy.

58
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,980
Since everyone is here today,

59
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,270
I'll treat all of you to a steak.

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,830
Oh no.

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,940
He wants to embarrass Ren Haoming in public.

62
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,940
No thanks.

63
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:12,980
Brother.

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,550
You can manage the company so well on your own.

65
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,570
Don't tell me

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,390
that you can't even eat steak?

67
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,520
Haoxuan.

68
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,410
do you think dad would appreciate someone

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,680
who can eat steak

70
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,180
or

71
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,340
someone who can manage the company well?

72
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,760
It is definitely not a disabled person.

73
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,230
Our company only let the fittest survive.

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,240
We don't keep trash here.

75
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,990
Well, the company is keeping you, isn't it?

76
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,070
Looks like

77
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,500
we have nothing much to talk about anymore.

78
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,350
Excuse us.

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,140
What's wrong?

80
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,920
My shoes are broken.

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,760
It looks like your shoes

82
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,810
is bad in quality.

83
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,390
Yes.

84
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,960
Yes.

85
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,560
They look happy together.

86
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,820
You can keep moving forward

87
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,950
about seven to eight meters.

88
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,220
Turn right

89
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,140
and go out from the main door.

90
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,210
Miss Ruan,

91
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,590
I have a collaboration to discuss with you.

92
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,740
Are you interested?

93
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,780
What kind of collaboration

94
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
do you mean?

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,940
Let's talk upstairs.

96
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,040
Eat up.

97
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,280
We've been starving all night to deal with them.

98
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,210
Okay.

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,830
Let's eat.

100
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,510
You did a good job today.

101
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,240
You seem to know a lot

102
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,880
about the domestic design circle.

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Well,

104
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,940
I understand a little.

105
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,990
You dislike your sister, don't you?

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,430
Why did you say that?

107
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,210
I feel it.

108
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,150
It's none of your business.

109
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,280
By the way,

110
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,280
I've agreed

111
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,240
on what you said before.

112
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,030
From now on,

113
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,730
you will continue to be my eyes,

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,820
and I'll try my best to help you.

115
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,600
The premise is within my ability.

116
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,100
Your steak is too cooked.

117
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,560
How do you know?

118
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,440
I can tell it by the sound.

119
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,560
It's not clean, I used it just now.

120
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,550
It tastes good.

121
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,780
Pervert.

122
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,260
I mean the steak.

123
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,930
Is your father in this house?

124
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,650
Yes.

125
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,320
You...

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,530
I don't like you since long time ago.

127
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:39,970
Hurry.

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,210
Let's move the bed out.

129
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,420
These machines are stopped.

130
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,810
Will it harm the patients?

131
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,430
The ventilator was not plugged in at all.

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,720
Now it seems

133
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,310
even my dad's illness

134
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,240
is also a conspiracy.

135
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,890
What kind of medicine

136
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,750
did they inject into my dad?

137
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,080
Let's move the bed out first.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,540
Ok.

139
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,570
Song.

140
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,419
Thank you very much

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,679
for what you did to my father.

142
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,480
Miss Ruan,

143
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,100
I am the one who should say thank you.

144
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,770
Ever since boss got into the accident,

145
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,820
I never see him smile again.

146
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,760
An accident?

147
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,850
An accident that seems to be planned.

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,910
Boss's eyes were hurt because of that.

149
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,170
Hello, what's wrong?

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,730
Young master,

151
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,570
the furniture you ordered will arrive soon.

152
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,100
I plan to bring it back later.

153
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,730
Please come and have a look on that time.

154
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,260
No need.

155
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,850
I still have a lot of work to do in the company.

156
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,410
I don't know when I can finish them.

157
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,180
Okay.

158
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,060
How is it going over there?

159
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,160
Moreover,

160
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,010
you have to take full responsibility for this.

161
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,640
No problem. Don’t worry.

162
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,230
Young master?

163
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,980
Young master!

164
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,290
What's wrong, Young master?

165
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,990
What should I do?

166
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,640
Young master!

167
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,400
Young master!

168
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,060
Can you hear me, young master?

169
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,860
Young master!

170
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,700
Answer me, young master!

171
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,190
I was hit by a car...

172
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,310
Where?
