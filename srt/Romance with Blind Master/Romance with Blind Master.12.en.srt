00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,170
Doctor, can I get my sight back?

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,660
Your test report shows that your condition is improving,

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,620
but whether you can regain your sight is yet to be seen.

Morning.

00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,170
Be careful.

10
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,289
Did you make all these?

11
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,910
How did you...

12
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,320
You can see things now?

13
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,430
There's a breakfast machine in the kitchen.

14
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,630
It's not so hard for me

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,300
to learn to use it.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,370
Let me make breakfast in the future.

17
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,120
What if you hurt yourself?

18
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,560
I just want to do it for you

19
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,460
so that you can have breakfast

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,410
immediately after you get up.

21
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,680
Eat.

22
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,500
It's so delicious.

23
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,730
Really?

24
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,270
Try it.

25
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,860
Why are you biting my finger?

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,420
Let go!

27
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,500
Are you a puppy?

28
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,240
Yes.

29
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,030
Your puppy.

30
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,170
Come in.

31
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,040
Well,

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,380
I came to visit you.

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,010
I'll get you some water.

34
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,110
Don't worry, Boss.

35
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,690
I saw nothing.

36
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,300
I know you saw everything.

37
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,590
How did you know?

38
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,060
Because I have my sight back now.

39
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,520
Really?

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,690
Does Miss Ruan know?

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
I can't see clearly now.

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,350
The recovery of my sight is probably temporary.

43
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,010
So I don't want her to know about it yet.

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,650
Anyway, it means you can get your sight back.

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,040
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,670
Nothing.

47
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,270
Nothing.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,670
Yes.

Young Master asked me to do.

But photos are not enough.

55
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,709
And this.

56
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,280
Ren Haoxuan asked me to do that.

57
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,900
He asked me to crash the car over.

58
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,020
Whether that man could survive didn't matter.

59

Please let me go.

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,290
I have an email for you.

61

I have it sent to you.

62

the data of Ren Haoxuan's company.

Now we have the evidence.

Why don't you call the police?

It's not the time yet.

69
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,210
I want that person to know

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,300
that he was wrong.

72

he has been way off the mark.

73

I've been keeping an eye

I'm talking to Dad.

Come another time.

82
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,480
You're so eager to kick me out.

You caused the car accident

to make me lose my sight,

87
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,980
and set me up

to expel me from the company.

you've been the more obedient son.

Ren Haoxuan asked me to do that.

Since I was a boy,

you've been saying

that the result is more important than the process.

105

ended up like this

mainly because of you.

116

You're the culprit.

In your eyes,

118

nothing is more important than the company,

including us.

120
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,870
Since we were young,

121

home has been a cold battlefield.

122
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,940
You want us brothers to compete with each other.

123

If we don't

do as you say,

125
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,760
we won't get any recognition from you.

126

You don't allow us

127

to get out of your control.

128

You just want to find

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,140
an able pawn for the company

130
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,620
through the competition.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,430
A pawn?

132
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,340
How could you say that?

133
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,440
Am I wrong?

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,440
You're my son.

135
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,430
I raised you

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
to be my successor.

137
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,400
He's your successor? Then what about me?

138
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,030
You're not in your brother's league in any aspect.

139
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,080
You've never done one thing

140
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,740
that satisfied me.

141
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,910
Then why did you pit me against my brother in the first place?

142
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,530
Why did you encourage me?

143
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,210
You said you would treat us equally.

144
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,100
You gave me hope again and again

145
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,590
and shattered it again and again.

146
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,360
Now I see.

147
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,930
I'm just his stepping stone!

148
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,030
You've never cared

149
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,150
whether I can become abler than my brother.

150
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,390
You've never cared about me either.

151
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,890
You've forgotten that I'm your son too!

152
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,429
Nonsense.

153
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,480
At this point,

154
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,490
you still wouldn't admit your mistake.

155
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,530
You've long strayed from the right path.

156
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,950
You want us to go head-to-head, right?

157
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,860
As you wish!

158
00:08:59,650 --> 00:08:59,980
You...

159
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,980
What are you doing?
