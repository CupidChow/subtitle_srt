I won't marry her.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,170
You are my first and eldest son.

10

Your every word and behavior represent our company.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,800
Our Ren Group's core advantage is jewelry materials.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,510
But our disadvantages are also very clear.

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,090
We lack good designers.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,620
And this is the strength of the Ruan's Jewelry.

I just ask you to attend it for Xinxin.

Because you grew up in the Ruan family.

You've been living a good life.

51

She has been suffering outside with me for so many years.

Now that the Ruan family is in trouble,

I have to find a way to escape after the engagement party.

No wonder Ruan Xinxin wants to break off the engagement.

65

The first daughter was brought home by Madam Ruan.

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,060
The second has been with Qin Yunzhu outside.

70
