4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,580
Didn't I sit on the chair yesterday?

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,080
Last night,

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,880
I fell asleep here?

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,250
With him?

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,440
Ren Haoming!

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,890
Nothing happened

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,360
between us, right?

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,440
What do you think?

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,230
Looks like nothing happened.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,330
You didn't do anything to me, right?

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,590
You should ask yourself

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,970
what you did to me.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,120
What did I do to you?

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,789
Last night,

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,180
you lied on my chest

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,310
and held my hand.

20
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,230
And you...

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,860
Called me daddy.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,460
I'll get the door.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,630
Qingtian.

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,840
Xinxin.

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,460
You haven't been home for a long time.

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,000
So your sister and I came to see you.

27
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,800
Come in.

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,890
Who is it?

29
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,390
My mom and my sister are here.

30
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,850
Take your time.

31
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,100
Ren Haoming's house is really nice.

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,790
How is it?

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,950
How are you getting along?

34
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,320
Not bad.

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,750
Well,

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,240
is he good to you?

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,050
Fine.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,310
Qingtian.

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,380
Your father was kidnapped

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,780
from the hospital yesterday.

41
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,710
When did that happen?

42
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,160
Last night.

43
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,370
Who did it?

44
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,170
We don't know.

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,200
But I heard from someone in the hospital

46
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,660
that it was a man and a woman.

47
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,480
Did they see their faces?

48
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,300
No.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
They were in disguise.

50
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,910
They must have planned it a long time ago.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,250
For the stability of our company,

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,620
we have to

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,440
keep this matter a secret for now.

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,450
Where's Ruan Xinxin?

55
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,860
She's not feeling very well.

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,000
She went to the bathroom.

57
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,050
Qingtian.

58
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,660
We came to you today

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,380
to ask you

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,820
if your father

61
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,300
has any enemies?

62
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,160
Who else could do such a thing?

63
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,210
Let me think about it.

64
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,700
Acting is so exhausting.

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,780
She never uses the computer to draw pictures.

66
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,380
So she's been hiding her design here.

67
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,680
I'll go check on her.

68
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,550
Mom.

69
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,840
I might have eaten something bad this morning.

70
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,380
I might need to go to the hospital.

71
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,740
What's going on?

72
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,050
Qingtian.

73
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,420
We'll leave now.

74
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,170
Tell me if you have any news.

75
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,330
I'll send someone to look for your dad too.

76
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,740
Sister.

77
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,360
Take care of yourself.

78
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,530
Qin Yunzhu.

79
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,370
She should be here to test me today.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,020
But Ruan Xinxin...

81
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,730
Why did she come too?

82
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,380
Where is Ruan Xinxin?

83
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,070
Xinxin

84
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,510
is not feeling very well.

85
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,800
She went to the bathroom.

86
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,590
It was she who stole it.

87
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,070
Welcome to

88
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,350
Ruan's Jewelry's new product launch.

Let's welcome the designer for our new products,

90
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,040
Miss Ruan Qingtian.

91
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,330
You thief!

92
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,940
I won't let you!

93
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,390
The launch has already started.

94
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,070
You can't go in.

95
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,540
It's me!

96
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,040
You are?

97
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,030
I am...

98
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,170
Ruan Xinxin.

99
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,600
The Second Miss of the Ruan Family.

100
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,050
Let me in!

101
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,980
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,050
My lady has ordered

103
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,040
that you can't go in.

104
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,670
What?

105
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,020
Welcome to

106
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,200
Ruan's Jewelry's new product launch!

107
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,390
Let's welcome the designer for our new products,

108
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,130
Miss Ruan Qingtian.

109
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,380
[Ruan's Jewelry's New Product Launch]

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,870
Hello, everyone.

111
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,980
Let me proudly present to you

112
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,920
our True Love series.

113
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,670
This design is my most satisfying work.

114
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,250
There is also a more oriental style

115
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
that I prefer.

116
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,870
I used the orchids in nature

117
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,370
as inspiration.

118
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,690
In terms of materials,

119
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,400
I used annealed silver

120
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,400
to depict the wrinkles of petals.

121
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,760
The petals and branches

122
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,140
are decorated

123
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,360
with diamonds and rubies.

124
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,380
Why is it so similar?

125
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,670
This series includes rings,

126
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,660
cufflinks, and necklaces.

127
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,900
Now it's time for our question-and-answer session.

128
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,420
Do you have any questions

129
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
for our designer?

130
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,280
Mr. Ren, please.

131
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,550
-Let me in! -What do you want?

132
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,640
I think my arm is dislocated.

133
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,310
I can't move.

134
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,480
What should we do?

135
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,540
I don't know.

136
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,490
What should we do?

137
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,970
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

138
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,660
You did it.

139
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,770
You did it!

140
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,080
You...
