Congratulations on signing the contract.

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,740
Don't you have anything

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,470
to tell me?

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,380

With the speaker on.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,600
What's up with you?

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,230
Why are you so paranoid?

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,240
Xinxin.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,280
I'm almost done talking to Luoke.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,720
How's it going over on your side?

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,030
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,190
Did Ren Haoming give you a hard time?

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,890
But it's useless even if he gets it.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,280
If he gives you a hard time,

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,240
come home.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,110
Gives me a hard time about what? Explain yourself.

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,720
What...

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,570
What did she mean?

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
You should know the answer.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,700
What on earth has happened?

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,140
When did you collude

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,150
with Ren Haoxuan?

29
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,500
What does this have to do with Ren Haoxuan?

30
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,700
What is going on?

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,800
Today,

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,229
people from Luoke told me that

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,390
you went to their company

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,630
and transferred the contract

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,100
to Ren Haoxuan's subsidiary.

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,990
That's impossible!

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,360
I was at home all day yesterday.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,250
Also, why would I do that?

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,860
Only you know the answer to that.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,050
I have nothing to do with Ren Haoxuan.

41
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,550
I don't like people lying to me.

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,520
Don't you trust me at all?

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,230
Have you ever thought that

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,620
this might be them trying to sow discord between us?

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,079
Trying to sow discord?

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,250
They're not outsiders.

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,500
She's your mother.

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,600
You're a family.

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,640
Ren Haoming,

50
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,380
you're not only heartless, but also brainless.

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,750
You can choose to believe me or not.

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,550
Congratulations.

53
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,320
This deal is yours.

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,410
Wonderful.

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,310
We stole the business order

56
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,970
and made them suspicious of one another.

57
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,079
How did you come up with this idea?

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,720
Do you twins

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,200
switch identities often?

60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,060
But Second Young Master,

62

Of course.

64
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Since you helped me,

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,450
I will definitely help you

66
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,170
get the Ruan family back.

You're not only heartless, but also brainless.

You can choose to believe me or not.

Young Master.

77
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,100
It's the middle of the night. What happened?

78
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,600
Help me check

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,980
the CCTV at the door yesterday.

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,909
See if Ruan Xinxin

81
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,010
has been out.

82
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,030
Okay, I'll look at it right away.

83
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,790
Don't let me down.

84
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,390
You fool.

85
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,000
You believe everything others say?

86
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,320
I didn't go out yesterday.

87
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,320
How could I go to look for Wang Mo?

88
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,770
Ruan Xinxin.

89
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,220
I don't think the other company

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,230
would tell such a low lie.

91
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,000
He said he saw me,

92
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,220
but I didn't show up.

93
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,890
Then what he saw

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,730
must be Ruan Xinxin.

95
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,260
Young Master.

96
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,610
I checked the CCTV.

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480
Miss Ruan didn't go out yesterday.

98
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,400
Okay, I got it.

99
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,500
Please run a check on

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,030
Ruan Xinxin and Ruan Qingtian.

101
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,500
Okay.

102
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,980
I have to tell him about this.

103
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,090
What if he still doesn't believe me?

104
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,270
Why should I care so much about him?

105
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,930
Young Master,

106
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,630
I'm standing right here.

107
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,820
If you have anything to say,

108
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,890
just tell me.

109
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,250
Let's talk.

110
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,370
Have one.

111
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,760
I don't eat street food.

112
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,780
So you mean

113
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
she pretended to be you

114
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,440
and went to Wang Mo?

115
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,250
Yes.

116
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,110
This is her favorite

117
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,940
dirty trick.

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,830
Do you often switch identities?

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,610
Anyway,

120
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,400
she's probably with Ren Haoxuan.

121
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,220
I think they've established

122
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,650
a partnership.

123
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,390
What?

124
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,580
You were so fierce just now.

125
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,700
Why are you so meek now?

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,150
Well,

127
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,700
how do you plan to get

128
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,539
your order back?

129
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,840
There's no hurry.

130
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,760
Even if it's given to them,

131
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,909
they might not be able to handle it.

132
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,530
Try one.

133
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,010
This is really delicious.

134
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,340
Try one.

135
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,820
No.

136
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,740
Try one.

137
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,180
Have one.

138
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,430
Just have one.

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,520
I told you I don't eat street food.

140
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,920
Isn't it delicious?

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,320
Not bad.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,450
I'm fine.

143
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,680
I've read the soft copy of the contract.

144
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,370
As for the price,

145
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,350
you raised it by 5%.

146
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,960
It's our honor

147
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,930
to work with Ren Group.

148
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,080
We only want the best and the most expensive.

149
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,560
Mr. Wang is generous.

150
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,560
I heard that Mr. Wang is here.
