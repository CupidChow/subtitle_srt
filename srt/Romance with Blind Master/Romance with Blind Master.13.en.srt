4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,540
You'd better rest at home.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,180
Besides, Mr. Ren's eyes

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,260
have recovered

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,200
in our treatment.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,120
Call us if you need anything.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,180
Thank you, doctor.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,590
Song.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,220
How is he?

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,259
Don't worry, Miss Ruan.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,050
Ming's condition is very stable.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,680
He'll be fine after resting at home.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,780
By the way, the doctor also said

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,580
that the tests found

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,750
nerve activity in Ming's eyes.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,520
He should be able to regain his sight soon.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,790
Really?

20
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,350
Song.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,360
Thank you very much.

22
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,550
-Have something to eat. -Okay.

23
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,289
Haoming.

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,030
When will you wake up?

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,690
Maybe

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,110
when you wake up,

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,590
you'll see me.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,340
If you can wake up,

29
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,630
I'll tell you the truth.

30
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,970
I want to be with you

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,240
as Ruan Qingtian.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,590
Xinxin.

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,460
Something happened.

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,320
I know.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,430
Ren Haoxuan is such a loser.

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,390
I heard that

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,120
Ren Haoming's sight has been restored.

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,630
What?

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,740
Second Young Master is completely useless.

40
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,630
But who would have thought

41
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,810
that this blind Ren Haoming

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
would be so capable?

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,820
What should we do, Xinxin?

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,370
What do you mean?

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,170
Haoming

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,430
has never been our enemy.

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,980
But in the past...

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,340
The past is in the past.

49
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,280
After all,

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,450
isn't he

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,020
my fiancé?

52
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,930
You mean you want to

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,180
let Qingtian come back?

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,570
How could I let her come back?

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,930
I want her to disappear

56
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,830
from Ren Haoming's side.

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,740
If that happens,

58
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,580
when Ren Haoming wakes up,

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,570
I'll be the first person he sees.

60
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,400
I'll be the one who's been by his side,

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,370
and the one who he loves.

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
No, Xinxin.

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,680
Is there any other way?

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,300
Are you worried about her?

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,070
I...

66
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,270
I didn't mean that.

67
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,320
I don't think it's necessary.

68
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,900
Besides,

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,300
Qingtian

70
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,430
is your sister too.

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,810
All of you only care about Ruan Qingtian.

72
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,400
What's so good about her?

73
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,860
Isn't it just because

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,390
she was the one who was brought back?

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,710
What about me?

76
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,550
I have nothing.

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,350
I got nothing.

78
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,370
These belong to me in the first place.

79
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,420
Mom.

80
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,530
Didn't you say

81
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,310
you would always

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
be on my side?

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,339
Yes.

84
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,020
I'm on your side.

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,650
Put her in the car. Let's go.

86
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,820
Haoming.

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Haoming.

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,800
Anyone there?

89
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,560
Hello?

90
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,770
If you don't want to be gagged,

91
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,870
then shut up.

92
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,310
Who are you?

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,340
What do you want?

94
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,140
Listen to me.

95
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Calm down.

96
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,230
This is illegal, you know?

97
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,480
You'll go to jail

98
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,710
for at least ten years.

99
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,300
Don't come over.

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,360
I beg you.

101
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,690
Don't come over!

102
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,620
Help!

103
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,700
Who are you?

104
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,850
Who sent you here?

105
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,550
Eat it if you're hungry.

106
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,960
Miss Ruan hasn't been back for two days.

107
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,370
That's not right.

108
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,290
Miss Ruan.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,670
Where have you been?

110
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,630
I thought something happened to you.

111
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,830
Something happened at home.

112
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,510
You can leave now.

113
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:55,900
Okay.

114
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,660
Ren Haoming.

115
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,180
From now on, the person by your side

116
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,240
is me.

117
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,230
Haoming.

118
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,640
You're awake.

119
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,039
Haoming.

120
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,179
Take it slow.

121
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,310
Xinxin.

122
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,670
You can see now?

123
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,240
That's great!

124
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,880
I miss you so much.

125
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,020
You've been

126
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,180
taking care of me all this time.

127
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,640
Thank you.

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,330
You were in a coma for half a month.

129
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,370
I was really scared.

130
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,190
I thought

131
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,990
I would lose you.

132
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,970
It won't happen again.

133
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,880
I feel a little dizzy.

134
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
I want to rest for a little longer.

135
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,340
I'll get you a glass of water.
