THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,120
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,659
Are you okay?

5
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,504
- Use this.
- It's fine.

6
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,352
KANG GUNWOO

7
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,067
You can use this umbrella.

8
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,073
I think it'll make Gunwoo sad

9
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,076
if he were to see you.

10
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,437
EPISODE 3

11
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,523
-

12
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,366
Don't come out.

13
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,911
I just want to see Gunwoo alone.

14
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,897
Mom.

15
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,191
I came too late, didn't I?

16
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,206
It's fine now.

17
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,210
You're home now, so it's okay.

18
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,722
I'll do it. Your arms will hurt.

19
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm done.

20
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,476
Let's see.

21
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,604
You look like my mom now.

22
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,607
Are you really okay now?

23
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,111
Of course.

24
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,948
The scar is almost gone now.

25
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,991
I'm talking about your heart.

26
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:12,293
Soohyun, I don't want you to have
any bad thoughts.

27
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,172
Although no one can fill the void
of a child's empty seat,

28
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,259
but you have me and Yuri.

29
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,469
Mom, I won't die.

30
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,264
I would never leave you alone
in this world.

31
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,682
How could I die like that?

32
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,850
I also promised Gunwoo

33
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,603
that I wouldn't live a shameful life.

34
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,689
I'll do what I can to survive,

35
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
to keep that promise.

36
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,777
I'm going to do that.

37
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,577
That's good.

38
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,664
That's good.
Let's shoot a few more. Great.

39
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,793
A little more.

40
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,086
All right.

41
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,838
A little brighter.

42
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,300
- Just a moment.
- Cut! One minute.

43
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,348
Let me.

44
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,225
How's this, Mr. Lee?

45
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,687
- Doesn't the brilliant cut stand out more?
- Yes, much better.

46
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,273
- Let's change the light.
- Why? It seems fine now.

47
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,774
It's the Cedu Collection.

48
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,901
White gold shouldn't look like rose gold.

49
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,820
Gosh, you're so meticulous.

50
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,904
Thank you.

51
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,158
Raise the contrast
and control the white balance.

52
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,494
- Yes, sir. White gold.
- One more time.

53
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,787
Okay.

54
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,248
That's good.

55
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,711
Of course.

56
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,297
The brochure will be released
in time for the opening.

57
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,175
- Okay.
- You have a guest.

58
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,895
Soohyun?

59
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,748
Soohyun.

60
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,177
That was
when the shop launched.

61
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,557
Yuri.

62
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,769
You've become so fabulous.

63
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,314
You just didn't know before.
I clean up well when I dress up.

64
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,693
Thank you.

65
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,947
For taking care of my mom in my place.

66
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,031
What are you saying?

67
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,992
When I became an orphan,

68
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,078
you and Mom took care of me.

69
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm still a long way from paying that off.

70
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,293
She's my mom too. Don't make a fuss
just because you're related by blood.

71
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,673
Seeing you so successful

72
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,552
makes me... so happy.

73
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,137
It's your turn.

74
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,806
Start over.

75
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,684
Okay?

76
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,606
YANGPYEONG POLICE STATION

77
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,406
I'd like to find the survivor of
the fire incident in Yangpyeong in 2003.

78
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,373
The police station moved in 2005.

79
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,835
Most of the old records were lost.
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,884
Mom, I'll be home later.

81
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,886
Are you going out to look again?

82
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,346
Be careful.

83
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,684
HWASONG CABIN

84
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,872
May I ask you something?

85
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,875
Isn't this where the old cabin used to be?

86
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,376
That cabin?

87
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,422
It disappeared after the fire.
It's a restaurant now.

88
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,757
By chance,

89
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,344
- do you have their contact information?
- No, I don't.

90
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,388
There used to be a cabin there.

91
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,723
- Do you know it?
- Cabin?

92
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,391
- I don't.
- I don't know.

93
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,646
DAEJIN CITY SMILE CENTER

94
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,149
It happened so long ago,
there aren't other records.

95
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,361
There is one record
of the psychology counselor in charge.

96
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,988
I see. Thank you.

97
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,157
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY PSYCHOLOGY

99
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,503

104
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,649
Desire is an urge
to overcome despair. It's an antinomy.

105
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,903
All humans
have their own desires.

106
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,864
The reason those desires
can't be expressed

107
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,616
is because of social rules.

108
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,704
Freud said that if a person suppresses
these desires because of social rules,

109
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,166
they'll eventually be expressed
through dreams.

110
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,752
Jiheon, did you have
that type of dream last night?

111
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,630
- I had dinner with you in my dream.
- Goodness. What?

112
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,427
Class is over.
That's it for today's lesson.

113
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,803
Professor!

114
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,985
Eun Soohyun!

115
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,403
WE LOVE YOU, PROFESSOR

116
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,113
LOVE YOUR LECTURE, THANK YOU

117
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,323
I NEVER SKIPPED YOUR CLASS

118
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,283
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR CLASS

119
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,576
MY WOUNDS HAVE BEEN HEALED

120
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,036
YOU RAISED MY SELF-ESTEEM

121
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,331
Thank you.

122
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,384
Excuse me?

123
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,219
Are you Professor Kim Sira?

124
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,514
Yes, I remember.

125
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:46,312
He was very wary from his first session.

126
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,397
He was afraid of fire.

127
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,983
He had severe insomnia too.

128
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
In the end,

129
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,946
he refused treatment,
so the sessions stopped.

130
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,368
By chance, do you have his number?

131
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,455
It's been over 10 years
since I spoke to him.

132
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,293
Still, I'm sure I have
his record somewhere.

133
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,170
I'll look for it.

134
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,589
Thank you so much.

135
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,841
By the way...

136
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,803
You're her, aren't you?

137
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,644
I'll help you. I promise.

138
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,989
Hey, Yuri.

139
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,160
Ta-da.

140
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,997
I got it on my business trip.
I thought it'd look good on you.

141
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,624
Open up. Hurry up.

142
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,966
Isn't it pretty?

143
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,970
Ta-da! We have a matching pair.

144
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,514
Thanks.

145
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,853
Hey, do you remember?

146
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,733
When I said I didn't know how I could meet
someone like you in my life?

147
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,360
I meant that.

148
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,867
How was your trip to the States?

149
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,412
All I did was work.

150
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,915
By the way... Well...

151
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,003
I think Suho's coming back soon.

152
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,008
Aren't you going to call him?

153
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,573
DIVORCE APPLICATION

154
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,494
Give that to Suho for me.

155
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,579
Soohyun.

156
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,875
Fine, do whatever you want.

157
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,712
Don't care if Mom's worried,
I'm upset, or Suho's tormented.

158
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,299
- Don't bother. Just do what you want!
- How can I do what I want?

159
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,885
I don't want to let him go either.

160
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,679
I want to stay beside him...

161
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,308
even if I become his baggage, but...

162
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,685
how can I do that?

163
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,940
He's the person...

164
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,736
I love the most.

165
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,078
- It's true!
- Daddy, hurry up.

166
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,746
No, I'm right.

167
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,790
Why won't you believe me?
I mean it.

168
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,835
Gunwoo, help me.

169
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,588
- Come on.
- Let's go. My baby, good boy.

170
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,382
- Let's go.
- Come on, Happy.

171
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,300
- Go inside, Happy.
- You're so cute.

172
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,927
Let's go inside.

173
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,679
I mean it.

174
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,309
HAPPY

175
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,886
You look so cool!

176
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,924
Honey.

177
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,828
No! No! No!

178
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,705
I don't want to wear pants!

179
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,458
Tease-ya!

180
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,220
Mom, look at me. I can jump this high!

181
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:20,312
Look at me!

182
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,960
- One, two.
- Aah!

183
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,089
You said you'd pull it after three.

184
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,515
I'm sorry.

185
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,350
I'm so sorry...

186
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,194
That day,
I heard this exact sound.

187
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,834
- Hello?
- I found it.

188
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,461
The victim's counseling log
you were looking for.

189
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,090
I will send those together
to you directly.

190
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,967
Okay.

191
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,852
20, UNAM-DONG 1-GIL, SEOJAE-GU, SEOUL

192
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,735
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

193
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,322
- Is this the right address?
- Yes, it is.

194
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,034
- By chance, do you know Gwon Seonyul?
- Seonyul?

195
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,079
- He lives on the second floor.
- Is that so?

196
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,749
But he's not home right now. He's at work.

197
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,543
I saw him leave for work this morning.

198
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,212
- I see.
- If it's urgent,

199
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,882
- I can tell you where he works.
- Do you know where that is?

200
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,800
Yes, just a moment.

201
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,968
Thank you.

202
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,748
 Congressman Choi Juseok
is driving on his own

203
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,832
without his entourage.

204
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,222
- Cheers!
- Hey!

205
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,183
This is great.

206
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,227
- Why are you so pretty?
- Damn it.

207
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,898
Come here! Come here!

208
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,931
Who are you?

209
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:42,194
JUNKYARD

210
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,363
OFFICE

211
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,616
- Hi, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.

212
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,828
- Is Gwon Seonyul here?
- You can go that way.

213
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,872
Thank you.

214
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,960
- You have to go all the way down.
- Okay, thank you.

215
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,076
Excuse me?

216
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,122
You?

217
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,625
You can use this umbrella.

218
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,673
I think it'll make Gunwoo sad

219
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,843
if he were to see you.

220
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,390
Are we having pork belly tonight?

221
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Hey, Seonyul.

222
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,770
- I'm off.
- Make sure to turn the lights off.

223
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,399
Let's go this way.

224
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,996
Ah.

225
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,045
Do you always eat dinner this late?

226
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,797
Yes.

227
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,767
But I'm curious.

228
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,479
Why did you come to see me?

229
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,572
To be honest,

230
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,158
someone...

231
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,580
asked me to meet you for them.

232
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,473
What is this?

233
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,437
BANK BOOK

234
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,942
FOUR DEAD IN FIRE
SOLE SURVIVOR, AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY

235
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,446
That person...

236
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,449
felt terribly guilty

237
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,827
and wrote letters of apologies

238
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,497
to you for a long time.

239
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,834
So...

240
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,505
are you here to deliver an apology

241
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,883
from the person who killed my parents?

242
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,888
Why would you do this for them?

243
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,269
Because she can't...

244
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,981
deliver them herself anymore.

245
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,403
She died.

246
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,116
Until her last breath,

247
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,119
she felt so sorry.

248
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,663
She sincerely hoped
you'd live a good life--

249
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,336
So?

250
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,798
How do I look?

251
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,970
Do I look like I'm doing well?

252
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,477
An apology doesn't bring the dead
back to life.

253
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,856
Or relieve any burden.

254
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,065
I know.

255
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,484
I know how you feel.

256
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,945
I know it all too well.

257
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,658
What do you know?

258
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,623
I didn't want to know about this person
until the day I died.

259
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,793
Do you have any idea

260
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,048
what you did to me?

261
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,422
Soohyun, I have a favor to ask.

262
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:59,260
That child endured a hard time
as much as you did.

263
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,556
Can you help him put that painful memory

264
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,350
behind him?

265
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,712
How do I look?
Do I look like I'm doing well?

266
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,135
What do you know?

267
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,641
I didn't want to know about this person
until the day I died.

268
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,107
Do you have any idea

269
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,817
what you did to me?

270
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,223
We were
just riding normally.

271
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,892
That kid ran in front of me
with a soccer ball.

272
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,728
Then that man popped out of nowhere
and I hit him.

273
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,023
So you hit him
trying to avoid hitting the child?

274
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,108
Things got out of hand
because of him.

275
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,318
What are you saying?

276
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,403
My kid would've gotten hurt
if it weren't for him!

277
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,571
That's dangerous!

278
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,118
- What is he doing?
- He said he lost his mother's necklace.

279
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,203
Goodness!

280
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,163
Come out. Goodness! Get out of there.

281
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,748
My mother's picture is in there!

282
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,083
This is dangerous!

283
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,210
- Come out, please?
- Excuse me!

284
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,879
Excuse me! There's a big accident here!

285
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,548
People were hurt.

286
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,300
You have to come to the police station
and write a report.

287
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,178
- Come out of there. Quickly.
- Come on out!

288
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,389
- You can find it later.
- Goodness.

289
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,723
Be careful.

290
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,159
Excuse me.

291
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,414
Here.

292
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,810
I also...

293
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,357
have a similar pain.

294
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,780
I lost...

295
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,037
my child.

296
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,708
I wanted an apology from the man...

297
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,253
who did that to my child.

298
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,298
Apologize.

299
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,759
You ruined my child's life.

300
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,178
So apologize properly!

301
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,846
He could've died anywhere else!

302
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,182
Why did he have to get hit by my car?

303
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,600
If he had,

304
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,436
I still couldn't forgive him,

305
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,397
but I would've tried to forget it.

306
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,483
I didn't do it.

307
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,319
I'll hold your hand.

308
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,373
I still break every day

309
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,124
in a pain that can't be healed.

310
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,293
That's why I came to find you.

311
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,590
I hoped you weren't trapped in pain
like me.

312
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,593
I wished you would accept
her heartfelt apology

313
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,138
and try to live your life.

314
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,391
But...

315
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,853
I was wrong.

316
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,232
You were living your life well

317
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,485
in your own way.

318
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,655
You had buried this pain,

319
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,282
and I dug it up for you.

320
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,285
I am...

321
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,250
truly sorry.

322
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,165
EUN SOOHYUN

323
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:08,087

00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,966

HANKUK UNITED PARTY
REPRESENTATIVE KIM JOON

331
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,493
Don't worry. I'll call you.

332
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,204
She'll be back soon.

333
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,815
It's been six years.

334
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,699
You look...

335
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,328
so gaunt.

336
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,832
You've gone through so much.

337
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,794
Let's go.

338
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,173
What are you doing?

339
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,095
Did you really think

340
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,931
- I'd abandon you?
- Suho...

341
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,851
Don't I horrify you?

342
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,520
Please.

343
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,190
You don't need me in your life.

344
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,693
So forget about me,

345
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,861
and meet someone else.

346
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,613
Yes.

347
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,534
I tried to, but I couldn't.

348
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,995
I just can't do it.

349
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:15,209
You don't mean that.
Just tell me you're sorry.

350
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,256
Tell me you'll never push me away.

351
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,719
Say you'll never say something
like that again.

352
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,012
Then I'll forgive you.

353
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,806
The more you do this,
the more miserable I feel.

354
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,182
So just go.

355
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,810
Go and live your life.

356
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,729
That's how you can help me.

357
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,564
Please, go.

358
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,492
How could I ever let you go?

359
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,250
Don't you know
who you are to me?

360
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,677
I missed you so much, Soohyun.

361
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,601
Let's go home. Okay?

362
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,802
Professor!

363
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,471
Who's this?

364
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,603
Don't call her that.
She's your sister-in-law.

365
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,605
Ah, Soohyun.

366
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,526
- Have you been well?
- Yeah.

367
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,363
Are you doing okay?
I wanted to come see you.

368
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,283
I'm grateful you sent me all those letters
even though you're busy.

369
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,410
You did that?

370
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,330
- Yes.
- Isn't this your third year now?

371
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:21,001
I tutored you as a kid.
When did you become a doctor?

372
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,337
It's all thanks to you.

373
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,215
What's this?
Is this how you came?

374
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,844
What? I left the hospital urgently.

375
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,305
Goodness. Let's go inside, Taeho.

376
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,644
Why do you always
take food pictures?

377
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,105
You wouldn't know.
It's my own personal joy.

378
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,648
It's like a precious diary

379
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,567
that records my day.

380
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,991
Forget it. Try calling Mom again.

381
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,451
I don't think she's coming.

382
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,998
The way she sounded over the phone...

383
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,626
Then let's just enjoy ourselves, okay?
Honey?

384
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,297
Mom.

385
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,934
Mother.

386
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:26,400
I caused you... so much trouble.

387
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,152
I'm very sorry.

388
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,784
You've been through a lot.

389
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,828
It must've been so hard for you, dear.

390
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,554
No, it's fine.

391
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,141
You went through all the trouble. Here.

392
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:03,979
You loved braised galbi.

393
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,148
Here. Eat up.

394
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,025
Go on.

395
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,862
Eat up.

396
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,544
We'll live a good life.

397
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,465
Thank you for accepting me again.

398
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,346
Soohyun.

399
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,724
Yes.

400
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,519
Don't think I accepted you.

401
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,942
You still... horrify me.

402
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:55,864
If you hadn't come home that day,

403
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,242
my grandson wouldn't have died like that.

404
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,205
What happened to Gunwoo
was partly your fault.

405
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:08,210
Now you're back after committing murder,

406
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,754
and you want to take my son down.

407
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,382
How terrifying would that be?

408
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,510
But my son told me

409
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,762
that he'd die without you.

410
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,602
He said he'd cut ties with me
if I continued to oppose.

411
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,688
So what else could I do?

412
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,149
I have no choice but to surrender.

413
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,277
So...

414
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:38,157
endure everything for Suho.

415
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,285
I'll try to endure you too.

416
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,251
Let's go.

417
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,665
Thanks.

418
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,833
For what?

419
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,336
For...

420
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,172
...taking me back.

421
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,222
Will you give me your hand?

422
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,410
Do you remember when I proposed to you?

423
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,789
No matter what happens,

424
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,876
I said we'd always be together.

425
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,464
We've been apart for so long, right?

426
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,388
So I'm going to propose
to you again today.

427
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,027
Thank you...

428
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,324
for allowing me to be by your side again.

429
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,409
And...

430
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,624
for allowing me to be Gunwoo's dad.

431
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,545
Thank you for that.

432
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,132
Soohyun.

433
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,512
Let's walk together
in the present now, okay?

434
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,350
From now on,

435
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,229
I'll always be with you.

436
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,238
Let's be happy.

437
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,719
Oh.

438
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,390
- Have you been well?
- Yes...

439
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,351
- Have you returned home?
- Yes.

440
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,152
Are you Heejae?

441
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,280
You're so grown up.

442
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,241
Heejae, say hello.

443
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,243
She's Gunwoo's mom.

444
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,080
- Hello.
- Do you remember me?

445
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,584
You played in our garden often.

446
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,628
Yes, I remember playing soccer
with Gunwoo.

447
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,014
- We'll see you around.
- Ah.

448
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,590
I still break every day

449
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,508
in a pain that can't be healed.

450
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,552
That's why I came to find you.

451
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:54,514
I hoped you weren't trapped in pain
like me.

452
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,018
I wished you would accept
her heartfelt apology

453
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,978
and try to live your life.

454
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,366
Director Kang, come in.

455
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,161
You became the face of the 8 O'clock News.
Plus a special broadcast.

456
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,038
The ratings will be good

457
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,540
- since you're popular, right?
- Of course.

458
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,210
Did you want to speak to me
about something?

459
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,129
Director, we were wondering.

460
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,049
How about making an appearance
with your wife?

461
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,510
That sounds good.

462
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,761
What do you say?

463
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,765
Yes, I'm sorry. That will be difficult.

464
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,227
I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

465
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,938
Still, could you talk to her about it?

466
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,108
Director Kang?

467
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,652
What can I say?
I have a meeting for the evening news.

468
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,612
I should go.

469
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,990
- I'll see you again.
- Sure.

470
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,332
I don't think he'll do it.

471
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:07,170
Kang Suho's the face of ABS now.

472
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,592
Shouldn't we check to see
if his murderer wife

473
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,804
will be his Achilles heel or cheat key?

474
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,098
Here's your coffee.

475
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,891
Isn't this place nice?

476
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,186
- Yes.
- I found a lot of great places

477
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,063
to go with you and Mom.

478
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,815
- Seriously?
- What?

479
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,860
- You should go with a boyfriend.
- She's right.

480
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,987
Are you seeing anyone?

481
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,324
Even if I wanted to,
no one catches my eye.

482
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,994
Anyone decent is already taken.

483
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,375
- Try this.
- Okay.

484
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,129
Hello?

485
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:55,260
Yes. I see.

486
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,805
I'll think about it.

487
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,267
Okay.

488
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:11,151
What type of uncomfortable call was that?

489
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,903
What do you have to think about?

490
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,197
It was about Suho.

491
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,366
He's doing a special broadcast.

492
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,577
The producer in charge

493
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,663
asked me if I could make an appearance
with him.

494
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,792
Hmm.

495
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,254
Did Suho say anything?

496
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,466
- No.
- If he didn't bring it up,

497
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,093
I'm sure there's a reason for it.

498
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:40,180
You'll end up getting hurt
if you make that appearance

499
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,265
and people start gossiping about you.

500
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,809
That's how I feel too.

501
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,770
I feel the same way.

502
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,065
I'm sure there are people who support you,

503
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,234
but there will be people
who will criticize.

504
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,319
I'm worried you might get hurt.

Why didn't you tell me they wanted me
to make an appearance on your special?

516
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,837
How did you know that?
By chance, did someone call?

517
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,173
Those people. I swear...

518
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,342
- I told them.
- Honey.

519
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,011
I'll...

520
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,348
do it.

521
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,770
No, I know you're doing it for me,

522
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,064
but don't worry about it.

523
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,107
Aren't I allowed to do something for you?

524
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:00,779
I know how many inconveniences
you'll have to deal with because of me

525
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,948
because you're in that position.

526
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:05,867
Also...

527
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,787
I don't want to be someone
you have to protect.

528
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,581
I want to be someone

529
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,668
who can walk beside you.

530
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,879
- I understand, but honey--
- This...

531
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,217
could become that opportunity for us.

532
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,052
Okay?

533
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,815
The new face of ABS's 8 O'clock News.

534
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:40,735
We have Anchorman Kang Suho and his wife
here with us today.

535
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,281
I really wanted to meet you.

536
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,159
You won the grand prize for journalists.
Congratulations.

537
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,287
- Thank you.
- Yes.

538
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:56,001
As for Ms. Eun Soohyun,
you took quite the difficult step.

539
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,585
Thank you so much for coming.

540
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:16,896
We will be talking
with both people here today.

541
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,232
It's been quite some time,

542
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,361
but I'm sure it's still difficult
to talk about.

543
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,156
I apologize beforehand for asking
these questions.

544
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,451
Have you been getting through it?

545
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,835
I don't know.
The sadness of losing your child

546
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,628
is not something you can get through.

547
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,298
It hurts every day.

548
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,842
It's still very difficult.

549
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,929
As for you,

550
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:55,018
I'm sure it wasn't easy
to come on the show.

551
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,438
I know it may be difficult,

552
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,982
but can you share your thoughts as well?

553
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,985
I'm sure

554
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,990
it could be uncomfortable for some people
to see me.

555
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,658
However,

556
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,996
I wanted to say this.

557
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,290
I was...

558
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,838
the mother of a child...

559
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,509
...whose life was
more precious than mine.

560
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,972
And I lost that child overnight.

561
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,477
He was a child who loved the stars,

562
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,146
and he became a star to us.

563
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,735
I try
to accept that every day,

564
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,239
but there are times when I can't.

565
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,620
A parent who loses a child

566
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,458
still hurts
no matter how much time passes.

567
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,839
Still...

568
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,428
I think it's time...

569
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,306
...to let everything go and forget.

570
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,436
I wasn't able to protect

571
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,980
this man beside me or my family

572
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,525
because of my pain.

573
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,696
If I want to protect
the rest of my family,

574
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,615
I must...

575
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:39,247
...try my best
to become a mother

576
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,376
that Gunwoo would be proud of,

577
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,504
and a better wife than I was yesterday.

578
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,007
Yes.

579
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,892
Is this for Eun Soohyun?

580
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:23,208
Will you say
one last thing to the viewers?

581
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,585
My wife and I

582
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,505
have endured a hard time together.

583
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,674
It has made us stronger. And...

584
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,053
our feelings for one another

585
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,680
have strengthened.

586
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,099
That will never change.

587
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:47,440
To all the parents out there
who have been through the same pain,

588
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,443
we hope...

589
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,280
you can endure it.

590
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,324
Thank you.

591
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,535
Thank you.

592
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,251
- Great job.
- That was great.

593
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,336
- Great job.
- I was so worried.

594
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,296
Wasn't that difficult?

595
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,465
Director, great job.

596
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,548
MISSED CALL
GWON SEONYUL

597
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,106
- Hello?
- It's Gwon Seonyul.

598
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,192
The diary.

599
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,823
I'm not confident I can forgive her,

600
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,409
still...

601
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,703
I'll read it.

602
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,413
Text me.

603
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,176
Meet me
at Solgang Nursing Center at 2.

604
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,981
RECIPIENT
EUN SOOHYUN

605
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,935
But I can't help but wonder
about who sent that photo to me.

606
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,688
I can't stop thinking about who the woman
in the photo is.

607
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,565
The person who took it is a pro.

608
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,985
Did something happen today?

609
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,446
-

610
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,697
I'm his guardian.

611
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,325
Don't try to dull the pain.

612
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,827
Just bury it.

613
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,496
Don't look back.

614
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,045
What have you been doing?
Why did I get something like this?
