ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,904
I don't have...

5
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,032
any pictures of my mom.

2016 HANKOOK UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE CEREMONY

00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,676
LATE KIM EUNMIN
CHIEF MOURNER GWON SEONYUL

8
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,145
Seonyul's mom

9
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,688
passed away.

10
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,817
A man ran here
with her on his back.

11
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,569
Put her down there.

12
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,279
Help me.

13
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,199
Ma'am, can you hear me?

14
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,785
Ma'am, do you hear my voice?

15
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,015
What brings you here?

16
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,894
Are you here to see me?

17
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,361
Apologize.

18
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,657
Just earlier today...

19
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,703
I was punished for my crimes in court.

20
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,787
No.

21
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,375
Apologize to my son.

22
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,712
When I think about it,

23
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,422
you didn't...

24
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,259
apologize to him at all.

25
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,513
You almost had me there.

26
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,391
Okay. Deal.

27
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,106
But...

28
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,774
how much?

29
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,003
EPISODE 11

30
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,087
What's this?

31
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,109
Seonyul.

32
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,194
She's here.

33
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,919
Kim Eunmin.

34
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,922
It wasn't easy for me

35
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,800
to come all this way.

36
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,219
I...

37
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,724
still can't forgive your husband
for taking Gunwoo away from me.

38
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,644
Ever since he killed my son that day,

39
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,858
my life has been hanging on by a thread.

40
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,569
I was as good as dead.

41
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,530
But...

42
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,908
I came here to tell you this.

43
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,786
I'll help

44
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,080
your son.

45
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,709
That's the least I can do.

46
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,546
I'll give Seonyul's mother

47
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,341
not Gwon Jiwoong's wife

48
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,509
my word.

49
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,722
So...

50
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,058
please...

51
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
rest in peace.

52
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,257
What are you doing here?

53
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,637
Don't think about anything else.

54
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,141
Focus on sending your mom off.

55
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,395
Did you come here

56
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,563
to see me like this?

57
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,632
Give yourself a chance to be sad.

58
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,553
Let yourself suffer.

59
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,641
I'll see you after that.

60
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,289
- Great job.
- Thank you.

61
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,851
GUNWOO'S DATA

62
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,473
- What are you doing there?
- Oh.

63
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,934
I just needed to pack some stuff.

64
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,317
Seonyul's mom passed away.

65
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,620
Hey...

66
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,081
Did you go?

67
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,917
You know who his father was.

68
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,422
He intentionally approached you,
harassed you,

69
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,508
and destroyed our relationship.

70
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,344
This is what he wanted.

71
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,056
He's working for Kim Joon.

72
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,808
He's dangerous.

73
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,895
Do you know what mindset I had
when I came here?

74
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,400
Talking to you like this...

75
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,112
is hard for me.

76
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,906
You should focus on your work.

77
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,449
I'll focus on mine.

78
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,422
Excuse me, ma'am?

79
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,340
Yes?

80
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,800
Aren't you going home?

81
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,136
Well, I had some work left.

82
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,345
Go ahead.

83
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,556
Great work.

84
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,154
Cheers!

85
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,865
Ah!

86
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,826
Professor, I saw your segment.

87
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,495
- You were so cool!
- I went to the bookstore yesterday,

88
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,040
- and your book is doing so well!
- Professor, I respect you!

89
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,751
- Respect!
- Jeez.

90
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,128
Look at the compliments flowing
because I'm buying.

91
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,380
- Not at all.
- No way.

92
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,382
I just happen to have a question!

93
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,385
How can we live as wonderfully as you?

94
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,972
Hmm.

95
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,684
Me existing as myself.

96
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,061
To do that, believe in yourself
more than anyone.

97
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,355
That's how you maintain your self-respect.

98
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,484
You'll be able to rise back up
after something difficult.

99
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,446
We may not have connections
but we have self-respect.

100
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,825
To self-respect!

101
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,911
Cheers!

102
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,706
Now, here's your tasty chicken!

103
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,129
Quiet, everyone.

104
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,673
Say hi to my sister.

105
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,135
- Hello.
- Hello. Enjoy.

106
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,387
- Thank you.
- Wow, it's grilled chicken!

107
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,014
The skin's so crispy.

108
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,016
The cheese
and chicken are perfect!

109
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,726
- Hey, hurry up and eat.
- Mmm.

110
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,603
The scorched rice is good too.

111
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,642
How have you been, Goeun?

112
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,812
You must be busy.

113
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm sorry I came without calling.

114
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,026
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

115
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,282
Would you like something to drink?

116
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,701
No, it's fine. I already had something.

117
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,333
Also, this.

118
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,797
I heard you collapsed,
and I couldn't even visit.

119
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,299
I'm so sorry.

120
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,600
Think of the kids,
and take care of your health.

121
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,395
If you want to see Soohyun

122
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,898
back to teaching again

123
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,150
and publishing another book.

124
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,243
Since you were discharged,

125
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,372
shall we have a family dinner?
It's been so long.

126
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,958
- Myunghee.
- Yes?

127
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,793
Don't try so hard.

128
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,215
I'll do what Soohyun wants.

129
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,135
I'm going to respect Soohyun's choice.

130
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,387
Still

131
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,806
as the adult of the family,

132
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,517
shouldn't we stop the children
from splitting up?

133
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,356
If Soohyun was your daughter,

134
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,816
could you say the same thing?

135
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
I think...

136
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,825
I should get going.

137
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,830
Take care of yourself.

138
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,010
I'd tell Soohyun

139
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,013
to get a divorce too.

140
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,351
If Soohyun was my daughter.

141
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,188
To be honest,

142
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,817
I adored Soohyun a lot.

143
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,153
She's my daughter-in-law,

144
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
but she was amazing.

145
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,701
But...

146
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,036
I am...

147
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,250
Suho's mother.

148
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,362
Soohyun.

149
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
Back then

150
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,326
we were all in pain.

151
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,246
Can you forgive him

152
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,707
just once?

153
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,335
Mother.

154
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,880
My mom...

155
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,092
is going through a very hard time.

156
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,472
She's holding on for me.

157
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,849
Please

158
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,393
don't say...

159
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,896
anything else.

160
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,108
I'll come see you
once I get my feelings organized.

161
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,944
Get home safely.

162
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,991
Take good care...

163
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,786
of your mother.

164
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,625
PURENEBOM

165
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,769
Mom?

166
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,439
What brings you here at this time?

167
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,442
I bought you a coat.

168
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,195
Seriously?

169
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,572
Stop worrying about me.

170
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,574
See. I'm fine!

171
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,162
Try it on.

172
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,791
Why did you buy something so expensive?

173
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,751
You look so pretty.

174
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,045
Mom, make sure you keep yourself warm.

175
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,672
Okay, thanks.

176
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,927
That's right! Wait a second.
I'll bring you some side dishes.

177
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,720
Goodness.

178
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,142
I told you to stay at the hospital
for a few more days.

179
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,769
Why would we waste money
on hospital bills?

180
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,982
I'm so thankful to the young man
who took me to the hospital.

181
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,777
Do you...

182
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,739
- ...know him well?
- Yes.

183
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,034
He comes here whenever he thinks
of his mom's stew.

184
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,872
To me, he looked to be in pain
rather than being hungry.

185
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,333
Strangely, I couldn't stop
worrying about him.

186
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,463
He's young,
but he looked so tired and sad.

187
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,352
I'll go ahead.

188
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,354
Okay.

189
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,326
You must be busy
preparing for the election.

190
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,080
Is that what's important right now?
Didn't I tell you I'd be your father?

191
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,208
I heard...

192
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,585
your mom woke up for a moment.

193
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,130
Did she say anything?

194
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,175
I didn't see her

195
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,428
in her last moments.

196
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,563
Let it all go now.

197
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,066
I hope you feel at ease too.

198
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,151
I'll do the same.

199
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,574
You went through so much
taking care of your sick mother.

200
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,212
Mr. Kim.

201
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,219
I need to learn more about...

202
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,347
my mom's accident.

203
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,561
What for? It's all over.

204
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,438
I just...

205
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,191
heard something strange.

206
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,446
You must be busy.

207
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,656
You should go.

208
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,037
Yes.

209
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,414
If there's something on your mind,

210
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,124
you should look into it.

211
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,794
Call me if you ever need anything.

212
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,713
Okay?

213
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,735
It's all over.
Why is he so reluctant to give it up?

214
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,740
He must not feel at ease
after his mother died.

215
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,079
Let's go.

216
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,827
Great job, guys. Thanks a lot.

217
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,120
Do you want company?

218
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,665
No, I want to be alone.

219
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,211
I can be here in five seconds if you call.
Call me.

220
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,924
Bye.

221
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,642
Let's go.

222
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,187
I think it's her phone.

223
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,198
Hey, honey.

224
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,866
Where are you, honey?

225
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,621
Did you get a probation?

226
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,792
I'm so relieved.

227
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,379
I told you.

228
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,172
Nothing would happen.

229
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,969
Yes, we just got home
after Seonyul's exam.

230
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,055
He's fine.

231
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,446
What about the boy's mother?
Poor thing.

232
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,782
It's a good day. Why would you bring up
that dead kid?

233
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,328
Do I have time to care about that kid?

234
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,038
Don't say ridiculous things.

235
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,835
- What brings you here?
- Hello?

236
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,757
Are you here to see me?

237
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:34,968
What's wrong?

238
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,803
Honey?

239
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,722
Apologize.

240
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:43,643
Just earlier today...
I was punished for my crimes in court.

241
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,604
No.

242
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,896
Apologize to my son.

243
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,983
When I think about it,

244
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,652
you didn't apologize to him at all.

245
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,115
You almost had me there.

246
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,200
Okay. Deal.

247
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,996
But how much?

248
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,374
Just so you know,
I'm not responsible for this anymore.

249
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,710
I'd like to offer some
to show my sense of duty.

250
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,339
You're lucky to have met someone like me.

251
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,634
Once you're ready, you can call me.

252
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,305
You scared me.
What do you think you're doing right now?

253
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,223
Apologize.

254
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,476
You ruined my child's life.

255
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,478
So apologize properly!

256
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,148
Look here, lady. That's enough.
I won't be considerate anymore.

257
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,942
Apologize!

258
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,153
- What the hell? Seriously?
- 

259
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,909
Sir!

260
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,663
Please!
Please, apologize.

261
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,457
- Please, apologize to him.
- Hey!

262
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,293
Do you know how many businesses
I'm involved in right now?

263
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,755
Do you know how many deals I've lost
because of your kid?

264
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,757
He could've died anywhere else!

265
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,759
Why did he have to get hit by my car?

266
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,064
Seonyul. She's here.

267
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,649
I'll start the anesthesia.

268
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,739
I wanted an ordinary life too.

269
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,159
- ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

270
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,287
Make a wish!

271
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,633
I wanted to be a good son.

272
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,398
It's all done.

273
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,632
All I had left...

274
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,093
was my vengeance towards you, Eun Soohyun.

275
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,543
Even if it's not painful,
don't get hurt anymore.

276
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Take care of yourself.

277
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,380
Wouldn't your life be a waste?
Can't you live a proper life?

278
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,131
Think of your parents.

279
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,343
- I can't see you ruin yourself anymore.
- You're a murderer.

280
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,303
Did you think
I'd be your guardian

281
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,306
without any level of commitment?

282
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,644
I'm going to keep meddling in your life.
I have to see you live a proper life.

283
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:56,980
What...

284
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,023
do I do now?

285
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,575
Seonyul! Hey, Seonyul!

286
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,660
Are you up?

287
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,246
Seonyul!

288
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,498
Have you eaten?

289
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,375
Seonyul!

290
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,334
Eat it.

291
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,676
I've done this before too.

292
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,597
It was even hard to have a sip of water.

293
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,642
I even tried living

294
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,937
as if I were dead, but none of that helps.

295
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,609
You have something to do.

296
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,045
So what do you know?

297
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,673
You have to pull yourself together first.

298
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,968
Then I can tell you.

299
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,214
Hey, Soohyun.

300
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,924
Mom.

301
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,385
What are you doing?

302
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,054
What do you think? I'm working.

303
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,139
Let's go...

304
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,349
get some air.

305
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,643
I'm busy.

306
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,604
Just close the restaurant for one day.

307
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,399
Come out.

308
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,651
I'm out front.

309
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,326
It's so pretty.

310
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,120
Look at this.

311
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,955
- Pretty?
- It's so pretty!

312
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,290
Shall we see scarves?

313
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,001
- I'll buy you one.
- No, you do it.

314
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,460
I'll buy it.

315
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,712
No, Mom.

316
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,214
- I already have one.
- Mom, you look great.

317
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,966
You're so pretty.

318
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,387
Welcome.

319
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:29,103
Goodness. My hands are ugly.
This is so embarrassing.

320
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,148
Your hands are beautiful, Mom.

321
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,941
These hands raised me.

322
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,694
They're the prettiest hands in the world.

323
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,905
Do it.

324
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,949
Pick your favorite from here.

325
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,262
Ah!

326
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,232
It's not too late to confess.

327
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,534
It's been so long.

328
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,293
To be honest,
I have something to tell you...

329
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,673
What is it? What is it this time?

330
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,676
My sister-in-law? Or my brother?

331
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,345
Excuse me?

332
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,141
Yes.

333
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,813
I asked Kang Taeho to introduce me
to Eun Soohyun.

334
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,109
I'm approaching him well, so don't worry.

335
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,446
I'm a little busy right now.

336
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,659
I'll call you again later.

337
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,704
Are you a fool?

338
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,124
You said you heard me.

339
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,459
I approached you on purpose.

340
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,544
But...

341
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,505
why would you call me again?

342
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,424
Yes.

343
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,551
I know why you approached me.

344
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,554
I'm letting you use me.

345
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,640
I'll let you.

346
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,449
It's comfortable
that they grill it for you.

347
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,869
- Enjoy it.
- Okay, thank you.

348
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,206
Mom, eat up and make sure
you don't collapse again.

349
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,291
Okay.

350
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,338
Try it like this.

351
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,012
Mmm.

352
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,015
It's really delicious this way.

353
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,019
Mom, eat it slowly.

354
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,188
It's so good.

355
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,984
Can we get two servings to go as well?

356
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,152
Okay.

357
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,241
Now, here's one for you.

358
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,748
- Mmm.
- Is it good?

359
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,168
It's better eating it with you.

360
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,920
Yes.

361
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,474
I'm living in luxury thanks to you today.

362
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,270
Wow, it's nice.

363
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:09,156
EUN SOOHYUN

364
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
LOVE IN TIME

365
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,537
- Here.
- It's finally out.

366
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,915
I wanted to show you first.

367
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,917
Why am I so nervous?

368
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,798
My wife is so impressive.

369
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,217
You worked so hard.

370
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,886
You helped me so much. I'm grateful.

371
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,681
What are you talking about?
You did all the hard work.

372
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,268
I'll continue to help you,

373
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,145
Writer Eun Soohyun.

374
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,522
- Here.
- Here.

375
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,661
Is there something...

376
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,497
you want to tell me?

377
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
What is it?

378
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,215
Mom.

379
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,300
Yes?

380
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,969
The person...

381
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,266
who sent us that photo...

382
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,564
was Gwon Jiwoong's

383
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,524
son.

384
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,655
Do you remember...

385
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,451
the boy who carried you

386
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,120
to the hospital?

387
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,750
That was him.

388
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,510
Why...

389
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,721
would you tell me that now?

390
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,266
You knew all of that,

391
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,519
so why did you endure it alone?

392
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,188
You should've told me.

393
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,986
How did you do that alone?

394
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,785
How did you bear all that burden?

395
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,622
It was...

396
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,627
so hard on me.

397
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,766
He's the son of the man who killed my son,

398
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,978
I hate him so much.

399
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,273
But seeing him like this...

400
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,610
makes me pity him as a person.

401
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,279
I just...

402
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,283
wanted everything to stop.

403
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:03,080
I was so scared because I thought
everything was going to break.

404
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,136
It must've been so hard on you alone.

405
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,471
I didn't...

406
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,890
know anything.

407
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,312
I couldn't do anything for you.

408
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,838
Mom.

409
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,590
Shall we just...

410
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,843
live here together like this?

411
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,555
No.

412
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,226
I'm going to see the flowers
all over the world.

413
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,229
You can go with me.

414
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:14,610
If I'm going, I should go
with a handsome man.

415
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,030
What?

416
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,991
What was that?

417
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,961
But, Soohyun?

418
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,470
After I'm gone...

419
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,851
no one will be with you.

420
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:54,233
Then don't leave.
Just be by my side like this.

421
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,486
That tickles. Stop!

422
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,073
Get away.

423
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,408
Go to bed now.

424
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,034
Go to sleep.

425
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,938
That child.

426
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,818
Don't hate him too much.

427
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,682
GWON SEONYUL

428
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:44,927
Hello?

429
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,475
You scared me.
What do you think you're doing right now?

430
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,936
Apologize.

431
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,356
You ruined my child's life.

432
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,442
So apologize properly!

433
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,740
Look here, lady. That's enough.

434
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,784
I won't be considerate anymore.

435
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,287
Apologize!

436
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,082
What the hell? Seriously?

437
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,584
Damn it.

438
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,173
Mister... Mister!

439
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,342
No, sir!

440
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,722
I...

441
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,934
still can't forgive you.

442
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,270
But why are you doing this to me?

443
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,363
I know it's hard for you to see me too.

444
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,284
Yes.

445
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:52,995
It was.

446
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,248
I lost my child.

447
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,127
I was in prison for seven years.

448
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,006
When I was inside...

449
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,926
I missed my child...

450
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,554
every single day.

451
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,767
Also, I hated the person
who did that to him.

452
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,646
But I learned something one day.

453
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,566
That person...

454
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,070
also had a family.

455
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,798
I already knew...

456
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,469
that you were in hell.

457
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,305
Inmate 4811! Stay with me!

458
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,314
It was the same for me.

459
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,691
But I turned away from it.

460
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,152
I thought I'd be able...

461
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,661
to survive if I did this...

462
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,166
or else I would die.

463
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,837
Don't get me started.

464
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,673
The pictures of Kim Eunmin's accident
you requested

465
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,175
were so hard to find.

466
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,260
Oh.

467
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,513
Thank you so much.

468
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,266
If we ever get the chance,

469
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,392
I promise...

470
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,645
to repay you with an interview.

471
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,899
That would be
an infinite honor.

472
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,651
Please check the email I sent.

473
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,736
By the way,

474
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,530
are you still digging around that case?

475
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,396
Hello?

476
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,691
Hello, Attorney Lee.

477
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,154
Well...

478
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:18,450
I called because I wanted to ask
a few questions.

479
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,744
By chance...

480
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,081
can you introduce me to a lawyer

481
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,250
who specializes in traffic accidents?

482
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,295
BAEKDUDAEGAN ATTORNEY KANG YUNSEOK
THURSDAY 11 A.M.

483
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,548
Kang Yunseok?

484
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,135
Kang Yunseok.

485
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,198
BAEKJEONBAEKSEUNG LAW FIRM
ATTORNEY KANG YUNSEOK

486
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,336
Right. The lawyer
who represented Kim Eunmin's perpetrator.

487
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,598
BAEKDUDAEGAN LAW FIRM

488
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,686
There's a long distance

489
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,437
before this car stops.

490
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,231
They must've been speeding.

491
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,402
Still, despite all of that,

492
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,113
these skid marks and the accident spot
should be closer.

493
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,575
What do you mean by that?

494
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,955
It means the driver saw the victim
and only hit the brakes after the crash.

495
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,040
By chance,

496
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,792
maybe they were too slow

497
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,252
to react to the situation

498
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,130
because they're an inexperienced driver.

499
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,758
Then they would've
steered to the right.

500
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,469
Take a look.

501
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,722
The angles of the skid marks
show the driver

502
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,348
had no intention of swerving.

503
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,641
They're too straight.

504
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,019
Then...

505
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,980
are you saying it was intentional?

506
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,690
Of course.

507
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,526
There's a 90% chance or more
this was a deliberate accident.

508
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,029
You'll win this case.

509
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,866
May I...

510
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,912
ask for a favor?

511
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,608
LOVE IN TIME

512
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,929
There are no wiretaps or hidden cameras.

513
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,891
What's going on?

514
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,060
Why are you being like this?

515
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,895
I think someone came here

516
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,022
- when I wasn't home.
- What?

517
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,192
Who would do that?

518
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:50,240
Mr. Kim, I need to learn more
about my mom's accident.

519
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,453
- What for? It's all over.
- I just heard something strange.

520
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,170
I heard your mom
woke up for a moment.

521
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,382
Did she say anything?

522
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,886
Nothing's been installed,
they must've been looking for something.

523
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,556
Looking for what?

524
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,018
That's right.

525
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,146
Things were so hectic,

526
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,023
so I couldn't tell you
because I didn't know what it meant,

527
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,069
but your mom said something strange
before she died.

528
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,573
What did she say?

529
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,911
Seonyul's on his way. Just wait.

530
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,623
What?

531
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,469
Ma'am, give us some space.

532
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,351
But, Seonyul.

533
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,105
Why do you think she said that
with her dying breath?

534
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,124
GWON SEONYUL

535
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,259
- Hello?
- You told me to call you

536
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,677
when I was ready.

537
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,930
Yes.

538
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,559
Let's meet.

539
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,575
GWON SEONYUL

540
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,738
Why did you do it?

541
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,324
Why did you say my mom's accident
wasn't an accident?

542
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,788
That car that day...

543
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,792
didn't cause the accident
because they couldn't slow down.

544
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,302
They said he was waiting for a while.

545
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,892
Waiting for your mom to show up.

546
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,215
These are all the documents I gathered.

547
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,719
I've finished verifying it.

548
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,596
I got all the consults too.

549
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,974
You can decide to bury it...

550
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,143
or go all the way.

551
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,356
Why did he do it?

552
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,153
He was asked to kill your mother.

553
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,991
Who is he?

554
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,121
You know who it is.

555
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,085
Kim Joon.

556
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,015
What's your reason?

557
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,228
Why do you work for him
when you know everything?

558
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,382
Are you really working for Kim Joon
because of this?

559
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,302
Great job.

560
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,431
- Who did it?
- I sent it.

561
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,851
Did you follow him around
while she was in prison?

562
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:13,438
- Are you trying to torment her?
- I won't forgive anyone...

563
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,815
who hurt my parents.

564
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,876
All of this
is connected to one person.

565
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,419
Kim Joon! Kim Joon!

566
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,129
He caused
the accident on purpose.

567
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,215
Come out!

568
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,509
Mister.
Make sure he's punished properly.

569
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,261
Make sure you didn't
miss anything in your mom's case.

570
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,805
Think about it one more time.

571
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,432
He said he was looking
into his mom's accident.

572
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,185
But he's hanging out
with Eun Soohyun.

573
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,063
You knew all of this.

574
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,315
Can you forgive him?

575
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,691
I'm sorry.
