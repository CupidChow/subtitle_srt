00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,618
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,328
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,218
It didn't matter...

5
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,771
how my life went on...

6
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,072
after Gunwoo died.

7
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,033
Seriously?

8
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,416
My life was over then.

9
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,511
But then I received a photo.

10
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,058
I learned...

11
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,435
SIXTH ANNUAL FAMILY SPRING PICNIC

12
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,978
...who sent it too.

13
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,025
His son...

14
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,073
You said I could meet him.

15
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,702
Do you want to meet him?

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,875
Relay the message for me.

17
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,463
He can harass me all he wants.

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,383
If he wants to see me in pain,
I'll gladly suffer.

19
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,801
But...

20
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,388
not my family.

21
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,475
I won't allow him

22
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,853
to mess with my family

23
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,689
over his anger towards me.

24
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,320
That person...

25
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,701
also lost his dad.

26
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,375
I lost...

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,424
my child.

28
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,638
A mother who lost her child unfairly...

29
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,727
will do anything.

30
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,852
EPISODE 8

31
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,397
Hello, Mother.

32
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,983
Hello.

33
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,277
Have you been well?

34
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,823
- I heard your knees aren't well.
It comes with age.

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
I keep breaking down.

36
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,787
I'm ashamed to face my children.

37
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,830
Don't say that.

38
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,958
It's not like you want to be in pain.

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,211
You could've just brought
your mother-in-law.

40
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,921
Why did you ask me to come?

41
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,716
It wasn't me.
Soohyun wanted to invite you both.

42
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,512
As a daughter and daughter-in-law,

43
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,390
I haven't treated either of you right.

44
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,767
I'll treat you both much better.

45
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,853
- Let's go in.
- Yes, let's go.

46
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,189
Go on ahead. Okay.

47
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,732
Let's go.

48
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,822
Your back is very tense right now.

49
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,199
Hmm.

50
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,665
Your pelvis is twisted.
I can see why your knees hurt.

51
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,507
What is it?

52
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,718
I don't know.

53
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,096
It's nice you look so spirited,

54
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,017
but you seem different too.

55
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,604
Mom.

56
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,608
Everyone waited for me
and protected me all this time.

57
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,320
It's my turn now.

58
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,824
I'll make sure nothing happens
to our family.

59
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,535
I'll protect everyone.

60
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,500
My son's a doctor.
Why bring me to an oriental clinic?

61
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,378
Taeho takes you to the hospital.

62
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,256
Soohyun did this for you both.

63
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,342
Think of it in a good way.

64
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,513
You looked tired on the news.

65
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,557
Take care of yourself.

66
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,687
Your wife at home
should be taking care of that.

67
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,398
Don't worry. We take care of each other.

68
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,691
Take a seat.

69
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,909
What about you?

70
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,619
Do you like Soohyun that much?

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
You said you'd accept her.

72
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,459
- Why are you being like that?
- I'm just curious.

73
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,338
You have a history with her.

74
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,422
Not to mention,

75
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,674
there was that incident.

76
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,427
Do you still like her that much?

77
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,809
Let's be honest.

78
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,148
You liked her more.

79
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,200
Are you done?

80
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,495
Was the treatment okay?

81
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,379
Let's go.

82
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,855
I was able to be a dutiful son
thanks to you.

83
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,565
Thanks.

84
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
I promise...

85
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,281
to treat you better too.

86
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,201
What do you mean? I'll treat you better.

87
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,758
He can harass me all he wants.

88
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,594
- But...
- 

89
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,928
...not my family.

90
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,976
I lost my child.

91
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,187
A mother who lost her child unfairly...

92
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,399
will do anything.

93
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,866
Are you crazy?

94
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,076
What's with you? You'll pass out again!

95
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
Sit down.

96
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,418
Did that woman say something to you again?

97
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
Huh?

98
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,590
Do you know...

99
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,052
when people feel the most pain?

100
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,597
When their family...

101
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,059
is ruined right before their eyes.

102
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,605
Like me right now.

103
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,987
- Seonyul.
- I'm going to go all the way.

104
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,657
Until I reach her end...

105
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,744
or mine.

106
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,943
I've been waiting...

107
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,737
for the moment for her
to find happiness again.

108
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,447
I missed you so much, Soohyun.

109
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,659
From now on,

110
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,536
I'll always be with you.

111
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,669
My wife and I have endured
a hard time together.

112
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,213
It has made us stronger. And...

113
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,132
our feelings for one another

114
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,843
have strengthened.

115
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,220
That will never change.

116
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,413
I'm going to make you suffer

117
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,791
more than I did.

118
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,461
I'm going to make you...

119
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,839
truly regret it.

120
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,638
Hey.

121
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,477
- Hello.
- Hi.

122
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,984
Well, hello.

123
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,617
What brings you here?

124
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,995
I think you should give me
the victim's information again.

125
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,124
- Excuse me?
- Seonyul isn't the one

126
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,792
I was looking for, Professor.

127
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,676
To be honest,

128
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,887
he's an old friend of my niece.

129
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,559
He's lived a life of immense pain.

130
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,019
You couldn't imagine it.

131
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,440
That can't justify
your actions, Professor.

132
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,698
I know. I leaked counseling records
and changed the victim's identity.

133
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,950
You could report me
and I couldn't stop you.

134
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,121
What do you think will happen

135
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,040
once his revenge is over?

136
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,836
There will come a time when he realizes

137
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,549
that nothing has changed even after
he did what he had to.

138
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,179
From then on, being alive
will feel no different than being dead.

139
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,600
I can't let Seonyul live like that.

140
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,727
The fire victim too.

141
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,901
I'm sorry I was so late.

142
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,527
GWON MINHYUK

143
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,265
Were you the one that called me?
What do you have to give me?

144
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,602
What? Did she leave behind
some money or something?

145
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,481
You don't expect me
to forgive her, do you?

146
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,982
I heard...

147
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,820
- you got the diary.
- So what?

148
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,324
Will saying sorry after killing
my parents make everything okay?

149
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,535
Why did she die?

150
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,996
I can't even resent her now! So, why?

151
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,541
I wanted to kill her once she got out.

152
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,334
Get lost if you're not going to pay me.

153
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,172
If you come back here talking about
her or her diary again, I'll kill you.

154
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,259
Damn it.

155
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,469
So?

156
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,681
How much longer will you live like this?

157
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,267
What?

158
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,938
Living like this won't bring back
your late parents.

159
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,399
If ruining your life is revenge,

160
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,568
- who does that really harm?
- Shut up.

161
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,279
What do you know?

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,406
I went through...

163
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,325
everything you went through.

164
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,829
I lost my son unjustly,

165
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,956
I got revenge,

166
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,001
and threw away my life too.

167
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,546
Still,

168
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,132
I chose to live again.

169
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,968
You have a choice too.

170
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,678
Continue to live like this,

171
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,432
or live a proper life
on behalf of your parents as well.

172
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,442
There are more people out there

173
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,736
who are willing to help you.

174
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,906
Call me when you decide.

175
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,677
Damn it.

176
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,323
Yoon Hyegeum,
the director of Geum Gallery

177
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,158
run by Junseong Welfare Foundation.

178
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,661
She went to an art school in France.

179
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,830
Currently, she's back in Korea
with her son.

180
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,341
I'm Director Yoon Hyegeum of Geum Gallery.

181
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,594
The painting
I will introduce to you all today

182
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,056
is Francesca and Paolo

183
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,976
from Circle 2 of Dante's Inferno.

184
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,107
While Francesca's husband went out to war,

185
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,858
she had an affair

186
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,444
with her brother-in-law.

187
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,613
The painting depicts her murder

188
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,491
after her husband found out.

189
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,786
As you said,
she has an incredible sponsor.

190
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,124
Shall we move onto the next piece?

191
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,388
You've been looking at this painting
for a while now.

192
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,266
I like it.

193
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,144
It's a sad love story between the two.

194
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,645
To someone else,

195
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,023
wouldn't it be a tragedy?

196
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,860
He was betrayed by the two people
he loved the most.

197
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,201
Here, I hear it's going
in the congressman's office.

198
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
The secretary will know about it.

199
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,103
It's done.

200
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,439
Here.

201
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,809
Professor Kim Sira,

202
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,646
he will get treatment again.

203
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,900
I'll take full responsibility
until the end.

204
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,778
It's near the southern end.

205
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,698
The sea's in front

206
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,035
and in the back,
there's this little hill.

207
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,829
There's a very old tree at the top.

208
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,874
They say if you touch it and make a wish,
it'll come true.

209
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,003
What will you wish for if you go there?

210
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,421
What about you?

211
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,423
I'd wish

212
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,300
for all the people

213
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,803
who suffered because of me
to find happiness in their lives.

214
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,972
Let's go there

215
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,391
together one day.

216
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,477
Hyeongja!

217
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,274
Could you

218
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,401
give these letters to him

219
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,778
for me?

220
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,363
That child endured

221
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,283
a hard time as much as you did.

222
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,329
Can you help him put
that great pain behind him?

223
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,040
Hyeongja.

224
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,170
I finally gave it to him.

225
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,435
How much is this?

226
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,312
It's five billion won.

227
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,607
It's expensive. Hang it well.

228
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,067
Yes, sir.

229
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,199
What did you have to tell me?

230
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,080
It's what you asked about before.

231
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,090
My wife received
an anonymous gift recently.

232
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,300
Were you the one who sent it?

233
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,221
Who did it?

234
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,848
I sent it.

235
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,978
Was it over your father?

236
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,650
Did you follow him around
while she was in prison?

237
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,777
Are you trying to torment her?

238
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,280
I won't forgive anyone...

239
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,074
for hurting my parents.

240
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,627
Seonyul.

241
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,881
As an adult, I should tell you to forgive.

242
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,511
Your resentment must've been so deep.

243
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,434
I can't even stop you.

244
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,602
On your way to the Blue House,

245
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,647
I'll make sure Kang Suho
won't get in your way.

246
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,453
I'm finally eating
my first meal.

247
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,831
Mmm.

248
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,752
It's nice having someone grill the meat.

249
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,129
- It tastes better.
- It's all done.

250
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,256
- Enjoy.
- Thank you. Sure.

251
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,509
- Did you check it?
- Yes.

252
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,886
That gallery

253
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,722
is Kim Joon's slush fund warehouse.

254
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,682
Just as you said,

255
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,477
there are dozens of pieces
that went abroad recently.

256
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,980
- Where's the money flowing?
- I asked the locals for a favor.

257
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,482
They'll reach out soon.

258
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,650
- Great job.
- Yes.

259
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,325
I almost forgot.
What about the person who sent the photo?

260
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,285
Was it him?

261
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,953
Well...

262
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,581
I'm looking into it,

263
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,125
but besides that...

264
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,921
Here.

265
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,311
He can harass me all he wants.

266
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,897
If he wants to see me in pain,
I'll gladly suffer.

267
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,607
But not my family.

268
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,860
That person also lost his dad.

269
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,195
I lost...

270
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,531
my child.

271
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,951
Honey?

272
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,122
Hey.

273
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,501
- Are you just getting home?
- Yes.

274
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,837
You were reading.

275
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,964
Yes.

276
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,507
I can't seem to focus.

277
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,801
- Take a shower.
- Okay.

278
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,513
I met Hansang today.

279
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,891
You did?

280
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,561
Yes, he wanted me to say hello.

281
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,981
He said he saw you the other day.

282
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,733
Why didn't he say hi to me?

283
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,489
You were with some other man,

284
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,158
so he couldn't say hello.

285
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,830
- Who was it?
- What?

286
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,714
The person I gave the diary to.

287
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,762
The victim from the fire?

288
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,481
Hmm.

289
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,609
But why do you keep meeting him?

290
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,572
If people see you with him,

291
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,992
they'll start to talk
and it'll bring nothing but trouble.

292
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,374
Please don't...

293
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,710
meet him again.

294
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,587
Okay?

295
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,861
YANGPYEONG CABIN FIRE INCIDENT

296
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,244
FIRE SURVIVOR

297
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,099
Hello, I'm Director Kim Joon
of the Junseong Welfare Foundation.

298
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,105
Well, I know

299
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,108
that you're all going through
a very tough time.

300
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:12,028
I want to thank all the patients
and their families for attending

301
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,446
this meaningful event.

302
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,074
I, Kim Joon, will support
the future leaders

303
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,327
of this country to become great talents
with their strong hearts.

304
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,914
I will be with you every step of the way.

305
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,626
Next, we will have
the transfer of funds ceremony.

306
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,587
Director, please step forward.

307
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,796
Let's give them a hand.

308
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,096
JUNSEONG WELFARE FOUNDATION
CHILDREN'S HEART DISEASE

309
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,098
Soohyun!

310
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,226
The young patients
have prepared homemade cookies

311
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,687
for the hospital director.

312
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,439
Let's give them a round of applause.

313
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,567
- Goodness.
- Have these cookies!

314
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,360
- It's a gift.
- Wow!

315
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,620
Wow, I really wanted to try this place.

316
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,788
What can I do without you?

317
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,170
It's so good!

318
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,921
It's crunchy and moist!

319
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,590
I bought a lot.

320
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,550
Share it with the hospital staff.

321
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,262
Okay, the scorched rice here is so good.

322
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,348
It's best when eaten together.

323
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,894
That's right. Seonyul dropped out
of school because of his mom.

324
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,481
He even started a petition
after his mom's accident.

325
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,857
What was he like?

326
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,776
I bet he was popular.

327
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,779
It's almost refreshing
to see someone that handsome.

328
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,448
He had a great personality too.
He took care of others.

329
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,493
God gave him everything but a good heart.

330
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,080
But why are you so curious about Seonyul?

331
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,332
You should ask him yourself
if you're close.

332
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,210
It'd be uncomfortable

333
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,171
to ask him about this directly.

334
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,217
I almost forgot. About Kim Eunmin.

335
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,386
Did you look into

336
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,845
- her hospital bills?
- Yes.

337
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,932
They're being paid by
the Junseong Welfare Foundation.

338
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,226
She was moved to a VIP ward
a few days ago.

339
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,353
The Junseong Welfare Foundation?

340
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,655
As you said, she was moved to a VIP ward.

341
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,116
Good job.

342
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,494
We should be considerate.

343
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:09,122
Eunmin, you have to wake up
for Seonyul's sake.

344
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,756
Guys!

345
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,717
Sujin!

346
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,553
- Have you been well?
- Yes!

347
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,430
- What did I bring?
- We don't know!

348
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,225
One, two, three!

349
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,643
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

350
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,230
- Who wants it?
- Me!

351
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,898
Here. Minju, first.

352
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,359
- There! You're all so cute!
- Thank you!

353
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,653
- Who wants one?
- Me!

354
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,990
- Here you go.
- Can adults get one too?

355
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,994
Of course. Which one do you want?

356
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,370
If I get to choose,

357
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,163
how about the heart?

358
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,291
Ta-da.

359
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,001
I had one prepared.

360
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,923
Taeho...

361
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,551
How can you not cross that?

362
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,011
The car was coming.

363
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,972
Thanks for walking me.

364
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,641
- Be careful, Sujin.
- Okay, bye.

365
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,813
Yes!

366
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,151
This Saturday.

367
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,903
What shall we eat?

368
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,034
Mom!

369
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,621
- What brings you here?
- I brought some underwear for you.

370
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,749
You never come home.
This is the only way I can see you.

371
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,543
- Who was that?
- What?

372
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,587
Oh.

373
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,715
A patient's guardian.

374
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,718
Mom, I just got a call.

375
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,929
- I'm going. Okay.
- Here, take this.

376
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,347
- Go ahead.
- Bye.

377
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,765
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

378
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,353
A patient's guardian?

379
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,121
Come here.

380
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,352
Hyegeum.

381
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,357
- Yes?
- Take Heejae...

382
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,860
and leave for the time being.

383
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,241
If you become a weed in my way,

384
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,702
I'll pull you out.

385
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,876
Do you understand?

386
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,680
Hankook University Hospital
held

387
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,850
a ceremony for
the Children's Heart Disease Association.

388
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,770
Kim Joon of the Hankuk United Party aided

389
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,189
the Junseong Welfare Foundation
in supporting funding.

390
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,666
The kid working for Kim Joon
is the same kid Soohyun's looking for?

391
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,252
Breaking news.
Jahyeon Party candidate, Min Hyeongseok,

392
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,379
is holding a press conference at his home.

393
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,882
He has announced that he will resign
and leave the party.

394
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,927
We'll connect to the reporter
at the scene for details.

395
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,304
You still can't reach Min Hyeongseok?

396
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,349
Hey, what happened?

397
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,226
Min Hyeongseok told WBN,

398
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,144
and they got the exclusive.

399
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,229
- Exclusive?
- Yes.

400
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,023
Why would WBN get that exclusive?

401
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,901
I'm going to try to get an interview
with the party leader.

402
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,571
This is the edited opening remark.

403
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,281
What should we do?

404
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,325
The president is asking for you.

405
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,830
Get it together!

406
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,208
Who cares if he holds
an emergency press conference?

407
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,836
Director Kang, our neighbors
are having a party.

408
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,046
Are you all going to hold a funeral?

409
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,383
I apologize, we'll do it properly

410
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,718
for next week's news guest.

411
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,554
Who?

412
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,682
Kim Joon.

413
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,769
He won't enter a broadcasting station
before the presidential election.

414
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,604
How can you?

415
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,856
I have to try.

416
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,567
I'll try.

417
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,681
Don't you feel guilty at all?

418
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,184
- Do you regret your revenge?
- No.

419
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,563
I don't regret it.

420
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,824
A parent who loses a child

421
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,204
still hurts...

422
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,123
no matter how much time passes.

423
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,083
Still...

424
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,210
I think it's time

425
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,005
to let everything go and forget.

426
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,216
I wasn't able to protect

427
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,052
this man beside me or my family.

428
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,561
I will become a proud mother
to protect the rest of my family.

429
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,188
Not my family.

430
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,814
I won't allow him

431
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,567
to mess with my family

432
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,152
over his anger towards me.

433
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,325
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

434
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,620
- ♪ Happy birthday, dear Seonyul! ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday, dear Seonyul! ♪

435
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,791
- ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

436
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,584
Make a wish!

437
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,340
Seonyul!

438
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,845
Son, you're first again?

439
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,891
Wow. Who do you take after?

440
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,019
- I don't believe it.
- I knew it.

441
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,604
- Did I do well?
- I'm so proud.

442
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,981
Hey, stop studying now.

443
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,649
Just have fun.

444
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,402
Then you shouldn't have...

445
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,488
messed with my family.

446
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
My wife and I

447
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,537
have endured a hard time together.

448
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,873
It has made us stronger. And...

449
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,334
our feelings for one another

450
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,337
have strengthened.

451
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,756
That will never change.

452
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:29,098
To all the parents out there
who have been through the same pain,

453
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,059
we hope...

454
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,065
Are you staying at home today?

455
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,986
Yes, Mom and Yuri
are coming over later.

456
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,195
Okay.

457
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,614
Have fun.

458
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,911
How can I help you?

459
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,288
Hello.

460
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,622
Hello.

461
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,833
By chance, did you park your car here

462
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,711
- about two weeks ago?
- Yes, this is our house.

463
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,630
Yes, I was in
a minor collision then.

464
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,883
It was so unfair for me.

465
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,761
Could you check to see
if you have that filmed?

466
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,721
Well...

467
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,264
- On my dash cam?
- Yes.

468
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,099
Please, if you don't mind!

469
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,980
I was staying at my mom's then.

470
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,691
- It won't be in my car.
- Okay.

471
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,696
Just a moment.

472
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,168
Check it for him.

473
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,962
- Thank you.
- I'll be home later.

474
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,048
See you tonight.

475
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,138
Thank you.

476
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,310
Can you tell me the day and time?

477
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,575
I'll look for it and call you.

478
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,244
Okay, thank you.

479
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,431
11:00 P.M.

480
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,679
Hello?

481
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,515
I checked the footage,

482
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,185
and there's nothing on here.

483
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,229
Okay, thank you.

484
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,397
Bye.

485
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,733
She checked it.

486
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,195
But...

487
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,238
why did you want her to check that?

488
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,866
There's something there

489
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,994
that she needs to see.

490
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,300
To be honest...

491
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,680
The day I saw you at Mom's house,

492
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,016
I was very emotional.

493
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,560
I kind of went off on Suho.

494
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,812
It must've been that night.

495
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,912
Hey, Yuri.

496
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,039
Soohyun, I have big news!

497
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,334
A publisher called me
about releasing your book.

498
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,130
They still think I'm your manager.

499
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,050
I see...

500
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,970
Why am I so happy?

501
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,097
It feels like we're back in the old days.

502
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,016
Soohyun, how about writing again?

503
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,812
- I'm not qualified for that.
- Why would you say that?

504
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,730
So many people love your books.

505
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,068
Do you know which moment I miss the most?

506
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,862
It's when you stood on a platform by day,

507
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,531
and wrote at night.

508
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,370
Back when you shined the brightest.

509
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,291
What's wrong with you?

510
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,008
Yuri?

511
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,093
- Let's talk later!
- Okay.

512
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,512
Are you okay?

513
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,431
Goodness!

514
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,725
- What's wrong?
- Should we call 911?

515
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,892
We should.

516
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,770
He suddenly started shaking
and just passed out.

517
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,772
- What do we do?
- Just a moment.

518
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,898
What do we do?

519
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,364
Shall I call 911?

520
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,951
Do you need help?

521
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,376
Heejae!

522
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,393
Hold on.

523
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,342
We took that
on our first overseas trip with Heejae.

524
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,340
Soohyun.

525
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,027
It wasn't you, was it?

526
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,405
The woman in the photo.

527
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,717
Forgive me.

528
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,180
I lied.

529
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,516
The woman in the photo

530
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,643
isn't me.

531
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,817
Get up.

532
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,237
Right now.

533
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,418
Why did you do it?

534
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,088
On that day,

535
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,759
you weren't even in the country,
so why did you lie?

536
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,933
To protect...

537
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,938
Heejae.

538
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,608
From who?

539
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,114
I can't tell you anymore.

540
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
Kim Joon.

541
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,206
Is this because of him?

542
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,878
I saw him go into your house.

543
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,299
What's your relationship with him?

544
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,179
I know about your relationship
with Kim Joon very well.

545
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,225
I know you're helping him
launder money here.

546
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,980
I didn't come here to question you.

547
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,356
However,

548
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,191
it's time you get out of this now.

549
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,943
How?

550
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,487
I've been tracking him for a long time.

551
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,907
I know his misdeeds better than anyone.

552
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,202
Someone like him
can never become the president.

553
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,704
We must...

554
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,915
stop him together.

555
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,667
I can't do it.

556
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,378
Hyegeum.

557
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,590
You've been digging, so you should know.

558
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,133
He's a dangerous man.

559
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,178
I know that.

560
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,804
I know that very well.

561
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,349
But think about it.

562
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,769
Will someone like Kim Joon

563
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,480
really go easy on his own son?

564
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,779
To become the president,

565
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,114
he'll try to get rid of you
and Heejae first.

566
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,909
Next, he'll take Heejae as a hostage

567
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,954
and place the blame on you

568
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,747
for all of his illegal activities.

569
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,292
When that time comes,

570
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,629
you won't be able to protect Heejae.

571
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,382
Your husband

572
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,425
said he'd protect us.

573
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,224
So you made a deal with him.

574
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,144
You promised to repay me one day.

575
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,274
Is this how you're repaying me?

576
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,322
He said he couldn't let

577
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,491
that one mistake ruin you.

578
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,126
Even if he has to become the bad guy here,

579
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,005
he said it would protect you.

580
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,596
That woman...

581
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,601
He said you mustn't find out who she is.

582
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:34,948
At 6:30 p.m. you have a dinner party
with the other party leaders.

583
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,617
For the business association conference
before the dinner,

584
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,371
I gave them a tentative departure time
considering your travel time.

585
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,456
All right.

586
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,046
Also, you were invited as a guest

587
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,589
on Kang Suho's news.

588
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,926
Well...

589
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,430
I guess he wants to call me in
to stab me in the back.

590
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,976
Shall I go armed too?

591
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,940
Come in.

592
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,155
Director, Kim Joon said
he'll make the appearance.

593
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,533
Okay.

594
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,244
- Let's prepare well.
- Okay.

595
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,539
I almost forgot this.
Mr. Yoon said you asked for it.

596
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,500
Thanks.

597
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,602
GWON MINHYUK

598
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,398
LEE HANSANG

599
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,488
- Hey.
- Your gut feeling was right.

600
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,991
- I just checked too. It wasn't him.
- But did you know who

601
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,494
- Gwon Seonyul was?
- What? Who is he?

602
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,045
He's Gwon Jiwoong's son.

603
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,748
Why you little skank!

604
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:53,795
Hey! Where did you put my money?

605
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,174
You never gave me money!

606
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,217
- Goodness!
- Why are you bitching at me?

607
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,927
Bitching? You wench!

608
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,889
All the money
that bastard gave you was mine!

609
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,433
Give it back!

610
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,519
- Sir, wait inside.
- What?

611
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,855
I'll take care of this and be right there.

612
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:16,610
Goodness! Are you trying to seduce him
when I'm standing right here?

613
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,654
You bastard! I'm going to kill you!

614
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,781
- Goodness! That hurts!
- Hey!

615
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,700
This wench is killing me!

616
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,912
I can't live with that man anymore!

617
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,125
- They look alike.
- What?

618
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,348
That woman...

619
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,516
He said you mustn't find out who she is.

620
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:01,506
He was betrayed
by the two people he loved.

621
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,933
Hey, Seonyul. I'm off.

622
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,394
Make sure
to turn the lights off.

623
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,188
It was so unfair for me.

624
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,983
Could you check to see
if you have that filmed?

625
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,818
- On my dash cam?
- Yes.

626
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,445
Please, if you don't mind!

627
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,054
Hey, Mom.

628
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,932
I'm about to leave.

629
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,853
Okay.

630
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,106
This is the same product.

631
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,069
I think you'll be more satisfied
with this.

632
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,695
Yes.

633
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,865
Help put it on.

634
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,784
- I'll help you.
- Wait over there.

635
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,004
Soohyun's crying.

636
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,593
You said you'd live a good life.
You promised it in front of people.

637
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,389
The woman next door?

638
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,976
You know that was wrong.

639
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,729
What were you thinking?

640
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,689
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

641
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,316
Your mother's here.

642
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,692
She's early.

643
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:18,995
Yuri.

644
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,873
It's your mama.

645
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,628
You crazy brat!

646
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,714
Hey! Damn it!

647
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:33,134
Come here! Why won't you listen?

648
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,346
Hurry up!

649
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,973
You brat!
This is all your fault!

650
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,683
- I can't live with you!
- Mokryeon.

651
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,435
- You won't kill her like that.
- Die!

652
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,728
Die!

653
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,948
Oh.

654
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,034
You're quite successful.

655
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,577
Leave.

656
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,204
What?

657
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:02,956
Get out.

658
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,374
How rude.

659
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,464
I'm the one that raised you.
How dare you talk to me like that?

660
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,886
I'm going out of my mind

661
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,056
because I'm scared of losing Soohyun.

662
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,933
Just tell her the truth.

663
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,147
Hold on.

664
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,820
Then?

665
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,031
Shall I tell her
you're the woman in the photo?

666
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,075
Is that what you want?

667
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,801
What do you think you're doing?

668
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,985
Then? Shall I tell her
you're the woman in the photo?

669
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,904
Is that what you want?

670
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,333
Then? Shall I tell her
you're the woman in the photo?

671
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,002
Is that what you want?

672
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,898
Then?

673
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,862
Shall I tell her
you're the woman in the photo?

674
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,282
Is that what you want?

675
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,128
Not my family.

676
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,465
My wife and I...

677
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,845
Eun Soohyun.

678
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,848
Watch in pain.

679
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,223
I can't...

680
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,267
forgive you.

681
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,398
You never should've come back to me.

682
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,108
Do you have any idea...

683
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,860
how long I waited for this moment?

684
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,572
Kim Joon will make a guest appearance
on my segment.

685
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,240
That will be the day we do it.

686
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,619
Your mom is with me.

687
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,871
If anyone wants to shake me,
go ahead.

688
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,706
If you die here,

689
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,708
no one could find you.
