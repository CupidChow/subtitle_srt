00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,618
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,328
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,510
She's back after eight years,
introducing Eun Soohyun.

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,185
Let's give her a round of applause.

6
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,318
"LOVE IN TIME"
AUTHOR EUN SOOHYUN

7
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,240
WRITER EUN SOOHYUN'S "LOVE IN TIME"
MEET THE AUTHOR AFTER SECOND RELEASE

8
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,078
This is Han Yuri,
Eun Soohyun's old manager.

9
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,662
Yes.

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,792
What have you prepared so far?
If there's anything else, I'll prepare it.

11
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,127
I can contact the media for you.

12
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,381
Everything has a right time.

13
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,009
As for me, that time is now.

14
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,178
What can you tell us
about your new book?

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,721
My new book

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,141
will be written based on true events.

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,687
It's the hidden truth
about my son's accident.

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,983
There was another culprit
to my son's accident that day.

19
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,195
Wait, who is that person?

20
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,780
Presidential candidate...

21
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,326
Kim Joon.

22
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,579
Do you have definitive proof?

23
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,043
That concludes the event.

24
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:32,777
The police have called
to get your statement.

25
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,988
They're going to start the investigation.

26
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,670
BOONJEONG POLICE STATION

27
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,754
EPISODE 14

28
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,228
We will start questioning the complainant.

29
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,148
Eun Soohyun, is this the original file?

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,484
Why did you file
a complaint against Kim Joon?

31
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,195
Someone's coming.

32
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,283
How's the current
investigation going?

33
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,744
- It's still ongoing.
- Check the facts for us.

34
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,662
We'll announce the results
when we have it.

35
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,207
- Answer us briefly.
- Please wait.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,209
Discuss some of the progress with us.

37
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,964
Eun Soohyun is being questioned
as the complainant.

38
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,299
Shouldn't we report this too?

39
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,136
Can you handle the consequences
if Kim Joon becomes president?

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,639
- Still...
- Don't act recklessly.

41
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,728
He wanted us to have a sense of mission.

42
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,147
It must be true that
he's joining Kim Joon's camp.

43
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,528
Dear citizens,

44
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,991
there have been groundless rumors
circulating around me recently.

45
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,536
The deep-rooted tree

46
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,914
is not swayed by the wind.

47
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:13,378
I will not lose against slander and lies.

48
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,840
I will protect the people to the end.

49
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,263
Kim Joon!

50
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,933
Kim Joon!

51
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,643
- Kim Joon!
- Congressman.

52
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,104
I got a call from the chief.

53
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,273
You have to go for a questioning.

54
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,025
Kim Joon!

55
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,030
Thank you so much.

56
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,866
- Thank you!
- Number one! Kim Joon!

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,910
- Thank you for your support.
- Kim Joon!

58
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,005
You've had such a difficult time.
You just have to sign it now.

59
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,299
Okay, thank you.

60
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,950
GWON SEONYUL

61
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,079
KIM JOON, SUSPECTED
OF KILLING EUN SOOHYUN'S SON

62
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,414
YOU'RE A GOOD MOM. GOOD LUCK!

63
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,999
WE SUPPORT YOUR COURAGE, EUN SOOHYUN!

64
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,021
Thank you.

65
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,328
What were you doing
when this all happened?

66
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,581
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,250
I took measures with
the social and political department.

68
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,545
I didn't think she'd use
her new book event to attack you.

69
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,226
What did the party say?

70
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,062
A few of the other congressmen
have been acting strange.

71
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,146
I'm looking into it.

72
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,483
Who is it?

73
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,692
But all of them...

74
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,239
were Gwon Seonyul's targets from before.

75
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,203
First, we'll countersue Eun Soohyun
for defamation

76
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,665
- and refuse to attend the questioning.
- That's why you're incapable.

77
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,046
Tell them...

78
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,798
I'll attend.

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,301
Best way to fight

80
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,805
is to win it without fighting.

81
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,643
We can take over the castle
without having to attack directly.

82
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,896
Can't we?

83
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,570
Open Gwon Jiwoong's file.

84
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,281
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,298
GWON JIWOONG'S FILE

86
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,049
KANG GUNWOO'S ACCIDENT EVIDENCE

87
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,384
BUYEONGDONG FILE

88
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,972
GWON JIWOONG WIRETAP

89
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,378
How do you feel about the fact
that Eun Soohyun is suing you?

90
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,964
Everyone,

91
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,175
I have a favor to ask.

92
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,178
She's going through a hard time
after losing her son.

93
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,098
If slandering me
will lessen her sadness,

94
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,225
it's fine with me.

95
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,435
Eun Soohyun...

96
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,147
is also a precious citizen I must protect,
is she not?

97
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,734
So I want all of you

98
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,985
to stop slandering her.

99
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,072
Eun Soohyun has accused you
of being an accomplice

100
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,698
in her son's accident.

101
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,953
When it comes to that,

102
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,122
I hope the misunderstanding
can be cleared.

103
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,625
To be honest,

104
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,379
I have received a recording file
from Gwon Jiwoong's family.

105
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,591
I contemplated a lot on
whether to disclose this or not.

106
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,553
I think I should expose the truth,

107
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,513
so I'll let you all hear it.

108
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,392
Apologize.

109
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,478
You ruined my child's life.

110
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,022
So apologize properly!

111
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,483
Look here, lady. That's enough.

112
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,193
I won't be considerate anymore.

113
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,780
Apologize!

114
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,157
- What the hell? Seriously?
- 

115
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,663
Hey, do you know how many businesses
I'm involved in right now?

116
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,791
Do you know how many deals I've lost
because of your kid?

117
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,876
He could've died anywhere else!

118
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,920
Why did he have to get hit by my car?

119
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,553
This is the conversation between the two

120
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,471
right before she killed him.

121
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,057
As you heard,

122
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,893
Gwon Jiwoong was the one that hit her son.

123
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:07,523
Eun Soohyun will reveal the answer
to whether this file is the truth or not.

124
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,901
I drank a lot...

125
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,362
with Gwon Jiwoong that night.

126
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,659
He called me to say he hit a child,
I told him to take him to the hospital.

127
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,579
I said to turn himself in.
He abandoned the child.

128
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,039
- What now?
- I told him...

129
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
- The press is overturned.
...no human

130
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,753
- should ever do such a thing.
The comments too. They all pity him.

131
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,473
Yes, Mr. Park?

132
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,516
The response
from Kim Joon's supporters

133
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,268
towards you isn't great.

134
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,646
They're saying you joined

135
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,690
the opposing party
so you can hurt Kim Joon's image.

136
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,901
It's best to be careful for now.

137
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,236
- You could be at risk.
- No.

138
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,866
I have no intention
of playing into Kim Joon's show.

139
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,951
I will...

140
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,953
go all the way.

141
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,095
- Mom, eat up.
- Okay.

142
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,396
Soohyun.

143
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,399
I'm going to my friend's house

144
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,110
in the countryside for a while.

145
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,030
- Mom.
- I want to take time off

146
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,198
and enjoy fresh air.

147
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,991
Let me do that.

148
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,591
The weather's nice.

149
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,932
Mom, I'll bring you back home.

150
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,518
For you...

151
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,228
and for Gunwoo,

152
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,772
I have something to do.

153
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,203
Come in.

154
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,877
Are you living here?

155
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,879
Yes.

156
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,714
Take a seat.

157
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,090
- Okay.
- I'll bring some tea.

158
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,557
Did Soohyun...

159
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,268
tell you about her mom?

160
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,813
No.

161
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,524
Your mother-in-law...

162
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,817
has dementia.

163
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,905
I went by the restaurant to check

164
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,866
and the place was up for rent.

165
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,369
They're not home either.

166
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,622
Then again,

167
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,458
how could she stay mentally stable?

168
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,752
I only lost my grandson,

169
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,338
and I've been losing my mind.

170
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,344
I went to someone like that,

171
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,597
and I asked her to forgive you.

172
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,016
I begged her.

173
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,355
Suho.

174
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,940
Look at me.

175
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,324
No matter what happens to you and Soohyun,

176
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,869
you can't...

177
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,496
turn a blind eye to your mother-in-law.

178
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,124
That would make you inhumane.

179
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,042
I...

180
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,044
didn't raise you like that.

181
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,091
You should take care of her.

182
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,596
I came here to tell you that.

183
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,015
I should go. Don't see me out.

184
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,129
Now,

185
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,298
what's left for me to do?

186
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,219
When there's no other way,

187
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,846
I have one last choice.

188
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,850
The act of having courage.

189
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,106
In the presidential race,

190
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,984
Kim Joon of the Hankuk United Party
is accused of murder.

191
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,028
The truth has yet to be uncovered.

192
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,155
He attended his questioning,

193
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,033
denied the charges
and released related recordings.

194
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,537
Kim Joon's attorney has not stated
any position after hearing the facts.

195
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,373
He attended the police investigation

196
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,918
and revealed a recording between
Eun Soohyun and Gwon Jiwoong.

197
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,837
According to the recording,
Gwon Jiwoong confessed to the crime

198
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,465
and shows that Eun Soohyun
is aware of the fact.

199
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,218
There will be repercussions
after determining its--

200
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:45,337
I am a mother who unjustly lost
a child to drunk driving.

201
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,174
I stand here
not as a professor or a writer,

202
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,593
but as a mother of my child, Kang Gunwoo.

203
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,266
For my son who died in fear and pain,

204
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,143
I will never

205
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,979
let the truth get covered up.

206
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,543
If you fail,

207
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,670
then I'll step in

208
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,506
and kill Kim Joon for you.

209
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,932
Thank you.

210
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,575
That's right.
Did you see Eun Soohyun protesting?

211
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,827
Her son died,

212
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,537
and her delusions got worse.

213
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,039
I knew she seemed strange.

214
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,291
Some say she's doing it
to sell her book.

215
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,427
Excuse me? Do you know Eun Soohyun?
How much do you know about her?

216
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,054
More than me? Her family?

217
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,015
My sister-in-law
isn't that type of person.

218
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,351
So please don't talk about her like that.

219
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,777
- Yes.
- Excuse me!

220
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,612
What brings you here?

221
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,906
Did you know Eun Soohyun
is protesting on her own?

222
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,492
- Yes, we knew.
- By chance,

223
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,828
can you post it
on the students' bulletin board?

224
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,959
Yes, hello.

225
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,669
Can you post a notice on the site?

226
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,296
Yes, please share it on other sites too.

227
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,065
Mother.

228
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,817
You can't stand being cold.

229
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,530
Then again,

230
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,409
you buried your child in the cold ground.

231
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,037
How could you ever feel warm after that?

232
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,841
I'm leaving.

233
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,677
Take good care of yourself.

234
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,349
Mother.

235
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,729
Thank you.

236
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,132
- I heard you went through trouble.
- It's fine.

237
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,761
I got to ride the media wave
thanks to your wife.

238
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,763
I'm getting more attention.

239
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,349
I should be thanking her.

240
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,726
Congressman.

241
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,437
Just leave her alone.

242
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,314
Didn't you see my interview?

243
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,484
Eun Soohyun is one
of my precious citizens.

244
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,696
My team will go to your camp
to get media coverage.

245
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,949
I'll make sure to get a good one for you.

246
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,367
I'll look forward to it.

247
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,244
Goodbye.

248
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,365
Hey, Seonyul. It's been a while.

249
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,244
- What's going on?
- I wanted to give you one last chance.

250
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,539
Stop fooling the people. It's disgusting.

251
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,877
Seonyul, you keep upsetting me.

252
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,255
You were always so obedient to me.

253
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,717
Who turned you into this monster?

254
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,512
I'm really curious.

255
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,642
Can someone who killed another person
become the president?

256
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,064
Contract killing?

257
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,696
Do you want to die?

258
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,283
Haven't you killed enough?

259
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,201
I don't care if I have to kill

260
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,037
a hundred or a thousand people.

261
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,289
I'll kill anyone who gets in my way.

262
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,583
Yes.

263
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,335
Kill me just like

264
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,920
- you did with my mom.
- I'm thinking.

265
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,300
Should I kill just you or Eun Soohyun too?

266
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,390
- Don't mess with her anymore.
- You little punk...

267
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,475
Yes.

268
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,352
Let's die here together.

269
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,937
Hey, Seonyul. It's been a while.

270
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,190
- What's going on?
- I wanted to give you--

271
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,656
Why did you do that...

272
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,366
to Gunwoo?

273
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,867
I know, right?

274
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,122
It would've been nice
if he had just died on impact.

275
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,753
It would've been easier for him.

276
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,964
For me too.

277
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,509
Seonyul.

278
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,387
Do you know how I got this far?

279
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,348
Despite everything,
I'll become the president.

280
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,352
Stop acting up.

281
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,233
No.

282
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,686
- The poor thing.
- I know.

283
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,564
Professor Eun Soohyun
is such a good person.

284
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,941
That's right. We can testify for her.

285
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,153
She's not the person who'd ever lie.

286
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,072
I'd protest with her
if my knees would allow it.

287
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,449
Eun Soohyun is someone

288
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,159
I'll never forget.

289
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,703
She lifted me up when I gave up.

290
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,997
She's a good person.

291
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,751
EUN SOOHYUN

292
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,796
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PROTEST

293
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,307
- Did you hear about Eun Soohyun?
- Yes, let's help.

294
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,434
She's no other than Professor Eun.

295
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,395
I know. She even loaned me
tuition when I was in financial trouble.

296
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,439
- Gotta pay her back.
- I'm going to go see her.

297
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,734
Yes, I understand.
Take down all the stories of her now.

298
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,362
- Send someone to the scene.
- I'll get right on it.

299
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,033
- Now, now. Let's start!
- Leave anonymous comments.

300
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,494
- Delete all the stories about Eun Soohyun.
- Delete these.

301
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,955
- Okay. It's urgent.
- Leave comments on that.

302
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,916
We need to delete them quickly.
Please delete all of them!

303
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,169
- Soohyun failed suicide attempt...
- Does she want attention?

304
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,964
- Who'd believe that?
- She wants to benefit from Joon.

305
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,883
She received money
from the opposing party to harm Kim Joon.

306
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,513
A presidential candidate
attracts annoying people. Poor Kim Joon.

307
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,099
With her son dead,
she must have gone crazy with depression.

308
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,977
I worked here for 15 years.

309
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,853
There was no one like Professor Eun.

310
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,898
She always approached me first
and greeted me so warmly.

311
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,733
She even gave me this scarf.

312
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,194
There are so many people
insulting her online.

313
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,489
It's not true. She's a good person.

314
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,620
Ms. Eun Soohyun?

315
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,497
Good luck.

316
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,541
We're rooting for you.

317
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,544
Good luck.

318
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,339
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

319
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,273
We lost our family...

320
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,358
in an accident too.

321
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,403
We came here to join you.

322
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,378
Thank you.

323
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,589
Let's stand behind her.

324
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,698
- What's all this?
- I'm so sick of this.

325
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,702
It's been years since your kid died!
That's enough, will you?

326
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,371
Why would you come here
and do this?

327
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,667
You punk!

328
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,393
How much longer
will you milk this?

329
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,354
Excuse me! What are you doing?

330
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,814
OVERTHROW KILLER KIM JOON!

331
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,652
What did the congressman do?

332
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,866
Step back!

333
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,286
- Overthrow Kim Joon!
- That's enough! Stop it!

334
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,081
- Overthrow Kim Joon!
- Get rid of it!

335
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,582
How much longer will you do this?

336
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,019
Professor Eun, you had a rough day.
We came for you.

337
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,771
Good luck. You can do this.

338
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,189
We'll cheer for you.

339
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,442
- Good luck.
Ignore the weather, you got this.

340
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,862
Professor!

341
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,071
We're sorry we're late.

342
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,698
We're here to join you.

343
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,074
You can do this.

344
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,327
Good luck!

345
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,460
We're here to support you! Good luck!

346
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,296
We'll always support you.

347
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,175
- We'll always be with you. Good luck!
- Good luck!

348
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,470
- You can do this.
- Good luck.

349
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,804
Good luck!

350
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,890
I was friends with Gunwoo as a kid.

351
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,684
- I brought the kids from school.
- Hello!

352
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,104
- Good luck!
- You can do this!

353
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,789
Professor, thank you for everything.

354
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,333
You can do this.

355
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,009
Cheer up.

356
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,804
Cheer up!

357
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,766

- Good luck!

358
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,851
Cheer up.

359
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,561
JUNSEONG FOUNDATION CONDEMNATION
AND FACT-FINDING COMMITTEE

360
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,682
- With the people...
- Together!

361
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,518
- ...a prepared president...
- Kim Joon!

362
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,980
Kim Joon!

363
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,983
A prepared president,
Presidential candidate Kim Joon!

364
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,151
KIM JOON CAMPAIGN RALLY

365
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,115
Kim Joon!

366
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,706
Kim Joon!

367
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,423
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

368
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,507
Hello.

369
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,976
Kim Joon!

370
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,022
Kim Joon!

371
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,157
We're a minute out.

372
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:40,833
Everyone, the person who can protect
this country!

373
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,377
Who is it?

374
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,754
Kim Joon!

375
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,005
I, Kim Joon,

376
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,510
will turn crisis into opportunities.

377
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,265
I'll make sure all citizens
have the right to safety,

378
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,520
and make Korea

379
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,314
a happy place to live!

380
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,029
Hello, viewers. I'm Kang Suho.

381
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,364
KIM JOON, CONSPIRACY FOR MURDER

382
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,074
Today's first news

383
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,119
will be an exclusive report by ABS.

384
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,791
The leading presidential candidate,
Kim Joon,

385
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,169
has been accused of murder
and crucial video evidence

386
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,922
has been exclusively acquired by ABS.

387
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,384
I will release the video sent by Mr. Gwon.

388
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,219
Let's watch it together.

389
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,724
Hansang, I have a plan.

390
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,019
I'm going to work for Kim Joon.

391
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,271
Kim Joon will never trust me.

392
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,982
He'll only trust my weakness.

393
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,234
So I'll try and use it.

394
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,777
TRUTH BEHIND THE PAPER COMPANY

395
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,571
The moment he puts his guard down,

396
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,322
I'm going to take him down.

397
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,081
Hey, Kang Suho!

398
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,167
People are whispering, you jerk!

399
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,294
Kim Joon's sniper
has become his sycophant!

400
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,437
Let's take down Kim Joon together.

401
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,067
Why did you do that to Gunwoo?

402
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,234
I know, right?

403
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,527
It would've been nice...

404
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,612
TIP-OFF VIDEO

405
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,573
...if he had just died on impact.

406
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,451
It would've been easier for him.
For me too.

407
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,789
Deepfakes are so common these days.

408
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,500
I can just say the rest are manipulated.

409
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,011
Stop the broadcast!

410
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,514
- What do you think you're doing!
- No, sir.

411
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,100
- We have to release this.
- Get out of the way!

412
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,811
Everyone!

413
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,562
You don't believe this, do you?

414
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,814
- We don't believe it!
- No!

415
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,732
It's a deepfake! It's manipulated!

416
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,400
That's right!

417
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,237
They're trying to slander me!
Don't be fooled!

418
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,158
Kim Joon!

419
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:31,129
The tablet you see right now was recovered
on the day of the accident, July 12, 2015,

420
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,631
and belonged to the late Kang Gunwoo.

421
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,053
It recorded the details before
and after the accident.

422
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,055
Let's hear the urgent voices

423
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,641
of the scene together.

424
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,231
The kid saw my face.

425
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,025
- What do I do about this?
- What?

426
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,112
- 
- I'm so close to the Blue House...

427
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,490
Do I have to stop in my tracks
just because I stepped on a little bug?

428
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,576
Or shall we make sure it's dead

429
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,452
- and keep going?
- What? Wait.

430
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,204
Mommy...

431
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,883
Viewers,

432
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,053
I am speaking to you
not as an Anchorman Kang Suho,

433
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,181
but as a citizen
and a father of a child.

434
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,768
A killer of a six-year-old boy,

435
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,314
a destroyer of a peaceful family...

436
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,816
stands before you

437
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,154
claiming to be a president
that serves the people.

438
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,449
But he deceived the people
and tried to be above the law.

439
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,661
He's a criminal
who must be brought to justice.

440
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,413
Please...

441
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,460
...remember the voice...

442
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,173
of Gunwoo who cried out for his mother...

443
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,260
in his last moments

444
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,138
as he laid alone...

445
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,893
on that cold ground.

446
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,372
Let's go.

447
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,921
Everyone!

448
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,631
If that's real,

449
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,675
you have my head!

450
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,304
They're trying to defame me!

451
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,889
Don't be fooled!

452
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,942
Who will be the people's president?

453
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,778
You must choose wisely!

454
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,822
Everyone...

455
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,826
Wait for me!

456
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,722
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

457
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,220
Wow! It's you!

458
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,597
It's my dad!

459
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,765
You're so cool.

460
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,351
You're the best! The best!

461
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,102
You were right.

462
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,855
I respect the decision you made back then.

463
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,359
You were more righteous
than any other journalist.

464
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,790
Everyone! Don't be startled!

465
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,376
All of this is...

466
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,180
What are you doing?

467
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,974
That's not even the original.

468
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,437
- Stop it right now.
- It's the original, Congressman.

469
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,107
- What?
- From now on,

470
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,733
I won't be answering your calls.

471
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,838
Why did you do that to my mom?

472
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,510
- Well...
- If you say it was Kim Joon,

473
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,095
who will believe you?

474
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,224
Kim Joon's finished.

475
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,728
You know I have a lot of evidence.

476
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,607
If I submit the evidence I have...

477
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,736
who do you think
will take the fall for it?

478
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,534
Decide.

479
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,371
Will you sink with Kim Joon

480
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,541
or get off the boat before it's too late?

481
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,713
It would've been nice if he had just
died on impact.

482
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:15,389
Deepfakes are so common these days.
I can just say the rest are manipulated.

483
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,482
Just until a few hours ago,

484
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,485
Eun Soohyun was struggling alone.

485
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,695
Despite terrible weather conditions,

486
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:33,199
more and more people are rallying
around her.

487
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,285
She stood up to a greater power
to uncover the truth.

488
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:41,081
She didn't do it as a professor or author,
but as a mother, and it has greatly moved

489
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,542
the hearts of the people.

490
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,466
You are under arrest for the murder
of Kang Gunwoo and Kim Eunmin.

491
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,929
You have the right to an attorney
and a chance to state your case.

492
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,348
You have the right to remain silent.

493
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,392
You have the right to file an appeal
to the courts.

494
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,228
Let's go.

495
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,688
Get this off of me.

496
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,441
I'm still a presidential candidate.

497
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,407
Let's go.

498
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,219
We did it!

499
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,016
KIM JOON ARRESTED AT CAMPAIGN RALLY
IN BUSAN

500
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,191
We won!

501
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,253
We'll start the news
with last night's ABS's exclusive

502
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,463
which is now called the Kim Joon Gate.

503
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,967
All of the illegal acts of Kim Joon,
former Hankuk United Party's candidate,

504
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,719
are being uncovered one-by-one.

505
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,054
There have been allegations
of illegal profiting

506
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,765
from transferring funds
through a paper company.

507
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,311
This afternoon, Kim Joon will be indicted

508
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,689
on charges of fleeing overseas
with assets and embezzlement.

509
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,609
After signing the MOU
for Baekdudaegan Law Firm,

510
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,569
CEO Hwang Jiseok and Cho Seonghan made

511
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,404
over 200 billion won in slush funds.

512
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,699
A ledger was found with related people
from the political community

513
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,785
- and has been causing a stir.
- When Kim Joon was the mayor of Seoul,

514
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,747
there were human casualties
in the Buyeongdong fire.

515
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,459
Shockingly, it turned out to be a planned
arson for the redevelopment.

516
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,046
Various crimes committed by
Congressman Kim Joon are evident.

517
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,340
This is a very serious situation.

518
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,092
We can't entrust state affairs
to a criminal.

519
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,596
The Hankuk United Party
officially announces

520
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,014
the resignation of Kim Joon.

521
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,146
Case 2024-1427

522
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,441
and a consolidated trial in regards
to Case 2024-1657

523
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,234
will begin now.

524
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,445
Can we have the first witness?

525
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,740
DEFENDANT

526
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,701
My child was very sick.

527
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,038
Kim Joon said he'd save our child,

528
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,751
so my husband did what Kim Joon had asked

529
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,170
and hit Kim Eunmin with his car.

530
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,426
I worked under Kim Joon

531
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,222
for years,
and he assaulted me habitually.

532
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,600
He made me do all types of dirty deeds.

533
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,435
Among them,

534
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,523
he asked me to hire a hitman.

535
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,322
That day,

536
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,368
Kim Joon was near the scene
of Gunwoo's accident.

537
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,953
Right after the accident,

538
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,998
Kim Joon took away the security camera
in front of my house,

539
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,543
my dash cam and even my cell phone.

540
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,713
I can submit my call history...

541
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,133
from that day.

542
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,077
I finally got
to keep the promise

543
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,497
I made that I'll help you.

544
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,626
I'm sorry it took so long.

545
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,098
I'd like to call
on Gwon Seonyul, the complainant

546
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,725
in Kim Eunmin's case, as a witness.

547
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,197
WITNESS

548
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,956
According to the recording
submitted as evidence,

549
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,542
it seems the defendant, Kim Joon,
and your father had made a deal.

550
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,920
Do you know what deal it was?

551
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,505
At the time,

552
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,591
I was in need of a heart transplant.

553
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,136
Kim Joon used my heart transplant

554
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,888
to make a deal with my father.

555
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,892
The heart inside my body...

556
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,186
is proof of that.

557
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,481
Counsel, cross-examine the witness.

558
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,569
There's a witness who saw...

559
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,114
you and Eun Soohyun visiting
each other's home often.

560
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,451
What's your relationship with her?

561
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,328
Objection, Your Honor.

562
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,331
- That has nothing to do with the trial.
- I...

563
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,126
approached Eun Soohyun intentionally.

564
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,632
I wanted to ruin her.

565
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,261
But...

566
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,598
the person who killed my father

567
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,934
had to be a bad person.

568
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,649
She was the first person
who told me to live properly.

569
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,736
She meddled in my life.

570
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,614
She worried about what I ate.

571
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,660
She looked into my wounds.

572
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,623
No one consoled me like that before.

573
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,210
Just as she said,

574
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,631
I won't waste my life anymore.

575
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,803
That's why I came here today.

576
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,223
I hope people who were hurt...

577
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,895
and are in pain...

578
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,483
will gain the strength to rise back up.

579
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,464
I will give the sentence
for Case 2024-1427

580
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,635
and Case 2024-1657
of the consolidated trial.

581
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,387
Considering various evidence

582
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,974
such as video footage at the time
of the incident among the charges filed,

583
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,686
the defendant's guilt regarding
the fleeing of the murder suspect

584
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,689
is acknowledged.

585
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,444
The defendant, after this incident,
has not sincerely apologized

586
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,739
or compensated the victim's families

587
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,241
for over eight years.

588
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,828
Furthermore, the defendant has not shown
any signs of remorse.

589
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,163
Therefore, this court...

590
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,419
sentences Kim Joon...

591
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,755
to life in prison.

592
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,520
I'm sorry, Congressman.

593
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,107
Get ready to appeal.

594
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,452
Mom, does that hurt?

595
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,704
Let me blow on it for you.

596
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,143
It doesn't hurt anymore, does it?

597
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,246
Don't cry, Mom.

598
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,459
I heard you were punished severely.

599
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,714
Yes.

600
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,925
Still...

601
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,886
I didn't get fired.

602
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,724
It was a broadcast accident
and a scoop at once.

603
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,231
Suho.

604
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,192
When Gunwoo

605
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,986
left the front door,

606
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,740
I didn't hear the door open.

607
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,368
The person who didn't shut the gate...

608
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,121
was me.

609
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,582
Heejae, try turning around.

610
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,959
Now, take it slow.

611
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,669
There you go.

612
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,255
Heejae, great job!

613
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,056
Happy!

614
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,975
Where are you going?

615
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,146
What?

616
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,489
Happy, where are you going?

617
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,081
I know why you stopped then.

618
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,001
I do.

619
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,337
Take a look. It's from that day.

620
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,971
There you go.

621
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,724
Heejae, great job!

622
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,894
Do you still have nothing to lose?

623
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,861
There wasn't a single day
when I didn't blame myself.

624
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,990
What if I didn't shut the door?

625
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,701
I felt so guilty.

626
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,414
Every night was painful.
I wanted to die.

627
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,503
It's not...

628
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,965
your fault.

629
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,513
All that time...

630
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,600
I bet it was so hard for you too.

631
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,895
It's time for you...

632
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,648
to find peace too.

633
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,319
Soohyun, for as long as I have lived,

634
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,614
I thought I would have to protect you...

635
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,119
and my son at any moment.

636
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,330
But I couldn't do that.

637
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,624
I always felt sorry.

638
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,002
But...

639
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,339
I was unaware.

640
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,510
You're a much stronger person

641
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,971
than I could ever be.

642
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,227
That you shine on your own.

643
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,608
I'm sorry.

644
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,403
Also, thank you.

645
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,643
I heard you're appealing.

646
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,228
Of course.

647
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,817
Something unfair has happened to me.
Shouldn't I go by the law?

648
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,903
Sure.

649
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,572
Do it by the law this time

650
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,657
and get punished.

651
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,742
Tell me.

652
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,787
Do you feel like a hero now?

653
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,666
Seonyul, just because you got rid of me

654
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,460
doesn't mean the world will change.

655
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,381
I know that.

656
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,008
But this world

657
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,261
isn't just filled with people like you.

658
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,182
There are good people out there.

659
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,393
It'll get better.

660
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,145
Come on.

661
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,689
Do you think I'll end here?

662
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,734
No.

663
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,320
Far from it.

664
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,371
A never-ending trial
will be waiting for you.

665
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,707
We're just getting started.

666
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,377
This is your end.

667
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,461
Where are we?

668
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,096
It's the Wishing Tree.

669
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,724
If you make a wish here,

670
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,185
it'll come true.

671
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,773
What's your wish?

672
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,238
I don't have one.

673
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,828
Then think of one.

674
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,917
Let's not

675
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,336
live like a bare tree anymore.

676
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,795
Let's sprout and live.

677
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,591
Don't stay in dying things.

678
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,100
Is this a farewell?

679
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,899
I hope you will be warm...

680
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,485
to yourself

681
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,154
with the time you have left.

682
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,990
Then one day,

683
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,159
you'll get a call...

684
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,746
that everything...

685
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,999
is okay now.

686
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,968
You too.

687
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,651
SIX YEARS LATER

688
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,680
Mother.

689
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,809
You're so beautiful today.

690
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,563
Aren't you cold?

691
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,653
My sweet son-in-law.

692
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,619
My mom isn't sick.

693
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:27,540
Maybe she just went back in time
to when she was happy.

694
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,589
Wait, Director!

695
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,716
We have to do this.

696
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,053
We barely got the proof
from undercover coverage and we can't?

697
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,930
Did I tell you not to do it?
It was the boss.

698
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,183
This is media suppression!

699
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,976
"We'll reject

700
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,188
"any interference or pressure,

701
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,817
"internal or external,
from individuals or groups..."

702
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,861
...including power
and financial influences...

703
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,197
"...that threaten the freedom of press."

704
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,744
Dang, you're so loud.

705
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,246
Get back to work.

706
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,334
- Do you have to release that?
- Yes.

707
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,585
It's justice.

708
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,715
Do it then.

709
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,468
But take responsibility.

710
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,970
No, I'll take responsibility.

711
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,972
Don't be scared and do it.

712
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,266
I love you, sir!

713
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,768
I love you!

714
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,562
I respect you! I love you!

715
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,777
Congratulations.

716
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,365
You opened an exhibit with your skills
of shooting a gun.

717
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,702
- Goodness, you're amazing.
- Thank you.

718
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,080
- The flowers are beautiful.
- Really?

719
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,748
I think you're more beautiful.

720
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,543
Stop it.

721
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,753
I'll buy you a meal.

722
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,339
Let's eat what you want.

723
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,757
I want Korean beef!

724
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,261
I'll be right back
after I put these in a vase.

725
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,345
Okay.

726
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,893
Thanks for being so nice to her, Mom.

727
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,150
I want do better my second time around.

728
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,446
Coffee's here.

729
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,364
Have some coffee.

730
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:32,373
Take it easy.
You haven't slept in three days.

731
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,792
This is insane.

732
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,419
We launch next month.

733
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,963
Be honest. Did you like being a CEO
of the editorial shop?

734
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,467
Mmm, nope.

735
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,261
I like working my own brand a lot better.

736
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,975
We're all living our own lives.

737
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,438
As for me, I have a child again.

738
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:56,856
Mom!

739
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,234
Mom!

740
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,615
Mom!

741
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,701
My sweet babies.

742
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,637
ORPHANAGE

743
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,059
Wow, there are
so many good things here!

744
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,270
Wooju, it's your birthday today.
Eat as much as you want.

745
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,481
Can I really eat all of this?

746
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,233
Of course.

747
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,949
Thank you for the meal!

748
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,743
Wow!

749
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,247
It's not just chicken. It's grilled.

750
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,541
- It tastes better.
- Really?

751
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:57,625
Yes!

752
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,711
It's so good with the scorched rice.

753
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,131
Also, the lights here are so shiny.

754
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,341
It's so pretty!

755
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,677
Yes, you're right.

756
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,399
How pretty.

757
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,944
As for the last person,

758
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:54,075
the child who lived in all things dying.

759
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,802
Whoa!

760
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,389
What's going on?

761
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,184
One, two, three, four, five,

762
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,312
six, seven, eight.

763
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,817
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

764
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,572
What a relief.

765
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,212
Are you feeling better?

766
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,674
- Please take care of him.
- Okay, thank you.

767
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,282
Seonyul, hurry up!

768
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,160
- You're late.
- Okay.

769
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:35,259
We're late. Let's go.
You're handsome. I'll forgive you.

Eun Soohyun!

775
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,289
It seems time has no effect on you.

776
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,416
- You're still so beautiful.
- Thanks.

It's Hyeonjeong.

778
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,089
Thank you.

779
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,849
I'm okay now.

780
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:16,378
In the middle of life's journey,
I got lost and wandered.

781
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,132
No matter how much time passes,

782
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,720
losing someone precious to you
will always be lonesome.

783
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,488
But I will try to keep going.

784
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,577
If I keep going,

785
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,873
one day the pain will lessen.

786
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:58,879
I hope all those grieving find comfort.

787
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:04,260
I hope the world will be more friendly
to those in pain.

788
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:09,640
