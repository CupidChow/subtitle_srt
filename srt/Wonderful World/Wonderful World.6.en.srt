00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,660
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,370
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,047
EMERGENCY CENTER

5
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,982
Over here!

6
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,443
This way!

7
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,112
There.

8
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,239
Sir?

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,699
- Doctor!
- Yes?

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,246
He has a 7 cm laceration
in his left flank.

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,956
He could have a spleen injury here.

12
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,506
How did this happen?

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,342
He fell from the third floor
and got stabbed with a metal.

14
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,304
Let's take a CT first. We'll operate
if his spleen injury's severe.

15
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,597
We're taking him to CT.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,099
- Start an IV.
- Okay.

17
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,892
Sir?

18
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,107
Will you sign in first?

19
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,901
Write the patient's personal information.
Are you family?

20
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,740
Yes.

21
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,098
You?

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,893
What are you doing here?

23
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,117
Code blue! Code blue!

24
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,070
You have to leave!

25
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,366
Out of the way.

26
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,245
What are you doing? Move!

27
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,338
No! Let go of me!

28
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,466
- Let go of me!
- Charged to 150.

29
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,801
Apologize!

30
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,261
What the hell? Seriously?

31
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,595
Please, apologize.

32
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,223
- Please...
- He could've died anywhere else!

33
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,935
Clear!

34
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,062
One, two, clear!

35
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,030
One more time.

36
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,949
- Charge it to 200.
- Yes, sir. Charging.

37
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,033
200 volts.

38
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,995
One, two, clear.

39
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,798
- Get an ultrasound.
- Yes, Doctor!

40
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,968
Just once more!

41
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,303
Just once!

42
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,391
One, two, clear.

43
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,147
The patient has achieved ROSC.

44
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,857
Check her vitals.

45
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,151
- Take a brain CT.
- Yes, Doctor.

46
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,343
EPISODE 6

47
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,862
-

48
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,408
Hey...

49
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,583
I don't want to see...

50
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,877
anyone die.

51
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,673
What are you doing here?

52
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,806
What about you?

53
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,975
I was looking for someone.

54
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,852
Their family?

55
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,870
Your clothes.

56
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,747
What's all this blood?

57
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,459
Don't be so nosy.

58
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,671
Do you think you mean something to me...

59
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,966
just because you gave me that diary?

60
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,217
Soohyun?

61
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,513
How's the patient?

62
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,682
She's clear of any immediate danger.

63
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,934
But we'll have to keep an eye on her.

64
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,938
Is there no hope of her waking up?

65
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,523
Probably not.

66
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,984
She's been like this for a long time
with brain damage.

67
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,111
Still,

68
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,154
sometimes miracles happen.

69
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,367
By chance,

70
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,786
does she have other family?

71
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,208
She has a son.

72
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,796
Son.

73
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:55,386
If so,
did her son send that photo?

74
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,724
The surgery went well.

75
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,393
However, he lost a lot of blood.

76
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,186
We'll have to keep an eye on him.

77
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,982
We'll watch and move him to general ward
once he wakes up from anesthesia.

78
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,567
Okay, I understand.

79
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,110
- Thank you.
- Sure.

80
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,527
Hey, Gwon Seonyul!

81
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,532
Hey!

82
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,910
I told you to be careful!

83
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,954
You can't run like this.
Think about your heart!

84
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,874
- Seriously.
- You should be careful.

85
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,125
You're out of breath right now.

86
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,589
If not for you, there's no reason
for my heart to fail.

87
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,267
How is he?

88
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,061
The surgery went well.

89
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,730
He's not up yet.
They need to watch him for a few days.

90
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,650
I still don't understand.

91
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,152
Why would you look for someone
who means nothing to you?

92
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,198
I'll go to the hospital
for the time being.

93
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,658
Don't worry about it.

94
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,910
Forget it.

95
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,455
Just listen to me.
You were shocked yesterday.

96
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,625
Hey.

97
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,670
When we were admitted
for our weak hearts together,

98
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,255
I was really scared back then.

99
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,383
I wouldn't have been able to endure it
without you.

100
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,968
So listen to me

101
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,637
because I would do anything for you!

102
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,805
Okay?

103
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,227
You used to complain and cry
about how much it hurt.

104
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,813
When did you grow up?

105
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,190
Did you just realize that now?

106
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,486
I met that woman...

107
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,697
at the hospital yesterday.

108
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,867
Aren't you curious?

109
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,661
What expression will she make

110
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,122
when she meets his son?

111
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,055
Why did he put
the address on the picture?

112
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,850
Why?

113
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,526
A WOMAN IN CRITICAL CONDITION
AFTER BEING HIT BY A TRUCK JAYWALKING

114
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,366
A WOMAN WAS HIT BY A TRUCK AFTER
JAYWALKING AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL

115
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,370
I don't think it's an accident,
but a planned crime.

116
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,461
Not an accident...

117
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,673
but a planned crime?

118
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,015
SHARP CURVE AHEAD

119
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,978
There's a sharp curve
and a crosswalk right after.

120
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,731
Everyone slows down,
so there aren't many accidents.

121
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,827
SEHYUN-DONG HILL

122
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,335
But the location of the crosswalk
and the bus station is ambiguous there,

123
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,420
so a lot of people jaywalk.

124
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,506
- Hey, hurry up!
- Hurry.

125
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,008
- Hurry!
- Run!

126
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,095
Hey! Hurry up!

127
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,269
30
SPEED LIMIT

128
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,091
Yes, hello?

129
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,887
Yes.

130
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,640
I'd like to read the verdict on a case.

131
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,897
Where has she been all day?

132
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,497
Mother.

133
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,049
Come in.

134
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,565
I'm so sorry, Mother.

135
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,074
I won't say

136
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,034
it was a mistake.

137
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,787
But I swear...

138
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,834
...it was just once.

139
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,338
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

140
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,682
You should've resisted.

141
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,226
After Gunwoo died,

142
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,687
Soohyun was in that state.

143
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,732
You should've gotten your act together.

144
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,406
I lost my child too.

145
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,159
But, Mother...

146
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,079
I couldn't be as sad as I wanted to.

147
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,123
I was afraid...

148
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,584
to lose Soohyun too.

149
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,337
I couldn't even cry aloud.

150
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,631
I should've done it.

151
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,593
I should've killed him.

152
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,765
I should've gone to prison instead of her.

153
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,391
I can't get it out of my head.

154
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,853
I regret it and blame myself.

155
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,606
I drowned myself in alcohol every day.

156
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,025
When I finally came to my senses...

157
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,491
there was no one left in front of me.

158
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,743
Soohyun...

159
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,914
and Gunwoo were no longer
in that empty house.

160
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,962
It was so cold and lonely.

161
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,514
I know I shouldn't have done it.

162
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,519
I must've been crazy, Mother.

163
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,232
I'm very sorry.

164
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
I'm sorry.

165
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,966
Hmm.

166
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,099
Yuri.

167
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,353
Hey, sis!

168
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
Hey, sis!

169
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
You came!

170
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,535
What brings you here?

171
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,996
Did you come to see me?

172
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,378
I haven't been here in so long.

173
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,633
You always

174
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,052
stood right over there.

175
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,514
When Mom hit me

176
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,642
and I ran away,

177
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,560
or sat alone

178
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,563
because I didn't have any friends,

179
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,816
you stood over there,

180
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,611
and you grabbed my hands like this.

181
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,948
Seriously, why were you so good to me?

182
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,866
Did you pity me?

183
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,661
Because you were pretty.

184
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,749
Whatever. My birth mother
treated me like baggage.

185
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,127
To me,

186
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,797
you were like a gift.

187
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,299
That will continue

188
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,343
to be the case.

189
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,017
I know that you and Mom

190
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,145
are always upset because of me.

191
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,440
You saw me in that state
a few days ago too.

192
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,486
But, Yuri?

193
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,780
I...

194
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,992
will solve it in my own way.

195
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,703
I'm going to get through this.

196
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,831
If not for me, for you and Mom.

197
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,462
Of course.

198
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,274
Okay.

199
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,278
Eat this before you go.

200
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,782
I'm sorry, Mother.

201
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,830
Soohyun went home.

202
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,923
Soohyun.

203
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,359
Honey.

204
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,115
I'm done sorting through my emotions.

205
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,078
You...

206
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,873
broke our trust.

207
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,545
You should've told me it was
the woman next door.

208
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,757
You lied because you were afraid
to lose me.

209
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,302
It only hurt me more.

210
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,515
I'm sorry.

211
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,353
It's all my fault.

212
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,399
The hurt I received

213
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,151
won't be erased easily.

214
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,403
This stain...

215
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,280
will be in my heart forever.

216
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,702
So I tried...

217
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,664
to cut you out

218
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,875
of my life completely.

219
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,671
But...

220
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,006
me...

221
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,011
...and Gunwoo...

222
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,307
disappeared too.

223
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,356
I don't know how long it'll take

224
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,359
for our relationship to recover.

225
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,154
However...

226
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,157
I...

227
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,493
want to try my best.

228
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,080
That...

229
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,917
is my choice.

230
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,887
Thank you.

231
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,433
Thank you so much.

232
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,152
Shall we meet today?

233
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,237
I have to go somewhere today.

234
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,572
Okay.

235
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,025
KIM ***MIN

236
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,310
Hmm.

237
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,605
There.

238
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,947
- How's it going?
- Good.

239
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,491
- It's pretty.
- So pretty.

240
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,920
THE VERDICT DOCUMENT HAS BEEN APPROVED.

241
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,396
"At a speed of 115 km per hour"?

242
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,874
Hello?

243
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,209
Hello, Reporter Jeong.

244
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,629
Hello, I was curious
as to how you were doing.

245
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,218
You went to the accident site?

246
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,887
Yes.

247
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,181
I was wondering.

248
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,100
The speed limit there is 30,

249
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,394
but looking at these records,

250
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,688
the perpetrator's vehicle was over 100

251
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,315
even with that sharp curve.

252
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,193
By chance, was the perpetrator

253
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,945
someone that didn't know the terrain
of that area?

254
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,490
No, I remember
he was from that neighborhood.

255
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,993
But

256
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,621
why did you say that before?

257
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,414
That you think it's planned,

258
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,832
not an accident.

259
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,001
Ah.

260
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,838
Some of the facts made me feel
a little reluctant.

261
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,132
So Kim Eunmin's son

262
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,843
went around digging up everything
about his mom's accident.

263
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,596
I see.

264
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,182
By chance,

265
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,601
can I know more

266
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,478
about the perpetrator?

267
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,647
Yeah, I'll look into it
and call you.

268
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,982
Okay. Thank you.

269
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,747
GWON SEONYUL

270
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,082
- Where are you?
- Junkyard.

271
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,667
Did you get home safe?

272
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,797
It's raining. Be careful with your bike.

273
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,174
You're not answering.
Don't skip your meals.

274
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,847
Don't be so nosy.

275
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,349
Do you think you mean something to me

276
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,184
just because you gave me that diary?

277
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,164
- Out of the way.
- No! Let go of me!

278
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,791
I've seen him somewhere.

279
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,473
Hangyeol. What are you doing here?

280
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,101
I don't want to get the surgery.

281
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,312
I'm scared.

282
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,773
Then you can't ride in an airplane.

283
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,941
Hangyeol,

284
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,944
should you become a pilot or not?

285
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,490
Still, I'm scared.

286
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,785
Ta-da!

287
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,370
A gift.

288
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,665
I had surgery because my heart hurt.

289
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,917
You'll feel better with this.

290
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,419
Do you want to try it?

291
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,594
Here.

292
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,974
You look so pretty.

293
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
So pretty.

294
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,271
Hangyeol, do you think you can do it now?

295
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,986
Hangyeol!

296
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,197
Mom!

297
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,161
Here you go.

298
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,872
- What?
- If something like this happens again,

299
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,499
you can make use of these.

300
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,629
Excuse me?

301
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:43,883
If you pass out hearts like this,
it makes me feel a little upset.

302
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,845
We've met a few times, right?

303
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,222
Yes! I come often.

304
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,349
Doctor Kang Taeho.

305
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,311
Then what should I call you?

306
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,521
Ah.

307
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,899
There.

308
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,526
I'm Hong Sujin.

309
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,113
Tufting? What's this?

310
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,739
Bang, bang, bang!

311
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,869
- You scared me.
- Come by one day. I'll show you.

312
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,161
Bye now.

313
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,168
What was that?

314
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,629
A bullet of love?

315
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,555
I just remembered.

316
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,506
Some of the facts made me feel
a little reluctant.

317
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,925
So Kim Eunmin's son

318
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,552
went around digging up everything
about his mom's accident.

319
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,417
The person
you are calling cannot accept...

320
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,335
Why won't Soohyun pick up?

321
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,969
I came
to visit Gwon Minhyuk.

322
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,512
Can you tell me where he is?

323
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,473
I can't give out
the patient's personal information.

324
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,017
No, I'm really close to him.

325
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,643
I just want to see his face.

326
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,228
What's the patient's name?

327
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,896
Gwon Minhyuk.

328
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,317
He's recovering
after his surgery.

329
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,736
You can't visit him.

330
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,448
I told you. I just want to see his face.

331
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,536
Where is this bastard?

332
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,414
Hey, search everywhere and find him!

333
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,876
Seonyul, what do I do? It's bad.

334
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,385
Go to the workshop.

335
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,944
Hey, Taeho. Did you call?

336
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,780
Yes, it's nothing important.

337
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,823
What's your relationship with the person

338
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,618
who performed CPR
to the patient in room 1405.

339
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,704
He looked familiar
as if I saw him somewhere...

340
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,915
Wait a second.

341
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,250
Soohyun!

342
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,877
Soohyun?

343
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,513
I don't think he's conscious.

344
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,309
He has a gambling debt of 25 million won.

345
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,605
How can he sleep so peacefully?

346
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,359
Minhyuk.

347
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,445
There are ways to pay it back
while you sleep.

348
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,038
PHYSICAL RIGHTS WAIVER

349
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,673
Who are you?

350
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,768
You call yourself human beings?

351
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,813
He's not even conscious.

352
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,023
Hey.

353
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,650
Who are you?

354
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,694
Well? What's it to you, punk?

355
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,907
You...

356
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,160
Aren't you the kid who reported us?

357
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,335
Were you in on this together?
Is that what this is?

358
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,298
Do you know how much trouble
I went through because of you two?

359
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,341
What are you doing? Get him.

360
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,745
- That's enough!
- Stop it!

361
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,997
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!

362
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,081
Chief!

363
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,502
Nurse!

364
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,423
Are you okay?

365
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,217
Just a moment.

366
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,309
Are you okay?

367
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,775
We need to talk.

368
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,574
Why are you living like this?
You can't live like this forever.

369
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,119
Who cares? What's it to you?

370
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,205
Yeah, I'm going to make it matter now.

371
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,375
Wouldn't your life be a waste?
Can't you live a proper life?

372
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,169
Seriously? Do you think you're my family?

373
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,213
You're nothing to me.

374
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,423
You're always getting hurt
or breaking something.

375
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,425
Think of your parents.

376
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,761
I can't see you ruin yourself anymore.

377
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,061
Excuse me.

378
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,274
Where do you get off giving me advice?

379
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,572
You're a murderer.

380
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,120
Just mind your own business.

381
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,414
HONG SUJIN

382
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,071
You're a murderer.

383
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,414
Just mind your own business.

384
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,542
I like your scent too.

385
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,420
Really? What do I smell like?

386
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,047
You smell pretty.

387
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,800
Also, like stars.

388
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,807
Mom...

389
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,810
Mom...

390
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,063
Mom...

391
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,483
Mom, hurry up.

392
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,195
Mom...

393
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,451
Honey...

394
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,411
Honey, are you okay?

395
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,583
Did you have a bad dream?

396
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,712
You're back.

397
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,505
Yeah.

398
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,923
What are you doing?

399
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,592
Aren't you hungry?

400
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,344
Hmm. The coffee smells nice.

401
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,014
It's done.

402
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,225
- What are you doing today?
- Well...

403
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,687
I'm going to help my mom volunteer.

404
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,315
That was today?

405
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,236
You should've told me.
I would take the day off to help.

406
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,323
- Let me know next time.
- Okay.

407
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,102
Shall we move?

408
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,274
There are too many memories here.

409
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,527
Gunwoo's kindergarten, the playground.

410
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,371
We won't forget wherever we go.

411
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,998
Also, I don't want his room

412
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,584
to be filled with anything else.

413
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,635
- What?
- What?

414
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,719
- Yuri.
- Soohyun!

415
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,388
Hey!

416
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,098
What about work?

417
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,142
Mom does this every year. I can't miss it.

418
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,479
She has me this year. Why did you come?

419
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,148
- What?
- She'd come even if you told her not to!

420
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,983
Why wouldn't I come? I should be here.

421
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,360
- Right, Mom?
- Goodness.

422
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,278
Say you like that I'm here. Say it!

423
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,656
- Say you like it!
- Okay!

424
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,200
I feel reassured to have two daughters.

425
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,368
Right?

426
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,954
- I'll change out of my clothes.
- Okay.

427
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,373
- Watch your hand.
- Okay.

428
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,458
- I'm an expert right now.
- Goodness.

429
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,630
Yuri, do you want to taste it?

430
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,798
Yes.

431
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,007
Here.

432
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,220
Mmm.

433
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,680
- Mmm.
- Is it good?

434
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,098
Yes.

435
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,058
Here you go.

436
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,312
- How is it?
- Is it okay?

437
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,523
- Is it good?
- Mmm.

438
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,317
Mom, do you want to hear
your favorite song?

439
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,154
- What?
- Wait a second.

440
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,018
Let go. I'll carry it.

441
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,687
I'll do it, Mom.

442
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,813
Let go.

443
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,399
Mom, I'll do it.

444
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,901
Hey, put this in the back.

445
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,778
The backseat.

446
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,237
- Do it together.
- I'll do it.

447
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,989
I'll do it, Mom! Let go!

448
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,116
- Let go. It's heavy.
- Come on.

449
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,038
The elders love it.

450
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,081
Thank you so much.

451
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,210
Please tell Sister Maria for me.

452
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,128
Okay. Goodbye.

453
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,240
Park Jinhwan, how are you feeling?

454
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,866
Yes, I'm okay.

455
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,118
I'm Choi Juseok
of the Hankuk United Party.

456
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,579
Activist Park Jinhwan
has been protesting

457
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,790
for 34 days on a 50-meter-high crane,

458
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,794
and members of the Hankuk United Party
came to the site to show support.

459
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,296
However, the most promising
presidential candidate,

460
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,673
Congressman Kim Joon was absent.

461
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,466
You can do it!

462
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,968
That day, Congressman Kim Joon

463
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,179
was at a small rural school
where Park Jinhwan's daughter attends.

464
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:37,145
Hearing that Park Jinhwan won't be able
to attend his daughter's event,

465
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,439
Congressman Kim Joon went in his place,

466
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,985
and is raising his voice against
the suspension of development projects.

467
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,695
In response, Park Jinhwan

468
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,281
expressed his gratitude
towards Congressman Kim Joon

469
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,907
and has agreed to meet him and speak.

470
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,784
- Next in news.
-

471
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,246
That looks good.

472
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,958
Your approval rating
is rising sharply right now.

473
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,753
However, compared to the middle-aged
and older concrete support base,

474
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,046
the female voters...

475
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,507
are leaning slightly towards
Congressman Son.

476
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,759
It's just a 3% difference.

477
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,889
How's Kang Suho lately?

478
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,265
For now...

479
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,063
The response from females is enthusiastic.

480
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,902
KANG VOTED AS WOMEN'S FAVORITE JOURNALIST

481
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,904
In the age of gender equality,

482
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,489
we should match the gender ratio.

483
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,659
- Thank you.
- Great job.

484
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,828
- Great work.
- Great job, everyone.

485
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,788
Great work.

486
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,960
Kim Joon, you snake.

487
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,963
Hey, Hansang.

488
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,548
Did you find anything?

489
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,427
We need to find that punk
who sent the photo.

490
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,324
I came because I have something to say.

491
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,246
I have no right to interfere

492
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,790
with how you live, but...

493
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,460
I don't understand why you acted
the way you did that day.

494
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,549
I wanted to do something for you.

495
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,677
I've only received from you.

496
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:18,932
That day...

497
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,185
the patient's son was there too.

498
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,148
He reminded me of me.

499
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,610
I didn't think he should lose his mom too.

500
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,615
That's why I did that.

501
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,787
You can meet him

502
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,998
if you want.

503
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,678
About yesterday...

504
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,347
I...

505
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,142
was harsh.

506
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,486
Okay.

507
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,696
All right.

508
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,907
It did hurt a little.

509
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,993
I'll accept your apology.

510
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,815
Your tire looks flat.

511
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,400
Want me to inflate it for you?

512
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,033
You can wait there.

513
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,295
That's Pisces.

514
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,427
Aphrodite was walking with her son.

515
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,349
A monster suddenly appeared
and she suddenly jumped into the fire.

516
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,392
It represents the mom and son...

517
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,480
holding on to each other,
not wanting to let go.

518
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,277
I'm so jealous.

519
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,323
At least they're together.

520
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,458
I didn't think you'd come see me again.

521
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,421
Did you think I'd be your guardian

522
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,216
without any level of commitment?

523
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,930
So it'll be faster for you
to change your mind.

524
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,103
I'm going to keep meddling in your life.

525
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,730
I have to see you live a proper life.

526
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,570
Is there anything you want to do?

527
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,451
Not really.

528
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,163
Then start thinking about that now.

529
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,417
You don't know how much
you have going for you, do you?

530
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,837
What is this, an AA?

531
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,299
You've got such a way with words.

532
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,142
Don't worry about things alone.

533
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,436
You can talk to me about it.

534
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,146
I'll help you...

535
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,523
do what you want.

536
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,571
Are you always this kind?

537
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,573
No.

538
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,326
I'm normally pretty crabby.

539
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,019
Do you want to meet the son?

540
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,273
No.

541
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,360
I'm going to find...

542
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,279
what I can do

543
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,573
for him.

544
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,739
Yes?

545
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,786
Hey.

546
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,581
Keep an eye out.

547
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,507
He got something recently.

548
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,301
Let's find out what that was.

549
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,629
It's room two.

550
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,006
Honey.

551
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,261
Wow!

552
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,972
Is it a special day?

553
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,557
No, what day?

554
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,018
I just wanted to eat out with you.
It's been a while.

555
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,855
A friend recommended this place to me.

556
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,232
It's a hot spot among the young crowd
these days.

557
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,817
I see.

558
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,987
We're not the oldest ones here, are we?

559
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,322
That's right.

560
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,617
But you're the prettiest.

561
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,376
- Hello.
- Hi.

562
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,212
I'll get started.

563
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,009
Oh.

564
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,277
I'll raise the fire.

565
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,711
He was afraid of fire.

566
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,549
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

567
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,681
- Honey?
- Yes?

568
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,224
Are you okay?

569
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,768
Honey, I have to use the restroom.

570
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,019
Sure.

571
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:44,163
He didn't have any scars.

572
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:49,711
THE SURVIVOR FROM THE YANGPYEONG FIRE
SUFFERED 3RD DEGREE BURNS TO HIS SHOULDER

573
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,220
Mom.

574
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,874
Seonyul.

575
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,130
Who...

576
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,340
are you?

577
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,216
Who...

578
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,469
are you?

579
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,804
Why are you doing this, you bastard!

580
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,389
By chance,

581
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,267
is he the one who took my picture?

582
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,477
Where?

583
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,770
Eat up.

584
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,939
Director Kang,

585
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,817
you will come back to me.

586
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:00,985
Do you want to bet on it?

587
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,031
His son...

588
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,577
You said I could meet him.
