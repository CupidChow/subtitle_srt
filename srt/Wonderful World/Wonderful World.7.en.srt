00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,328
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,997
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,931
Multiple casualties here!
Multiple casualties!

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,641
Please send more ambulances!

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,441
My mom and dad are in there!

7
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,777
Save my mom and dad!

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,031
My mom and dad are in there!

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,451
My mom and dad are in there!

10
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,414
You're up.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,667
I heard you saved me.

12
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,470
Are those...

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,264
the scars from that day?

14
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,396
Who are you?

15
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,907
This is yours.

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,676
YANGPYEONG FIRE

17
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,526
I can't even ask
for your forgiveness.

18
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,903
I'll take full responsibility for my sin.

19
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,738
I hope you don't remember
someone like me,

20
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,200
so you don't lose any opportunities.

21
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,494
I sincerely apologize.

22
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,580
I heard she died in prison.

23
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,208
She begged for forgiveness
from you until she died.

24
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,628
Who said she could die?

25
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,177
Who are you? Are you her son?

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,945
I needed it so I borrowed it.

27
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm giving it back now.

28
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,203
I completed your discharge process.
Call me if you need.

29
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,541
Why are you doing this, you bastard!

30
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,849
You're like me.

31
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,061
Don't you have any manners!

32
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
He was a killer! Go to hell!

33
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,105
He killed a child!

34
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,857
- He's so shameless!
- How dare you?

35
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,234
He was punished for killing
an innocent child!

36
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,573
- Forget the apology!
- No, Seonyul.

37
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,785
He was punished for killing
an innocent child!

38
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,330
Hold back.

39
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,333
We have to.

40
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,503
Mom.

41
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,888
Honey!

42
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,391
We'll begin the funeral process.

43
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,981
- Honey!
- Dad!

44
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,570
We'll shut the door.

45
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,624
Hey, his father is a murderer.

46
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,756
Get him.

47
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,551
Damn it.

48
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,276
Mom.

49
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,659
I'm sorry...

50
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,203
I didn't visit you often.

51
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,749
Just wait.

52
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,004
It'll all be over soon.

53
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,875
EPISODE 7

54
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,338
Goodness. Ms. Eun Soohyun?

55
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,926
Hello.

56
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,802
- Have you been well?
Yes.

57
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,223
- Funny seeing you here.
I know.

58
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,350
That's right...

59
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,560
Did you meet the survivor of the fire?

60
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,312
Yes, thanks to you.

61
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,065
He was living at the address you sent me.

62
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,192
That's a relief.

63
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,444
The information was so old.

64
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,156
I was worried it wouldn't help.

65
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,575
Did you give him the diary?

66
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,621
- Yes.
- That's good.

67
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,415
If we get the chance,

68
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,417
- let's meet again next time.
- Okay.

69
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh.

70
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,385
The victim's counseling log
you were looking for.

71
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,220
I will send those together
to you directly.

72
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,890
I'm the one
who was looking for him.

73
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,602
Did you give him the diary?

74
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,480
How did she know that?

75
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
At the very least,

76
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,527
I never told her about the diary.

77
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,051
COUNSELING LOG

78
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,850
WRITTEN BY PSYCHOLOGIST KIM SIRA
OF HANKOOK UNIVERSITY

79
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,496
GWON SEONYUL

80
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,134
Who...

81
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,805
are you?

82
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,568
Yes?

83
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,950
Hey, Seonyul.

84
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,244
What brings you here?

85
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,221
You're up early.

86
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,849
Yes, I got up.

87
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,228
You've been tossing
and turning lately.

88
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,355
Is something bothering you?

89
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,695
Where are you?

90
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,779
GWON SEONYUL

91
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,241
Who is it?

92
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,369
Well.

93
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,789
The person Hyeongja was looking for.

94
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,335
You already gave him the diary.

95
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,837
Are you still bothered by him?

96
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,841
His wounds are deep.

97
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,093
I guess it did bother me.

98
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,597
Yes, sure.

99
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,348
I understand how you feel.

100
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,977
Can't you stop taking care of him now?

101
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,563
Honestly,
we don't know anything about him.

102
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,945
I'm going to take a shower.

103
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,998
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

104
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,125
- Hello.
- Hi!

105
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,422
Hello.

106
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,008
Hello!

107
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,010
- You're here.
- Yes.

108
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:28,098
I just changed her clothes,
and I'm about to head out.

109
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,100
I see you won't be bored.

110
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,520
Of course not. I'm such a chatterbox.

111
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,523
- Oh, right. I'll just shut the window.
- I'll do it.

112
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,942
- Really? Thanks.
- Sure.

113
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,861
- Take care.
- Okay.

114
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,283
Why did you do that the other day?

115
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,785
You startled Seonyul.

116
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,205
He thought something happened to you
and hasn't eaten for days.

117
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,712
This is just between us,

118
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,092
but that dummy thinks I only like him
as a friend.

119
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,470
But...

120
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
I won't let anyone hurt Seonyul.

121
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,891
No matter who it is.

122
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,566
So wake up.

123
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,572
You promised.

124
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,120
- Goodness!
- Gosh!

125
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,582
- Doctor!
- Are you okay?

126
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,292
Are you okay?

127
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,168
Well...

128
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,337
- Sujin?
- Yes?

129
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,590
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

130
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,759
- You must be here to visit.
- Yes, are you okay?

131
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,344
- Yes?
- But just now...

132
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,263
I heard something crack.

133
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,225
- I'm okay.
- Really?

134
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,274
I can't believe
you saw all that.

135
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,483
It's fine.

136
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,862
But you remembered my name!
Dr. Kang Taeho.

137
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,198
I thought of it every time I saw you.

138
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,786
Did you not get sleep last night?

139
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,371
You have bags under your eyes.

140
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,166
Yes, I just got out of surgery.

141
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,126
I guess you haven't eaten yet either.

142
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,961
Here you go.

143
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,255
No, you should eat this.

144
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,090
I can buy another one on my way.

145
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,635
- Help yourself.
- Okay, then.

146
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
- Thank you.
- Sure.

147
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,722
I should go. See you.

148
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,946
She gives me hearts every time I see her.

149
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,407
Is this a greenlight?

150
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,892
I'll treat you to a meal next time
to thank you for the donuts.

151
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,018
This is my number.

152
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,815
Mission complete.

153
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,234
We're going on a date next time.

154
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,741
I wish he'd get jealous.

155
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,509
Hey.

156
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,636
Give us another glass.

157
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,722
No, that's fine. I drove here.

158
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,818
Here.

159
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,991
I thought I'd come across something

160
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,452
if I kept digging into
Kim Joon's assistant.

161
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,587
Who's this? Never seen him before.

162
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,007
I looked into him because I thought
he was one of Kim Joon's henchmen.

163
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,594
I think he's the one that clears the path
for Kim Joon.

164
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,639
Congressman Choi Juseok resigned
from the election not too long ago,

165
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,433
- and joined Kim Joon.
- Yes.

166
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,187
Everything that's happening seemed fishy,
so I looked into it.

167
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,106
There's a rumor that says his drug party
was filmed.

168
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,442
So he's the one that took it?

169
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:53,155
Yes, and Choi Juseok
had someone tail him...

170
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,033
...and totally got
his butt kicked.

171
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,036
He's the one who took
Congressman Son's slush fund pictures,

172
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,039
which was involved in the embargo.
He majored in photography.

173
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,625
By chance,

174
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,921
is he the one who took my picture?
Did Kim Joon ask him to do it?

175
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,799
I'll keep tracking him.

176
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,984
Great job.

177
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,569
The money you asked for.

178
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,198
Why do you suddenly need that much?

179
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,869
Thank you.

180
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,842
Damn it.

181
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,388
MANAGER JERK

182
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,723
Crap.

183
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,602
I said I'd pay you back.

184
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,812
You don't have parents or siblings,

185
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,689
but you got yourself a pushover.

186
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,650
It's about your private loan, punk.

187
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,027
He paid it all.

188
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,155
Call me if you ever need money.

189
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,656
- Okay?

190
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,621
That's a hefty price
for borrowing a diary.

191
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,708
Stop gambling.

192
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,092
DEBT PAYMENT CONFIRMATION

193
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,472
DEBTOR: GWON MINHYUK
AMOUNT: 25,000,000 WON

194
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,974
A FULL PAYMENT FOR THE DEBT
HAS BEEN NOTARIZED

195
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,028
WE PRAY THE TWO VICTIMS OF THE FIRE
AT YANGPYEONG CABIN REST IN PEACE.

196
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,077
The victims you asked about

197
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,788
were laid to rest at Seongshin Memorial.

198
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,098
Gunwoo.

199
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,891
Mommy's here.

200
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,676
Hello?

201
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,927
What are you doing?

202
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,429
Are you busy?

203
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,974
If you haven't eaten,
do you want to eat together?

204
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,103
I'm at a restaurant by Yeongseong Market.

205
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,564
Where?

206
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,317
It's hot. Be careful.

207
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,153
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

208
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,239
Restaurant Purenebom.

209
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,869
Don't you want to come?

210
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,062
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

211
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,069
- Thank you for the meal.
- I thought a friend was coming.

212
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,613
I guess not. I'll bring her next time.

213
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,573
Okay. Sure.

214
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,992
Always be careful on your bike.

215
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,161
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

216
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,622
- I'd like to order.
- Sure. Bye.

217
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,094
We have to make a country
where young people can live well.

218
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,388
What's the point of saying it
over and over again?

219
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,973
Send them on vacation.

220
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,308
The government should give them
an allowance.

221
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,729
They try to get a job,
and they're judged on their English,

222
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,691
volunteer experience, certificates,
internships, and more.

223
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,234
- They work all day to...
- Enjoy.

224
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,821
...build those qualifications.
Studying both day and night in cafes.

225
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,865
It breaks my heart.

226
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,582
This way.

227
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,426
I'm so sorry for calling

228
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,636
such a busy person like you
all the way here.

229
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,388
Take a seat.

230
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,774
I was famished after trying to please
the young people.

231
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,109
I started without you.

232
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,904
- Would you like a drink?
- No.

233
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,782
We're not close enough to share
our feelings over a drink, are we?

234
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,288
This is why I like you, Director Kang.

235
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,248
Right?

236
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,503
When it comes to skate,

237
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,173
the nose is my favorite.

238
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,218
I just love this

239
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,511
pungent taste.

240
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,600
What is it you want to say?

241
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,025
When skate is left out of a feast,

242
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,694
the table could be filled
with nothing to eat.

243
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,532
I want to have a feast.

244
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,534
Will you join me?

245
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,081
So you're asking me

246
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,126
to be the skate at your feast?
Is that it?

247
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,176
My camp has a killer view.

248
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,387
I'm thinking of setting up a room for you.

249
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,015
I'm sure you're sick
of broadcasting by now.

250
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,560
How about a change of scenery?

251
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,023
This is unexpected.

252
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,277
I'm sure there's a line of people

253
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,945
waiting to join up with you.

254
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,572
So why me of all people?

255
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,825
Even college kids like you.

256
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,410
What do they call you?

257
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,870
"The people's husband"?

258
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,381
You shouldn't set all your affections
to your wife.

259
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,385
Let's make this country
a good place to live.

260
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,098
Aren't you curious how sweet

261
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,183
the government's payroll would be?

262
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,147
I don't know.

263
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,399
I appreciate it, but...

264
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,943
I don't like sweets.

265
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,406
You can keep all that sweet food

266
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,242
to yourself, Congressman.

267
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,953
I should get going.

268
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,668
By the way,

269
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,714
one food I hate is fermented skate.

270
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,675
It smells rotten.

271
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,719
Like someone I know.

272
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,847
Enjoy.

273
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,684
Director Kang,

274
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,313
you will come back to me.

275
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,191
Do you want to bet on it?

276
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,372
- Bring it to me.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,600
Such...

278
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,729
...strong ties.

279
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,530
Hansang?

280
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,408
Do you know why I came this far
and endured everything?

281
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,576
If it weren't for Kim Joon,

282
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,497
the man who killed my son
wouldn't have gotten off that easily.

283
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,458
None of this would've happened to Soohyun.
All of it.

284
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,378
it's all because of him.

285
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,340
I couldn't do anything then
because I had no power,

286
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,468
but this time...

287
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,847
I'm going to go all the way.

288
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,016
What about him?

289
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,644
He climbed higher than you did.

290
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,814
To be honest, helping you

291
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,733
kind of worries me.

292
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,610
We lost our jobs over
the Buyeongdong Corruption,

293
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,697
but you know what type of punk
Kim Joon is.

294
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,702
We were naive then. We went at him
with nothing up our sleeves.

295
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,581
This time, I have something

296
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,499
that can wring him by the neck.

297
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,129
What is it?

298
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,761
I'll tell you once I put it together
a little more.

299
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,765
Tell me what it is.

300
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,273
Kim Joon has

301
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,608
an illegitimate child.

302
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,737
An illegitimate child?

303
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,493
Will that be enough?

304
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,496
What if his mistress

305
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,248
is the one laundering
his political slush funds?

306
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,335
Is that tempting enough?

307
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,712
Who is it?

308
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,506
Do you have proof?

309
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,884
I'm almost there.

310
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,637
Hansang.

311
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,058
I left Soohyun behind like that
and went to States to climb to the top.

312
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,521
I don't care if it crumbles down now.

313
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,609
I'll do whatever I can to stop
Kim Joon from becoming the president.

314
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,029
So help me, okay?

315
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,576
I think he's the one that clears
the path for Kim Joon.

316
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,597
Hey, it's been ages!

317
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,358
- Don't you have any manners!
- He was a killer!

318
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,985
- Go to hell!
- He killed a child!

319
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,236
- So shameless!
- Funeral?

320
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,821
He doesn't deserve a funeral!

321
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,656
- He's being punished!
- Enough.

322
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,658
- Don't do this.
- No, Seonyul.

323
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,204
- Let go of me!
- Why would you come here?

324
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,999
What are you doing? Murderer!

325
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,710
Hold back.

326
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,129
Mom.

327
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,967
Why would they be violent?

328
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,082
Don't worry.

329
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,335
I'll be your father

330
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,254
from now on.

331
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,188
Take a seat.

332
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,320
Did you eat?

333
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,031
I already ate.

334
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,118
You've become so handsome!

335
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,872
Well, how's your mother?

336
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,376
How cruel, right?

337
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,087
She should think of her son, and wake up.

338
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,552
How are you feeling, Congressman?

339
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,598
It's just us. Be yourself.
You don't have to call me that.

340
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,641
Just call me Mr. Kim.

341
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,074
I heard you're a good worker.

342
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,119
But I'm not happy about that at all.

343
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,374
You even got accepted to a med school.
Why are you working for me?

344
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,586
Stop wasting that brain of yours,
and go back to med school.

345
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,254
I'll pay your tuition.

346
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,382
- I don't want to bother you anymore.
- That's your problem.

347
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,260
You can lean on me
and ask for help if you need it.

348
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,720
That's what living is about.

349
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,140
You know,

350
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,768
I work for the people
trying to do politics,

351
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,978
and there's not much to it.

352
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,774
Growing talent like you
is what's good for the people.

353
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,401
What if your mother saw you like this?

354
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,029
Do you think she'll be proud of you?

355
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:21,035
You help with my mother's hospital fees.
It's more than enough.

356
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,203
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

357
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,041
You deserve so much better.

358
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,460
Seonyul.

359
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,379
Yes?

360
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,881
Your father died in vain,

361
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,093
but shouldn't you protect your mother?

362
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,762
That means you must come to your senses.

363
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,724
Will you waste your life hating the person
that did this to your parents?

364
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,313
You thought I didn't know?

365
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,942
Once I enter the Blue House,

366
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,486
I'll make sure you get your justice.

367
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,489
Don't do anything foolish, and trust me.

368
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,826
I promise...

369
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,122
I'll be of strength to you.

370
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,859
- Where did you go?
- I had something to tend to.

371
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,195
Hey, but who is she?

372
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,030
- Who?
- Over there.

373
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,491
She really had an air about her.

374
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,771
Did you enjoy...

375
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,524
your meal?

376
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,860
Yes.

377
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,037
That's my mom's restaurant.

378
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
Really?

379
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,709
I'm a regular there.

380
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,257
I told you to come to the restaurant.

381
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,010
Why did you come here?

382
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,054
I was a little far away.

383
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,890
I was at your parents' memorial.

384
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,396
Why did you go there?

385
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,316
I just...

386
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,610
wanted to apologize.

387
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,039
I'm late.

388
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,417
Did you see my text?

389
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,886
I'll call you soon.

390
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,072
CLOSED

391
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,460
What were you thinking?

392
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,879
Then you never should've come back.

393
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,385
I want to erase everything too.

394
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,429
I'd erase it all if I could.
Do you know that?

395
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,105
Hey, sis!

396
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,607
Hey, Yuri. You're here.

397
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,153
I've been working late so much lately.
I came to recharge.

398
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,488
Mom's food always recharges me.

399
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,241
- Soohyun!
- You didn't call. What brings you here?

400
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,703
I just missed you.

401
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,539
Mom?

402
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,667
Did anything happen today?

403
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,086
What could happen?

404
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,923
I have two daughters who came to see me.

405
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,219
I feel so lucky today.

406
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,346
Sit down. I'll bring you something to eat.

407
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,598
Are you hungry?

408
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,058
The food's ready.

409
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,727
- Take that with you.
- Take it out?

410
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,103
Yes. This too.

411
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,897
- Just take this too, okay?
- Okay.

412
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,148
- And the mushrooms?
- Yes.

413
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,569
- Eat up.
- Wow.

414
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,529
- It smells great.
- Mother.

415
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,656
Hey.

416
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,575
Suho?

417
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,828
- Hi.
- I called him.

418
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,206
You're right on time.

419
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,166
Come on in. Sit down.

420
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,959
- Well? Come on.
- Okay.

421
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,842
- I'll bring more rice.
- No.

422
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,927
I'll get it.

423
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,248
Why are you two...

424
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,084
so quiet today?

425
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,502
What?

426
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,089
You're both acting very strange.

427
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,973
- Honey...
- To be honest...

428
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,767
The day...

429
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,896
...I saw you at Mom's house,

430
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,026
I was very emotional.

431
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,445
I kind of went off on Suho.

432
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,327
Yuri. Why did you do that?

433
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,663
I'm sorry.

434
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,376
I'm sorry about that.

435
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,547
I'm so upset with you.

436
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,719
Suho,

437
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,221
try to be understanding.

438
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,432
Yes.

439
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:45,956
I'm sorry.

440
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,543
I didn't want you to worry over me.

441
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,716
I should be sorry.

442
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,560
Honey.

443
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,396
Let's stay like this for a moment.

444
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:29,333
Why did he send a picture
without her face?

445
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:45,974
Welcome!

446
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,227
Auntie?

447
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,900
- Seonyul went to see you?
- Yes.

448
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,819
It was about the victim of the fire.

449
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,779
He asked if it was too late
to get treatment.

450
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,907
Pisses me off.

451
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,994
- What is?
- Seonyul and that woman.

452
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,538
They keep getting involved.

453
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,498
- Ms. Eun Soohyun?
- Yes.

454
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,127
They both strangely resemble each other.

455
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,879
Is it because of their wounds?

456
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,715
Don't I have wounds?

457
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,927
Seonyul's the type that can't stand back
and watch people in pain.

458
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,179
But why is that woman
so interested in him?

459
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,433
- Who does she think she is?
- I think she's a good person.

460
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,227
Sujin.

461
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,895
I wish...

462
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,815
- you wouldn't do anything to her--
- No.

463
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,735
That woman is evil to Seonyul.

464
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,696
If she's evil to him,

465
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,489
she's evil to me.

466
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,971
I got in touch with the detective
in charge of the case on Kim Eunmin.

467
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,556
I'm sending you his contact info.

468
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,559
Thank you so much.

469
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,151
SONGSEO POLICE STATION

470
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,824
Yes.

471
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,202
In Kim Eunmin's accident,

472
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,330
the pedestrian was jaywalking
and was closed a long time ago.

473
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,792
But the accident didn't take place
at dawn or anything.

474
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,294
- Were there no witnesses?
- No.

475
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,422
That's why it was closed so quickly.

476
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,509
And the perpetrator?

477
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,679
- How are they now?
- Goodness.

478
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,139
I can't tell you that.

479
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,349
I don't know either.

480
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,685
But right after the accident,

481
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,313
they said the entire family moved.

482
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,110
But why are you so interested

483
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,154
in Kim Eunmin's case?

484
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,077
I heard her son...

485
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,415
kept digging around for information.

486
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,804
That's right. He even filed a petition
seeking justice for his mom.

487
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,014
He wrote a lot of posts online too.

MY MOM WAS HIT BY A CAR AND IS IN THE ICU

491
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,219
SHE'S MY ONLY FAMILY
PLEASE HELP ME

492
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,940
I'M A FELLOW MED STUDENT
PLEASE JOIN THE PETITION

493
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,849
Taeho.

494
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,809
Let's have lunch.

495
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,445
Soohyun.

496
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,655
Hey, Taeho.

497
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,241
I'm sorry. Were you waiting long?

498
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,202
I know you're busy, it's fine.

499
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,829
I wanted to buy you something nice.

500
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,542
Next time when I'm off,
I'll buy you something nice.

501
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,712
It's on me. Eat up.

502
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,589
Okay.

503
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,135
To be honest...

504
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,139
I wanted to ask you something.

505
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,432
What is it?

506
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,644
The man you saw in room 1405 before.

507
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,107
- Do you remember?
- That's right! Silly me.

508
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,818
I even called you about that.

509
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,111
I know him.

510
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,078
He was one of the underclassmen
at my med school.

511
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,235
EXPEDITION TO THE PEAK
FIFTH ANNUAL FAMILY SPRING PICNIC

512
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:37,409
He received heart surgery three times
at our university hospital.

513
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,255
Hey, Seonyul. I think you got a text.

514
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,143
Let's meet up.

515
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,540
I think...

516
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,792
what happened was wrong.

517
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,253
However,

518
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,131
if I were to go back in time

519
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,717
I would still make the same choice.

520
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,930
I don't seek...

521
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,974
leniency.

522
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,985
- Punish the murderer!
- Soohyun!

523
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,611
Move! Move! Soohyun!

524
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,447
- Soohyun!
- Will you file for an appeal?

525
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,617
Why did you refuse
to have your sentence reduced?

526
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,203
- Don't you feel guilty at all?
- Forgive Eun Soohyun!

527
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,998
- Forgive Eun Soohyun!
- Soohyun!

528
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,959
Soohyun!

529
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,508
Forgive Eun Soohyun!

530
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,607
Move out of the way!

531
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,233
- Move out of the way!
- Make way!

532
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,485
Inmate 4811! Stay with me!

533
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,817
- Great job, guys. See you later.
- Okay!

534
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,849
CLOSE TO INMATE 0826, JANG HYEONGJA,
THE ARSONIST IN YANGPYEONG IN 2003

535
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,408
You can use this umbrella.

536
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,890
I try
to accept that every day,

537
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,518
but there are times when I can't.

538
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,524
A parent who loses a child

539
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,490
still hurts
no matter how much time passes.

540
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,486
I'm curious about something.

541
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,828
Why are you taking
the difficult back road?

542
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,996
You could've just told her who you were.

543
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,251
Because I want to take...

544
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,796
everything precious from her.

545
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,221
If I want to do that,

546
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,060
I have to become precious to her too.

547
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,151
Seonyul.

548
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,655
I thought about you.

549
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,657
You can use this umbrella.

550
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,659
I think it'll make Gunwoo sad

551
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,662
if he were to see you.

552
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,665
Excuse me?

553
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,667
She felt so sorry.

554
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,712
She sincerely hoped
you'd live a good life--

555
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,758
So? How do I look?

556
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,260
Do I look like I'm doing well?

557
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,601
Why do you get hurt so much?
Why do you have so many wounds?

558
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,685
What kind of...

559
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,938
wounds?

560
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,107
How did you think I'd live my life?

561
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,074
Don't be so nosy.
Do you think you mean something to me...

562
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,660
just because you gave me that diary?

563
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,080
Wouldn't your life be a waste?
Can't you live a proper life?

564
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,374
Think of your parents.

565
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,543
I can't see you ruin yourself anymore.

566
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,962
Where do you get off giving me advice?

567
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,840
You're a murderer.

568
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,890
Do you want to meet the son?

569
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,644
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY
HEART DISEASE PATIENTS' ASSOCIATION

570
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,903
Come out. Get out of there.

571
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,489
- My mother's picture is in there!
- Come out of there. Okay!

572
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,413
EXPEDITION TO THE PEAK
SIXTH ANNUAL FAMILY SPRING PICNIC

573
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,575
Now,

574
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,120
I know...

575
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,206
everything.

576
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,501
It's you.

577
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,674
Gwon Seonyul.

578
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,349
His son.

579
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,101
Do you want to meet him?

580
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,811
He's Gwon Jiwoong's son.

581
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,901
I think you should give me
the victim's information again.

582
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,111
You have a choice too.

583
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,864
I won't forgive anyone...

584
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,074
who hurt my parents.

585
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,451
It wasn't you, was it?

586
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,869
Leave.

587
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,204
To someone else,

588
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,955
wouldn't it be a tragedy?

589
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,959
He was betrayed by the two people
he loved the most.
