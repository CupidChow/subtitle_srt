THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,328
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,301
- What is the meaning of this?
- What about my mom?

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,344
What?

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,472
Your mom is with me.

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,893
Take care of her for me.

8
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,463
My belief is...

9
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,881
"Death

10
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,092
will bring a bigger death."

11
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
LOVE IN TIME

12
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,592
- Do you regret your revenge?
- I don't regret it.

13
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:07,056
I don't regret it.

14
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
CHEONGSHIN WOMEN'S PRISON

15
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,204
- Professor!
- Don't call her that.

16
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,789
She's your sister-in-law.

17
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,334
Mom, try this.

18
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,169
- This is good.
- I'll think about it.

19
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,503
What type of uncomfortable

20
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,339
- call was that?
- Soohyun.

21
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,883
Let's walk together
in the present now, okay?

22
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,218
Mom, do you want to hear
your favorite song?

23
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,762
- It's good.
- There you go.

24
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,846
Wait a second.

25
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,349
As a daughter
and daughter-in-law...

26
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,059
- I haven't...
- ...don't regret...

27
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,019
Soohyun wanted to invite you both.

28
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,564
I don't regret it.

29
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,693
Soohyun!

30
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,529
Don't worry. I'll do everything I can.

31
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,739
Don't worry, okay?

32
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,199
HAN YURI

33
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,867
PURENEBOM OWNER, OH GOEUN

34
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,161
Release Eun Soohyun!

35
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,829
Release her! Release her!

36
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,041
- Release Eun Soohyun!
- Release her! Release her!

37
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,835
It's good.

38
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,421
Mom, do you want to hear
your favorite song?

39
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,551
Mom, do you want to hear
your favorite song?

40
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,969
She's your sister-in-law.

41
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,054
It's good.

42
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,849
As a daughter-in-law,
I haven't treated either of you right.

43
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,934
Professor!

44
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,539
Five minutes left!

EPISODE 10

46
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,375
Hello.

47
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,016
ABS NEWS ROOM

48
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,819
I'm on my way.

49
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,286
I'm here.
I'll go up once Yoon Hyegeum gets here.

50
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,097
ABS GUEST

51
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,902
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
FOR HANKUK UNITED PARTY, KIM JOON

52
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,324
Goodness. I'm happy
to see you like this.

53
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,452
I'm honored you came.

54
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,121
I'll put my trust in you today.

55
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,373
Go easy on me.

56
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,459
That wouldn't be any fun.

57
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,505
I hope you enjoy
the beauty of live TV today.

58
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,007
I'll look forward to your responses.

59
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,264
This is it.

60
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,038
Hello, viewers. I'm Kang Suho.

61
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,123
The guest for my segment today

62
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,545
is Kim Joon, the presidential candidate
from the Hankuk United Party.

63
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,381
Welcome, Congressman.
It's nice to meet you.

64
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,176
Hello, I'm Kim Joon.

65
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,555
I'm very curious
about your conviction

66
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,931
regarding the rule of law.

67
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,849
To achieve true rule of law,

68
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,144
the first and foremost priority
is to eradicate corruption.

69
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,814
Using power to manipulate laws
as one pleases...

70
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,857
- Camera two, cut.
- ...must disappear.

71
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,277
- Being fair and just...
- Three, standby.

72
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,528
- ...to everyone.
- Cut.

73
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,862
I, Kim Joon, will make sure

74
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,323
- our country abides by that.
- Now, last question.

75
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,158
WHY SHOULD THE PEOPLE VOTE FOR YOU?

76
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,710
Okay, this is the last question.

77
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,753
It's the most important one too.

78
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,631
Let me ask you.

79
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,842
Congressman,

80
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,761
are the allegations of using

81
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,848
the Junseong Welfare Foundation
to create slush funds true?

82
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,643
Please, answer honestly for the viewers
watching now.

83
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,107
To verify the facts, I have invited

84
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,819
Director Yoon Hyegeum of the foundation's
Geum Gallery here today.

85
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,156
Director, will you come out?

86
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,133
What do you think you're doing?

87
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,851
Hey, what's the director doing?
Tell him to put his earphone in.

88
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,020
We have to ask the last question!

89
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,820
Crap...

90
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,822
Where is she?

91
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,418
LEE HANSANG

92
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,897
Okay, this is the last question.

93
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,524
WHY SHOULD THE PEOPLE VOTE FOR YOU?

94
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,985
Why should the people

95
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,696
vote for you...

96
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,699
for president?

97
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,956
There are so many strange things
and strange people

98
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,165
in this world.

99
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,252
People who drink and cause car accidents.

100
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,254
People who abuse
the elderly on the streets.

101
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,549
A world where anyone can stab and kill.

102
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,427
It's terrifying.
How can we live in a world like that?

103
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,721
- How refreshing!
- The people of our country

104
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,597
are already having a hard time.

105
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,266
What I want is...

106
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,437
- for women to feel safe walking at night.
- That's so refreshing.

107
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,730
For children and elders

108
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,898
to live a safe life.

109
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,986
A world where good people
won't get wronged.

110
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,489
Let's make that world together.

111
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,909
Dr. Kang Taeho, a moment please?

112
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,994
Yes.

113
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,829
ON AIR

114
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,123
- Great job!
- Great work!

115
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,791
- Great job.
- Thank you.

116
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,127
- Great work.
- Goodness, Congressman.

117
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,837
Great job.

118
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,257
The response is great right now.

119
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,302
This is all thanks to Director Kang.

120
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,389
My approval ratings will increase
thanks to you.

121
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,575
I hope you enjoy
the beauty of live TV today.

122
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,160
I'll look forward to your responses.

123
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,954
That's right.

124
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,372
I couldn't come empty-handed.

125
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,250
So I brought you a gift too.

126
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,254
How's this?

127
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,686
A kid who works for me gave it to me.

128
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,775
What did I tell you?

129
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,778
I told you I didn't send it.

130
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,325
Who knew I'd be able to use it like this?

131
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,457
What do you say?

132
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,045
Will you show me the beauty
of live television?

133
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,073
The live response
after the segment is very hot.

134
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,201
The strategy team at camp predicts

135
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,662
a 10% increase in your approval rating.

136
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,913
Kang Suho.

137
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,916
I bet this will upset him.

138
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,046
Call her.

139
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
Yes, sir.

140
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,200
Hello?

141
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,037
I told you to pack your bags.
What have you been doing?

142
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,664
Did you think I wouldn't know?

143
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,668
I was wrong.

144
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,962
I've committed a grave sin.

145
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,216
Then die.

146
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,846
Did you think
I'd let you live in peace

147
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,890
with your boy after doing something
so fearless?

148
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,683
Please,

149
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,768
Congressman...

150
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,729
Where's Heejae?

151
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,190
Don't touch Heejae!

152
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,651
- Shut up.
- 

153
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,696
I'll get rid of anyone who tries to block
my way, even if they're my own children.

154
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,865
You're all cockroaches to me.

155
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,203
If you make another move,
I'll trample you to death.

156
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,914
This my last warning.

157
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,383
Okay, where's Seonyul?

158
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,312
Mom.

159
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,106
- Mom!
- Heejae!

160
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,234
- Heejae!
- Mom!

161
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,302
Hey, kiddo.

162
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,346
You look great in that suit.

163
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,850
You really helped me today.

164
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,977
Let's go in.

165
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,232
You can go now.

166
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,015
As you went inside,
are you sure you closed the door?

167
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,732
The defendant is found not guilty.

168
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,823
Would there have been a different outcome?

169
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,867
- I'm late.
- Hello, sir.

170
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,951
Hello.

171
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,288
Is he Gwon Jiwoong's son?

172
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,748
Say hello.

173
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,708
They helped your dad.

174
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,004
I'm glad you're here.

175
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,382
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

176
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,093
It's nice to meet you.

177
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,302
I'm Gwon Seonyul.

178
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,846
Everyone here

179
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,973
are my people.

180
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,061
I'm Jeong Jaechan.

181
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,729
If you ever need our help.

182
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,488
Take a seat.

183
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,881
I don't regret it.

184
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,246
I'm going to kill the person

185
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,875
who did this to my father.

186
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,046
I won't forgive her.

187
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,173
No.

188
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,509
Don't be like that.

189
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,595
Let's forget it.

190
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,223
Please, don't hate her.

191
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,934
Why do you keep
telling me not to hate her?

192
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,604
Why are you protecting her?

193
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,940
I'm sad...

194
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,901
that I lost your dad.

195
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,280
But...

196
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,450
I also feel bad for her.

197
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,328
It'll be too hard for you if you hate her.

198
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,830
Don't hate her.

199
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,917
I'm begging you.

200
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,878
Promise me.

201
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,801
Mom, I'm sorry.

202
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,264
I have to see this to the end.

203
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,555
As Gunwoo's mother,

204
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,640
I have no remorse or shame.

205
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,268
"Death

206
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,186
will bring a bigger death."

207
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,425
What are you doing here?

208
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,351
Since when?

209
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,313
Since when have you been following me?

210
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,984
I know who you are.

211
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,034
Then shouldn't you be begging?

212
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
If I beg,

213
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,578
will you stop here?

214
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,290
Why?

215
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,210
Does it finally hurt after seeing

216
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,587
your mom collapse?

217
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,798
Just go with your belief.

218
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,842
- Kill me.
- No.

219
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,472
I won't kill you that easily.

220
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,556
So...

221
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
you'll leave your sick mother like that

222
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,645
just to get your stupid revenge?

223
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,772
How dare you speak of my mother?

224
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,856
What happened to...

225
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,862
your mom wasn't a simple accident.

226
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,999
- What are you saying?
- You...

227
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
You have to protect her.

228
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,713
Don't get involved in my mom's business.

229
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,259
Think about what you should be doing.

230
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,638
Think straight.

231
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,289
I guess you're not afraid
of anything, Mr. Kang.

232
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,500
Take a look. It's from that day.

233
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,172
My wife received
an anonymous gift recently.

234
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,799
Seeing as you thought I sent it,

235
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,551
it must've been very expensive.

236
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,052
Director Kang,

237
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,639
you will come back to me.

238
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,642
Do you want to bet on it?

239
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,654
I made a copy of the photos
on Gwon Seonyul's camera.

240
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,656
The rest are clean.

241
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,202
- What about Yoon Hyegeum?
- She never showed up.

242
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,246
What did you say?
You said we could trust her!

243
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,005
It's Kim Joon.

244
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,423
He stopped her.

245
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,345
Then you should've just
exposed him yourself!

246
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,014
You said you were prepared to get fired!

247
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,934
Yoon Hyegeum and I

248
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,936
prepared so much for this moment.

249
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,688
Hansang.

250
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,815
I have a plan.

251
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,745
Yes.

252
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,710
What?

253
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,463
Seonyul!

254
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,051
What the...

255
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,845
What is all of this?

256
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,018
Who did this?

257
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,769
That woman came by.

258
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,400
She figured everything out.

259
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,027
Sujin.

260
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,029
Let's talk later.

261
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,115
- Just go today.
- Okay.

262
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,219
Ah.

263
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,430
I couldn't give it to him.

264
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,951
What happened to...

265
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,080
your mom wasn't a simple accident.

266
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,414
Soohyun.

267
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,457
Mom was moved to the general ward.

268
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,334
Suho's here too.

269
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,509
Taeho said he wants to...

270
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,138
keep her for observation.

271
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,060
Go.

272
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,106
Just until she wakes up.

273
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,194
Just be...

274
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,280
Gunwoo's dad from now on.

275
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,080
We get to experience luxury thanks to you.

276
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:19,127
Why would the wife of Choi Myeong Group
say something like that?

277
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,713
What did she say?

278
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,883
Do you know CEO Yuri in Cheongdam?

279
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,176
She was at a cafe
with your daughter-in-law.

280
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,762
They're always together.

281
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,723
- What of it?
- She was crying and begging

282
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,058
in front of your daughter-in-law.

283
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,644
I think she's having an affair
with your son.

284
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,110
Goodness!

285
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,072
What a story.

286
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,117
Those two

287
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,704
grew up like sisters since they were kids.

288
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,414
Goodness.

289
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,708
Hey, Suho.

290
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,959
Where are you right now?

291
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,504
No, no. Even if you're busy,
I have to see you.

292
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,885
Welcome.

293
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,609
What's going on? I don't have much time.

294
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,985
Okay.

295
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,113
I'll get straight to the point.

296
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,991
Did you...

297
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,078
have inappropriate relations

298
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,748
with Soohyun's manager?

299
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,925
You're out of your mind.

300
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,551
I don't know

301
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,554
where or what you heard...

302
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,768
but don't say anything to Soohyun.

303
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,562
Don't make things any harder for her.

304
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,273
What did she say?

305
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,444
If you can't make it work,

306
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,446
get a divorce.

307
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,741
Breaking up is no big deal.

308
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,537
However, the reason for divorce...

309
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,956
can't be an affair.

310
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,710
You came this far.

311
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,005
I can't stand by and watch all of it

312
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,799
crumble in an instant.

313
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,141
You said you couldn't live without her.

314
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,144
You said she was the only one.

315
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,645
How could you do this?

316
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,606
How dare you do something so filthy?

317
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,056
Soohyun.

318
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,974
Mom.

319
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,394
Mom.

320
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,735
What happened to me?

321
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,657
You collapsed in the restaurant.

322
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,208
What about the restaurant?

323
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,669
I have a group reservation today.

324
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,254
Mom...

325
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,298
Is that important right now?

326
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm okay now.

327
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,595
Let's go home.

328
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,847
No, Mom.

329
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,018
The doctor said you need more rest.

330
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,394
Let's listen to them.

331
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,188
That'll make me feel better.

332
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,316
Okay?

333
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,693
I feel

334
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,988
like you're suffering because of me.

335
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,089
Mom.

336
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,299
Do you know...

337
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,346
how precious you are to me?

338
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,479
All I need...

339
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,899
is you, Mom.

340
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,861
No matter what happens

341
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,029
I can overcome anything...

342
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,283
as long as I have you.

343
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,872
Me too.

344
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,543
All I need is you.

345
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,881
As long as you're okay, I'm okay.

346
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,330
Why didn't you come in?

347
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,337
Soohyun.

348
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,133
I think...

349
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,928
she collapsed because of me.

350
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,725
- I'm here.
- Come in.

351
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,019
What did you buy this time?

352
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,191
I'll do it.

353
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,158
Is this how I do it?

354
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,952
It's so fresh.

355
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,459
Is something wrong?

356
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,336
What?

357
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,386
Yuri, you can tell me the truth.

358
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,555
About what?

359
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,935
What your birth mother said that day

360
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,188
about getting stabbed in the back.

361
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,523
What did she mean by that?

362
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,278
What's the photo she gave you?

363
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,831
No way...

364
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,960
The photo...

365
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,054
The woman...

366
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,474
Is it you?

367
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,065
I'm sorry.

368
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,991
- I'm so sorry, Mom.
- Don't call me that!

369
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,925
Does Soohyun know too?

370
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,778
Go.

371
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,198
Don't show yourself

372
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,785
to Soohyun for the time being.

373
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,454
She'll suffer at the sight of you.

374
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,793
Don't come here either.

375
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,049
Just go, Yuri.

376
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,356
You're here.

377
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,817
Have a seat.

378
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,985
Okay.

379
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,790
Ma'am?

380
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,710
Ma'am!

381
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,756
Ma'am.

382
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,220
Ma'am, are you okay? Ma'am!

383
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,892
- Over here!
- Doctor, we need you!

384
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,020
Over here.

385
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,189
Put her down there.

386
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,692
Help me.

387
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,154
Ma'am, can you hear me?

388
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,531
Ma'am, do you hear my voice?

389
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,616
Ma'am?

390
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,201
- What happened?
- She just collapsed.

391
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,996
Check her pulse first.

392
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,914
- Yes, Doctor.
- And let's get a CT scan.

393
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,200
DAUGHTER

394
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,466
Hello?

395
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,886
Why...

396
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,223
are you picking up?

397
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,059
Your mom...

398
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,853
is with me.

399
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,903
- Where's Oh Goeun?
- Soohyun!

400
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,997
- Hey! You're here.
- Yes.

401
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,041
- You must be hungry, sit down.
- Okay.

402
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,800
- Here are some eggs.
- You do this every time.

403
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,844
It's on the house. Eat up.

404
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,804
Thank you.

405
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,222
Thank you for the meal!

406
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,649
Son!

407
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,820
Take it with you.

408
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,405
- Thank you.
- Sure. Bye.

409
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,387
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

410
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,020
We ate so much earlier,
but it's still going in.

411
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,855
Hey, attention! Everyone!

412
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,984
To celebrate this week's
record-breaking ratings

413
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,819
with a special guest on ABS News.

414
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,865
Let's hear a toast
from Director Kang Suho!

415
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,993
Forget it.

416
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,497
- Kang Suho!
- Kang Suho!

417
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,540
- Kang Suho!
- Kang Suho!

418
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,712
You all worked hard preparing it.

419
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,297
It was tough.

420
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,381
There are many times

421
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,718
you could waver between truth
and the report as journalists.

422
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,095
During those times,

423
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,848
let's not forget our sense of mission

424
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,017
and fight to the end.

425
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,106
Cheers to our industry conscience!

426
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,067
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

427
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,319
- Cheers!
- Drink up.

428
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,946
Why won't you drink?

429
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,740
That's good.

430
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,991
Ah.

431
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,206
You never should've come back to me.

432
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,750
Do you know
what the hardest part for me is?

433
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,003
It's not knowing it was you and her

434
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,590
and that I wanted to live again
for both of you.

435
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,758
Just be...

436
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,760
Gunwoo's dad from now on.

437
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,946
Director.

438
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,991
You're really my role model.

439
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,368
I respect you so much.

440
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,376
Respect?

441
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,423
Look at me, I'm a mess.

442
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,151
I won't be able to come home
for a while because of work.

443
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,389
All done.

444
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,599
Thank you.

445
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,238
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

446
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,368
Oh Goeun came in
as an emergency patient yesterday.

447
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,828
How did she get here?

448
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,997
A man ran here with her on his back.

449
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,250
- A man?
- He said he wasn't family.

450
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,460
Just a moment.

451
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,342
It says Gwon Seonyul.

452
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,803
Why...

453
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,472
did he help my mom?

454
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,148
He's been waiting for me to crumble.

455
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,151
The end was right there, so why?

456
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,801
Seonyul, you have a call.

457
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,762
Thanks.

458
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,808
I'm busy right now.

459
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,691
Hey, where are you going?

460
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,194
Gwon Seonyul!

461
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,746
Seonyul, your mom woke up!

462
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,488
There's not much time.

463
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,572
Get here quickly.

464
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,926
Mom, wait for me.

465
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,971
Please.

466
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,479
Mom!

467
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,313
Seonyul.

468
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,505
Mom.

469
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,008
I'm here.

470
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,805
I'm a little late, aren't I?

471
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,391
I'm sorry.

472
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,398
You did great trying to stay with me.

473
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,902
You suffered so much, Mom.

474
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,951
Mom.

475
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,246
Thank you.

476
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,793
I'm sorry, Mom.

477
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,181
Mom.

478
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,518
Mom.

479
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,957
We'll go with this coffin.

480
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,585
Go with the nice frame and sheet.

481
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,296
This one.

482
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,548
What about the flowers?

483
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,425
For flowers...

484
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,888
We'll do the 1.3 million won flowers.

485
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,972
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,484
Hey.

487
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,196
- Did you get all of her stuff?
- Yeah.

488
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,365
I didn't think there'd be this much.

489
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,991
Things kept coming out.

490
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,452
I almost forgot.

491
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,204
I found this in her clothes

492
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,082
while I was packing things up.

493
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,792
Give it here.

494
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,170
I'll put this in the car.

495
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,663
Change your clothes.

496
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,045
Here.

497
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,090
It was with her stuff.

498
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,385
I think it's her phone.

499
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,733
Hey, Mom. How are you feeling?

500
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,446
Okay.

501
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,364
I'll come by later.

502
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,575
Okay.

503
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,632
- Hey, Taeho.
- Soohyun.

504
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:31,925
Did you hear the news?

505
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,594
What news?

506
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,930
Seonyul's mom passed away.

507
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,707
LATE KIM EUNMIN
CHIEF MOURNER GWON SEONYUL

508
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,791
What's this?

509
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,100
Seonyul.

510
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,810
She's here.

511
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,505
What are you doing here?

512
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,594
Don't think about anything else.

513
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,765
Focus on sending your mom off.

514
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,060
Did you come here

515
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,770
to see me like this?

516
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,744
What do I do now?

517
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,205
You know who his father was.

518
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,165
If there's something on your mind,

519
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,249
you should look into it.

520
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,794
Say hi to my sister.

521
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,214
As for me,
I'd have my enemies next to me if I need,

522
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,299
and abandon my friends
if they become useless.

523
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,885
Feel free to fawn over him, you bastard!

524
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,178
I...

525
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:29,013
still can't forgive you.

526
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,849
But why are you doing this to me?

527
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,435
You can decide to bury it...

528
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,562
or go all the way.
