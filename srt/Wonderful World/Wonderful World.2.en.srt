00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,327
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED TO ACTUAL PLACES,

2
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,620
PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,997
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,754
Prosecutor,
you may start with the demand.

5
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,631
Your Honor, it's evident
that despite having a motive,

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,968
the defendant retaliated with
deliberate vindictiveness.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,472
The prosecution requests 10 years
in prison.

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,060
Counsel,
make your final statement.

9
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,229
Your Honor.

10
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,608
The defendant was
mentally unstable at the time.

11
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,319
There were many reasons
attributable to the victim.

12
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:14,324
Above all, take into account that
the defendant confessed to her crimes.

13
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,367
I ask you be lenient.

14
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,538
Defendant, present your
closing statement.

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,807
I think...

16
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,521
what happened was wrong.

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,161
However,

18
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,125
if I were to go back in time

19
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,088
I would still make the same choice.

20
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,437
I don't seek...

21
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,610
leniency.

22
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,496
BREAKING NEWS

23
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,874
I'm sure you all remember
Kang Gunwoo's accident

24
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,169
that recently occurred in a school zone.

25
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,171
The driver who killed Gunwoo

26
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,090
was on his way home after receiving
a suspended sentence,

27
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,466
when he was killed.

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,260
The culprit
is none other than

29
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,512
Gunwoo's mother, Professor Eun Soohyun.

30
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,431
It has shocked the nation.

31
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,475
- There she is!
Punish the murderer!

32
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,562
Ms. Soohyun, is it true
you refused your sentence reduction?

33
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,689
Release her!

34
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,026
- Please tell us something.
Move! Move! Soohyun!

35
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,445
Soohyun!

36
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,074
Don't worry. I'll do everything I can.

37
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,827
- Don't worry, okay?
- I'm sorry.

38
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,746
Let go of me! Damn it!

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,165
Will you file for an appeal?

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,042
Honey!

41
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,419
Soohyun!

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,963
Soohyun!

43
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,549
Soohyun, please!

44
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,427
The mother is innocent!

45
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,429
The field connection
is almost over.

46
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,349
- Fifteen seconds.
Studio anchor, standby.

47
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,351
Will the next story be okay?

48
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,063
Three, two, one. Cue!

49
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,981
Next up.

50
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,900
EUN SOOHYUN'S FIRST MURDER TRIAL
RULING WAS TODAY

51
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,445
Eun Soohyun's first murder trial
ruling was today.

52
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,365
It was announced
at the Seoul Central District Court.

53
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
THE COURT CONSIDERS RETALIATORY MURDER

54
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,952
The court considers...

55
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,747
retaliatory murder to be

56
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,959
socially unacceptable and an antisocial...

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,254
crime in our society.

58
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,089
EUN SOOHYUN SENTENCED TO SEVEN YEARS

59
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,507
She was sentenced to seven years...

60
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,468
in...

61
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,640
Suho, continue calmly.

62
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,275
She was just a mother who lost her child.

63
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,484
Suho!

64
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,861
- Follow the teleprompter.
- But the court...

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,240
forgave him and calls her a criminal.

66
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,117
Hey! Turn it off!

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,410
Viewers.

68
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,080
Just once, think about why...

69
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,417
she had no choice but to do what she did.

70
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,671
Is there anyone out there

71
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,591
who can really judge her?

72
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,862
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

73
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,042
New inmate 4811, Eun Soohyun.

74
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,210
Enter.

75
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,444
A letter for Room Nine.

76
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,656
- A letter? Really?
- A letter?

77
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,581
- Whose are they?
- Eun Soohyun, Eun...

78
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,501
Wow, she's a big star.

79
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,797
"I'll wait for the day
you come out into the world."

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,674
"From, your pan."

81
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,302
It's not "pan"! It's "fan"!

82
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,971
- Fan!
- Fan.

83
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,182
Be quiet.

84
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,313
Inmate 4811, visitor.

85
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,109
Inmate 4811!

86
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,414
She refused the visit.

87
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,263
PETITION

88
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,770
MS. EUN, EAT YOUR MEALS

89
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,828
Soohyun, I know how hard it is
for you to see me right now.

90
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,122
Hang in there for me.

91
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,252
I'll keep my promise
and do everything I can in my power.

92
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,940
Lawyer, Hwang Jiseok.

93
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,900
CEO of Jaehwa Construction, Gwon Jiwoong.

94
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,153
Blood alcohol level of 0.03%.

95
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,619
Cheongdam-ro, 16-2.

96
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,712
 Right. Chrome Sun in Cheongdam.
It's a members-only room salon

97
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,298
that serves and caters
to self-proclaimed chairmen.

98
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,760
I think he tampered with
his blood alcohol levels. I need to check.

99
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,869
What is it?

100
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,164
I'm busy right now.
Let's talk later if it's not urgent...

101
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,209
Okay.

102
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,003
I'm leaving right now.

103
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,722
Kim Joon.

You're the best.

110
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,483
My sweet boy.

111
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,653
Do you like stars that much, Gunwoo?
I don't like that.

112
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,698
- Why not?
- It would be so sad

113
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,950
with me here and you all the way there.

114
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,705
Don't worry.
I'll fly you up there.

115
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,956
Really?

116
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,667
I'll hold your hand.

117
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,337
You can't let go. Never!

118
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,762
What's that?

119
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,308
Goodness! What do we do?

120
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,810
What's going on? Guard!

121
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,061
Guard!

122
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:14,984
Guard! Look at this!

123
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,987
There is an emergency!
Area 3, there is an emergency!

124
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,380
Choir volunteers!

125
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,758
Get your access passes
and we'll go into the assembly hall.

126
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,259
Inmate 4811!

127
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,304
Inmate 4811! Snap out of it!

128
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,098
- Inmate 4811!
- Move out of the way!

129
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,517
- Move out of the way!
- Make way!

130
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,061
Inmate 4811! Stay with me!

131
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,580
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

132
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:14,251
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

133
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,795
Ta-da!

134
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,848
Gunwoo?

135
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,311
Suho?

136
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,961
Be careful.

137
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,796
Hello!

138
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,549
Hi, Heejae!

139
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,944
How much longer?
Her blood pressure's dropping.

140
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,697
- It'll take another hour.
- Put in another line.

141
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,159
- Start the HEPA.
- Okay!

142
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,001
The patient is suffering
from severe anxiety

143
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,587
and depression due to trauma
from past events.

144
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,672
I think her reaction led to this accident.

145
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,366
Soohyun.

146
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,789
Why are you doing this?

147
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,707
Why would my daughter...

148
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,752
Do you know how much you mean to me?

149
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,254
Why does my daughter
have to suffer like this?

150
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,006
Mom.

151
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,388
I think I closed the gate.

152
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,601
- Soohyun.
- I'm sure of it.

153
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,771
I shut the gate with this hand.

154
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,482
What's the point of that now?

155
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,444
How much longer will you live
in the past like this?

156
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,029
Look at yourself.

157
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,867
- What if something happens to you--
- I really shut the gate.

158
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,372
How did Gunwoo get out?

159
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,000
My Gunwoo...

160
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,129
He can't open the gate on his own.

161
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,799
I should've checked one more time.

162
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,759
Just once more.

163
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,012
I should've checked once more!

164
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,056
- Just once more!
- Soohyun, no!

165
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,728
- Just once more!
- Someone, take these cuffs off!

166
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,106
- She's in pain! Take these off!
- Just once!

167
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,401
I should've checked one last time!

168
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,405
Just once more!

169
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,199
Just once...

170
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,097
A mother's misguided confidence
that her child would never

171
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,724
do something impulsive

172
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,435
was the starting point of this accident.
It's quite unfortunate.

173
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,479
I'm very sorry!

174
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,648
I'll repent! I'm very sorry!

175
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,738
Due to the lack of evidence,
the defendant is found not guilty.

176
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,706
JUDGE

177
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,483
I'm sorry I kept you waiting
when I called you here.

178
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,319
They talked so much
that the meeting was prolonged.

179
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,238
I'm Kim Joon.

180
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,827
- I'm Kang Suho.
- I know who you are.

181
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,080
I hear you were looking to expose me
when you quit.

182
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,125
Imagine how uncomfortable
I felt after hearing that.

183
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm sure you didn't call me to comfort me.

184
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,806
You bought off the waiter at the bar.
Did you find anything out?

185
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,897
It seems you were very close to the man
who killed my son.

186
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,108
You were both drinking
on the day of the accident.

187
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,944
Just because you're present,
doesn't mean you're drinking.

188
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,696
I know.

189
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,574
So why did you use
all the personal connections you have

190
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,492
to protect someone who wasn't drinking?

191
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,038
Do you... have proof?

192
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,458
The chief of police who can manipulate
DUI records.

193
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,086
The judge who gave him
a suspended sentence.

194
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,713
Even his attorney.

195
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:37,843
How will you explain the one connection...
all of these people share?

196
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,303
Congressman Kim Joon.

197
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,891
Mr. Kang.

198
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,312
You should write articles for news,
not write a novel.

199
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,484
Right.

200
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,154
I'll ask you one thing.

201
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,158
A member of the National Assembly
worked so hard to get a mere CEO

202
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,244
of a construction company out of trouble.
By chance, is it related

203
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,539
to the Buyeongdong Corruption
I tried to expose?

204
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,166
Are you still going on about that?

205
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,169
He was the CEO of a service company
during the Buyeongdong development.

206
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,799
From then,
he was your crucial right-hand man

207
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,010
in your chance
at the presidential election.

208
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,805
For instance,
the man in charge of money laundering.

209
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,230
Does this sound like a novel too?

210
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,985
I guess you're not afraid
of anything, Mr. Kang.

211
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,405
I have nothing left to lose.
People like me aren't afraid of anything.

212
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,327
Someone who has everything to lose
like you would be afraid, Congressman.

213
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,503
I'm sure you want to cover this up,

214
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,129
but I will expose everything

215
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,718
for my wife and my late son.

216
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,973
Just you wait and see.

217
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:17,067
Hey, our guest is leaving.
Can we let him go empty-handed?

218
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,862
We prepared a gift for you.

219
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,158
- What are you doing?
- Check out.

220
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,411
It's from that day.

221
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,467
Do you still have nothing left to lose?

222
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,142
What would happen if Eun Soohyun saw this?

223
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,478
Could she endure it?

224
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,150
You must know best

225
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:03,071
on how to protect your wife.

226
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,872
CHEONGSHIN WOMEN'S PRISON

227
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,499
- White stone.
- That's it.

228
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,752
- Aah.
- Ooh.

229
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,088
Inmate 4811.

230
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,563
Why don't you... allow him to visit?

231
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,982
Every time...

232
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,200
Soohyun, it's already fall.

233
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,911
Will you meet with me next time
so we can talk?

234
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,168
What are you doing?
Finish wiping the floor.

235
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,296
- You must have so much free time.
- Forget her.

236
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,465
Don't mess with the professor.

237
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,301
The professor is one strong woman.

238
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,679
The needle put
all those holes in her hand.

239
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,349
All around her hand.

240
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,393
She didn't scream once.

241
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,936
It must not have hurt.

242
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,355
- I don't think it hurt.
- Shut up.

243
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,525
It tore through her flesh.
Wouldn't that hurt you?

244
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,985
You saw it too.

245
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,490
Blood was dripping from her hand,
but she didn't even flinch.

246
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,909
Compared to the pain
of losing your child,

247
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,869
that must not be anything.

248
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,129
What are you doing? Hey!

249
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,673
- I'll do it.
- No. Do your own chores.

250
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,259
- Okay? Do your chores.
- Whatever.

251
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,594
Whatever.

252
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,437
Do you have
any interesting stories?

253
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,356
I used to be so popular.

254
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,358
Stop lying.

255
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,110
- It's not a lie.
- Right.

256
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,155
Hurry up.

257
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,450
Inmate 4811, go on out.

258
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,702
- No, it's fine.
- Get up for a second.

259
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,912
Get up for a second.

260
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,877
Step on it.

261
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,089
What are you doing?
You can't stop working. Hurry.

262
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,722
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

263
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,225
I'm doing it because I want to.

264
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,274
Then why me?

265
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,777
You remind me of me in the past.

266
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:35,158
Back then, my life was hanging on
by a thread and I found myself horrifying.

267
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,662
I used to be like that once.

268
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,833
But then I used all my strength
to survive.

269
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,587
I got further away
from my painful memories.

270
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,921
What?

271
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,719
Wow! Wow.

272
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,431
Wow.

273
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,349
Are you okay now? Does it hurt?

274
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,934
Congratulations! Good for you.

275
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,187
Also, this...

276
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,945
Wow.

277
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,039
It's a brand new world.

278
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,669
Well? Do I look incredible?

279
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,822
Let's wrap it up
in five minutes and move to Building Four!

280
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,240

LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

304
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,123
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

305
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,833
ABS
CONDITIONAL CONTRACT

306
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,628
NAME: KANG SUHO
FLIGHT: KZ284

307
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,214
- Freezer?
- Put the meat in the fridge.

308
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,508
- We're going to eat it soon.
- Okay.

309
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,305
Hello.

310
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,725
Have you been well?

311
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,312
How could I be well?
My son is all alone now.

312
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,734
We were going to send Suho some food.

313
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,069
We just got the groceries.

314
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,571
There's no need for that.
Suho won't be home.

315
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,198
He won't?

316
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,327
- Is he going somewhere?
- To the States as a correspondent.

317
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,288
Are you sure? When is he going?

318
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,126
What about my sister?

319
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,879
That's your problem.

320
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,297
I can't stand aside

321
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,174
and watch my precious son wither.

322
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,718
I don't think your daughter
is my business.

323
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,428
What do you think?

324
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,305
If Suho was your son,

325
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,851
would you get in the way of his success?

326
00:30:55,311 --> 00:31:00,358
Since you're an educated woman
who raised a daughter into a professor,

327
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,943
I trust you understand me.

328
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,298
Soohyun.

329
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,561
Mom.

330
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,608
How are you feeling?

331
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,192
Fine.

332
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,862
What about you, Mom?

333
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,157
How are you?

334
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,242
How are your knees?

335
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,787
If you're that worried about her,

336
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,624
how could you not ask for leniency?

337
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,792
You knew the sentence would be lengthy.

338
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,753
I'm sorry.

339
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,546
I just wanted...

340
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,133
to pay for all my sins.

341
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,471
By the way, did you know?

342
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,265
Suho got an offer
to become a correspondent.

343
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,935
Oh.

344
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,940
- That's great.
- How is that great?

345
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,151
Don't you know what that means?

346
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,447
He'll be gone for who knows how long.
You two will have to be apart.

347
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,325
With all that distance,
this separation could be permanent.

348
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,623
Soohyun, you shouldn't refuse
Suho's visitation.

349
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,293
He hasn't told you all this time.
I don't think he wants to go.

350
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,713
So hold onto him, okay?

351
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,597
Soohyun.

352
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,276
Are you okay?

353
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,739
I missed you.

354
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,159
I'm sorry.

355
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,579
I couldn't bring myself
to see you.

356
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,210
I understand.

357
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,297
I was going to keep coming no matter what.

358
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,134
I was going
to wait until then.

359
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,345
Congrats on returning to the station.

360
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,182
This is what you wanted.

361
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,185
I'm going to work hard again.

362
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,689
When you come out, you won't have to work.

363
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,904
- Suho.
- Yes?

364
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,366
I have a favor to ask.

365
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,577
Whatever you want. I'll do anything.

366
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,372
Don't come here anymore.

367
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,628
- What?
- Today's the last day

368
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,006
we'll see each other.

369
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,344
I thought it was right
to say this in person.

370
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,764
That's why I asked you to come.

371
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,599
What? What are you saying?

372
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,810
I'm so sorry.

373
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,145
But...

374
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,482
it's hard for me to see you.

375
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,777
I can't afford to consider your feelings.

376
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,739
I know. I'm not asking you to.

377
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,743
Just let me be beside you.

378
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,203
Okay, Soohyun?

379
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,998
Let's stay strong together
and hang in there.

380
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,544
We can overcome this difficult situation,

381
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,839
and we can start over, okay?

382
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,090
I'm a murderer.

383
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,051
Look at me.

384
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,554
Look at where I am.
Look at what I'm wearing.

385
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,391
What could you do with your future
with a murderer as your wife?

386
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,312
Isn't it time for you to wake up
from that dream?

387
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,191
- Soohyun?
- Please.

388
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,277
Leave me alone.

389
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,321
Just live your life.

390
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,412
Where...

391
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,832
could I go without you?

392
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,667
There's no room for you...

393
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,004
in my life anymore.

394
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,173
Do you mean that?

395
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,221
You really...

396
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,350
don't need me in your life?

397
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,771
No. I don't.

398
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,321
So just go.

399
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,828
I might become a correspondent.

400
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,749
I might not be able to come back!

401
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,507
- We're done here.
- What?

402
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,261
You're not going to stop me?

403
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,375
Don't hold it in.

404
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,962
It'll make you sick.

405
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175

Inmate 0826.

436
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,761
- Yes?
- Come out.

437
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,351
See you later.

438
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,298
What are you drawing?

439
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:55,513
The first place I want to go
when I get out of here.

440
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,854
It's near the southern end.
The sea's in front,

441
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:09,151
and in the back, there's this little hill
with silver grasses.

442
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,947
A place where you can't see
a gray wall like that.

443
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,825
There's a very old tree at the top.

444
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,412
They say if you touch it and make a wish,
it'll come true.

445
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,710
What will you wish for if you go there?

446
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,719
What about you?

447
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,391
I'd wish...

448
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,146
for all the people who suffered
because of me

449
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,232
to...

450
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,361
find happiness in their lives.

451
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:00,327
Let's go there
together one day.

452
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,793
Why are you looking at me like that?

453
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,050
I'm dying.

454
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,972
That's why they called me out
this morning.

455
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:25,227
I guess my last physical exam
wasn't all that great.

456
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,566
There's no need for that. Stop it.

457
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:37,364
I guess dying like this
is part of my redemption.

458
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,242
So I'm actually completely fine with it.
I mean it.

459
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,748
But I'm only saying this because of you.

460
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,126
I just...

461
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:55,424
don't want you to have to say
farewell again without any preparations.

462
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,304
When you live this long,

463
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:05,434
leaving someone properly is just
as important as meeting someone.

464
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,397
So let's say farewell properly.

465
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:12,983
Smile.

466
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,784
One more thing.

467
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,244
I have something to tell you.

468
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,175
MEETING WITH THE BEREAVED AFTER ARSON
A HEARTBREAKING DISASTER, NO LENIENCY

469
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,056
FOUR DEAD IN FIRE
SOLE SURVIVOR, AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY

470
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,645
To be honest,

471
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,148
I was just like you...

472
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,484
I dreamt of revenge.

473
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,322
I learned my husband was having an affair.

474
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,617
I wanted to kill them.

475
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,287
So I set the room on fire.

476
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,503
However, I didn't know the fire
would spread so much.

477
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,965
Once I snapped out of it,

478
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,011
I realized an innocent family died
because of me.

479
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,433
Quick! Over here!

480
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,561
There was one child
who survived.

481
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,938
My mom and dad are in there!

482
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,817
I prayed to God every day.

483
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,571
I hoped the child could endure this.

484
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,157
I prayed for his survival and protection.

485
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,453
That I'd give everything I had for it.

486
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,913
I started writing letters to the child.

487
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,377
I couldn't dare to bring myself

488
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,505
to apologize to him. I felt so guilty.

489
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,385
I begged and pleaded.

490
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,014
Soohyun.

491
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,310
I have a favor to ask.

492
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,103
Could you

493
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,524
give these letters to him for me?

494
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,523
Soohyun, could you give these letters
to him for me?

495
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:05,405
That child endured a hard time
as much as you did.

496
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,576
Can you help him put
that great pain behind him?

497
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,411
THREE YEARS LATER

498
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,447
This place is good.

499
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,462
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CONFERENCE

500
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,005
I, Kim Joon,

501
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,926
am the candidate
for the Hankuk United Party.

502
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,888
The reason we invited
the primary candidates here today

503
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,308
is to come together as one and create
a better nation.

504
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,768
I hope it can promote harmony.

505
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,606
There shouldn't be any fighting
or biting in politics, right?

506
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,652
Lee Jingwon's
daughter is the problem.

507
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,655
The congressman's daughter
bullied her classmate in school

508
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,283
and our team got the recording.
I think we'll be able to use it.

509
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,663
School violence will lower
the approval rating by 10% these days.

510
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,874
It was almost like a torture.
It wasn't easy for me.

511
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,545
I heard Congressman Lee's a great farmer.
He cultivated his daughter well.

512
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,007
His daughter's a treasure.

513
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,927
He's not the problem.
The problem's Son Hyeonmin.

514
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,306
He's a strong candidate.
The team's digging into him.

515
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,643
He's cleaned up his tracks well.
They can't find a speck of dust on him.

00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,775
I hear his wife's the principal there.

522
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,201

Congressman Choi's here.

- Not today.
- It's now or never.

00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,492
