THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,370
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,913
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,540
I told you.

5
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,709
Nothing would happen.

6
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,836
What about the boy's mother?

7
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,962
Poor thing.

8
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,173
Do I have time to care about that kid?

9
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,716
Don't say ridiculous things.

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,679
- What brings you here?
- Hello?

11
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,264
Apologize.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,016
Just earlier today...

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,103
I was punished for my crimes in court.

14
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,481
So apologize properly!

15
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,733
- What the hell? Seriously?
- 

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,694
Do you know how many deals I've lost
because of your kid?

17
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,654
He could've died anywhere else!

18
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,573
Why did he have to get hit by my car?

19
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,415
I'm going to kill the person...

20
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,379
- ...who did this to my father.
- No. Please, don't hate her.

21
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,590
Why do you keep telling me
not to hate her?

22
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,592
I also feel bad for her.

23
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,595
It'll be too hard for you if you hate her.

24
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm begging you.

25
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,265
SEHYUN-DONG

26
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,521
Stop Eun Soohyun
from going to prison.

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,189
I know you can do it.

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,235
What are you saying right now?

29
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,531
If you pretend like
you don't know, I won't stay quiet.

30
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,791
Mom! Mom!

31
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,462
Mom...

32
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,966
Mom, Mom!

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,929
Mom, Mom!

34
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,017
- Mom!
- Sir, wait here.

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,686
You can't go in there. Wait here.

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,620
Why did you drive like that?

37
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
Why did you do it?

38
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,039
- Let go!
- Calm down.

39
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,208
- Let go!
- Calm down, please.

40
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,835
- Why did you do it?
- Seonyul.

41
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,921
Hurry and stop him.

42
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,048
Congressman.

43
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,260
- What brings you here?
- He's like a son to me.

44
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,721
I want a proper investigation.

45
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,890
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

46
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,960
Mister.

47
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,255
Make sure he's punished properly.

48
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,219
Yes, I will.

49
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,012
I promise on your mother.

50
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,864
Come out.

51
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,991
Come out.

52
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,410
Come out!

53
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,915
Mister, I know you're inside.

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
Come out!

55
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,711
You're being so loud!

56
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,338
He moved out of there.

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,048
Can you be quiet?

58
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,800
- Are you joking?
- Mister.

59
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,885
How can you be released
without punishment?

60
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,470
Come out right now.

61
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,638
Come out!

62
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,433
Did you ask me for his address to do this?

63
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,811
Mister, he wasn't punished.

64
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,229
I know that.

65
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,564
I heard the verdict

66
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,775
and just went and raised hell on them.

67
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,859
I mean,

68
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,153
my mom's on the verge of life and death.

69
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,239
How is it a mistake? How is he not guilty?

70
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,449
I'm sorry, Seonyul.

71
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,744
I'm so sorry.

72
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,163
I should've put him in jail.

73
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,748
The law is crappy.

74
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,191
Honey, what do we do?

75
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,651
Be quiet.

76
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,197
Are you sure Mr. Kim will make sure
Huiseon gets the surgery?

77
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,282
Well?

78
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
He'll keep his promise.

79
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,101
What do you want?

80
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,104
Are you the wife of the driver

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,731
of Kim Eunmin's accident?

82
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,942
I know your husband...

83
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,695
caused the accident on purpose.

84
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,618
Please, that's enough.

85
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,331
- What do you want me to do about that now?
- Kim Eunmin...

86
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,750
is still in the hospital.

87
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,049
Junseong Foundation
promised to do my child's surgery,

88
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,135
but my baby died
before she could get it.

89
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,722
My husband was tormented to death too.

90
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,851
That woman's son and now you.

91
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,687
Stop harassing me now!

92
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,858
Junseong Welfare Foundation...
Kim Joon?

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,488
Seonyul knows too?

94
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,416
Now, let's eat.

95
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,708
Thank you for the meal!

96
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,960
EPISODE 12

97
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,672
Eat some burgers too.

98
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,842
Come this way! Here, shoot!

99
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,428
Goal!

100
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,388
Great job!

101
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,307
What's your name?

102
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,143
Merry Christmas!

103
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,312
- Thank you.
Goodness.

104
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,107
- See you again.
Goodbye.

105
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,818
- Come back again!
Goodbye.

106
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,737
- Come again!
Goodbye!

107
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,328
Give it to me.

108
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,749
Did you find anything at Seonyul's place?

109
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,377
There was nothing there.

110
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,049
He said he was looking
into his mom's accident.

111
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,553
But he's hanging out
with Eun Soohyun.

112
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,309
What's he trying to do?

113
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,564
If he finds out the truth,

114
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,400
they both won't be able to handle it.

115
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,046
What's your reason?

116
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,008
Why do you work for him
when you know everything?

117
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,014
Thank you. Thank you so much.

Did you witness an accident here
on the 13th at 6 p.m.?

124
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,200
Excuse me?

125
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,327
Hello, can I look
at the security footage here?

126
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,839
I couldn't make a move
while my mom was still alive.

127
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,264
Because Kim Joon was always watching me.

128
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,710
This is Kang Yunseok from Baekdudaegan.

129
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,838
I sent you an email in regards
to the consultation you asked for.

Soohyun! Don't worry.

I'll do everything I can.

141
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,949
- Don't worry, okay?
- I'm sorry.

142
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,409
Let go of me! Damn it!

143
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,828
Hang in there for me.

154
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,572
What is this?

155
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,173
They were all working together...

156
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,051
to get Gwon Jiwoong out.

157
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,054
Kim Joon's in the middle of it all.

158
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,934
Why did you stop?

159
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,854
You knew all of this.

160
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,690
Why didn't you go all the way?

161
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,694
You would never give up!

162
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,076
Does Kim Joon have...

163
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,287
something on you?

164
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,920
Back then...

165
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,674
I didn't have any power. I'm sorry.

166
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,057
That was the best I could do.

167
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,897
You had...

168
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,776
no power?

169
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,697
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,201
No.

171
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,162
No, you...

172
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,749
should've gone all the way.

173
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,086
Our son...

174
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,006
It had to do...

175
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,302
...with our son.

176
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,478
Soohyun.

177
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,485
You're just as important...

178
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,197
as Gunwoo was to me.

179
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,578
Let's let Gunwoo go now.

180
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,414
Okay?

181
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,897
If you don't do it, I will.

00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,469
You got a call from Director Kang Suho.

187
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,022
To what do I owe this pleasure,
Director Kang?

188
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,274
Can we meet?

189
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,817
Of course.

190
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,527
You're asking after all.

191
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,994
A world worth living in!

192
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,538
Who will make it for you?

193
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,499
Kim Joon!

194
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,126
I, Kim Joon,
make this promise

195
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,503
in front of you all today!

196
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,381
I will make a world worth living in!

197
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,980
- Ma'am?
- Come on in.

198
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,273
It's been a long time.

199
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,828
You wait outside.

200
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,175
Will you have a drink?

201
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,153
You said you didn't like skate before.

202
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,406
I know.

203
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,617
The smell of it disgusts me,

204
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,288
but I'm sure there's a reason
people like it.

205
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,709
After the segment aired,

206
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,461
people were raving more about you than me.

207
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,965
Other camps are trying to recruit you.

208
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,967
They were so eager.

209
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,719
Isn't that true?

210
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,346
I don't know.

211
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,473
What do you think, Congressman?

212
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,975
Me? Of course.

213
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,021
I want to wear the same colors as you.

214
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,404
You know how I think about you, don't you?

215
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,365
Why is that important?

216
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,911
It's not like politics is about
making friends.

217
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,455
As for me,

218
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,042
I'd have my enemies next to me if I need,

219
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,961
and abandon my friends
if they become useless.

220
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,548
Even if someone could never be on my side,

221
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,384
I'll turn them if it's necessary.

222
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,678
That's politics.

223
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,500
Then...

224
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
I'll stand by your side too.

225
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,799
Will you accept me?

226
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,016
What's with you?

227
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,188
You played so hard to get before.

228
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,024
You said it yourself.

229
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,069
You'd keep enemies by your side
if necessary.

230
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,948
I don't have anything left to lose.

231
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,159
What's more fun than having power?

232
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,584
If you give me power,

233
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,464
I'll do whatever I can to help you win
the presidential election.

234
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,843
Your dream...

235
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,555
I'll make sure it comes true.

236
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,089
I will make sure...

237
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,178
you don't regret joining me.

238
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,870
Why is it so hard
for our family to have a meal?

239
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,247
Right? We're all so busy.

240
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,083
How are your grades?

241
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,501
I tried my best.

242
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,045
- But they're not good.
- Then you didn't try.

243
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,797
- I did.
- You should've tried harder.

244
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,924
Enjoy your meal.

245
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,054
Hello. Are you Congressman Choi Juseok?

246
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,973
Yes.

247
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,267
Can I get your autograph?

248
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,936
Yes, of course.

249
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,773
Thank you. Here you go.

250
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,082
You bastard,
it's you who took that photo!

251
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,252
I'm going to kill you...

252
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,714
Hold onto these photos.

253
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,093
Once I become president,
release Choi Juseok's photo first.

254
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,765
If Kim Joon becomes president,
you're the first one out.

255
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,143
What do you say?

256
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,084
You must know who I am.

257
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,421
I'm sure you heard from Congressman Choi.

258
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,842
I'm the one who found your faults
and made Kim the presidential candidate.

259
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,844
Congressman Choi's drugs.

260
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,513
Congressman Son's corruption.

261
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,185
Congressman Baek's son's
military corruption.

262
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,272
I put all of that in Kim Joon's hands.

263
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,525
All of this still remains
in Kim Joon's hands.

264
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,448
If he becomes the president,

265
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,743
it's clear you'll have to serve him
like dogs.

266
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,077
What are you trying to say?

267
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm the one that made him
a presidential candidate,

268
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,501
so I'm going to try to bring him down too.

269
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,259
If you're on the same page as me,

270
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,886
this is your only chance.

271
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,852
Choose.

272
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,743
I interviewed an expert in the field
over the accident

273
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,954
at the apartment site in Jangyeongdong.

274
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,665
It's the biggest issue lately
except for the election.

275
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,625
I think it's worth covering
for an article.

276
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,835
Then let's do that.

277
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,379
Now.

278
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,548
Today's main news will be on Kim Joon.

279
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,969
Foreign media have picked Kim
as the future leader of Asia.

280
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,220
I'm sure you all saw it.

281
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,847
Let's prepare with that.

282
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,974
GLOBAL/OVERSEAS

283
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,394
Also, has the presidential polls
been released?

284
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,272
Yes, Kim Joon is in first place
with 28.5%.

285
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,525
Okay, let's open with that.

286
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,405
Let's get moving.

287
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,788
LIVE

288
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,790
Hello, viewers.

289
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,209
Today's first news begins with the results

290
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,962
of the presidential polls
conducted by ABS.

291
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,845
In this poll
of all the candidates of each party,

292
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,266
Kim Joon, of the Hankuk United Party,
has been slightly rising to maintain

293
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,393
the number one spot.

294
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,064
What's gotten into him?

295
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,441
He hated him before.

296
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,359
Do you think he joined Kim Joon?

297
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,570
No way.

298
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,622
Hey, Kang Suho!

299
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,295
What have you been doing?

300
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,047
People are whispering, you jerk!

301
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,259
The great Kang Suho has decided to side
with Kim Joon now that he'll be president.

302
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,804
Kim Joon's sniper
has become his sycophant!

303
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,725
Let go! I was doing just fine
before you came to me!

304
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,686
Yes! Go ahead, be his loyal dog!

305
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,815
Feel free to fawn over him all you want,
you bastard!

306
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,900
Got it?

307
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,068
Let go of me!

308
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,444
Let go! Damn it...

309
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,946
Damn it! Let go!

310
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,490
Let go! Damn it!

311
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,269
- Yes, this is Kang Suho.
- Director Kang.

312
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,646
What's going on?

313
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,483
You went through something rough
because of me.

314
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,443
It's got me so upset.

315
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,696
I'm fine.

316
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,323
What people say doesn't bother me.

317
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,616
Of course.

318
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,077
By the way,

319
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
when will you join the camp?

320
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,582
To raise your approval rating
for a clean finish,

321
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,085
I say right before the third TV debate.

322
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,839
Until then, I'll continue to support you
with the press.

323
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,048
Let's do that then.

324
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,509
I'll call you again.

325
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,238
- Kim Joon! Kim Joon!
- It's Kim Joon!

326
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,996
Kim Joon!

327
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,049
Kim Joon for the people!
Number one!

328
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,843
Kim Joon!

329
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,263
Kim Joon!

330
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,146
Kim Joon!

331
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,357
Kim Joon!

332
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,037
HONG SUJIN

333
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,709
Yes, I need a favor.

334
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,713
Find out about Junseong Foundation.

335
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,762
Kim Joon!

336
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,681
He manipulated alcohol levels
to cover Gunwoo's case.

337
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,392
The legal team that was recruited.

338
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,396
Baekdudaegan.

339
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,773
Buyeongdong Corruption.

340
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,823
Laundered money using his lover,
Yoon Hyegeum.

341
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,411
Circumstances of attempting
to kill Kim Eunmin.

342
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,499
All of this is connected to one person.

343
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,836
Kim Joon.

344
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,633
Kim Joon and Gwon Jiwoong
had close business relations.

345
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,052
I'm sure there's something between them.

346
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,599
He tried to get Gwon Jiwoong out,
so why did he kill Kim Eunmin?

347
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,393
What are you hiding?

348
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,312
What type of person is Kim Joon?

349
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,397
I'll expose it all.

350
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,927
The reason Kim Joon tried
to kill your mom...

351
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,472
I think it has to do with your dad.

352
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,519
Also, Kim Joon is connected
to my son's case too.

353
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,939
I have to find out.

354
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,941
Make sure you check

355
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,985
if you didn't miss anything
in your mom's case.

356
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,613
Think about it one more time.

357
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,827
My mom said something before she died.

358
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,747
Seonyul's on his way. Just wait.

359
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,210
The tablet.

360
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,087
What?

361
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,550
Tablet.

362
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,094
She mentioned a tablet.

363
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,222
I looked everywhere.

364
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,518
I couldn't find it anywhere.
My mom's never used one before.

365
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,979
Someone broke into my house recently.

366
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,356
I bet Kim Joon's looking for that too.

367
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,157
When faced with death,

368
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,910
the last thing someone would say...

369
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,039
will be the most earnest
in any circumstances.

370
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,252
Necessary words that...

371
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,421
were left unsaid until now.

372
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,402
Hey...

373
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,863
I'm leaving soon.

374
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,865
Did Kim Joon...

375
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,160
ask you to do that?

376
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,040
Why would someone like you...

377
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,501
do such bad things for him?

378
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,588
Think of Heejae.

379
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,884
Don't live like that anymore.

380
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,015
He's a terrifying person.

381
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,601
Don't think...

382
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,688
of going up against him.

383
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,815
You'll only get hurt.

384
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,029
What mother in the world...

385
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,492
would be scared of getting hurt
for their child?

386
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,871
All this time,

387
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,833
I didn't know anything
about my son's accident.

388
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,754
I'm going to set things right now.

389
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,716
I'll make it known.

390
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,442
I go back and forth from work and home.
There's nothing to monitor.

391
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,488
Go home, I bet you're tired.

392
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,713
I want to see you too.

393
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,258
Wow, it's you! It's my dad!

394
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,968
- You're so cool.
- Do you like me that much?

395
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,388
- Yes, you're the best!
- Gunwoo's the best to me.

396
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,472
The best!

397
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,825
Congrats, Mom!

398
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,579
One, two, three!

399
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,837
Gunwoo...

400
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,259
I'm so sorry.

401
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,814
I'm sorry, Soohyun.

402
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,600
Go slow.

403
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,854
- Hello!
- Hi, Heejae.

404
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,234
Heejae, shall we go around now?

405
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,113
Get your balance.

406
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,887
What you said...

407
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,765
kept bothering me.

408
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,852
To be honest...

409
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,981
I saw Gunwoo...

410
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,526
leave with a tablet that day.

411
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,530
That's all I know.

412
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,242
I'm sorry.

413
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,239
A tablet?

414
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,074
Mom, take a picture with this.

415
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,159
Here.

416
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,787
- What?
- You can't see it now.

417
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,014
Hello?

418
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,724
Soohyun?

419
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,437
Suho,

420
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,023
do you remember...

421
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,485
seeing a tablet among Gunwoo's things...

422
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,654
- from the accident that day?
- A tablet?

423
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,073
No, there wasn't. Why?

424
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,492
Hyegeum saw it that day.

425
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,370
She saw him with a tablet.

426
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,206
What?

427
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,000
I mean...

428
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,669
I've been looking everywhere
and it's not in the house.

429
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,838
My mom said something
before she died.

430
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,048
She mentioned a tablet.

431
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,134
Wait...

432
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,428
I'll call you back.

433
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,317
Director?

434
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,777
It's time for the meeting.

435
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,405
I'll be right back.

436
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,200
Director? Director!

437
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,666
SPECIAL LECTURE REQUEST
RECIPIENT: EUN SOOHYUN

438
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,090
Ma'am?

439
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,176
Coming. Just a moment.

440
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,475
You should have a look at the product
I mentioned earlier.

441
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,893
- This?
- Yes.

442
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,439
Uh, check if we have this in stock.

443
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,774
Okay.

444
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,943
Also, match the colors here...

445
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,695
...and reset everything.

446
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,488
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

447
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,709
MOM

448
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,638
Yes?

449
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,432
You should come.

450
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,556
Mmm.

451
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,144
Hey.

452
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,316
Come here and take some food.

453
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,616
It's Soohyun's birthday.

454
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,409
I put some aside for you too.

455
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,661
Take it with you.

456
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,579
Birthday?

457
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,791
Did Soohyun get back okay?

458
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,920
- From where?
- What do you mean?

459
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,589
She went on a business trip
to that conference.

460
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,884
You're supposed to be her manager.

461
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,302
Where's your head?

462
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,054
Mom?

463
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,641
Suho and Gunwoo are alone.

464
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,103
We should take some food to them, right?

465
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,160
Make sure you check

466
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,914
you didn't miss anything
in your mom's case.

467
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,541
Think about it one more time.

468
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,174
Seonyul.
I have to go somewhere. It's urgent.

469
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,720
There's soup in the fridge.
Heat it up and eat it.

470
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,639
- What happened with your son?
- 

471
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,477
He got into medical school!

472
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,646
Really? Congrats.

473
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,565
Thanks.

474
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,153
Still, how could you work
in a restaurant?

475
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,864
I have to do what I can
to pay for his tuition.

476
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,744
- Honey, do you have it?
- Yes, I have it.

477
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,246
But what is this, honey?

478
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,001
Eunmin, why won't you come?

479
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,004
I'm not feeling well today.

480
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,964
Next time.

481
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,431
I'm home.

482
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,691
Mom, you got a call.

483
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,783
Hey.

484
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,827
I'm not feeling well today.

485
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,914
Next time.

486
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,710
Are you sick?

487
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,510
You have a fever.

488
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,805
No, I'm fine.

489
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,641
I'm just tired.

490
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,267
Let's go to the hospital.

491
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,230
You have no idea how reassured I am

492
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,732
to have you as my son.

493
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,110
What's gotten into you?

494
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,459
Seonyul.

495
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,045
Look at this necklace.

496
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,047
You know it's special to me, right?

497
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,966
I know.

498
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,427
Now,

499
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,097
I want you to have it.

500
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,728
Make sure to never lose it.

501
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,316
- Honey, do you have it?
- Yes, I have it.

502
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,193
But what is this, honey?

503
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,658
- Honey, do you have it?
- Yes, I have it.

504
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,870
The necklace.

505
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,482
Soohyun!

506
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,747
Soohyun?

507
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,901
Hello? Hey.

508
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,528
Director, where are you?

509
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,863
It's a company meeting,
the CEO's here too.

510
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,866
Okay, I'll be right there.

511
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,459
Where would she go without her phone?

512
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,558
What are you saying?

513
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,442
The tablet your mom mentioned...

514
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,527
I think it was Gunwoo's.

515
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,364
I have to find it.

516
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,873
You asked me...

517
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,293
if I had missed anything from back then.

518
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,810
She gave this to me...

519
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,689
a few days before her accident.

520
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,427
Can we...

521
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,387
open this?

Let's go. Let's go see Gunwoo.

526
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,568
Mom? Let's go with Soohyun
when she gets here.

527
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,321
Did Soohyun say she was coming?

528
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,199
Yes.

529
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,827
I'll call to see where she is.

530
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,704
- Wait here.
- Yes, okay.

531
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,513
Soohyun, please, pick up.

00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,844
Don't go. You can't.

551
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,137
Gunwoo.

552
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,598
Gunwoo!

553
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,604
Gunwoo!

554
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,232
Gunwoo!

555
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,528
Gunwoo!

556
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,280
Gunwoo?

557
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,284
Gunwoo...

558
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,289
Jiwoong, come quick.

559
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,635
I hit a kid.

560
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,852
Wait.

561
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,813
What do you mean by you hit a kid?

562
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,648
Mommy...

563
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:40,279
Shouldn't you take him
to the hospital?

564
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,281
Jiwoong.

565
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,575
Did you forget we were drinking?

566
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:50,832
The kid...

567
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,960
saw my face.

568
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,548
What do I do about this?

569
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,675
What?

570
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,804
I'm so close to the Blue House...

571
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,183
Do I have to stop in my tracks
just because I stepped on a little bug?

572
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,228
Or shall we make sure it's dead...

573
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,856
and keep going?

574
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,108
Well?

575
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,653
- Mommy...
- 

576
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,907
Please...

577
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,578
Congressman.

578
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,164
This accident

579
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,041
was caused by me.

580
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,463
Jiwoong,

581
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,507
will you do that for me?

582
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,592
In return,

583
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,135
you have to save...

584
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,138
my son, Seonyul.

585
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,107
Clean it up and make sure
there are no loose ends.

586
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,276
Yes, sir.

587
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,664
You're the son of a murderer,
aren't you?

588
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,294
I'm the mother of a murderer.

589
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,088
Mom.

590
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,299
Gunwoo,

591
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,217
I promise...

592
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,220
Keep your wife in check.

593
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,848
-
It's the hidden truth

594
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,809
about my son's accident.

595
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,020
I'd like to file a report

596
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,564
on Kang Gunwoo's case from 2015.

597
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,025
Kim Joon as the new perpetrator.
