4
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,922
- When will you be finished?
- Well...

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,133
I think my meeting's going
to run late today.

6
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,968
I'll call you as soon as it's over.

7
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,520
It's not even worth remembering.

8
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,689
It meant nothing. I just...

9
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,608
It's all in the past.

10
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,159
Thank you for teaching me

11
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,786
and taking care of me as well.

12
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,997
I promise to repay...

13
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,752
that debt.

14
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,897
I will never...

15
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,485
disappoint you again.

16
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,905
I promise.

17
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,454
Hyegeum did?

18
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,789
Yes.

19
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,084
I ran into her by chance
at Gunwoo's grave.

20
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,880
Turns out she went to see Gunwoo
from time to time.

21
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,842
I was so grateful.

22
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,325
EPISODE 5

23
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,967
Yes?

24
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,803
5-8-U-4-1-8-1. 1-8-BU-8-7-8-5.

25
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,638
There was a tail today.

26
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,473
Okay.

27
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,945
REQUEST TO TRACK 58U4181, 18BU8785.

28
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,900
I know
who you're with right now.

29
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,208
Suho?

30
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,586
What's wrong?

31
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,279
Honey?

32
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
Soohyun?

33
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,247
Honey!

34
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,958
Honey?

35
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,336
Soohyun?

36
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,881
Soohyun!

37
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,306
What brings you here

38
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,767
- this late?
- Hyegeum.

39
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,060
Yes?

40
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,315
Where's Heejae?

41
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,609
Uh...

42
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,029
he's sleeping.

43
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,575
Why were you at the hotel
with my husband?

44
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,180
By chance,

45
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,684
is this you?

46
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,153
I'm sorry,

47
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,030
Soohyun.

48
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,918
But this happened when you weren't around.

49
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,380
We met at Gunwoo's grave a few times,

50
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,300
and it broke my heart
every time I saw him.

51
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,138
I should've stopped
after just consoling him.

52
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,890
Just answer my question.

53
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
Did you send me this?

54
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,271
No, I swear.

55
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,443
We only met today so he could ask me
the same thing.

56
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,871
I'm sorry I hurt you.

57
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,754
- Soohyun!
- Never...

58
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,592
say my name again.

59
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,532
Honey.

60
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,370
Soohyun.

61
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,997
Soohyun!

62
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
Honey!

63
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,215
Honey, please...

64
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,053
We need to talk. Please.

65
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,813
I'm sorry.

66
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,108
I wasn't honest with you before.

67
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,110
It's all over.

68
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,155
I was afraid this would happen to you.

69
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,035
It shouldn't have been her.

70
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,248
No matter how much comfort you needed.
Not her.

71
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,167
- Soohyun.
- I could give in a hundred times.

72
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,378
What else could I do? I wasn't around.

73
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,546
But...

74
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,925
why did my mom have to see that picture?

75
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,515
It was sent to your mother?

76
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,618
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

77
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,703
But...

78
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,456
I'm sure someone did this on purpose
to defame me.

79
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,459
I'm going to find out who it is
and sort this out.

80
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,920
Can you give me some time? Please?

81
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,632
I'll stay at my mom's house
for the time being.

82
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,009
Soohyun.

83
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,188
I want to stay by her side.

84
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,316
I'm sure she was startled too.

85
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,318
Soohyun.

86
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,964
What kind of bastard did this?

87
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,809
Spending all day

88
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,519
climbing a mountain

89
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,313
and sweating together like this.

90
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,898
It feels like we're a team now.

91
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,316
- Right?
- That's right.

92
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,692
That's what I'm saying.

93
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,780
Let's cheers to our captain who will sail
the sea called "Korea."

94
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,240
Raise your glasses.

95
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,159
I, Kim Joon,

96
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,745
will do my best at navigating.

97
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,125
Now, to our party and country.

98
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,003
- Cheers to Congressman Kim Joon!
- Cheers!

99
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,385
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

100
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
You scared me.

101
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,279
Why are you in front
of the men's restroom?

102
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,573
Why are you following us?

103
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,743
- What?
- 5-8-U-4-1-8-1.

104
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,204
1-8-BU-8-7-8-5.

105
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,167
What are you saying?

106
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,260
- You little...
- If I press this button,

107
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,512
this will be all over the media.

108
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,145
If you bother us ever again,

109
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,814
you'll get hurt.

110
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,762
LOOK AT THE STARS AGAIN
WHEN YOU'RE IN PAIN

111
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,138
If you go through a hard time
after reading this,

112
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,016
call me.

113
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,020
I know a bit about photos.

114
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,314
You can call me if you need my help.

115
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,028
Mom.

116
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,373
Have some.

117
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,422
Mom.

118
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,968
Do you want to stay here for a few days?

119
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,228
Yes.

120
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,817
Mom.

121
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,194
I'm going to find out

122
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,116
who sent that photo,
so please don't worry.

123
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,624
Let's not...

124
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,670
Let's not get shaken up by this.

125
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,633
What will you do when you find out
who sent it?

126
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,385
Don't get involved in that.

127
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,554
What good will it do if you get hurt?

128
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,350
That's what they want.

129
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,937
I won't think about it,

130
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,897
so you don't think about it either.

131
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,192
At times like this, we should eat well

132
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,777
and sleep well too.

133
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,405
You just need to get it together
and live your life.

134
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,992
It's nothing, Soohyun.

135
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,744
It's no big deal.

136
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,277
Why did my mom have to see that picture?

TENACIOUS DETECTIVE LEE ARRESTS
THE SERIAL KILLER

LOCAL NEWS REPORTER KANG SUHO

141
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,126
No wear or tear on the crown.

142
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,502
There's no rust.

143
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,796
The waterproof ring
just needs to be changed.

144
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,675
It's like you own the place now.

145
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,218
Detective Lee.

146
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,971
S GOLD

147
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,348
Detective my foot. I was fired ages ago.

148
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,853
You look like you need something.

149
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,780
I need to find someone.

150
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,492
A strange photo was delivered
to Soohyun recently.

151
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,078
Find out who sent it.

152
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,416
A photo?

153
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,897
Don't look at it like that.
It's all in the past.

154
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,317
That means they've been watching you
since then.

155
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
Right?

156
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,533
Could this be Kim Joon?
He was the reason we got fired.

157
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,540
We might as well find out.
I can't trust anyone.

158
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,833
Except you.

159
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,556
Yes, sir?

160
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,434
Who?

161
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,696
Hey. You're here.

162
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,364
- Yes.
- Director Kang.

163
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,950
Goodness.

164
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,786
How long has it been?

165
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,666
It's been a while.

166
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,920
He came to see you after his luncheon.

167
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,173
I saw your segment.

168
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,428
You and your wife
seem to be doing well still.

169
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,473
The reactions
have been very positive.

170
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,018
You should appear as a guest one day

171
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,103
on his news segment.

172
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,229
Well...

173
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,274
I'm sure there will be an opportunity.

174
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,169
My wife received
an anonymous gift recently.

175
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,422
Were you the one who sent it?

176
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,676
Seeing as you thought I sent it,

177
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,262
it must've been very expensive.

178
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,390
I didn't ask to hear your answer.

179
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,018
Whether you sent it or not,

180
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,645
if you're behind it,

181
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,816
you'll have to pay a bigger price.

182
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,024
Kang Suho.

183
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,109
How interesting.

184
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,029
Keep an eye on him.

185
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,156
Yes, sir.

186
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,669
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

187
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,003
I'll take a bundle.

188
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,803
Eat this.

189
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,596
Table three is ready.

190
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,849
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay.

191
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,938
- I'd like to order.
- Okay. Welcome.

192
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,441
- What can I get you?
- One bibimbap.

193
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,360
- One kimchi stew.
- Can we pay?

194
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,611
Okay!

195
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,324
I don't need the receipt.

196
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,910
- Table five is ready.
- Okay!

197
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,579
Have a great day.

198
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,335
Who sent it?

199
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,045
Why?

200
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,807
GWON SEONYUL
MEET ME AT SOLGANG NURSING CENTER AT 2.

201
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,650
I'm a little busy right now.

202
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,577
Where are you?

203
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,213
- Let's get drinks.
- Not tonight.

204
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,590
- Great job.
- I'm exhausted.

205
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,402
You must have a lot of time
on your hands seeing how you came here.

206
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,574
You're busy. It's the least I can do.

207
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,160
Here. Eat this.

208
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,425
Have you been working here long?

209
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,678
A guy I know runs this place.

210
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,682
Is it worth the pay?

211
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,059
You know...

212
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,188
I like it here
because this is where things end.

213
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,863
What about you? Don't you work?

214
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,324
Work?

215
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,037
I don't know.

216
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,042
What does it feel like
to want to do something?

217
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,211
I can't really remember.

218
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,843
Don't you have any other relatives?

219
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,138
Not anyone who I can call family.

220
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,642
Then what about your meals?

221
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,077
Why?

222
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,914
Do you pity me?

223
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,460
No.

224
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,672
You can eat a lot of ramyun at your age.

225
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,759
I ate a lot at your age too.

226
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,143
Still, call me if you ever get sick of it.

227
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,824
Drink this.

228
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,459
Why do you get hurt so much?

229
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,630
You were the same the last time I saw you.

230
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,595
Why do you have so many wounds?

231
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,014
What kind of...

232
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,267
wounds?

233
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,231
I have another part-time job
aside from this.

234
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,277
So that job's dangerous.

235
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,445
That's what pays the most.

236
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,869
How did you...

237
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,830
think I'd live my life?

238
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,751
Money's nice,

239
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,296
but try to avoid dangerous work.

240
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,881
Don't you...

241
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,842
feel pain?

242
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,269
What happened there?

243
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,529
I just...

244
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,868
got hurt.

245
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,330
Did it hurt?

246
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,373
No.

247
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,919
Things like this...

248
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,632
don't hurt at all.

249
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,802
It's the same for me.

250
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,225
Things like this...

251
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,437
don't hurt at all.

252
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,789
Did you figure out the photo?

253
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,919
They took that photo with a film camera
instead of a digital one.

254
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,837
It wasn't a private detective agency.

255
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,467
How can you know that from just looking
at the photo?

256
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,928
I do a lot of odd jobs on the side.

257
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,805
I also find people too.

258
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,017
Do you want me to look into it for you?

259
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,152
PHARMACY

260
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,327
Even if it's not painful,
stop getting hurt.

261
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,163
Take care of yourself.

262
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,559
JUNKYARD

263
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,364
Hey, Seonyul! That woman!

264
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,701
Have you eaten?
There's a lunchbox over there.

265
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,287
Did that woman bring it?

266
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,414
- Yes.
- What?

267
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,208
She's really acting like your guardian.

268
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,543
Did you look into it?

269
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,670
What? That's right.

270
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,965
You owe me big time for this.

271
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,218
I brought something big.

272
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,808
I looked into some security footage
at illegal gambling sites,

273
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,810
and I found him.

274
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,520
Is this him?

275
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,780
- Good job.
- Hey.

276
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,492
- What will you do without me?
- Without you?

277
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,452
I'd just keep living without you.

278
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,661
Hey!

279
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,288
How could you say that?

280
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,706
No.

281
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,666
I won't let it slide today.

282
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,085
Pay it back...

283
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,671
with your body today.

284
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,465
What's with you?

285
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,847
Do you like it that much?

286
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,559
Wow! My heart's going to burst!
I love it!

287
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,020
Hey, can you feel my heart racing?

288
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,984
Even if it's not painful,

289
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,945
don't get hurt anymore.

290
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,988
Take care of yourself.

291
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,683
There was nothing
in the first photo.

292
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,215
A JAYWALKING WOMAN IN CRITICAL CONDITION
AFTER BEING HIT BY A TRUCK

293
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,309
What does this article
have to do with the photo?

294
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,478
BLUEBIRD NEWS REPORTER JEONG JINHUI

295
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,696
Is that so?

296
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:35,117
By chance,
can you tell me where she works now?

297
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,327
Hello.

298
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,663
I'm the one that made the inquiry.
I'm Eun Soohyun.

299
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,334
Is there a reporter by the name
of Jeong Jinhui in the culture department?

300
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,220
Hello, Reporter Jeong Jinhui.

301
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,598
I'm writing you
because I'd like to ask you

302
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,600
about an article you wrote in 2017.

303
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,812
Please, write me back when you get this.
From Eun Soohyun.

304
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,314
YOUR EMAIL HAS BEEN SENT

305
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,965
Yes, Mother.

306
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,800
This one on the right

307
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,345
focuses on the basic care with collagen.

308
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,013
Is that so?

309
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,224
This is nice too.

310
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,850
Let's take this one too. Yes.

311
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,353
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it.

312
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,945
Goodness.

313
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,614
It looks great on you.

314
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,865
Isn't she beautiful?

315
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,826
We'll take this too.

316
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,911
Mother, wait...

317
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,209
I'll wrap it up for you.

318
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,679
Today's coffee is good.

319
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,015
Drink some.

320
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,650
Aren't you Eun Soohyun?

321
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,320
I saw your segment.

322
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,990
You two look great together.

323
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,326
- Thank you.
- Sure.

324
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,869
She's my daughter-in-law.

325
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,205
Goodness. I'm a huge fan of Kang Suho!

326
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,458
Thank you so much.

327
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,753
I hope you can support
my daughter-in-law as well.

328
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,087
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,547
We're rooting for you.

330
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,800
- Have a good time. Bye.
- Okay, thank you.

331
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,011
- Take care.
- Thank you.

332
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,729
So you're staying at your mother's.

333
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,403
The people at your mother's
merchant association sure are quick.

334
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,280
Word has spread to me.

335
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,661
Words can be a scary thing.

336
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,954
It can get so inflated.

337
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,625
What if a rumor spreads
that you two are having issues?

338
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,670
What will happen to Suho's image?

339
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,298
He said you two will try your best
in front of the nation.

340
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,884
He made that promise.

341
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,809
You decided to endure and bear it.

342
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,604
At least pretend to take responsibility.

343
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,608
Must you force me to get involved

344
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,403
and pretend like we're on good terms?

345
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,830
I won't ask you
why you're at your mother's.

346
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,081
However,

347
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,209
your carelessness must stop here.

348
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,596
Soohyun.

349
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,641
Control your expressions.

350
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,451
I'm having dinner with the people
from the merchant's association.

351
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,035
I'll be home late tonight.

352
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,622
Take this time to rest up, my daughter.

353
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,818
I'm having dinner with the people
from the merchant's association.

354
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,152
I'll be home late tonight.

355
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,322
Take this time to rest up, my daughter.

356
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,801
Soohyun?

357
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,390
- What's wrong? What is it?
- Nothing.

358
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,560
- Why are you crying?
- No, it's nothing.

359
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,145
What is it?

360
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,486
Tell me.

361
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,530
Soohyun.

362
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,865
It's nothing.

363
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,393
Soohyun's crying.

364
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,481
You said you'd live a good life.
You promised it in front of people.

365
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,111
The woman next door?

366
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,197
You know that was wrong.

367
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,075
What were you thinking?

368
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,411
Then you never should've come back.

369
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,334
I want to erase everything too.

370
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,128
I'd erase it all if I could.
Do you know that?

371
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,214
I'm going out of my mind

372
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,426
because I'm scared of losing Soohyun.

373
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,105
Now, let's have some lunch.

374
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,535
Here.

375
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,842
Soohyun?

376
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,721
Don't you want to go back to work?

377
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,725
Yuri told me

378
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,978
you got an offer from your old college

379
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,563
to give special lectures.

380
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,567
If you don't think
you can stand in front of people,

381
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,237
you could write again.

382
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,824
Why, Mom?

383
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,453
You don't like seeing me like this?

384
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,540
No, it's such a waste.

385
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,044
Who cares if it's not a college?

386
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,714
You can teach children and write again.

387
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,216
I was so impressed with you then.

388
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,095
So do whatever you want.

389
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,431
I'll always be on your side.

390
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,600
I'll support you, okay?

391
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,105
Eat up.

392
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,906
Mom, just a second.

393
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,996
Hello?

394
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,416
REPORTER JEONG JINHUI

395
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,379
I didn't think I'd meet you like this.

396
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,716
I always wanted to interview you
if I got the chance.

397
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,429
I was wondering about

398
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:02,476
the inquiry I emailed you before,
about the accident.

399
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,979
The woman who was hit by a truck
after jaywalking.

400
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,107
To be honest,
I was very surprised to learn

401
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,151
that you were curious about her.

402
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,779
Excuse me?

403
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,281
Do you...

404
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,991
...have to know about it?

405
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,952
What do you mean by that?

406
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,290
I think it'll be better
if you don't know.

407
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,419
By chance,

408
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,379
does it

409
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,882
have to do with me somehow?

410
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,680
The woman who was in
the accident was Kim Eunmin.

411
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,017
Do you know who that is?

412
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:05,747
Do you remember
which hospital was she taken to?

413
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,597
When will you buy it for us?

414
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,600
Hey, Soohyun.

415
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,103
What favor?

416
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,397
Just a moment.

417
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,446
Who?

418
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,035
Okay. I will.

419
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,705
Doctor, the patient that came up
from ICU yesterday

420
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,082
- just went into cardiac arrest. Hurry.
- Let's go.

421
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,293
- Get the crash cart and defibrillator.
- Okay.

422
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,961
KIM EUNMIN

423
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,051
What?

424
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,430
Where did it go?

425
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,848
Shoot.

426
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,353
Gwon Seonyul. He took my car.

427
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,732
Is he insane? Why did he take my car?

428
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,651
I have a date. Crap!

429
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,862
MEN'S BATH

430
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,469
I checked
criminal records like you said.

431
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,803
He's a gambling addict.

432
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,555
Plus robbery and assault.

433
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,974
He was in and out of prison
a few times recently.

434
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,645
They say those who gamble can't stop
gambling even their arm gets cut off.

435
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,483
I looked into some security footage
at illegal gambling sites,

436
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,235
and I found him.

437
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,528
Is this him?

438
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,275
Customers...

439
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,943
Thank you.

440
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,659
- I'm on fire tonight.
- You should be careful.

441
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,119
I swear...

442
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,248
Damn it. Seriously?

443
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,750
What the hell did I do?

444
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,002
Hey! Here we go again.

445
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,628
I didn't do anything!

446
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,422
The dealer messed around.

447
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:51,222
Hey, I told you not to come here,
you punk.

448
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,517
Don't come here, you bum.

449
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,109
Are you crazy?

450
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,528
Bring him to the office.

451
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,240
Hey!

452
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,959
There's a crackdown!

453
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,170
- Crackdown!
- Hey, crackdown!

454
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,301
- Hurry!
- Hurry up!

455
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,805
- Hey! Damn it!
- Run!

456
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,225
What do I do? Hurry!

457
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,397
- What's going on?
- Don't move.

458
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,023
Everyone, don't move.

459
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,277
- Run!
- Don't move...

460
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,829
Go downstairs right away!

461
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,351
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

462
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,362
Oh, right.

463
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,453
Nurse?

464
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,289
Have you seen the piece of paper
I was writing on earlier?

465
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,083
- Here it is.
- Thank you so much.

466
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:26,920
Let's see.

467
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,593
KIM EUNMIN
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

468
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:44,270
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

469
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,861
Soohyun, I looked into it.

470
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,072
She's still at our hospital right now.

471
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,295
EMERGENCY CENTER

472
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,016
The woman who was in
the accident was Kim Eunmin.

473
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,560
KIM ***MIN

474
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,078
Do you know who that is?

475
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,432
She's the wife of the person

476
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,225
that you killed.

477
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,534
I was looking for someone.

478
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:10,953
I was afraid...

479
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,872
to lose Soohyun too.

480
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,334
I'm done
sorting through my emotions.

481
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,960
It represents
the mom and son...

482
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,463
holding on to each other,
not wanting to let go.

483
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,466
You think it's planned...

484
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,386
...not an accident

485
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,305
Where do you get off
giving me advice?

486
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:31,808
You're a murderer.
