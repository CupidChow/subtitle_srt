TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,

00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,555
It was a tough day at the show.

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,434
Yes.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,358
Are you okay?

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,195
Yes.

8
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,030
I'm fine.

00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,490
RECIPIENT
EUN SOOHYUN

10
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,305
Honey.

11
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,726
You went through so much today.

12
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,021
You must be tired.

13
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,857
No, I'm fine.

14
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,775
I'm afraid you'll come down
with something.

15
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,201
Suho...

16
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,413
I think your mother's here. What do we do?

17
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,291
If you're not feeling well,
let's reschedule this.

18
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,669
No, I'm fine. Let's not keep her waiting.

19
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,379
Okay.

20
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,091
Coming.

21
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,602
Mom, how is it?

22
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,813
- You should try too.
- There we go.

23
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,357
Why are you bringing so much?

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,025
It's not much, but eat up.

25
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,030
Wow, it smells great!

26
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,950
- Am I late?
- You said you couldn't come.

27
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,869
It's a historical moment for this couple.

28
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,955
I can't miss it. I rearranged my schedule.

29
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,916
Suho, it's great to see you.

30
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,793
-It's been a while. How have you been?
-Yes.

31
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,378
-A seat.
-Soohyun.

32
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,796
What did you buy?

33
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,966
This is the bestselling golf wear
in our store.

34
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,926
I brought it for you. You golf, right?

35
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,386
Yes. Thank you.

36
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,845
-I appreciate it.
-Sure.

37
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,014
-Make sure to take her around more.
-I will.

38
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:30,353
Now, this is for you.

39
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,189
-A scarf.
-You didn't need to get me anything!

40
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,525
Of course, I did.

41
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,318
Take a look.

42
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,028
- It's nice.
- Goodness.

43
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,363
-Looks good.
-It's perfect.

44
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,407
Right, Soohyun?

45
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,492
- Thank you.
- Yes.

46
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,036
-I'll bring more plates.
-No, it's fine.

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,705
- What?
- I'll get it.

48
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,998
Honey?

49
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,670
- It airs tomorrow, right?
- Yes.

50
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,547
I can't wait to watch it.

51
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,257
-Have you eaten?
-No.

52
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,802
It looks so good.
Thank you.

53
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,470
Thanks for coming,
I know you're busy.

54
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,139
Of course. I had to come.

55
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,600
- Wow, it looks so good.
- Why did you buy this?

56
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,686
It's so pretty.

57
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,147
You can just pass it
on to me later.

58
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,989
Soohyun, are you okay?

59
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,743
Yes.

60
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,413
I must have an upset stomach.

61
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,168
Can you open the door?

62
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,338
No, it's fine.
I'll be out after I brush my teeth.

63
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,965
-Go to bed.
-Are you really okay?

64
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,383
Yes.

65
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,973
I'll put some medicine on the table.
Take it when you come out.

66
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,933
Okay?

67
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,005
EPISODE 4

68
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,760
- Babe, where are you?
- Stop messing around.

69
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,180
Isn't it your day off?
Let's get something to eat.

70
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,017
I have plans today.

71
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,061
Really?

72
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,398
How about a late dinner?

73
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,651
Okay. Fine.

74
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,863
What plans do you have today?

75
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,865
Hmm.

76
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,160
Who is he meeting?

77
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,504
TEXTS
EUN SOOHYUN

78
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,257
MEET ME AT SOLGANG NURSING CENTER AT 2.

79
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,054
I lost my child.

80
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,266
I still break every day

81
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,185
in a pain that can't be healed.

82
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,520
That's why I came to find you.

83
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,732
But I was wrong.

84
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,944
You were living your life well
in your own way.

85
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,446
I am truly sorry.

86
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,541
EUN SOOHYUN

87
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,093
Thank you.

88
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,262
THE NOVEL, LOVE IN TIME,
RECEIVED ROSALINE LITERARY AWARD

89
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,142
The son of Eun Soohyun,

90
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,770
the first Korean to win
the Rosaline Literary Award,

91
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,356
has tragically died in a car accident.

92
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,233
The driver
who killed Gunwoo

93
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,070
was on his way home after receiving
a suspended sentence, when he was killed.

94
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:53,449
After a scuffle,
Kang Gunwoo's mother intentionally...

95
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,286
...retaliatory murder
to be unacceptable

96
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,080
and an antisocial crime in our society.

97
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,793
Viewers. Just once, think about why...

98
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,921
she had no choice but to do what she did.

99
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,634
Is there anyone out there
who can really judge her?

100
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,523
What are you doing?

101
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,441
You're up.

102
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,152
I'm making some porridge.

103
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,406
I don't know how it'll taste.

104
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,701
Why would you do that?
I'm sure you're busy with work.

105
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,912
How do you feel?

106
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,707
I feel much better.

107
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,918
I must've been nervous about the show.

108
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,754
I'm relieved.

109
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,968
Are you going to volunteer today?

110
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,846
Yes, I am.

111
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,309
I'd ask you to stay home today if I could.

112
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,729
Don't overdo it, okay?

113
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,564
Yes.

114
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,774
See how it tastes.

115
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,663
- Is it okay?
- Yes, it's good.

116
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,417
I'm going to see Taeho for lunch.

117
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,086
When we last saw him,

118
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,631
he looked like a complete bum.

119
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,842
I want to buy him
something to eat.

120
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,931
I don't even have
time for a shower.

121
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,558
This is my first meal in 10 hours.

122
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,937
I wanted to buy you something good.

123
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,066
At this rate, you'll get sick
while treating others.

124
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,859
Don't skip your meals.

125
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,402
I want to,

126
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,322
but I get called
whenever I try to sit down.

127
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,575
Still, I'm going to make sure
to watch your segment.

128
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,745
No, don't even bring that up.

129
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,457
I regret it so much right now.
I should've done it alone.

130
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,501
Why?

131
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,544
Your sister-in-law...

132
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,632
threw up all night last night
after the shoot.

133
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,676
It was really hard on her.

134
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,054
But it's not like you forced her to do it.

135
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,267
It's because
she made the appearance for me.

136
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,311
I should've stopped her.

137
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,690
-It's my fault.
-That's awful.

138
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,943
What is this?

139
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,238
Your wife is sick,
and you're upset.

140
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,406
Why am I so jealous?

141
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,160
It feels like I'm experiencing the love
of a real couple.

142
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,662
Seriously.

143
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,205
Stop messing around.

144
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,749
Did you look into what I asked you?

145
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,588
I picked a few best for her.

146
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,757
This and this one.

147
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,677
It covers the respiratory system
and heart CTs.

148
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,138
You just need to add cerebrovascular MRIs.

149
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,808
Also, you can find disease characteristics
with genetic testing.

150
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,976
Yes, okay.

151
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,478
I'll take a look. You eat.
You don't have time.

152
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,730
That's right.

153
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,695
I have to go.

154
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,740
-Why?
-It's the ER.

155
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,409
-It's a five-car collision TA.
-What?

156
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,202
Well...

157
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,165
Hey, hey! At least drink some water.
You'll get an upset stomach.

158
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,043
- Take care of that for me.
- Yes, okay.

159
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,714
- Call me, okay?
- Okay!

160
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,637
It's displayed in the wrong order,
Jeongmin.

161
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,847
Ms. Han!

162
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,225
Where shall I display the VIP goods?

163
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,687
-Uh, near the window by the entrance.
-Okay.

164
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,813
Okay.

165
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,320
SOOHYUN, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

166
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,240
- I'll bring more plates.
- No, it's fine.

167
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,658
- What?
- I'll get it.

168
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,785
Honey?

169
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,746
Yuri!

170
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,415
- Oh my god!
- It's been a while!

171
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,001
Mary and Jazz, how have you been?

172
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,170
-Great.
-Yeah, we just wanted to visit your shop

173
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,506
-while traveling. Yes.
-Traveling? So nice!

174
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,008
-Oh. This is awesome.
-Awesome?

175
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,676
-Yes.
-Thank you. Come here.

176
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,970
-I will show you around.
-Okay.

177
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,806
-Wow.
-Jazz.

178
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,141
Sorry!

179
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,476
The woman.

180
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,729
Who is she?

181
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,909
Don't come here anymore.

182
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,619
There's no room for you...

183
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,164
in my life anymore.

184
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,499
You really...

185
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,881
don't need me in your life?

186
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,383
No.

187
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,595
That's when it was.

188
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,351
Then who sent this to me?

189
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,405
Yes, I'm the one
who put the envelope

190
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,615
in the waiting room that day.

191
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,492
By chance,

192
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,745
do you remember who you got it from?

193
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,580
It was a deliveryman.

194
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,877
Things were hectic because of the shoot,
so I don't remember anything else.

195
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,880
A man asked me to get it to you.

196
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,759
Okay, thank you.

197
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,892
I'm Gwon Seonyul.

198
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,357
Why are you doing this?

199
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,817
What are you doing?

200
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,779
Don't do this.

201
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,199
You bastard!

202
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,117
Why did you come back here?

203
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,787
-Tell me. Where's your bank book?
-You took it last time.

204
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,622
- Why do you want it?
- Damn it!

205
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,500
- Tell me right now!
- Goodness.

206
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
- Where is it?
- Good grief.

207
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,252
What are you doing?

208
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,921
Damn it! Move!

209
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,465
- Goodness!
- Yes, take it and sell it!

210
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,925
You worthless punk!

211
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,885
- It's got to be worth something!
- Hey!

212
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,012
- Tell me!
- Goodness!

213
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,516
-Gracious!
-Goodness, what's he doing?

214
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,976
Goodness!

215
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,602
Tell me!

216
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,703
Wait...

217
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,625
Look at me. Right here.

218
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,836
He did that to me.

219
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,921
Wow, I've never seen trash talk before.

220
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,048
You little punk!

221
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,925
Detective, let's follow the law.

222
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,385
Both of you, be quiet.

223
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,220
Even if it was legitimate,

224
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,597
you'll face criminal charges
if you don't settle.

225
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,474
Is there no one for you to call?

226
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,686
No.

227
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,735
I'm his guardian.

228
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,124
Who asked you to settle
with a creep like that?

229
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,424
Follow me.

230
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,653
Do you always use your fists first?

231
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,073
Just give me the diary.

232
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,827
If you don't settle,

233
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,996
will you go to jail?

234
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,374
Would that make you feel better?

235
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,295
I don't think I did anything wrong.

236
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,215
I know.

237
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,677
I think that too.

238
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,889
But the world doesn't.

239
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,894
They'll just... remember you as an ex-con.

240
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,564
I'm telling you that

241
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,528
as someone who's experienced it.

242
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,572
I mean it.

243
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,702
I don't want your life to end here.

244
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,207
Think of the settlement
as my investment in your future.

245
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,836
Here's your food.

246
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,221
The settlement money.

247
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,431
I'll pay you back.

248
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,144
Yes, sure. Pay me back.

249
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,272
I know where you live too.

250
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,690
But...

251
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,402
why are you talking so casually to me?

252
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,071
Can't I?

253
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,075
Do whatever you want.

254
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,882
Can I order some dumplings?

255
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,514
Can we get a plate of dumplings?

256
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,765
Sure.

257
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,469
By chance...

258
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,389
If you go through a hard time
after reading this,

259
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,019
call me.

260
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,609
And...

261
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,447
don't try to dull the pain.

262
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,867
Make sure to treat your wound.

263
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,620
It was taken with a film camera.

264
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,665
The photo from earlier.

265
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,087
Thank you.

266
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,971
They used a CineColor 800T tungsten film.

267
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,724
The person who took it is a professional.

268
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,105
I know a bit about photos.

269
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,065
You can call me if you need my help.

270
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,495
-Isn't she the author?
-It's the kid's mom.

271
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,164
-Goodness.
-She was released from jail.

272
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,805
Hyegeum, have some tea!

273
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,100
- Yes, Hyegeum. Come on.
- Maybe later.

274
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,565
Get in.

275
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,109
We're going in the same direction.
I'll give you a ride.

276
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,070
Come on.

277
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,260
We took that on our first overseas trip
with Heejae.

278
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,895
Drink it.

279
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,065
I wanted to have a cup of tea with you.

280
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,817
People will talk

281
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,694
if you hang out with me.

282
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,321
It doesn't matter.

283
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,199
You were the same.

284
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,870
Don't you remember?

285
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,374
Heejae's nickname was "Bubble Freak."

286
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,252
He would foam at the mouth
whenever he had a seizure.

287
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,004
So the kids gave him that nickname.

288
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,674
But...

289
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,886
Gunwoo approached him and said,

290
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,766
"Heejae isn't a bubble freak.

291
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,853
"He is the best soccer player
in the world."

292
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,902
He said that's what his mom told him.

293
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,699
I cried so much that day.

294
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,536
No one would let their kids
play with Heejae.

295
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,748
You let Gunwoo play with him.

296
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,876
When my friends were...

297
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,504
taking the college entrance exams,

298
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,426
I was lying in a hospital bed about
to give birth to Heejae and I thought,

299
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,054
"I shouldn't have had him."

300
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,396
That's who I was,

301
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,274
and I learned so much from watching you.

302
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,739
You really are a good mother.

303
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,495
I...

304
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,291
am not qualified to hear that.

305
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,001
No.

306
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,879
Thank you for teaching me

307
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,673
and taking care of me as well.

308
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,134
I promise to repay...

309
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,472
that debt.

310
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,153
-You should go inside.
-Okay, bye.

311
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,743
I was comforted today thanks to you.

312
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,501
I'm his guardian.

313
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,216
I don't want your life to end here.

314
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,928
Don't try to dull the pain.

315
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,391
Make sure to treat your wound.

316
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,181
Honey, I'm home.

317
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,815
Wow, what's this?

318
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,819
I wanted to have some wine with you.

319
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,114
That's good.

320
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,035
Your favorite. Misty Blue.

321
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,748
It's been years since I got you flowers.

322
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,667
Thanks.

323
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,378
I'm going to go change.

324
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,349
I drank this wine in the States.
The aroma was so nice.

325
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,936
I wanted to drink it with you one day.

326
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,981
I can't believe that day has come.

327
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,247
Here.

328
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,636
It's nice.

329
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,846
How was your day?

330
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,684
I volunteered.

331
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,563
I had some tea with Heejae's mom
at her house.

332
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,315
Heejae's mom?

333
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,860
The next door neighbor.

334
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,780
Yes. I ran into her by chance
on my way home.

335
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,830
She said...

336
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,168
I was a good mother.

337
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,380
Of course.

338
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,091
You are a good mother.

339
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,218
A good wife too.

340
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,066
Honey.

341
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,944
Did something happen today?

342
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,989
You're being strange.

343
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,911
Yes.

344
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,289
To be honest

345
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,542
I have something to talk to you about.

346
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,755
Really? What is it?

347
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,858
Someone sent me this.

348
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,613
What have you been doing?

349
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,741
Why did I get something like this?

350
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,886
Soohyun.

351
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,721
I once thought that

352
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,057
while you were apart from me,

353
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,852
you could meet another woman.

354
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,479
If...

355
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,190
you were in love with someone else,

356
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,486
I'd have to let you go one day.

357
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,158
What are you saying?

358
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,871
You know how I feel
and why I came back to you.

359
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,971
I'm really sorry.

360
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,433
It was my mistake.

361
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,148
Anything I say will sound
like an excuse right now,

362
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,316
but the truth is...

363
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,280
it was brief and happened
while we were apart.

364
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,741
But this...

365
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,953
It meant nothing.
It's not even worth remembering.

366
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,037
I just...

367
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,790
It's all in the past.

368
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,380
Before and now,

369
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,841
you're the only one for me.

370
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,594
Believe me.

371
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,352
Okay.

372
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,606
Perhaps

373
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,275
that's what I wanted to hear.

374
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,904
You said it's in the past.

375
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,907
I won't blame you.

376
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,787
Let's bury it.

377
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,046
We agreed to start over.

378
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,054
I'm so sorry.

379
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,726
I will never...

380
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,230
disappoint you again.

381
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,193
I promise.

382
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,282
Okay.

383
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,451
That photo...

384
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,954
you can throw that away.

385
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,505
The day we did the broadcast together,

386
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:49,592
a man came to the station
and asked to relay that photo to me.

387
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,177
By chance,

388
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,430
do you have any idea who it could be?

389
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,227
No.

390
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,371
Congressman Choi Juseok said

391
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,331
he'd support Congressman Kim Joon today.

392
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,960
He officially announced that he'd give up
running for the primary.

393
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,129
Therefore, the candidates who have passed

394
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,298
the preliminary rounds have now
been reduced to three candidates

395
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,343
and an intense three-way competition
is expected to take place.

396
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,429
According to a recent poll,

397
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,307
Candidates Kim Joon and Son Hyeonmin
are in a close race.

398
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,893
Congressman Choi Juseok's supporters
could be absorbed...

399
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,771
-Yes.
-It's going according to plan. Good job.

400
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,315
-Do you want to go on vacation?
-No, I'm fine.

401
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,778
It has been raising a lot of
questions. Kim Joon had normally been

402
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,947
-called an internal sniper...
-You coming?

403
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,658
...but has shown
a completely different side.

404
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,205
Did you break
all the plates I made you?

405
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,291
Why is this all you have?

406
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,796
What's this?

407
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,049
I got it today.

408
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,179
Where did you get it?

409
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,475
Shall I sleepover tonight?

410
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,189
Why not?
I feel like I should protect you today.

411
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,449
Still, I got to see you smile.
That's good enough.

412
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,871
That woman said

413
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,457
she was my guardian.

414
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,543
She said to call if I ever need to.

415
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,841
Hey!

416
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,803
Are you talking about another woman
in front of me?

417
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,316
Is it good?

418
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,362
Gonggam Talk Show
will be starting after this,

419
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,906
with anchorman Kang Suho
and writer Eun Soohyun.

420
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:27,917
Today on Gonggam Talk Show,
the new face of ABS's 8 O'clock News.

421
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,839
We have Anchorman Kang Suho and his wife
here with us today.

422
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,841
Yes.

423
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,594
I really wanted to meet you.

424
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,764
Recently,
you won the grand prize for journalists.

425
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,143
- Yes. Thank you.
- Congratulations. Yes.

426
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,687
As for Ms. Eun Soohyun,

427
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,190
you took quite the difficult step.

428
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,441
I was...

429
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,739
the mother of a child...

430
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,618
...whose life was
more precious than mine.

431
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,079
And...

432
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,416
I lost that child overnight.

433
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,209
Great job.

434
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,212
He was a child
who loved the stars,

435
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,799
and he became a star to us.

436
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,389
I try
to accept that every day,

437
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,268
but there are times when I can't.

438
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,191
A parent who loses a child

439
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,361
still hurts
no matter how much time passes.

440
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,408
Still...

441
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,704
I think it's time...

442
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,249
...to let everything go and forget.

443
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,752
My wife and I

444
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:57,381
have endured a hard time together.

445
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,885
It has made us stronger.

446
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,599
-The comments are good.
-...our feelings for one another...

447
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,683
I CRIED WATCHING THIS

448
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,809
...have strengthened.

449
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,895
KANG SUHO IS LIKE A MOVIE STAR
HE'S AWESOME!

450
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,730
That will never change.

451
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,487
To all the parents out there
who have been through the same pain...

452
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,447
This is it.

453
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,577
It has to ferment to taste like this.

454
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,080
...you can endure it.

455
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,249
Thank you.

456
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,117
-Director Kang.
-Sir, hello.

457
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,827
-Hello.
-Yes.

458
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,038
The response from the segment was good.

459
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,624
I feel at ease now.

460
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,543
I'll put my faith in you.

461
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,588
- I'm leaving.
- Thank you.

462
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,715
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

463
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,176
- You two looked great.
- So impressive.

464
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,219
- You were great.
- Congrats!

465
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,140
How is he like that?

466
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,602
Yes?

467
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,862
It's the security footage
of the day you asked for.

468
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,490
Great job.

469
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,657
I checked the security footage,
but I couldn't find him.

470
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,160
Ta-da!

471
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,746
Soohyun, try this.

472
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,793
This place is famous.
The pastry chef here's dating my employee.

473
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,879
I put in a good word.

474
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,506
Thanks.

475
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,932
Soohyun.

476
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,934
Is something wrong?

477
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,646
It's just, before...

478
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,525
you didn't seem well
at the barbeque party at your house.

479
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,569
You didn't text me back either.

480
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,538
-Yuri.
-Yes?

481
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,290
When I...

482
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,377
gave you my divorce papers.

483
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,382
I was

484
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,178
really going to let Suho go.

485
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,638
I know.

486
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,557
How could I not know that?

487
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,395
I told him to get out of my life.

488
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,690
That there was no place for him anymore.

489
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,445
I said awful things to him.

490
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,990
I hoped he'd meet someone else

491
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,326
and live a happier life.

492
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,704
To forget about me and start over.

493
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,790
But...

494
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,294
a person's feelings are so strange.

495
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,258
It felt awful knowing

496
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,843
that he actually met someone else.

497
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,141
Someone else?

498
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,811
What are you saying?

499
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,278
Suho...

500
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,825
was seeing another woman.

501
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,164
Did he say that?

502
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,917
No.

503
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,672
Someone sent me a picture of them to me.

504
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,219
Then you know who the other woman is.

505
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,763
I don't know.

506
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,475
Her face can't be seen in the photo.

507
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,521
It's for the best.

508
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,693
If I had seen her,
it would be on my mind forever.

509
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,112
What did Suho say?

510
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,363
Did you talk to him?

511
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,616
Yes.

512
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,451
Last night.

513
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,912
He said she meant nothing

514
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,248
and wasn't even worth remembering.

515
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,002
We agreed to bury it.

516
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,588
But...

517
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,549
I don't think I meant it.

518
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,470
I understood it in my mind.

519
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,474
I know he went through a hard time
after we separated.

520
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,894
What can I do about someone
he met during that time?

521
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,062
Not to mention,

522
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,730
he says it's all in the past.

523
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,983
But I can't help but wonder

524
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,403
about who sent that photo to me.

525
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,240
I can't stop thinking about
who the woman in the photo is.

526
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,661
Soohyun.

527
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,246
Just because you get hit by lightning,

528
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,667
enduring a rain shower

529
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,877
doesn't get any easier.

530
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,255
Why am I letting this bother me?

531
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,677
Aren't you a woman too?

532
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,805
Although it's the past,
it'll still bother you.

533
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,683
But, Soohyun,

534
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,059
just bury it.

535
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,603
Don't look back.

536
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,648
Suho told you.

537
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,318
That she wasn't even worth remembering.

538
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,198
The person he really loves...

539
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,492
is only you.

540
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,578
I can guarantee that.

541
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,456
I've seen it for myself.

542
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,881
Hello?

543
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,802
I'll be right there.

544
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,596
Sorry.

545
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,515
-Something came up at work.
-Go ahead.

546
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,934
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

547
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,739
- Mom.
- Hey.

548
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,699
You called.

549
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,160
I didn't know. I was grocery shopping.

550
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,411
Yes.

551
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,831
I just wanted to hear your voice.

552
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,000
Then come by.

553
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,085
I want to see you too.

554
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,589
Yes, the farmer's market.

555
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,425
They have fresh goods.

556
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,220
I bought a few things while I was there.

557
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,472
I guess I lost track of time.

558
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,892
That's too heavy for you.
Your wrists are bad.

559
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,393
You should've gone with me.

560
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,189
My daughter's too precious for that.

561
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,150
Shall I...

562
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,111
come see you now?

563
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,532
Do you want to? I'd love that.

564
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:10,118
What shall I make you?
Tell me what you want to eat.

565
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,705
What's this?

566
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,544
Hello?

567
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,254
Mom?

568
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,256
I just got some mail.

569
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:26,301
There's no return address
and nothing's written on it.

570
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,358
Mom.

571
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,944
Mom?

572
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,849
Mom!

573
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,064
Mom?

574
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,612
Mom?

575
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,640
Mom.

576
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,397
Mom?

577
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,414
How did you find me?

578
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,669
Mom.

579
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,753
I am...

580
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,715
I'm okay.

581
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,761
You...

582
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,889
know?

583
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,821
Suho.

584
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,993
I didn't want to
let him get away with this.

585
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,165
I wanted to go see him.

586
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,501
But I couldn't bring myself to go.

587
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,713
I didn't want to hurt you more.

588
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,637
You did well, Mom.

589
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,347
He said it's all in the past.

590
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:03,101
It happened while we were apart, Mom.

591
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,896
That bastard.

592
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,690
He should've held back.

593
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,653
My daughter loses her child overnight.

594
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,491
While she was enduring
on that cold prison floor...

595
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,286
He should've held back.

596
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,841
Wait.

597
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,761
Did someone send you that photo too?

598
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,431
Who did it?

599
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,226
Was it the woman in the photo?

600
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,437
I don't know.

601
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,735
How dare they mess with my daughter?

602
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,155
I'm going to find them
and teach them a lesson.

603
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,909
Just as Gunwoo was the world to you,

604
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,286
it's the same for me.

605
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,415
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

606
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,380
Soohyun.

607
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,341
Mom.

608
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,010
I'm so sorry.

609
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:23,056
I'm sorry to worry you again like this.

610
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,104
Why would anyone do this
to my poor daughter?

611
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,068
Mom, I'm okay. It's fine.

612
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,123
Good. Smile just a little.

613
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,963
Okay.

614
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,214
What a picture.

615
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,217
You look great.

616
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,510
- Great job.
- Are we done?

617
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,262
Great job.

618
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,306
Good work.

619
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,683
It's more of a pictorial
than a newsletter.

620
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,977
How can an anchorman
look better than an actor?

621
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,687
It wasn't easy.

622
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,355
-Good luck.
-Okay.

623
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,691
- Great job. Thank you.
- Wonderful work.

624
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,874
Hello?

625
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,252
I wanted to check something with you.

626
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,088
Was it you?

627
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,341
Did you send the photo?

628
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,348
Let's talk in person.

629
00:53:54,773 --> 00:54:01,780
#701, CINDERIA HOTEL

630
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,583
ST. ANDREA ORPHANAGE

631
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,296
Here it is.

632
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,593
It's the last picture
before you left the orphanage.

633
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,928
Yes, anything new?

634
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,139
He must not even go to a hospital.

635
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,475
There are no medical insurance records,
and his current address is unknown.

636
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,936
Go through criminal records.

637
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,564
Aren't you working me too hard?

638
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,651
Still, I'll do everything
you ask me to.

639
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,194
You owe me chicken and beer.

640
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:04,027
St. Andrea village

641
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,873
Hey, Soohyun.

642
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,249
When will you be finished?

643
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,336
I think my meeting's going
to run late today.

644
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,382
I'll call you as soon as it's over.

645
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,175
Okay.

646
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:50,156
I think my meeting's going
to run late today.

647
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,563
I know
who you're with right now.

648
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,482
There was a tail today.

649
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,443
Things like this...

650
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,069
don't hurt at all.

651
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,782
Seeing as you thought I sent it,

652
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,992
it must've been very expensive.

653
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,870
What does this
have to do with the photo?

654
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,373
Words can be a scary thing.

655
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,875
It can get so inflated.

656
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,711
What...

657
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,838
are you doing here?
