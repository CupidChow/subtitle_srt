EUN SOOHYUN

5
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,933
Are you okay?

6
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,497
What's your name?

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,333
Yuri.

8
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,293
Han Yuri.

9
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,630
Let's go.

10
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,533
Eat slowly, okay?

11
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,869
Goodness.

12
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,749
Drink some water.

13
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,934
-Want to listen to music?
-Yes.

14
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,018
Okay.

15
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,522
-Ta-da!
-Wow.

16
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,446
I like you. I wish you were my sister.

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,906
I'll be your sister from now on.

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,872
She's here!

19
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,998
She's here.

20
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,755
What happened?

21
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,594
-Mom.
-Soohyun.

22
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,846
Yuri.

23
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,556
I...

24
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,393
got hired as a professor!

25
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:13,193
Great job! Congratulations!

26
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,112
You're incredible!

27
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,323
You're the best!

32
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,423
- Smile!
- Wait!

33
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,633
Yuri, come on.

34
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,218
- No, no. Wait.
- Come on!

35
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,303
Yuri, come on. Take the picture with us.

36
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,472
-Auntie, hurry!
-Put the camera up.

37
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,640
Okay, okay. Wait.

38
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,434
-Okay!
-Great. Come on!

39
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,728
-Yes.
-Let's do this.

40
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,939
Oh!

41
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,448
There!

42
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,951
- I bet it came out good!
- I'm sure it did!

43
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,917
Then? Shall I tell her
you're the woman in the photo?

44
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,835
Is that what you want?

45
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,450
EPISODE 9

46
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,496
What do you think you're doing?

47
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,130
Who do we have here?

48
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,841
Aren't you Soohyun's mom?

49
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,470
It's been so long! Don't you remember me?

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,265
It's me. I'm Yuri's mom.

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,728
You're no mother.
Yuri's my daughter!

52
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,232
-What?
-Giving birth doesn't make you a mom.

53
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,820
You were always hitting her.
You're shameless. How dare you come here?

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,114
How dare you hit my daughter?

55
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,327
If you come to her one more time
and cause a fuss,

56
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,162
I won't sit still.

57
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,762
Oh, my gosh.

58
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,306
That's so touching.

59
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,354
Poor you. What do we do about you?

60
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,898
Um,

61
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,611
Yuri, why did you do it?

62
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,413
You'll always be my daughter.

63
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,876
The apple...

64
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,878
doesn't fall far from the tree.

65
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,550
Goeun.

66
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,430
Be careful.

67
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,642
If you get stabbed in the back,
there's nothing...

68
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,937
you can do about it.

69
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,777
See you later, my daughter.

70
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,530
Yuri, goodness.

71
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,367
Are you hurt? Were you hurt?

72
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,137
Mom.

73
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,140
Mom.

74
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,103
Soohyun, I didn't know you were here.

75
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,981
Goodness. What's going on?

76
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,233
Mom.

77
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,069
Go home. I'll take care of things here.

78
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,656
-Still, after she calms down--
-I said...

79
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,702
-What?
-I'll take care of it.

80
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,788
Great job.

81
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,873
Great work!

82
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,875
-Great work.
-Thank you. You too.

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,752
-Great job.
-Great job.

84
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,381
I'M HERE

85
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,654
You'll always be my daughter.

86
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,615
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

87
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,368
-I wanted to get dinner with you--
-Send all the employees home.

88
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,205
I did.

89
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,008
Soohyun.

90
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,303
What's wrong?

91
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,725
Yuri.

92
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,769
Yes.

93
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,274
Yuri.

94
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,084
I know everything.

95
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,137
I can't...

96
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,683
forgive you.

97
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,526
How could you smile at me

98
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,946
and let Mom hold you,

99
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,783
as if nothing happened?

100
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,828
Soohyun...

101
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,206
Soohyun...

102
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,957
-I...
-Shut your mouth.

103
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,725
Don't just ask me for forgiveness.

104
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
Soohyun.

105
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
Wait.

106
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,531
Wait until I clear my head.

107
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,535
Keep your mouth shut until then.

108
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,761
Soohyun.

109
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,685
Soohyun?

110
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,701
Soohyun.

111
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,758
Let's wear these
and only go to good places now.

112
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:12,304
When I said I didn't know how I could meet
someone like you in my life,

113
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,432
I meant that.

114
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,361
Suho...

115
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,363
was seeing another woman.

116
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,033
Did he say that?

117
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,118
No.

118
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,496
Someone sent a picture of them to me.

119
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,710
Then...

120
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,589
you know who...

121
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,843
the other woman is.

122
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,147
To me,

123
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,066
you were like a gift.

124
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,360
That will continue

125
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,362
to be the case.

126
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,170
No, no.

127
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,693
Gunwoo.

128
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,956
Gunwoo.

129
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,460
What do I do now?

130
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,464
Gunwoo.

131
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,319
What happened? Did you meet?

132
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,487
Yes, but...

133
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,866
Soohyun knows everything.
She knows who the woman in the photo is.

134
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,360
- Come quick!
- Seonyul!

135
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,404
Hurry up!

136
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,909
What happened?

137
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,537
It's going according to plan.

138
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,622
Okay.

139
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,166
I bet you haven't eaten all day.

140
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,918
Here.

141
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,629
Wrap it like this.

142
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,006
Roll it up.

143
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,174
Open up.

144
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
Mmm.

145
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,764
- Okay. Here.
- It's good.

146
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,434
We're doing somaek today.

147
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,810
Today,

148
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,563
-we're all getting wasted.
-Okay!

149
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,814
Deal!

150
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,107
Cheers!

151
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,281
- Hey!
- Down the hatch.

152
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,075
Take it easy!

153
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,077
Ooh! One point?

154
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,373
Is that right?

155
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,292
Cheers!

156
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,502
Cheers!

157
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,708
I'm sorry.

158
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,253
I never wanted you to find out.

159
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,172
But on the other hand...

160
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,884
there were times

161
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,678
I wanted to tell you everything
and escape this hell.

162
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,598
However,

163
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,225
you were trying hard to start over.

164
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,730
I couldn't
bring myself to tell you.

165
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,113
You...

166
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,912
never should've come back to me.

167
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,874
I pushed you away.

168
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,044
I said
I didn't want this.

169
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,756
I told you to live your life!

170
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,262
Even if we were apart,

171
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,973
you two shouldn't have done that.

172
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,439
I lost my child
and was barely holding on in prison.

173
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,316
You shouldn't have done that to me.

174
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,362
You never should've come back...

175
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,616
...after doing such a thing!

176
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,333
Do you...

177
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,673
know what the hardest part for me is?

178
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,135
You two cheating?

179
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,679
No.

180
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,848
No matter how unfair it is

181
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,766
or how angry I am,

182
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,060
it's not worse than losing my baby.

183
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,521
For me,

184
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,067
the hardest thing to endure...

185
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,571
is not knowing it was you and her...

186
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,953
and that I wanted to live again
for both of you.

187
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,639
I won't ask...

188
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,351
for forgiveness.

189
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,899
I'm really sorry.

190
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,781
No.

191
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,869
It's too late.

192
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,705
You...

193
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,337
are no longer mine.

194
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,890
You ruined everything.

195
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,139
Yuri.

196
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,016
I know everything.

197
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,881
What about Soohyun?

198
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,800
Did you talk to her?

199
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,843
Do you want a drink?

200
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,233
What is it?

201
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,531
Do you know what this place means to me?

202
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,826
I asked Soohyun out here.

203
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,453
I said we'd be together forever.

204
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,872
That I'd protect her until death.

205
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,844
But, I...

206
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,351
...couldn't even protect my only child.

207
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,772
I'm a worthless man
who couldn't even protect his wife.

208
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,234
What did Soohyun say?

209
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,321
Suho.

210
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,158
She wants to break up.

211
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,626
She doesn't mean that.

212
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,128
You know her.

213
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,629
I do.

214
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,258
I know why she pushed me away
like that too.

215
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,846
That's why...

216
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,812
...it hurts so bad.

217
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,327
Suho.

218
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,497
-It's me.
-That took you long enough.

219
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,708
Will you start

220
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,253
-acting like a good daughter?
-Where did you get this photo?

221
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,676
Why do you want to know?

222
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,595
Where did you get it?

223
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,604
I'm hanging up.

224
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,522
I have an important guest.

225
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,117
What brings you here?

226
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,787
I never thought you'd come see me.

227
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,373
How did you know where Yuri works?

228
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,963
You had me there.

229
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,089
Oh!

230
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,800
Someone just told me.

231
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,888
He gave me a very interesting photo.

232
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,223
So?

233
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,225
Will you threaten her

234
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,102
with that pathetic photo?

235
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,022
Don't tell me.

236
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,359
You know what that photo is, don't you?

237
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,070
Don't ever come back if you understand.

238
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,448
You're someone who would sell
their children for money.

239
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,619
You can't get to me.

240
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,376
Don't you want to know
who gave me that photo?

241
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,061
Hello?

242
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,646
Where are you?

243
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,688
How is this place?

244
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,776
Not a lot of people know this place.

245
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,780
If you die here,

246
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,616
no one could find you.

247
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,207
I wanted to die here once before.

248
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,505
But you wrote something in your book.

249
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,885
"As long as you have one belief
to protect in your heart,

250
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,180
"you should...

251
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,142
"survive by any means."

252
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,362
My belief is...

253
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,408
"Death

254
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,744
will bring a bigger death."

255
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,583
Are you scared?

256
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,678
Dying is easy.

257
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,057
It's staying alive that's hard.

258
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,855
How do you think I've endured?

259
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,066
As Gunwoo's mother,

260
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,318
I have no remorse or shame.

261
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,739
I came all this way
with that thought in mind.

262
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,035
If anyone...

263
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,455
wants to shake me,

264
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,790
go ahead.

265
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,336
They can kill me,

266
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,133
but they can't kill my heart.

267
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,730
I'm grateful...

268
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,984
you said that.

269
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,100
You...

270
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,936
are no longer mine.

271
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,438
You ruined everything.

272
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,440
But...

273
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,692
you were caught by someone vicious.

274
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,695
Gwon Seonyul visited Soohyun
while she was in prison

275
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,656
while using volunteering as an excuse.

276
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,949
That punk

277
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,035
approached Soohyun on purpose since then.

278
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,301
Gwon Seonyul.

279
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,689
Did Kim Joon put you up to it?

280
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,694
What were you trying to do
with this measly old photo?

281
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,570
You lied an awful lot...

282
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,990
over that measly photo.

283
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,620
Do you know why I sent a faceless photo?

284
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,206
I can't have you ask for forgiveness
and end it that quicky.

285
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,332
So...

286
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,628
...this is your revenge?

287
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,133
This can't be the end of it.

288
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,345
She killed my father.

289
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,435
All right.

290
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,521
Why are you doing this now?

291
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,899
You did this when she finally
decided to start over.

292
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,985
What's your reason for that?

293
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,362
Hmm.

294
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,575
She's trying to be happy.

295
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,954
-What?
-She said it on TV.

296
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,332
She'll try to live a good life.

297
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,253
Do you have any idea...

298
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,757
how long I waited for this moment?

299
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,059
You bastard!

300
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,936
Who do you think you are
to say something like that?

301
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,689
You're just the son of the man
who killed my son!

302
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,693
If my wife hadn't done it,

303
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,654
I would've done it.

304
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,989
Do you know that?

305
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,492
That's why I'll do it too.

306
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,453
I'll do what your wife did.

307
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,194
Do it to me...

308
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,365
instead of Soohyun.

309
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,665
I'll quit the broadcasting company
if you want me to.

310
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,835
I'll give everything up
if that's what you want.

311
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,672
I'll do everything you ask.

312
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,093
The anger you have inside of you,

313
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,012
aim it towards me.

314
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,726
Don't mess with her anymore.

315
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,481
Please, I beg of you.

316
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,397
Mom, I'm here.

317
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,619
Mom.

318
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,205
Put these on

319
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,249
and let's go on a picnic.

320
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,461
Okay?

321
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,243
Compared to the tears you cried,

322
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,871
she still has a long way to go.

323
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,337
I'll make sure she pays.

324
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,948
Hello.

325
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,206
What did Kim Joon say?

326
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,587
He asked me to leave the country.

327
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,506
That he'd call me back after the election.

328
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,967
You were right, Suho.

329
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,887
If you go overseas,

330
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,555
he'll set you up and say...

331
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,768
you embezzled all the money
in the paper company.

332
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,604
Before he does that,

333
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,273
we have to bring Kim Joon down.

334
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,278
Don't be nervous. You can do it.

335
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,905
In the near future,

336
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,824
Kim Joon will make a guest appearance
on my segment.

337
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,494
That will be the day we do it.

338
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,620
Okay.

339
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,372
All right.

340
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,463
Purple represents
the party color.

341
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,882
It'll be nice to show off that tradition.

342
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,760
-Okay.
-Congressman.

343
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,179
What about the questions
about your competition?

344
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,182
- Take it out.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,893
I'll ask them to add questions
about the bill supporting

346
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,020
-single mothers and the youth policy.
-Okay.

347
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,531
Tell them not to change a single word.

348
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,615
Yes, sir.

349
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,452
Good. You may go.

350
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,883
Goodness. Were you waiting long?

351
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,595
Take a seat.

352
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,560
I've been so busy.

353
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,897
The election coming up
reminds me of your father.

354
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,025
He would've been
more involved than anyone.

355
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,654
You even came to visit my mother

356
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,281
during the heart disease event.

357
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,158
Thank you.

358
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,367
What are you saying?

359
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,371
I should take care of your mother
for your father's sake.

360
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,376
I heard you're making a guest appearance
on the news.

361
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,171
There's something you should know.

362
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,949
You should do your job properly!

363
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,472
Come in.

364
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,807
Ta-da!

365
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,141
Wow!

366
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,102
Is this where you work?

367
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,187
Yes.

368
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,940
You bought dinner, so coffee's on me.

369
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,651
- Sounds good.
- Wait here.

370
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,169
Bang!

371
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,637
Are you okay?

372
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,305
Yes.

373
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,979
Do you...

374
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,814
want to try that properly?

375
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,191
-Right now?
-Sure.

376
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,277
Yes.

377
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,362
Put that down, and follow me.

378
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,658
Now.

379
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,578
Grab it like this.

380
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,913
That's right.

381
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,333
Just like that.
Horizontally, at a right angle.

382
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,128
Put your strength into it,
and we'll go up on three.

383
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,212
Okay?

384
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,131
Now. One, two, three.

385
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,217
There you go. That's right.

386
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,720
But you have to put
a little more power into it.

387
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,724
Like this. Yes. One, two, three.

388
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,269
No, that's not it, no!

389
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,396
It's sticking out everywhere.

390
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,607
What will I do about this?

391
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,027
You are...

392
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,070
so bright.

393
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,197
Ah.

394
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,201
I should be since
I came back from the dead.

395
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,289
I got a heart transplant.

396
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,333
-Really?
-Yes.

397
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,382
That's right!

398
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,011
I heard anchor Kang Suho is your brother.

399
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,930
-Yes.
-Oh.

400
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,098
My caregiver said

401
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,225
Eun Soohyun came to our hospital room.

402
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,355
My sister-in-law said
she knew the patient.

403
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,483
- I guess you didn't know.
- No.

404
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,527
That's so interesting.
How do they know each other?

405
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,154
I'm a huge fan of hers.

406
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,950
I'll introduce you to her one day.

407
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,785
Sounds good!

408
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,829
Will it be as your girlfriend?

409
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,178
MY SISTER

410
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,483
Soohyun.

411
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,862
Let's meet.

412
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,444
Sit.

413
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,883
I was wrong.

414
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,018
I can't...

415
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,733
forgive myself either.

416
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,239
I won't give you an excuse.

417
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,910
If you hit me, I'll take it.

418
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,998
If you want me to leave, I'll go.

419
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,925
If you want me to die, I'll die.

420
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,971
Being able

421
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,808
to see you one more time like this...

422
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,103
is enough for me.

423
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,036
Han Yuri.

424
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,206
Look at me.

425
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,711
Lift your head.

426
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,052
I won't abandon you.

427
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,182
So don't be scared.

428
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,478
It's not because I adore you.

429
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,607
It's for my mother who thinks of you...

430
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,028
as a daughter.

431
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,204
I'm going to protect my mother.

432
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,373
So get it together.

433
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,020
Is she out of her mind?

434
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,856
She knows who the woman in the photo is
and she won't budge?

435
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,818
Then I'll just make her regret it.

436
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,237
How?

437
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,906
The person
she wants to protect the most.

438
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,617
There's one person left.

439
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,001
The number you have dialed...

440
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,712
Why won't she pick up?

441
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,864
What is the meaning of this?

442
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,117
What about my mom?

443
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,787
I don't know!

444
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,791
Look at this place.
The doors were all open. Where did she go?

445
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,835
Goodness.

446
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,062
Hello?

447
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,565
Hello?

448
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,359
Why...

449
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,779
...are you picking up?

450
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,863
Your mom...

451
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,574
is with me.

452
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,746
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

453
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,295
- Where's Oh Goeun?
- Soohyun!

454
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,509
-Where's my mom?
-This way.

455
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,930
Calm down.

456
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,391
We ran tests. Her CT was clean.

457
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,393
It's just a concussion.

458
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:23,273
Her vitals are stable now.

459
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,374
- Yes, stop.
- Show me the headline.

460
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,127
- If you look at this...
- Okay, check.

461
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,008
- Hello.
- Hello.

462
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,885
- Okay.
- Now, B1.

463
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,219
Raise it a little more.

464
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,143
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, that's good.

465
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,895
- Okay. Thank you.
- That's good.

466
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,481
Five minutes left!

467
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,340
I'm on my way.

468
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,108
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE KIM JOON

469
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,385
Mom...

470
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,513
Take care of her for me.

471
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,895
Soohyun...

472
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,102
MISSED CALL
EUN SOOHYUN

473
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,206
Don't be like that.

474
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,291
Don't call me that!

475
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,126
You're out of your mind.

476
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,881
I can overcome anything
as long as I have you.

477
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,509
I have to see this to the end.

478
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,594
Is he Gwon Jiwoong's son?

479
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,137
I have a plan.

480
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,974
Then, are you saying it was intentional?

481
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,309
Are the allegations of using

482
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,686
the Junseong Welfare Foundation
to create slush funds true?

483
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,605
What do you think you're doing?

484
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,107
Seonyul, your mom woke up!
