00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,203
PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
SETTINGS AND EVENTS

00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,997
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:14,365
<i>Call me if you feel upset</i>
<i>after reading this.</i>

5
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,960
<i>I feel the same.</i>
<i>Things like this don't hurt.</i>

6
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,553
<i>Don't get hurt anymore.</i>

7
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,514
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

8
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>I wanted to do</i>
<i>something for you.</i>

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,237
<i>I've only received from you.</i>

10
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,075
<i>Everything started</i>

11
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,536
<i>with the incident that summer.</i>

12
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,962
EPISODE 1

13
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,050


14
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,594
Let's go!

15
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,761


16
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,555


17
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,766
<i>That summer,</i>
<i>I was the first Korean</i>

18
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,518
<i>to receive the Rosaline Literary Award.</i>

19
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,395
-
Thank you so much.

20
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,563


21
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,315
I've attended many events,

22
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,901
but I've never seen such a large turnout

23
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,279
at a book signing event
for a writer who isn't a celebrity.

24
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,948
Please give Eun Soohyun,
the author of Love in Time

25
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,743
and the first Korean to win
the Rosaline Literary Award,

26
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,161
a round of applause.

27
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,176
Congratulations.

28
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,471
<i>After four miscarriages,</i>
<i>I held my miracle baby in my arms.</i>

29
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,599
<i>- I thought...</i>
<i>- </i>

30
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>I would never hope</i>

31
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,521
<i>for more happiness than this.</i>

32
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,775
- Yes, that's good.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,653
<i>I would never get greedy</i>
<i>for any kind of fortune.</i>

34
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,071
I'm a huge fan of yours.

35
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,407
<i>- </i><i>The joy of glory...</i>
- Smile.

36
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,370
<i>and emotional tears</i>
<i>would just be fleeting moments.</i>

37
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>The eternal relationships</i>

38
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,709
- <i>that would be with me forever...</i>
- Mom!

39
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,547
<i>- would be my family.</i>
<i>- </i>

40
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,926
Congrats on the award, Author Eun Soohyun!

41
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,177
Congrats, Mom!

42
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,429
- Thanks so much, baby!
<i>- </i>

43
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,056
Mom, hurry!

44
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,724
- Okay.
- Here.

45
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,105
It's all cooked. Here I come!

46
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,233
- I'm going to take it. Say cheese.
- Cheese!

47
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,319
One, two, three!

48
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,946
- Yay!
- It's cold!

49
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,407
It's war!

50
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,866
It's war!

51
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,952
Take that!

52
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,746
- I give up!
- We did it!

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,583
- We won!
- Help me!

54
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,102
Shut your eyes.

55
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,442
Now, open your eyes.

56
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,945
Congratulations.

57
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,030
Wow.

58
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,159
It's beautiful.

59
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,745
- Do you like it?
- Absolutely.

60
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,330
Try it on.

61
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,917
- Well?
- You look beautiful.

62
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,722
Is Gunwoo sleeping?

63
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,788
<i>I had thought</i>

64
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,501
<i>that day was so perfect that</i>

65
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,254
<i>not a single impure thought could seep in.</i>

66
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,342
- You're going alone?
- Yes, you can just go.

67
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,053
Why? Why can't I go?

68
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,932
Go and rest. Or go on a date.

69
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,018
What? I don't even have anyone
to go on a date with.

70
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,437
Besides, I like working more.

71
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,939
I'm coming with you.

72
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,023
What...

73
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,484
You had a hard time with the schedule too.

74
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,944
Still.

75
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,654
Listen to me, Ms. Manager.

76
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,115
Then...

77
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:35,037
Once you arrive, a Bilton Hotel employee
will meet you at 3:00, so rest until then.

78
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,917
There's a book donation event for patients
with incurable diseases at 5:00. No.

79
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,378
Just call me as soon as you get there.

80
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,838
Okay, Soohyun?

81
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,509
Is this what you call rest?

82
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,387
Don't answer your phone
or call me after I leave.

83
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,890
You're so stubborn.
I can never win against you.

84
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,309
Whatever. I got it, Professor Eun Soohyun.

85
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,187
Whatever.
Don't forget to take what's in the trunk.

86
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,690
- What is it?
- You said you're going to a wedding.

87
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,400
Wear it.

88
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,987
I can just wear anything.
Why would you waste your money?

89
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,656
Money spent on you isn't a waste.

90
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,743
Make sure you look pretty,
but don't outshine the bride.

91
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,038
What? Why?

92
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,541
How did I ever meet someone like you?

93
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,212
- I'm so lucky!
- Yes, you are.

94
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,755
I'm leaving.

95
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,923
Bye.

96
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,218
Be safe!

97
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,409
<i>Recently, there have been</i>
<i>drug-related cases...</i>

98
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,994
<i>What's with all these views?</i>

99
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,621
<i>He's Eun Soohyun's husband!</i>

100
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,748
<i>Is HMC a broadcasting station?</i>
<i>Never heard of them.</i>

101
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,583
<i>- Who watches this?</i>
<i>- My dog.</i>

102
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,668
<i>That's harsh.</i>

103
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,963
<i>- </i><i> This person was fired from ABS...</i>
<i>- </i><i>I saw him there.</i>

104
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,465
<i> Kang Suho.</i>
<i>Stop right there!</i>

105
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,260
It took me a year to get it to the desk!

106
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,928
- You know that.
I do.

107
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,181
You suddenly want me
to cover international competitions? Why?

108
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,017
This is what you call press suppression!

109
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,729
You want me to stay quiet
and not provoke Kim Joon, isn't that it?

110
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,649
This is for your benefit.

111
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,444
Do you think he became mayor by chance?
He's en route to become president.

112
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,405
He won't let anyone get in his way.

113
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,117
That's why we need to expose him!

114
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,868
Right?

115
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,668
Hey. Why are you all so quiet?
You call yourselves reporters?

116
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,964
You all wanted to take Kim Joon down.
I guess you're afraid of him.

117
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,301
Wasting tax-payers' precious money
on the Buyeongdong development.

118
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,344
Only trying to fill his pockets.

119
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,848
Things like this... Isn't it our job
to expose dirty deeds like this?

120
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,976
That's enough.
You could lose everything over this.

121
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,187
We'll reject any interference or pressure,

122
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,732
internal or external,
from individuals or groups,

123
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,736
including power and financial influences,
that threaten the freedom of press!

124
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,906
You said reporters should be the ears
of the people.

125
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,493
You used to shout and live by
the journalist's code yourself.

126
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,412
- You're not qualified anymore.
- What?

127
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
Are you done?

128
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll save you the trouble.

129
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,918
I quit.

130
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,463
Hey, Kang Suho!

131
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,133
PROFESSOR EUN SOOHYUN'S FAN SIGNING EVENT

132
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,803
Please give Eun Soohyun,
a round of applause.

133
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,474


134
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,773
- Dad!
- Yes?

135
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,568
My son.

136
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,322
Wow, it's Mom! It's my mom!

137
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,700
Isn't your mom so cool and pretty?

138
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,370
Yes, I want to see you too, Dad.

139
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,788
Me?

140
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,415
Mine's boring.

141
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,919
I want to see you too!

142
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,921
Okay. Wait for a second.

143
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,005
Shall we see this?

144
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,257
Wow, it's you!

145
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,634
It's my dad!

146
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,010
You're so cool.

147
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,891
- Do you like me that much?
- Yes, you're the best! The best!

148
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,895
Gunwoo's the best to me. The best.

149
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,773
Hmm?

150
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,900
- Wait.
- Huh?

151
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,402
What is it?

152
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,529
Come here.

153
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,991
Hmm?

154
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,664
MY HUBBY

155
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,295
- Hey, honey.
- Babe.

156
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,297
You're not on the plane yet, are you?

157
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,092
Not yet. Why?

158
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,553
I can't find Gunwoo's fever medicine.

159
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,140
- Does he have a fever?
- His head felt warm.

160
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,809
So I took his temperature
and he has a slight fever.

161
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,895
But his temperature keeps going up.

162
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,650
Do you remember when we didn't do anything
because it was just a mild fever

163
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,861
and we ended up taking him to the ER?

164
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,945
Yes...

165
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,490
Open the bottom drawer in the kitchen.

166
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,367
- His medicine is there.
- Wait.

167
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,581
Yes, I found it.

168
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,333
Today's Sunday,

169
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,420
- so the hospitals are closed.
- I'll give him some medicine first.

170
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,172
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

171
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,842
Yes, call me when you get there. Okay?

172
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,097
<i>How's Gunwoo's fever?</i>

173
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,779
SOOHYUN

174
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,743
- Welcome.
- Can we order?

175
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,827
Coming!

176
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,750
- Here you go.
- Some more side dishes, please.

177
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,834
Sure.

178
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,920
- Check please.
- Okay.

179
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,798
- More side dishes for table seven.
- Okay.

180
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,846
- Soohyun?
- Don't answer your phone.

181
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,944
<i>But his temperature keeps going up.</i>

182
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,622
I'm so sorry, Director.

183
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,792
You set everything up for me,
but I'm so worried about my son.

184
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,293
Yes, okay.

185
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,713
Take me to Seokgwandong.

186
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,804
How is it going?

187
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,014
Well, we have him.

188
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,684
Everyone's been so much help.

189
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
That's good.

190
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,563
We're progressing well
thanks to you, Congressman.

191
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,314
What is it?

192
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,317
I'm busy right now.
Let's talk later if it's not urgent...

193
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,821
Okay.

194
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,698
I'm leaving right now.

195
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,300
There you go.

196
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,094
Hold your balance. Slowly.

197
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,972
Go slow.

198
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,476
- Hello!
- Hi, Heejae.

199
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,776
Heejae, shall we try turning now?

200
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,282
There you go.

201
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,912
Happy, go and fetch.

202
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,581
Gunwoo!

203
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,250
Mom!

204
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:24,173
I heard you had a fever.
I was worried, so I came right back.

205
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes, dad touched my head
earlier like this.

206
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,386
But it doesn't hurt anymore.

207
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,056
I took my medicine all at once.

208
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,223
Let me see.

209
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
You're right.

210
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,063
You don't even like taking medicine!

211
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,357
Yes, but if I'm sick,

212
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,194
we can't have your birthday party.
We can't go on picnics either.

213
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,655
- Is that why you took it?
- Yes!

214
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,033
Will we be able to go on a picnic
in two days?

215
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,661
- Of course.
- I'm so excited!

216
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,498
Mom, take a picture with this.

217
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,710
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to sing you a song

218
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,504
for your birthday present.

219
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,385
Here.

220
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,013
- What?
- You can't see it now.

221
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,141
- Even if I do this?
- No way!

222
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,018
Go inside.

223
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,354
You can't!

224
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,730
Okay.

225
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,150
You're so cute.

226
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,406
Don't stay out for too long. Okay?

227
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,833
Where are you?

228
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,377
I'm in the kitchen.

229
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,212
What are you doing here?

230
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,755
Didn't you get on the plane?

231
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,300
No. I was worried about Gunwoo's fever.

232
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,054
It was just momentary.
He got better after he took his medicine.

233
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,432
I shouldn't have called you.

234
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,891
Yes, I guess so.

235
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,686
You should've picked up.

236
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,771
You called? I didn't get a call.

237
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,107
Wait.

238
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,362
Things were so hectic because of Gunwoo.

239
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,533
My gosh. What about you?
Is it okay if you don't go?

240
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,745
- You said it was important.
- My son's sick, so they understood.

241
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,872
What a relief.

242
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,127
Are you glad I'm back?

243
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,590
Can I tell you the truth?

244
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,841
Hmm.

245
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,137
It feels like I got an unexpected gift.

246
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,808
Have you seen a gift this beautiful?

247
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,645
Every day when I open my eyes.

248
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,523
Goodness.

249
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,858
By the way, Suho?

250
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,569
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

251
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,737
What is it?

252
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,114
- It's nothing.
- Let me see it.

253
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,407
It's nothing.

254
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,713
Since when?

255
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,468
Well... back then. Ever since I quit ABS.

256
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,973
Don't worry. I mean it.
It's gotten much better.

257
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,027
I'm sorry.
You've been taking it for so long.

258
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,655
How could I not have known that?

259
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,159
- I'm so embarrassed.
- What are you saying?

260
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,578
I'm more embarrassed and ashamed.

261
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,206
I only wanted to show you my best side.

262
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,125
But things won't go my way.

263
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,918
I feel so pathetic.

264
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,927
- Suho.
- Yes?

265
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,096
It's okay.

266
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,015
You were right.

267
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,562
I respect the decision you made back then.

268
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,066
You were more righteous
than any other journalist.

269
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,575
Thanks.

270
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,498
Thank you.

271
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,298
Why is the dog barking?

272
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,145
Gunwoo?

273
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,190
Let's go inside.

274
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,276
Kang Gunwoo?

275
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,695
Hmm?

276
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,906
Gunwoo?

277
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,993
Gunwoo?

278
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,040
Honey, what's wrong?

279
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,760
Honey?

280
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,844
Honey!

281
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,057
Honey!

282
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,813
Honey?

283
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,942
- Gunwoo!
- Honey?

284
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,610
- Gunwoo?
- What?

285
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,861
Where's Gunwoo?

286
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,656
He's not here.

287
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,865
What?

288
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,078
I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
Wait here. I'll find him.

289
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,537
Gunwoo!

290
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,415
- Gunwoo?
- Gunwoo!

291
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,586
Gunwoo!

292
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,922
Gunwoo!

293
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,467
Gunwoo!

294
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,888
- Ouch!
- Sorry about that. I'm sorry.

295
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
Gunwoo!

296
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,728
Gunwoo!

297
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,566
Gunwoo!

298
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,901
Gunwoo!

299
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,492
Gunwoo!

300
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,370
Can I help you?

301
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,622
Oh, actually...

302
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,458
I was just looking for my son.

303
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,670
He's wearing yellow shorts. He's six.

304
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,171
- Did you see him?
- No, sorry.

305
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,674
Gunwoo?

306
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,261
Gunwoo...

307
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,900
Gunwoo!

308
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,296
Gunwoo?

309
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,299
Gunwoo!

310
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,426
Gunwoo!

311
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,347
Gunwoo!

312
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,187
- Gunwoo?
- Gunwoo!

313
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,730
Honey.

314
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,151
I can't find him.
I went to the main road. He's not there.

315
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,737
I'll go over there.

316
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,656
Gunwoo!

317
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
Gunwoo.

318
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
Gunwoo.

319
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,370
Gunwoo!

320
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,331
Gunwoo!

321
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,961
Gunwoo...

322
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,839
Gunwoo?

323
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,346
Suho.

324
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,723
Did you find him?

325
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,523
Why haven't the police called yet?

326
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,872
Hey, excuse me?

327
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:40,544
My son came here often to buy snacks.

328
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,337
By chance, did you see him today?

329
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,339
- No, not today.
- He's just...

330
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,258
He's not even in elementary school yet.

331
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,009
He's about this tall.

332
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,511
No, I haven't.

333
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,060
Gunwoo!

334
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,488
- That poor child.
- No pictures, please.

335
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
Whose child is this?

336
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,284
- My goodness!
- Step back.

337
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,579
- That poor kid.
- Please don't push.

338
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,206
Where's the mother?

339
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,711
Goodness.

340
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,755
- He's hurt badly.
- Please, step back.

341
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,968
Step back.

342
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,096
My gosh.

343
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,516
- This is so bad. Goodness.
- Look at all that blood.

344
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,106
No, no...

345
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,610
No! No!

346
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,779
No!

I'm right here.

351
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,952
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.

352

- You scared me!

356
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,317
You startled me!

357
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,069
Why did you make so much?

358
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,571
It's Soohyun's birthday.

359
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,948
I wrapped this too, so take it with you.

360
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,993
I told you to not to make so much.
You have bad wrists.

361
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,661
Why would I do that?

362
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,246
It's for my babies.

363
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,874
You don't think about
how sad we'll be later, do you?

364
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,292
What?

365
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,377
After you're gone,

366
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,547
seeing large amounts of food like this
will make us cry.

367
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,550
Silly. Why would you cry?

368
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,471
I'm going to live
right by your sides forever.

369
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,765
That's what I'll do.

370
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,266
Okay!

371
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,393
- Take it over there?
- Yes.

372
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,104
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Okay. I'm getting a call.

373
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,567
My phone.

374
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,903
Soohyun!

375
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,739
I'm at mom's restaurant.

376
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,449
Did you land safely...

377
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,411
Soohyun?

378
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,538
Did something happen?

379
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,197
Sit down. You'll pass out like this.

380
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,785
It's all my fault.

381
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,373
If only I had closed the gate
when I came in.

382
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,418
Gunwoo...

383
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,129
If only I hadn't left him alone.

384
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,801
Someone else is at fault here.
Why would you blame yourself?

385
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,723
You didn't do anything wrong.

386
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,141
Okay?

387
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,854
Soohyun.

388
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,357
What do we do?

389
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,244
Why are you all crying?

390
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,164
Mom.

391
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,957
Mom, don't cry.

392
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,500
Come on.

393
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,669
- Mom.
- Goodness.

394
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,671
Gunwoo will make it through this.

395
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,965
Don't cry.

396
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,219
- Kang Gunwoo's guardian?
- Yes, Doctor?

397
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,972
How is he?

398
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,018
Your son is in critical condition.

399
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,980
You need to prepare yourself
for the worst.

400
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,858
Mom! Mom!

401
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,736
Ah...

402
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,907
Doctor, please! Save our son.

403
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,660
- Please, save him. Please.
- If he got to the hospital sooner...

404
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,663
I'm very sorry.

405
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,462
What do we do?

406
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,682
Gunwoo...

407
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:34,082
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

408
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,713
WAITING ROOM

409
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,636
Soohyun.

410
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,361
Why are you sitting here like this?

411
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,949
Mom.

412
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,535
The doctor...

413
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,663
told me...

414
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,584
to prepare for the worst.

415
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,547
But what am I supposed to prepare for?

416
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,383
Mom.

417
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,137
What can I do?

418
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,433
How can I give up on my child?

419
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,563
No, no. This is wrong.

420
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,357
I can't say goodbye to him like this.

421
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,277
I'll find another hospital

422
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,988
that can save Gunwoo.

423
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,823
Don't do this.

424
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,661
It'll only get harder for Gunwoo
if you act like this.

425
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,546
Let's...

426
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,425
say goodbye to Gunwoo.

427
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,599
Why are you being like this, Mom?

428
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,100
Mom?

429
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,394
Our Gunwoo...

430
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,107
can't go to sleep at night without me.
He can't even go to the bathroom.

431
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,611
How can I let him go?

432
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,156
- How? Where will he go?
- That's your greed.

433
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,078
Did you see him?

434
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,373
His entire body is covered in needles.

435
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,877
That small child can't speak
or open his eyes.

436
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,798
He's in pain but holding it in...

437
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,220
so that you can
say goodbye.

438
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,276
Don't make him suffer anymore.

439
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,739
No more.

440
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,075
Say goodbye.

441
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,711
Mom.

442
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,787
<i>Yes.</i>

443
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,290
You're so cute.

444
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,709
Huh?

445
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,211
My goodness!

446
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,507
<i>Gunwoo, you're the best!</i>

447
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,893
You stood up!

448
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,061
You stood on your own!

449
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,645
You're the best in the world!

450
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,192
<i>Great job, son!</i>

451
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,863
Yes, it's alright.

452
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,958
- One, two.
- Aah!

453
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,963
- You said you'd pull it after three.
- <i>I'm sorry. Did it hurt?</i>

454
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,550
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you </i>♪

455
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,679

456
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,350

457
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,784
Nurse?

458
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,017
All done.

459
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,192
Gunwoo?

460
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,072
Let's go home now.

461
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,160
Let's take out all these painful needles.

462
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,621
Let's go home.

463
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,541
We're supposed to go on a picnic.

464
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,889
It's too cold here.

465
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,474
My baby.

466
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,893
You get cold so easily.

467
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,877
Gunwoo!

468
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,754
Gunwoo!

469
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,368
<i>That tickles!</i>

470
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,619
This is nice.

471
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,788
I love that you smell like sweet powder.

472
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,957
I like your scent too.

473
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,543
Really? What do I smell like?

474
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,171
You smell pretty.

475
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,090
Also, like stars.

476
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,345
<i>Do you like stars</i>
<i>that much, Gunwoo?</i>

477
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,639
Yes, I'm going to be a star
when I grow up.

478
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,809
- Why?
- So I can shine.

479
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,978
I don't like that.

480
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,313
Why not?

481
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,108
It would be so sad
with me here and you all the way there.

482
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,905
Don't worry. I'll fly you up there.

483
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,531
Really?

484
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,742
Then will I fly in the sky with you?

485
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,037
Yes! I'll hold your hand.

486
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,831
- Like this?
- Like this.

487
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,918
You can't let go. Never!

488
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,630
<i>Okay, I'll never let go.</i>

489
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,756
<i>Never.</i>

490
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:55,017
Here lies the late Kang Gunwoo.

491
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,062
Gunwoo, you poor thing.

492
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,696
Gunwoo!

493
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,582
Gunwoo.

494
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,968
Honey.

495
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,221
Honey, let's say goodbye to Gunwoo. Okay?

496
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,776
Gunwoo, you poor thing.

497
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,711
- Gunwoo!
- Our poor baby.

498
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,238
GUNWOO

499
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,777
My poor child...

500
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,927
<i>Eun Soohyun, the first Korean to receive</i>
<i>the Rosaline Literary Award, lost her son</i>

501
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,180
<i>- in a car accident...</i>
<i>- </i><i>The child</i>

502
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,848
<i>who died in a school zone turned out</i>

503
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,143
<i>- to be Professor Eun Soohyun's son.</i>
<i>- </i><i>The assailant</i>

504
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,021
<i>put the victim in his car, fled,</i>
<i>and later abandoned him,</i>

505
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,856
- <i>missing his golden hour...</i>
I'm sorry.

506
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,232
<i>which led to his death.</i>

507
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,778
<i> Enforce harsher punishments</i>
<i>for child-related accidents.</i>

508
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,655
<i>Enforce it!</i>

509
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,615
<i>Gunwoo can't be found</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

510
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,035
- Enforce it!
- <i>But the media</i>

511
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,579
<i>is filled with Gunwoo.</i>

512
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,998
- Enforce it!
- Enforce it!

513
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,709
Enforce harsher punishments
for child-related accidents.

514
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,045
<i>Still, there was</i>
<i>one reason to survive...</i>

515
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,756
Enforce harsher punishments
for child-related accidents.

516
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,466
<i>and endure this.</i>

517
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,010
The murderer should repent!

518
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,638
- Repent! Repent!
- The murderer should repent!

519
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,973
<i>Prosecutor, question the witness.</i>

520
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,435
What state was the patient in
when he was transferred?

521
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:53,107
His CT results showed he had bleeding
in his brain and some time had passed.

522
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,027
His brain was very swollen
and he needed emergency surgery.

523
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,781
If the patient had been taken
to the hospital right after the accident,

524
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,158
would there have been a different outcome?

525
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:07,329
A cerebral hemorrhage is critical
and requires immediate attention.

526
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,540
If he had arrived without delay,

527
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,001
he would've had a good chance to live.

528
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,672
If the defendant hadn't
abandoned the child after the hit-and-run,

529
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,174
- the child could've been saved.
- Objection.

530
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,969
The defendant
put the child in the car

531
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,346
to bring him to the hospital
as soon as possible.

532
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,265
But the child stopped breathing,

533
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,851
and the defendant made a mistake
out of extreme fear.

534
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,478
<i>Please take into consideration</i>
<i>that the defendant</i>

535
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,647
<i>turned himself in</i>
<i>after realizing his wrongdoings.</i>

536
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,069
Your Honor.

537
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,488
To confirm the facts
from the day of the accident,

538
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,324
I'd like to request the victim's mother,

539
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,369
Eun Soohyun,
to take the witness stand today.

540
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,249
Ms. Eun Soohyun, do you accept?

541
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,962
Yes.

542
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,808
I solemnly,

543
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,479
sincerely and truly declare and affirm

544
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,147
that I will tell the truth,

545
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,359
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

546
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,284
The victim had a fever that day,
is that correct?

547
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,123
- Yes.
- But you still went on your business trip.

548
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,001
He was fine before my trip.

549
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,629
I see.
On the day of the victim's accident,

550
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,088
where were you?

551
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,340
I was at home.

552
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,550
- And the victim?
- He was in the garden.

553
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:47,930
So you left a child with a fever
alone outside?

554
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:51,475
He wanted to do something alone,
so I was waiting for him.

555
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,977
- It wasn't neglect.
- Then...

556
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:59,107
- how does the child normally go outside?
- I open the door for him.

557
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,860
Were you the last person
to come home that day?

558
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,239
- Yes.
- As you went inside,

559
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,282
are you sure you closed the door?

560
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,664
Take me to Seokgwandong.

561
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,417
- Hello!
- Hi, Heejae.

562
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,556
Answer the question.

563
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,685
I don't...

564
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,273
remember.

565
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,068
So you had no idea
that your son left the garden.

566
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,531
You were his mother, but you were at home
and left your sick child outside.

567
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,158
The fact that a mother's
misguided confidence

568
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,203
that her child
would never do something impulsive

569
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,373
was the starting point of this accident.

570
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,667
- It's quite unfortunate.
- Objection!

571
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,545
The defense attorney's question
is unrelated to this case.

572
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,797
He's forcing the victim's mother
to answer.

573
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,382
Sustained.

574
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,468
Counsel,
refrain from making incendiary remarks.

575
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,178
Continue to question the witness.

576
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,638
That's all.

577
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,687
Prosecutor, you may cross-examine.

578
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,629
<i>I was a sinner.</i>

579
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,506
<i>I couldn't protect my child.</i>

580
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,093
I want to register a birth.

581
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,597
- Please fill it out.
- <i>I fell apart more and more.</i>

582
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,270
DEATH DECLARATION

583
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,277
KANG

584
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,868
<i>It was...</i>

585
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,496
<i>the same for him too.</i>

586
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,424
<i>When I opened my eyes, I was back in hell.</i>

587
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,270
<i>I prayed every single day.</i>

588
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,109
<i>I prayed time would take me to death.</i>

589
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,156
GRANDMA'S STOVE

590
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,620
FINAL TRIAL

591
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:26,291
I will deliver the verdict
for case 2015-1426.

592
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,711
Due to the lack of evidence
to the charges of violating

593
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,714
the Road Traffic Act
and the Act on Special Cases Concerning

594
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,760
the Settlement of Traffic Accidents,
the defendant is found not guilty.

595
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,514
- Not guilty?
- What are you saying?

596
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,932
Silence!

597
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,726
Combining various evidence,
including witness statements,

598
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:49,981
the defendant's charges are admitted
to violations related to a hit-and-run

599
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,484
and the Act on Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Crimes.

600
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,321
In terms of sentencing,
it cannot be taken lightly,

601
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,406
especially given that the victim died
in this case.

602
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,868
However, the defendant confessed
to his crimes and expressed remorse.

603
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,913
The defendant was shocked
due to the gravity of the situation,

604
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,415
and the fact that this was
an accidental crime

605
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,377
were all taken into consideration.
As a result,

606
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,921
the defendant will be sentenced
to two years and six months.

607
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,090
However,

608
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:20,011
the sentence will be suspended
for four years from the final hearing.

609
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,140
No way.

610
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,560
Does that make sense?

611
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,228
You killed a six-year-old boy!

612
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,231
Not guilty? Suspend his sentence?
Does that make sense?

613
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,941
You call that a verdict?

614
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,026
My son died because of you...

615
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,778
Bring my son back, you bastard!

616
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,447
- Calm down!
- Bring my son back, you bastard!

617
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,324
Let go of me!

618
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,243
- I'm very sorry!
- You...

619
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,788
I'll repent up until my dying day.

620
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,209
I'm very sorry!

621
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,880
- I'll repent!
- Shut your mouth, you bastard!

622
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,465
- I'm very sorry!
- That's enough. Calm down!

623
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,676
I'm sorry!

624
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,512
Let go of me!

625
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,348
Let go!

626
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,562
HANSANG
SEOUL, MAHO-GU, YEONNA-DONG 34-9

627
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,892
Yes, it's me, Congressman.

628
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,272
As you said, my sentence was suspended.

629
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,940
Thank you.

630
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,567
No need to thank me.

631
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,779
We're going out to sea together.

632
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,490
The captain should take care of the people
on his boat.

633
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,744
It's fine. Forget it.

634
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,913
Okay.

635
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,044
<i>Currently,</i>

636
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,630
<i>suspicions are pouring into the media</i>
<i>over this case.</i>

637
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,341
<i>I believe the result from today</i>
<i>can be an answer...</i>

638
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,592
Ma'am?

639
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,470
<i>I'd like to pay</i>
<i>the deepest condolences</i>

640
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,139
<i>to the deceased and the family.</i>

641
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,348
I'll see you next time.

642
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,933
Come again.

643
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,234
Let's go.

644
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,584
Hey, honey.

645
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,006
No, I'm near the house.
I'll be there soon.

646
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,175
Okay.

647
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,552
I told you.

648
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,596
Nothing would happen.

649
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,060
It's a good day. Why would you bring up
that dead kid?

650
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,270
Do I have time to care about that kid?

651
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,897
Don't say ridiculous things.

652
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,324
What brings you here?

653
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,370
Are you here to see me?

654
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,753
Apologize.

655
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,507
Just earlier today...

656
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,511
I was punished for my crimes in court.

657
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,845
No.

658
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,809
Apologize to my son.

659
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,730
When I think about it,

660
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:45,568
you didn't apologize to him at all.

661
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,822
You almost had me there.

662
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,699
Okay. Deal.

663
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,164
But...

664
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,166
how much?

665
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,088
Just so you know,
I'm not responsible for this anymore.

666
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,632
But I'd like to offer some
to show my sense of duty.

667
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,844
You're lucky to have met someone like me.

668
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,429
Here you go.

669
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,726
Take it.

670
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,814
Once you're ready,

671
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,941
you can call me.

672
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:31,614
You scared me.
What do you think you're doing right now?

673
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,659
Apologize.

674
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,954
You ruined my child's life.

675
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,957
So apologize properly!

676
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,380
Look here, lady. That's enough.

677
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,591
I won't be considerate anymore.

678
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,760
Apologize!

679
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,512
What the hell? Seriously?

680
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,811
Damn it.

681
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,570
Mister...

682
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,654
Mister!

683
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,948
No, sir!

684
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,577
Please! Please, apologize.

685
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,246
Please, apologize to him.

686
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,332
You know this isn't right.

687
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,877
My son is dead
and no longer in this world.

688
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:30,507
You can't go on living
as if nothing happened!

689
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,344
Then what about my poor boy?

690
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,804
- Mister!
- God...

691
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,308
Hey, do you know how many businesses
I'm involved in right now?

692
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,520
Do you know how many deals I've lost
because of your kid?

693
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,522
He could've died anywhere else!

694
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,565
Why did he have to get hit by my car?

695
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,221
Hey.

696
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,724
Let's not make a big fuss over this.

697
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,770
What's done is done.
Shouldn't the living continue to live?

698
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,605
Don't you think so?

699
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,859
You can call me.

700
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,322
Damn it.

701
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,940
<i>If I believed that my answer</i>

702
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,110
<i>would be to someone</i>
<i>who would ever return to earth,</i>

703
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,950
<i>this flame would move no more.</i>

704
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,088
<i>But because no one</i>

705
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:38,426
<i>has ever returned alive from this gulf,</i>
<i>if what I hear is true,</i>

706
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,765
<i>I can reply</i>

707
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,227
<i>with no fear or infamy.</i>

708
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,919
<i>This...</i>

709
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,923
<i>is... my answer.</i>

710
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,295
<i> I think...</i>

711
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,217
<i>what happened was wrong.</i>

712
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,097
<i>What would happen</i>
<i>if Eun Soohyun saw this?</i>

713
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,682
<i>Could she endure it?</i>

714
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,559
<i>I'm a murderer.</i>

715
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,812
<i>I never wanted</i>
<i>to know the person.</i>

716
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,898
<i> Can you help him</i>
<i>put that great pain...</i>

717
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,192
