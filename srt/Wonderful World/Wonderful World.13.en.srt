00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,577
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,287
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,955
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,916
ON THE DAY OF GUNWOO'S ACCIDENT
SUMMER 2015

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,002
I met so many great people thanks to you.

6
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,545
Yes.

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,380
My expectations are high.

8
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,923
How are things these days?

9
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,343
We have this friend here.

10
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,305
Everyone's been helping out.

11
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,308
Things are going great,
thanks to the congressman.

12
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,434
What is it?

13
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,811
Where are you?

14
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,023
I'm busy right now.
Let's talk later if it's not urgent...

15
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,943
Seonyul's in the ICU right now.

16
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,696
Get over here.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,865
They said it's bad.

18
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,534
Okay.

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,244
I'm leaving right now.

20
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,211
Hey, Hyegeum. It's me.

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,755
I'm almost there.

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,509
I can stay for a moment.

23
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,885
Okay.

24
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,354
HANKUK UNITED PARTY AIDE CHOI JAEHYEOK

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,446
What?

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,991
What was that?

27
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,006
Damn it...

28
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,308
Honey.

29
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,772
What happened?

30
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,858
They can't delay
the transplant.

31
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,653
He can't hold on.

32
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,539
Honey.

33
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,419
Save Seonyul.

34
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,048
Please, our son...

35
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,179
CONGRESSMAN KIM JOON

36
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,022
Yes, Congressman?

37
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,816
Jiwoong, come quick.

38
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,905
Excuse me, Congressman...

39
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,201
I can't right now...

40
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,536
I hit a kid.

41
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,581
What?

42
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,817
What do you mean by you hit a kid?

43
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,819
Mommy...

44
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,160
Shouldn't you take him to the hospital?

45
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,579
Jiwoong.

46
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,665
Did you forget we were drinking?

47
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,090
The kid...

48
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,010
saw my face.

49
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,431
What do I do about this?

50
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,099
What?

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,477
I'm so close to the Blue House...

52
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,106
Do I have to stop in my tracks
just because I stepped on a little bug?

53
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
Or shall we make sure it's dead...

54
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,695
and keep going?

55
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,114
Well?

56
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,826
Mommy...

57
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,672
Congressman.

58
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,425
This accident...

59
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,136
was caused by me.

60
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,557
Jiwoong,

61
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,934
will you do that for me?

62
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,978
In return,

63
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,146
you have to save...

64
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,815
my son, Seonyul.

65
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,202
Clean it up and make sure
there are no loose ends.

66
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,412
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,319
Honey. Save Seonyul.

68
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,489
Please, our son...

69
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,193
Mommy...

70
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,528
EPISODE 13

71
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm so close to the Blue House...

72
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,330
Do I have to stop in my tracks
just because I stepped on a little bug?

73
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,958
Or shall we make sure it's dead...

74
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,544
and keep going?

75
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,629
Mommy...

76
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,966
In return,

77
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,634
you have to save

78
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,762
my son, Seonyul.

79
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,892
Clean it up and make sure
there are no loose ends.

80
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,565
...you have to save

81
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,276
my son, Seonyul.

82
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,112
I also feel bad for her.

83
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,072
Don't hate her.

84
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,094
Seonyul!

85
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,556
Are you okay?

86
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,894
What happened?

87
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,855
You got a transplant.

88
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,067
You're okay now.

89
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,528
- How?
- What?

90
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,031
Well...

91
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,867
It just happened.

92
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,622
The surgery was a success, Seonyul.

93
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,375
The number you have dialed...

94
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,294
MY SISTER

95
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,138
Mom? Mom!

96
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,852
Where were you? Soohyun wouldn't pick up.

97
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,397
Why would you call Soohyun?

98
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,775
It was nothing. Don't worry about it.

99
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,110
You take the dishes I made, and just go!

100
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,240
Don't say a word to Soohyun.

101
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,457
Soohyun, Mom just...

102
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,721
That's Pisces.

103
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,225
It represents the mom and son...

104
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,602
holding on to each other,
not wanting to let go.

105
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,021
I'm so jealous.

106
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,108
At least they're together.

107
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,245
I'm so close to the Blue House...

108
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,456
Do I have to stop in my tracks
just because I stepped on a little bug?

109
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,459
Or shall we make sure it's dead
and keep going?

110
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,130
This accident was caused by me.

111
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,173
In return,

112
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,675
you have to save

113
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,678
my son, Seonyul.

114
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,474
Clean it up and make sure
there are no loose ends.

115
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,482
Hello, everyone.

116
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,993
- You know Kang Suho, right?
- Of course.

117
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,370
The righteous reporter
and the people's husband.

118
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,539
He's the face of ABS.

119
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,916
Nice to meet you.

120
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,005
See you again.

121
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,972
By the way,
is Eun Soohyun doing well?

122
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,099
Yes, thanks to you.

123
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,895
Back in the old days, Prince Yeonsan...

124
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,024
hung a sign around the neck
of eunuch officials.

125
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,069
Do you know what it said?

126
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,157
"The mouth is the door to anger.

127
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,327
"The tongue is a sword that can slay."

128
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,829
Since early times,

129
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,415
it was important to be tight-lipped.

130
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,002
But...

131
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,880
what does that have to do with my wife?

132
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,720
Director, aren't you a devoted husband?

133
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,058
Keep your wife in check.

134
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:53,895
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

135
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,321
LAW OFFICE OF PARK JOOSUNG

136
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,170
How can I help you?

137
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,631
I'd like to file a report...

138
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,218
on Kang Gunwoo's case from 2015.

139
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,181
Kim Joon as the new perpetrator.

140
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,158
SOOHYUN, CALL ME BACK
YOU WON'T PICK UP

141
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,368
I'm fine.

142
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,624
Hyegeum saw it that day.
She saw him with a tablet.

143
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,772
While the police are seeking
an arrest warrant for Park,

144
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,025
they'll determine his involvement
in the voice phishing crime.

145
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,027
I'm Baek Jiwon from ABS News.

146
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,446
There is a lot of interest
at home and abroad

147
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,365
for presidential candidate Kim Joon.

148
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,536
On the International Day of Peace,

149
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,038
the foreign media have published
an article saying

150
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,416
Kim Joon is the future leader of Asia.

151
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,711
With the election,
Kim Joon expresses confidence in meeting

152
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,297
the high expectations placed upon him.

153
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,717
Yes, someone like him
should become the president.

154
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,179
- That's ridiculous.
- What do you know about politics?

155
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,306
Bastard.

156
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,312
Hey. Did you say that to me?

157
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,656
What, scumbag?

158
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,825
What's with him?

159
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,452
- Stop it.
- Move.

160
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,953
Hey, come here.

161
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,080
- Don't do it.
- Stop it.

162
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,291
Don't!

163
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,722
Goodness! Stop!

164
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,807
Stop it! You'll kill him!

165
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,225
Call the cops.

166
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,561
You can't get arrested again!
Stop it!

167
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,979
Hello?

168
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,233
Let's stop now.

169
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,776
You little punk.

170
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,321
Don't drink if you can't handle it.

171
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:32,197
The test results indicate it was dementia
caused by Alzheimer's.

172
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,408
You've been experiencing
headaches recently.

173
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,785
You're taking more naps.

174
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,205
You said you got lost
on your way home, right?

175
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,750
It seems like it started about a year ago.

176
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,296
By chance,

177
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,508
will it progress faster?

178
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:55,220
Well, we'll try to slow it down
with medicine.

179
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,107
What do I do about Soohyun?

180
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,530
KANG GUNWOO

181
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,518
Gunwoo,

182
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,104
I promise...

183
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,482
I will help...

184
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,901
your mom.

185
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,715

00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,426
I look forward to working with you.

00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,178
It won't be an easy fight.

188
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,390
Yes, we're up against a tough opponent.

189
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,725
I've braced myself.

190
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,272
But why are you filing this report now?
You had the evidence.

191
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,735
I only found out recently

192
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,030
that I had the evidence.

193
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,950
Someone...

194
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,871
passed it on to me on her deathbed.

195
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,514
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

196
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,767
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

197
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,020
♪ Happy birthday, dear Mom! ♪

198
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,689
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

199
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,444
Mom, I love you this much!

200
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,695
I love you!

201
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
How much longer will you follow me?

202
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,732
I'll leave...

203
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,942
after you go inside.

204
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,821
It's cold.

205
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
Go home.

206
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,785
I...

207
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,001
heard it too.

208
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,588
That video.

209
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,738
I'm sorry.

210
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,667
I'm sorry.

211
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,474
It's not your fault.

212
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,655
I'm sorry.

213
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,044
At that time,

214
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,380
I made a choice.

215
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,757
I don't seek...

216
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,218
I thought it was right.

217
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,888
...leniency.

218
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,384
But, Seonyul.

219
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,763
For you...

220
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,894
it became...

221
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,313
a permanent pain.

222
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm so...

223
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,945
sorry.

224
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,603
Hello.

225
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,150
- Director?
- Yes.

226
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,319
There's a press conference
over Kim Joon's lawsuit.

227
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,280
Who?

228
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,157
Well...

229
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,500
Hey, it's been a while.

230
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,793
How have you been?

231
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,711
Hello, Congressman.

232
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,546
We look forward to your support.

233
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,090
Congressman, look over here.

234
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,925
Look over here too.

235
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,427
Sir, this way.

236
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,511
Congressman!

237
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,972
Look this way.

238
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,808
- Will you look over here?
- Look over here.

239
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,530
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR KANG GUNWOO'S CASE

240
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,660
Now, right this way.

241
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,666
I had sent an official letter
to all media outlets.

242
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,056
Thank you for taking time out

243
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,017
to hear what I have to say.

244
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,728
I appreciate it.

245
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:15,608
Respected citizens, I'm Kim Joon,
the presidential candidate

246
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,360
of Hankuk United Party.

247
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,863
To make a country
with happy and safe citizens,

248
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,990
I decided to run for president.

249
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,284
After all that time,

250
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,578
I have come to uncover...

251
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,750
the truth of that day.

252
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,335
I have decided...

253
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:39,590
to come here today to reveal the truth.

254
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,515
Director Kang,

255
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,769
I need you to bring something to me.

256
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,242
Great job, Congressman!

257
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,496
- Congressman.
- That was great!

258
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,748
Go, Kim Joon!

259
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,541
What's this?

260
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,710
Weren't you going to Eun Soohyun's?

261
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,379
Don't get me started.
The director said not to go.

262
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:05,259
He's become Kim Joon's henchman.
It regards his family, but look at him.

263
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,179
- Are you sure those are the facts?
- Drop it.

264
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,431
Anyone who publishes a single line

265
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,849
will be sued for defamation.

266
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,102
You don't want to get on
the future president's bad side.

267
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,604
It will only cause trouble.

268
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,692
POLLS: KIM JOON 42.8%, MIN HYEONUK 32.8%

269
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,778
KIM JOON'S APPROVAL RATING INCREASES

270
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,451
Yes?

271
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,536
Yes, okay.

272
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,875
Kim Joon's the one stopping it.

273
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,419
Kim Joon's camp sent an official letter
to the press.

274
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,674
Seeing as how they're responding,

275
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,345
it seems Kim Joon's feeling
the psychological pressure.

276
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,350
I think their counter will get worse.

277
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,227
It doesn't matter.

278
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,396
I'll still let everyone know.

279
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,691
That won't stop me.

280
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,180
I confirmed it's the original.

281
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,689
Either way, only the original evidence
is admissible in court.

282
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,066
Deepfakes are so common these days.

283
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,652
I can just say the rest are manipulated.

284
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,138
Your wife gets to live, thanks to you.

285
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,776
Take it.

286
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,530
She knows it's gone,

287
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,116
she must be looking for it.

288
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,736
Did you take it?

289
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,325
Yes.

290
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,330
Withdraw your complaint from Kim Joon.

291
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,458
Your interview and press conference
won't be published.

292
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,628
Don't think of trying to appear on air.
Please.

293
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,423
Don't do anything.

294
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,767
Do you know how Gunwoo died?

295
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,895
My child...

296
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,107
looked for his mother

297
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,734
as he died.

298
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,697
Kim Joon's the one that did that to him.

299
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,367
Can you forgive him for that?

300
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,202
You looked for justice

301
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,121
in everything else,

302
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,373
- are you still you?
- If there really is...

303
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,501
justice in this world,

304
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,588
there shouldn't be kids like Gunwoo.

305
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,973
No matter what anyone says,
you're more important to me.

306
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,977
I don't care if people insult me
as a bad father.

307
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,604
I will...

308
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,232
go to hell and take my punishment.

309
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,319
So just bury everything.

310
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,154
Live your life.

311
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,615
I beg of you.

312
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,079
I will never live in a country
with a president...

313
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,792
who killed our son.

314
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,233
If he continues
to stop me like this,

315
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,654
I have to find a way
where he can't touch me.

316
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,822
What can I do?

317
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:41,804
LOVE IN TIME

318
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:57,569
PURENEBOM

319
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,306
Why are you just leaving?

320
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,939
Come in.

321
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,205
Eat up.

322
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,334
Have you had a decent meal

323
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,004
after you laid your mother to rest?

324
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,806
Yes.

325
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,268
You vented your anger on someone you hate.

326
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,811
Do you feel better?

327
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,980
Did it lift the weight?

328
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,816
You didn't do anything wrong in your life.

329
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,109
Why torture yourself?

330
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,738
Then you should've just ran her over
with your car!

331
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,703
You're the son of a murderer,
aren't you?

332
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,625
I'm the mother of a murderer.

333
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,711
But if we collapse like this,

334
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,630
would your late mother...

335
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,217
be able to rest in peace?

336
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,805
When I think of my child,

337
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,641
it breaks my heart.

338
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,897
Don't do this to my child.

339
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,358
It's hard on me.

340
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,737
It's not just me. It's your mom too.

341
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,073
All mothers in the world feel the same.

342
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,034
Seeing our child in pain

343
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,579
is the most painful.

344
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,133
Oh, my.

345
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,218
Look at me.

346
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,430
Seonyul.

347
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,599
I'm meeting victims
of Junseong Foundation.

348
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,184
Yes.

349
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,737
Hello, have you ever
seen this person before?

350
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,407
Hello, have you ever
seen this person before?

351
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,826
Read it and sign it.

352
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,286
We can make the accusations.

353
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,038
No, I don't want to be involved.

354
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,791
Hello, I'm looking for victims
of Junseong Foundation.

355
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,002
- Do you know anything?
- No, I'm sorry.

356
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,421
I'm looking for victims
of Junseong Foundation.

357
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,256
- Do you know anything?
- I don't know.

358
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,347
Sir.

359
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,849
The document for Junseong Foundation.
Look over it.

360
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,434
I can't.

361
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,103
I called you.

362
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,814
You got a scholarship from
Junseong Foundation.

363
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,566
How did you end up working here?

364
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,276
- If you just tell me...
- I can't.

365
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,779
Will you think it over?

366
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,951
Please.

367
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,870
- I beg of you.
- Do you know

368
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,163
what kind of people they are?

369
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,458
My child barely survived.

370
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,877
I don't want to be involved.

371
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,046
- I'm sorry.
- Still...

372
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,091
There could be more victims.

373
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,510
Please, I beg of you.

374
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,098
By chance, are you Go Geumsang?

375
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,892
- Who are you?
- I heard you worked

376
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,394
at Junseong Foundation before.

377
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,854
We're gathering victims from there.

378
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,107
- We're going to accuse--
- I exposed

379
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,858
their corruption and got fired.

380
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,653
My life was ruined after that.

381
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,823
That's why we're going to do it.

382
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,907
Just go.

383
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,339
Yes, you just have to sign it.

384
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:17,264
Will we get harassed
by Junseong Foundation?

385
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,645
Please, have some courage.

386
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,773
- Please.
- Yes, we beg of you.

387
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,900
I don't think I can do this.

388
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,778
Kim Joon will be the president soon.

389
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,202
Wait...

390
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,912
Kim Joon's scary.

391
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,967
To be honest, I feel the same.

392
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,054
To save my life,

393
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,766
my dad killed a child for Kim Joon.

394
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,393
He was still alive.

395
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,647
My mom knew the truth
and was killed for it.

396
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,358
Now that I know,

397
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,486
I don't know what will happen.

398
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,113
But...

399
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,745
even if I die,

400
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,747
I want to see this to the end.

401
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,334
For the family of the boy who died for me,

402
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,419
for my parents.

403
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,174
I don't want to feel ashamed anymore.
At the very least,

404
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,886
I think everyone here
feels the same way as me.

405
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,304
From the bottom of my heart,

406
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,182
I beg of you.

407
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,187
- Please.
- We beg of you.

408
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,981
We beg of you.

409
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,209
COMPLAINT

410
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,088
Thank you.

411
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,471
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

412
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,224
Okay, get home safely.

413
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,393
Goodbye.

414
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,477
You...

415
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,107
You should've told us what happened!

416
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,568
Why would you carry this burden alone?

417
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,736
Aren't we your friends?

418
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,240
- I'm sorry.
- You're terrible.

419
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,076
You were amazing earlier.

420
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,870
How did you say all that?

421
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,206
I learned it from her.

422
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,834
Approaching people with sincerity.

423
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,174
Yes, Mr. Park.

424
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:02,304
I don't think the complaint
is being filed.

425
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,347
I'm going to make a formal protest.

426
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,641
I think they're trying to buy time.

427
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,060
In the meantime,

428
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,855
I've been preparing something else.

429
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,199
I have to talk to you.

430
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,600
Aren't you cold?

431
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,613
Here. Victims of Junseong Foundation.

432
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,365
Complaints and statements.

433
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,701
I hope they help.

434
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,497
You know what?

435
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,209
You always exceeded my expectations.

436
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,127
Even in the worst circumstances,

437
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,256
you always found the right path.

438
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,175
I know you'll do well.

439
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,178
In a manner that fits you.

440
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,563
Seonyul.

441
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,110
I don't want you to get hurt.

442
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,156
This is my business too.

443
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,287
Also, I'm not alone now.

444
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,503
Thank you for this.

445
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,189
Mom.

446
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,402
What?

447
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,454
Mom!

448
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,543
Mom?

449
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:53,183
The number you have dialed...

450
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,360
Mom!

451
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,173
What?

452
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,696
Mom?

453
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,573
Mom!

454
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,575
Mom!

455
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,263
- Mom.
- Soohyun.

456
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,431
- Yeah.
- Mom.

457
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,684
What are you doing here?

458
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,769
Gunwoo...

459
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,688
is gone.

460
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:27,235
I wasn't looking for a split second.

461
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,572
He's gone.

462
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,326
Mom.

463
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,620
Mom.

464
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,209
Mom.

465
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,629
Gunwoo...

466
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,675
is just fine.

467
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,802
He's fine.

468
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,679
- Really?
- Yes.

469
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:02,687
So let's go home now, Mom.

470
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,314
Let's go home.

471
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,113
Are you cold?

472
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,293
I'm sorry.

473
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,922
For what?

474
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,508
What are you sorry for?

475
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,482
I bet my baby was scared.

476
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,823
Yes, Soohyun?

477
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,412
I asked the professor.

478
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,080
Your mom...

479
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,292
has Alzheimer's.

480
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,753
She's taking medication right now,

481
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,589
so don't worry.

482
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,424
Okay.

483
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,054
I know you're busy. Thanks for asking.

484
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,360
Kim Joon's approval rating
has been steadily rising day by day.

485
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,111
Kim Joon's rating is at 46%,

486
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,530
while Min Hyeonuk is at 30.2%.

487
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,449
Kim Joon's approval rating

488
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,951
- has risen an additional 5%.
- Kim Joon!

489
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,037
Kim Joon
of the Hankuk United Party

490
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,165
has a public rating of 47%,

491
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:13,544
while Min Hyeonuk of the opposing party
has a rating of 30%.

492
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:17,632
It seems Candidate Kim Joon has benefited
from the convention effect.

493
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,885
Min Hyeonuk is lagging behind
and can't narrow the gap.

494
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,720
In a short amount of time,

495
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,432
Kim Joon has been able to gain the support
from younger and female groups.

496
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,819
I know you'll do well.

497
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,737
In a manner that fits you.

498
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,369
EUN SOOHYUN RETURNS AFTER EIGHT YEARS

499
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,456
MEET WRITER EUN SOOHYUN

500
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,959
"LOVE IN TIME" EVENT

501
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:16,107
She's back after eight years,
introducing Eun Soohyun.

502
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,740
Let's give her a round of applause.

503
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,863
If you fail,

504
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,907
then I'll step in

505
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,451
and kill Kim Joon for you.

506
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,417
There was a lot of speculation

507
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,212
saying you wouldn't return
after those incidents.

508
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,798
Everyone had been waiting for this news.

509
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:25,009
Is there a reason you announced it
without notice?

510
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,594
Everything...

511
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,930
has a right time.

512
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,766
As for me,

513
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,768
that time is now.

514
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,687
So what can you tell
our readers about your new book?

515
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,356
My new book...

516
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,735
will be written based on true events.

517
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,111
If it's a true story,

518
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,280
which incident did you use as your motif?

519
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,367
It's the hidden truth

520
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,078
about my son's accident.

521
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,831
We're aware that case was closed.

522
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,874
What hidden truth are you referring to?

523
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,921
There was another culprit
to my son's accident that day.

524
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,257
He...

525
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,008
killed my son who was alive...

526
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,807
for his own desires...

527
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,643
that day.

528
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,064
Quiet please.

529
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,442
Wait, who is that person?

530
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,367
Hey, hey.

531
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,869
I'll fall at this rate.

532
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,829
Don't mess with her anymore.

533
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,832
What are you doing with the wench
that killed your father?

534
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,377
Let's die here together.

535
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,014
It's someone...

536
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,516
we all know.

537
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,062
Presidential candidate...

538
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,233
Kim Joon.

539
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,582
Now, what's left for me to do?

540
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,876
Can you handle the consequences

541
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,294
if Kim Joon becomes president?

542
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,297
If slandering me
will lessen her sadness...

543
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,757
So apologize properly!

544
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,092
EUN SOOHYUN, SUICIDE ATTEMPT

545
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,802
I'll kill anyone

546
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,804
- who gets in my way.
-

547
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,265
Don't mess with her anymore.

548
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:22,061
No. I have no intention
of playing into Kim Joon's show.

549
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,522
I will go all the way.

550
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,609
Mom, does that hurt?

551
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,486
Let me blow on it for you.

552
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,697
Don't cry, Mom.
