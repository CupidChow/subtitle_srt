12
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,550
That’s enough, you’ve had too much.

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,520
I’m not that drunk.

14
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,640
I just can’t see your eyes clearly.

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,410
If you can’t see me, just hold me.

16
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,039
You smell good.

17
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,009
Did you put on cologne?

18
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,440
No.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,610
I haven’t worn any in a while because you don’t like it.

20
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,750
But I know what it is.

21
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,580
What is it?

22
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,520
Phe… ro… mones.

23
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,810
What is pheromone?

24
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,560
Demon Lord.

25
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,580
Don’t come any closer.

26
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,700
Good boy.

27
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,610
Don’t sleep just yet.

28
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,130
You should change first.

29
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,270
You should change too.

30
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,510
Ozone. Do you hear me?

31
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,380
We’ll be having breakfast at 7 a.m.

32
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Huh? What did you say?

33
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,790
Something stuck in your throat?

34
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,590
Is there something between You and Pie?

35
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,520
Why are you teasing me? Target Ob-aun and Shan instead.

36
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,820
Everyone knows Ob-aun and I are together.

37
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,960
Not like you and Pie.

38
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,020
Well … I was waiting for the right moment to tell you.

39
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,820
Sin, are you jealous of us?

40
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,260
Yes.

41
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,960
When will The Villain's Strategy Guide end?

42
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,620
Soon. From our schedule, it’ll be done next week.

43
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,990
Can you finish it sooner?

44
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,490
Why?

45
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,460
Because fans are starting to guess that you guys are the 5yes of Wonder.

46
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,560
Let them guess. We are what we are.

47
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,020
No.

48
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,860
You need to start planning.

49
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,590
In half a month, there’s going to be a press conference for YS’ One Story of Moments in Time.

50
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,320
At the convention center.

51
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,090
This time, the 5yes of Wonder will be our highlight.

52
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,690
What?

53
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,770
Would it be strange if I tell you today,

54
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,490
I’m just afraid you might not feel this way.

55
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,190
There’s something my heart desire,

56
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,790
that I want us to stay like this every day.

57
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,990
May I ask you not to go so soon?

58
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,340
I really love being close to you.

59
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,420
Please stay with me and talk for a while.

60
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,740
Just the two of us, it feels so right.

61
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,900
This guy …

62
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,200
is my boyfriend.

63
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,380
His name is Jingjang.

64
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,520
You didn’t tell us about this.

65
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,080
Yeah.

66
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,980
The press conference starts at 3 p.m.

67
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,850
The live event this time is for charity.

68
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,400
Wait, isn’t our debut the main focus?

69
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,860
You can’t sing, can’t dance.

70
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,060
What debut do you want?

71
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,160
Hey!

72
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,540
What is this project then?

73
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,260
I expanded the project a little.

74
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,920
I intend for it to be for charity.

75
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,940
First, I’ll release a special gift set of The Villain’s Strategy Guide,

76
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,000
and all the earnings will be donated.

77
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,400
And once we gather enough stories for the project,

78
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,660
we’ll sell the rights.

79
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,740
Then, a portion of the earnings will go to charity.

80
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,140
Whoa, can we really do that?

81
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,860
If so, the 5yes of Wonder. …

82
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,060
will become a legendary name in the BL novel world.

83
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,560
Right?

84
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,660
Okay, it’s almost time.

85
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,240
Everyone, get ready.

86
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,580
Welcome everyone to the press conference for ...

87
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,140
One Story of Moments in Time.

88
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,280
Today, we’ll meet five charming writers who’ll answer your questions.

89
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,980
Let’s begin with …

90
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,680
Ozone, the person who always keeps the 5yes of Wonder lively and fun.

91
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,680
Next, we have the brains of the gang, Jao Samut.

92
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,580
And Sin, the laid-back guy who writes spiritual cultivation novels.

93
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,540
The last ones are Ob-aun, a writer of martial arts genre,

94
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,660
and Shan, a writer specializing in mystery.

95
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,400
It's like we’re celebrating after passing a game stage.

96
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,130
But there’s one more stage left.

97
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,160
What is it?

98
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,160
I’ll keep that a surprise for now.

99
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,930
Let’s play a game. An easy one.

100
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,330
You’re all familiar with this word, it’s ‘read’.

101
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,780
We’ll have our writers read comments from their fans.

102
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,160
Let’s start with Jao Samut.

103
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:04,180
“P’Jao Samut is the best. I’ll support you forever.”

104
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,620
Thank you.

105
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
My turn.

106
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,780
“I’m afraid my New Year’s blessing will get lost in the flood of messages,

107
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,130
and the fireworks will drown out my best wishes for you.”

108
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,180
“P’Ozone, Happy New Year.”

109
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,380
Next, it’s Sin’s turn.

110
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,500
“I’m proud to see you on the stage that’s truly yours.”

111
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,330
“Congratulations.”

112
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,760
Now, we’ll have Shan.

113
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,670
But let’s change the rules a bit.

114
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,670
You can either read a fan comment or tell us about your novel.

115
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,500
I’ll talk about my novel.

116
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,730
Sure thing.

117
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,410
So, The Villain’s Strategy Guide has technically ended,

118
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,070
but many people don’t want it to stop,

119
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,010
so I wrote a spin-off set in modern times,

120
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,760
telling what Shen An and Duan Ru Xing would do in our world.

121
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,760
This special chapter hasn’t been uploaded yet,

122
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,160
but a staff member asked me about it just now, so I posted a short teaser.

123
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,560
Now I need someone to act in it with me.

124
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,960
Ob-aun. Can you help me out?

125
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,300
All you have to do is stand there.

126
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,530
“I’ve kept the music of wedding bells,

127
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,010
I’ve saved the kiss on lips so well.

128
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,780
I’ve caught the stars in your tender gaze,

129
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,780
And always treasure the day we met,

130
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,380
With brushstrokes linking heart to heart,

131
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,070
We painted our love like a timeless art.

132
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,930
In every tale, you’re by my side,

133
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,300
A bond forever, it feels so right,

134
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,780
We watch the sun, just you and I,

135
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,300
Until the moon lights up the sky.”

136
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,130
What a great confession!

137
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,500
But the special chapter isn’t out yet, please stay tuned.

138
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,070
For now, our game isn’t over. Ob-aun, you’re next.

139
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,640
Can I talk about my novel?

140
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,810
Of course.

141
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,040
Originally, we wrote this book

142
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,530
just to relax at first,

143
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,070
but while writing, it became more than just words.

144
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:37,670
This novel is filled with sounds, images, feelings of joy and sorrow,

145
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,070
and reflects the dreams and struggles of many people.

146
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,300
It brought us all together between the lines.

147
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,610
And I think it’s very romantic.

148
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,100
We’ll love you forever, Little Prince.

149
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,980
I’m suddenly thinking about the ending of The Villain’s Strategy Guide,

150
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,010
where Shen An asks Duan Ru Xing …

151
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,930
“Duan Ru Xing, do you like this world?”

152
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,760
“The moon shines bright, the breeze runs pure,

153
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,440
Lively crowds, and beasts obscure.

154
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,380
Love, hate, and separation.

155
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,180
All from the pen of an ordinary person.

156
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,070
Is it real, or just a scene?

157
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,130
It feels like wandering through a dream.”

158
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,300
Duan Ru Xing, do you like this world?

159
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,410
I like the world with you in it.

160
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:36,840
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

161
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,900
I’m so lucky to have found you.

162
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,330
Yes.

163
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,130
I like the world with you in it.

164
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,380
Red envelopes give away.

165
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Huh? What is this?

166
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,610
Don’t ask! Just grab it quickly!

167
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,760
Okay.

168
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,810
Thank you, boss.

169
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,330
But why isn’t Ob-aun in this group?

170
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,380
I need your help, guys.

171
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,240
I’m going to propose to Ob-aun.

172
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,700
Any good ideas?

173
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,010
Really?

174
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,600
Welcome to the Devoted Husbands’ Club.

175
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,980
I used to want to be a wedding designer.

176
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,330
Hold on.

177
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,610
Shan, are you sure you want ideas from us?

178
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,470
You want to see Ob-aun float with happiness when you propose, right?

179
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,840
From my experience, you’ve already prepared something special.

180
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,160
The ring’s ready.

181
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,610
Everything’s ready. Then you just need Ob-aun to agree.

182
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,450
How about a candlelight dinner, and the last dish is the ring?

183
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,160
P’Jao Samut, it’s 2024!

184
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,470
We could rent a big villa that’s perfect for hide-and-seek.

185
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,440
Then hide the ring, and give clues to Ob-aun to find it.

186
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,070
Good idea, but if the clues are too easy, it won’t be fun.

187
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,870
And if they’re too hard, Ob-aun won’t find the ring.

188
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,900
Will Shan be walking beside Ob-aun the whole time he looks for the ring?

189
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,620
Guys, I need your help.

190
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,900
It’s urgent.
(For Shan (4))

191
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,960
What’s going on?
(For Shan (4))

192
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,070
What happened?

193
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,380
Shan isn't here.

194
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,580
Yes, don’t add him.

195
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,980
Shan’s birthday is coming up, so I want to surprise him. Any ideas?

196
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,840
Ob-aun, I’ve got something to deal with. I’ll be back in 15 minutes.

197
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,410
Sure, no problem.

198
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,640
What a crazy day! They just kept showering their love!

199
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,840
Thanks for inviting me in, what do you want to say?

200
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,930
Shall we discuss what to do next?

201
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,580
Should we tell one that the other is planning something?

202
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,040
Or should we just tell Ob-aun?

203
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,700
But this is the first time Shan’s ever asked us for help.

204
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,380
Maybe we should let him owe us one.

205
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,330
That’s true.

206
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:37,610
Or should we tell Shan that Ob-aun is planning a surprise.

207
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,640
No way, Ob-aun is our friend.

208
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,300
We can’t betray him.

209
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,470
That’s right.

210
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,330
Looks like we’ll have to be double agents.

211
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,180
Are we really going to endure watching them being all sweet?

212
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,180
No other choice, so that’s the plan.

213
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,900
Alright.

214
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,970
(Wedding Planner (3))

215
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,670
(Proposal Planning 1 (4))

216
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,530
(Proposal Planning 2 (4))

217
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,270
What’s with number 2? There was a group before this one?

218
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,500
Two is …

219
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,900
It represents couples. A pair.

220
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,730
It’s a good sign.

221
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,820
Thanks.

222
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,470
Let’s look at the gifts I received.

223
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,870
Sure.

224
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,930
I’ll start with Ozone’s.

225
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,840
Happy birthday, Ob-aun. This book is famous.

226
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,850
It has ten chapters, and I chose it just for you.

227
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,120
It’s beautifully written, and I even added my own comments.

228
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,070
Spring Wind and Rain.

229
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,900
This chapter helps unlock new feelings between you two.

230
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,470
Marriage Contract, this chapter is amazing, and there’s twins!

231
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,750
Sin’s gift is next.

232
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,040
Well, let’s see P’Jao Samut’s gift.

233
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,900
I bet it’s different from these two.

234
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,380
What do you think it is?

235
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,070
A painting?

236
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,210
That’s possible.

237
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,440
You’re right.

238
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,750
Heaven rewards those who work hard. From Jao Samut.

239
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,360
Pack your things.

240
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,900
Where are you taking me so early?

241
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,930
It’s a secret.

242
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,930
Come on, stop playing games for now.

243
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,130
You can get back to it later.

244
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,960
Don’t sulk. Let’s go.

245
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,810
Come on.

246
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,640
Let go first.

247
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,620
Who’s that?

248
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,270
My name is Ob-aun, can I come back to play with him tomorrow?

249
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,070
Oh, sure. You’re welcome.

250
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,530
Look, they’re butterflies, and over there are trees.

251
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,560
Let’s play tag.

252
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,109
I’ll run around you, and when you say stop, you have to find me.

253
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,870
Okay, start.

254
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,980
I want to be a writer.

255
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,620
I’ll write about how you helped the police catch the thief.

256
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,669
And send the short story to a magazine.

257
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:46,020
So everyone will know about your bravery.

258
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,110
This is …

259
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,930
the place we first met.

260
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:44,780
I’ve tried not to remember everything that happened here.

261
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,200
When I think of this place,

262
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,000
it always brings me back to our childhood.

263
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,000
Shan

264
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,360
If I couldn’t remember,

265
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,820
would you be upset?

266
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,490
Not at all.

267
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,690
I’ve told you that those things don’t really matter.

268
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,470
But I’d be sad …

269
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,510
Why would you?

270
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,820
Because I wouldn’t know …

271
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,090
just how good ... that chocolate cake tasted.

272
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,670
If …

273
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,980
If you came here that day and saw me,

274
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,400
what would be the first thing you’d say?

275
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,820
P’Shan, where’s my chocolate cake?

276
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,960
Nong Ob-aun …

277
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,620
Our story starts here.

278
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,400
And from now on, can I stay by your side for life?

279
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,960
To meet you and stand by your side.

280
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,490
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

281
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:33,160
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

282
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,960
Yes.

283
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:40,270
I’m so lucky to have found you.

284
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:46,240
To meet you and stand by your side.

285
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,690
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

286
00:39:52,690 --> 00:40:04,510
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

287
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:10,380
I’m so lucky to have found you.

288
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:47,940
Wow, here they are.

289
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,140
My friend is taken.

290
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:55,620
Congrats!

291
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:05,270
Kiss! Kiss!

292
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,420
I’m so jealous!
