00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:41,634
(Hongzhen Holy Palace)

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,040
(Hongzhen Holy Palace)
I have come to save His Majesty.

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,239
Those who dare stop me
shall be shown no mercy!

21
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,199
The time has come, Your Majesty.

22
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,680
The heavenly pill is finally complete.

23
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,680
Why does it have a pungent smell?

24
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:09,839
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,639
as they say, good medicine for health
tastes bitter to the mouth.

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,600
The same applies to the pill.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
The heavenly pill consists
of the wonders of the world.

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
Naturally,
it has an extraordinary taste.

29
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,600
Your Majesty,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,559
I've tested the pill.

31
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,479
It is safe to consume.

32
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,479
Rest assured.

33
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,039
You are right, Grand Preceptor.

34
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,720
If it can indeed prolong one's life,

35
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:37,039
an odd taste is nothing to worry about.

36
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,839
You have made a great contribution
by concocting this pill.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,759
Let's do it the usual way.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,639
I will take one.

39
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,559
You will take one.

40
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,279
May both of us
achieve longevity at the same time.

41
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,199
I thank Your Majesty
for your graciousness.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,839
Be careful, Your Majesty!
The pill is poisonous!

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
That man is a spy from Northern Liang!

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,440
Quick! Project His Majesty!

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,119
Hurry! Protect His Majesty!

46
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:15,600
I am innocent!

47
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,520
- Don't slander me!
- Protect His Majesty!

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,839
I am innocent, Your Majesty!

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Your Majesty, I am innocent!

50
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:24,800
You...

51
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,759
He is dead.

52
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,320
Liang Yi, why are you here?

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,919
What is the meaning of this, Official Yuan?

54
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,160
Your Majesty,
Liang Yi came to surrender himself

55
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,559
and brought intel of the Northern Liang's
plot to assassinate Your Majesty.

56
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,839
I will explain

57
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,039
the details to Your Majesty
once we return to the palace.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,119
Your Majesty, you have been poisoned
by the Grand Preceptor.

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,279
You must be treated
by the imperial physician at once.

60
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Take me back to the palace!

61
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,440
Return to the palace immediately!

63
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,600
Search Grand Preceptor's room at once.

64
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,880
We must find the indenture contract.

65
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,239
Let's go.

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
What are you thinking?

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,239
I keep feeling that something is off.

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
How so?

69
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,040
I can't figure out

70
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,839
how the Grand Preceptor

71
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,760
saw through our plans
with the three memorials.

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,040
How do you feel, Your Majesty?

73
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,480
My head feels dizzy.

74
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,559
My shoulders are sore.

75
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,440
My legs hurt too.

76
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,160
I feel...

77
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,239
I feel uncomfortable all over.

78
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,640
But the imperial physicians said

79
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,839
there was nothing unusual
with Your Majesty's pulse.

80
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,480
Could it be that the amount
you consumed did you no harm?

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,279
The Grand Preceptor died tragically.

82
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,440
How could I be fine?

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,760
Your Majesty.

84
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,640
I heard that Northern Liang
is extremely crafty with their poisons.

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,359
Some won't show any signs

86
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,920
even after days of ingestion,

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,559
but in fact, the poison
has already seeped into the muscles.

88
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,000
Where's the emetic soup?

89
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,559
Where's the emetic soup?

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,559
It is on the way.
It will be here right away.

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,320
You'll have to lose

92
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,679
more than your heads

93
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,799
if it gets here too late.

94
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,000
- Hurry!
- Your Highness,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,839
I'll go and check.

96
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,679
Hurry!

97
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,760
All of you are dismissed.

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
Are you all right?

99
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,359
Your Majesty.

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,200
We can be certain

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,799
that the spy is among Eunuch Liu,

102
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,040
Imperial Commander Yan,
and the Grand Preceptor.

103
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,440
But what if there is more

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,559
than one spy among them?

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,600
I couldn't figure it out before.

106
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,600
Official Yuan's plan was extremely
well thought out and executed.

107
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,239
So how did the spy see through it?

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,679
No matter how I think about it,

109
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,720
there is only one possibility.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,160
That there were two spies.

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
The two of them
compared their memorials.

112
00:06:59,119 --> 00:06:59,920
It's Eunuch Liu.

113
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,799
Eunuch Liu.

114
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,559
This is odd.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,040
The Grand Preceptor vomited blood
and died moments after he was poisoned.

116
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:28,160
But nothing
has happened to Your Majesty so far.

117
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,679
Imperial Commander Yan,
His Majesty is blessed by the heavens.

118
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,679
Moreover, His Majesty
only consumed half of a pill.

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
We must have His Majesty
drink the emetic soup

120
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,160
before the effects kick in.

121
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,519
But Your Majesty...

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,799
Imperial Commander Yan has a point.

123
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,559
Perhaps we should observe a bit longer?

124
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,440
Observe what?

125
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll only rest easy after I throw it up.

126
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,200
How do you feel?

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
The soup has taken effect.

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,119
Hurry!

129
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,679
The soup has taken effect! Quickly!

130
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,239
Hurry.

131
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,600
- Your Majesty?
- Your Majesty.

132
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,880
Your Majesty. Your Majesty?

133
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Your Majesty!

134
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,479
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

135
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,679
Your Majesty!

136
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,159
The wretched spies from Northern Liang

137
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,359
must have poisoned the pills
with differing doses.

138
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,760
That's why even after His Majesty
drank the soup, it was still too late.

139
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,280
I am guilty of a thousand deaths.

140
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,640
I was unable to protect His Majesty.

141
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,880
I deserve a thousand deaths.

142
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,679
Don't cry.

143
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,200
No one is allowed to cry.

144
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,039
Now is not the time for you to cry.

145
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,440
N... Neither is it
the time to punish all of you.

146
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Imperial Commander Yan.

147
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,640
Yes, Your Highness.

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
Summon your men.

149
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,919
Lock

150
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
all the palace gates.

151
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:18,280
Have the imperial guards seal the news.

152
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,200
Maintain order in the palace.

153
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,359
Go.

154
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,760
Go! Hurry!

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,919
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,719
Liu Quan.

157
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,679
Yes, Your Highness.

158
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,599
Go find the Crown Prince.

159
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,719
Go to the Crown Prince's residence.

160
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,039
Tell him...

161
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,159
Tell him to get ready
to ascend the throne.

162
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,880
Go.

163
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,119
Your Majesty...

164
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,440
Your Majesty...

165
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,599
Your Majesty!

166
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,400
Your Majesty!

167
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,239
Stop.

168
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I have
Imperial Commander Yan's token with me.

169
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,520
I have urgent news
to report to His Majesty. Make way!

170
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,919
Let's go.

171
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,280
Close the palace gates.

172
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
No one is to enter or leave

173
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
without Imperial Commander Yan's orders.

174
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
- Yes, sir!
- Wait!

175
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,679
What happened?

176
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,000
Tell us.

177
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,359
Lord Liang, His Majesty...

178
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,719
His Majesty has passed away.

179
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,400
Let's go.

180
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,000
Your Highness. Imperial Commander Yan.

181
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,039
Official Yuan
and his group asked to see you.

182
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,159
Let them in.

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,880
Yes, Your Highness.

184
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,479
Your Highness.

185
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,760
Where is Liu Quan, Your Highness?

186
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,080
I sent Liu Quan

187
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
informing the Crown Prince
to prepare to ascend the throne.

188
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,280
What's the matter?

189
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,520
He is a spy from Northern Liang as well.

190
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,000
You...

191
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,640
Didn't you guys say
the Grand Preceptor was the spy?

192
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,599
Please order Imperial Commander Yan
to capture Liu Quan first,

193
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,799
Your Highness.

194
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,400
We will explain everything to you.

195
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,599
Alert all the palace guards.

196
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,280
Screen
all the major roads in the capital.

197
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,280
Seize Liu Quan at all costs!

198
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,080
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,119
Both of you hurry
to the Crown Prince's residence first.

200
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:52,960
I will be there right away.

201
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:53,799
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,479
According to what you said,

203
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,679
both the Grand Preceptor and Liu Quan
are spies from Northern Liang.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,039
To be precise,

205
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,080
Liu Quan is the spy.

206
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,640
The Grand Preceptor is most likely

207
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,359
only a guise used and discarded by him.

208
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,960
What do you mean?

209
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,400
Based on Your Highness's description,

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,599
His Majesty showed
no signs of poisoning before his death.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,159
Rather, he suddenly vomited blood
and passed away

212
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,400
after consuming the emetic soup.

213
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,119
I venture to speculate

214
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,400
that the pill the Grand Preceptor
gave His Majesty was not poisoned.

215
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,960
The Grand Preceptor who consumed
the same pill died on the spot.

216
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
It makes little sense that His Majesty,

217
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,799
who consumed half of it,
would show absolutely no symptoms.

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,000
Hence...

219
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,320
The poison was in the emetic soup.

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,799
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

221
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,159
I prepared the medicine
according to the prescription.

222
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,320
I had no idea it was poisoned.

223
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,919
Liu Quan was the one

224
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,880
who brought His Majesty the soup.

225
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
(He must have poisoned the soup)

226
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,159
(while it was being delivered)

227
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,919
(without anyone noticing.)

228
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,599
Eunuch Liu.

229
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,840
(The truth has finally come to light.)

230
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Liu Quan is the Northern Liang spy

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
who has been lurking
in the palace all these years.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
As for the Grand Preceptor,

233
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,840
perhaps Liu Quan had something on him,

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,520
and that is why he obeys him
to a certain degree.

235
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,200
But he wouldn't have the guts

236
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,320
to assassinate His Majesty.

237
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,200
So Liu Quan
orchestrated an elaborate plan

238
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,440
to trick us into believing
that the Grand Preceptor

239
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,760
was the spy
who wanted to assassinate His Majesty.

240
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,640
Then, he created the illusion
that Grand Preceptor died

241
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,880
from the poison in the pill,

242
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,440
sending His Majesty
into a state of panic.

243
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,479
Finally, he used a bowl of emetic soup

244
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,840
that had been deemed so urgent

245
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,039
that it was allowed
to bypass all testing,

246
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,080
and in the end, he succeeded
in poisoning His Majesty to death.

247
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,599
Liu Quan...

248
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,440
A cunning and detestable man.

249
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,679
Once I get my hands on him,

250
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,799
I will tear him from limb to limb.

251
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,159
The first step of his plan is complete.

252
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,919
He must have escaped from the city
with his indenture contract

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,760
to the nearest feudal lord now.

254
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,400
I pray that we may seize him halfway.

255
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,640
Otherwise,
Dashuo will fall into catastrophe.

256
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,400
Your Highness, I will notify
the Ministry of War at once.

257
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,719
I will request additional men

258
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,760
to guard the city gates.

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,031
(Northern Gate)

260
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,719
Stop.

261
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,520
Sir.

262
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,679
All right.

263
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,200
Go.

264
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:00,840
Raise your head.

265
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,719
Go on.

266
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,080
Go.

267
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,559
As per Your Highness's orders,

268
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,039
all the major roads leading from the capital
to the fiefdoms of the feudal lords

269
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,080
have been temporarily set up
with additional barriers.

270
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,039
The Main Administrative Office
has sent all the men we can as well.

271
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,719
Liu Quan would not be able to avoid them

272
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,679
unless he sprouted wings.

273
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,440
At the end of the day,

274
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,760
you still haven't managed to catch him.

275
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,239
I don't believe this.

276
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,200
I refuse to believe that a person

277
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,919
could vanish into thin air.

278
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,919
I'll give you three days

279
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,520
to capture Liu Quan.

280
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,200
If you fail,

281
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,479
you can remove
your court attire and retire!

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,119
Please calm your rage, Your Highness.
Official Yuan is doing everything he can.

283
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,559
At least there is no news

284
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,119
of any signs of rebellion
from the feudal states yet.

285
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,840
That means we did manage
to stop Liu Quan's tracks,

286
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,400
except we can't determine
his exact whereabouts as of yet.

287
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,520
After this, we need only gradually
narrow down our scope of search.

288
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,359
I'm just worried...

289
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,280
Liu Quan is cunning and guileful.

290
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,479
I'm worried
he has something else up his sleeve.

291
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,719
I cannot rest easy

292
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,640
until he is captured.

293
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,159
The Crown Prince's
enthronement ceremony is approaching.

294
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,000
Your Highness should put more thought

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,520
into helping His Highness
stabilize the political situation.

296
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,200
All right.

297
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,640
All of you may leave.

298
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,880
Yes, Your Highness.

299
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,679
Is my mother all right?

300
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,880
I've told you.

301
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,479
Your mother is safe and sound with me.

302
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,559
I want to see her.

303
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm afraid you can't do that now.

304
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,719
I've already found the spy as promised.

305
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,119
Our agreement

306
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,119
was that you had to eliminate

307
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,919
the threats the Northern Liang's spies
posed to the Crown Prince.

308
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,559
This matter concerns
not only me and the Crown Prince

309
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,919
but even more the safety of the nation.

310
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,719
You must not let me down.

311
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,880
I will capture Liu Quan.

312
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,359
Your Highness mustn't forget

313
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,359
what you promised me as well.

314
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,680
I never thought
you would speak up for me one day.

315
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,599
I'm not used to it.

316
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,160
I was only stating the truth.

317
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,359
You put it so lightly.

318
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,359
Gradually narrowing our scope.

319
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,640
This area is vast.

320
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
If Liu Quan hides patiently

321
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
and refuses to emerge,

322
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
we would be looking
for a needle in the sea.

323
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
How long will it take us to find him?

324
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,199
Patience...

325
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,520
What's the matter?

326
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,680
Patience.

327
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,319
I thought that was
the strangest part of all of this.

328
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,040
Why was Liu Quan so impatient?

329
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,079
Think about it carefully.

330
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,920
Liu Quan must not have been aware

331
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,680
that we had uncovered
his plans and deeds

332
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,640
when he escaped the city.

333
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,239
That's true.

334
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,359
Absconding from the city

335
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,680
is practically the same
as revealing himself as the spy.

336
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,719
He shouldn't be so eager
to expose himself.

337
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,560
If I were him...

338
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,319
If I hadn't known that my scheme

339
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,319
had been discovered by others,

340
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,040
I would continue to stay in the palace.

341
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,439
Citing the passing of His Majesty,
I would ask Her Highness

342
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,199
to permit me to retire
and return to my hometown.

343
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:50,640
By doing so,

344
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,359
I would be able to travel

345
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,719
to the feudal states justifiably.

346
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,599
Unless he believes the risk

347
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,199
of exposing himself would be even lower

348
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,439
than him staying in the palace
for the time being.

349
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,520
In other words,

350
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,880
he was already sure
that even if he escaped,

351
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,880
we wouldn't be able to capture him.

352
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,040
Is he just that confident?

353
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,800
Could he actually fly?

354
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,439
Or maybe he is certain

355
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,040
that his hiding place

356
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,199
is somewhere we would never suspect.

357
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,119
You mean...

358
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,839
That's right.

359
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,280
Right here.

360
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,680
The capital.

361
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,319
He secretly snuck back

362
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:26,439
after he absconded from the city.

363
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,199
We focused all our attention

364
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,160
on screening
those who were leaving the city.

365
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,319
Instead, we neglected

366
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,520
the traveling merchants
entering the capital.

367
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:39,280
So it would have been an easy task
for him to sneak back here.

368
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,119
He intends to wait

369
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,280
until all of us

370
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,640
have grown weary of our fruitless search

371
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,959
and let our guards down

372
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,719
before he makes his move.

373
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,439
There is indeed
no reason for him to rush.

374
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,520
His aim is to disrupt Dashuo completely.

375
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,160
So he should at least wait

376
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,959
until the Crown Prince
has officially taken over the reign

377
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,160
before he instigates
the feudal lords to revolt.

378
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,920
He would have the Crown Prince
and the feudal lords

379
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,199
fight to the death.

380
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,199
It seems Eunuch Liu

381
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,719
is a master of deceit
and misdirection indeed.

382
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,439
I will arrange for them

383
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,560
to search the entire capital at once.

384
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:17,575
(Ministry of War)

385
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,359
Qin Xuan.

386
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,719
Didn't I tell you
not to come to find me here?

387
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,199
You haven't come home
for the past few days.

388
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:24,599
I was worried.

389
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,040
Mother told you?

390
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,599
These days the Ministry of War is working
with the Main Administrative Office

391
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,800
to conduct a city-wide search
to arrest Liu Quan.

392
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,040
That's why I haven't returned.

393
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,959
Hasn't Liu Quan
already fled the capital?

394
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,319
According to Qiu Yan's analysis,

395
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,280
he has probably snuck back.

396
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,199
In any case,
all of this has nothing to do with you.

397
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,319
Go back.

398
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,839
Her again.

399
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,199
Wait.

400
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,119
Do you have so little patience for me?

401
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,400
Is there anything else?

402
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,599
What if I can help you find

403
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,119
Liu Quan's hiding place?

404
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,040
Wasn't this
a Northern Liang spy stronghold?

405
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,520
You think Liu Quan is hiding here?

406
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,119
Why not?

407
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,560
If I hadn't brought you here,

408
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,400
none of you would have thought
to search this place again.

409
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,520
Beixue.

410
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,286
(Sealed by the Main Administrative Office
in the Xinchou Year of Chengzhao)

411
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,599
Sir, the seal has been tampered with.

412
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,719
Someone did go in there.

413
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,400
Stay outside.

414
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,640
Qin Xuan?

415
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,520
Liang Yi?

416
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,160
Qiu Yan?

417
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,800
Why are you guys here?

418
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,719
That's my question.

419
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:03,439
Why did you guys come here?

420
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,880
Qiu Min thought Liu Quan
would be hiding here,

421
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,400
so she led us here.

422
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,520
Qiu Yan thought of it too.

423
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,680
Liu Quan might
take advantage of our blind spots,

424
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,839
so we came to check again.

425
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,439
Qiu Yan is clever indeed.

426
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,439
You were one step ahead of everything.

427
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,040
But it seems I had the wrong idea.

428
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,719
Liu Quan isn't here.

429
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,640
Have you checked inside as well?

430
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,880
If that's the case,

431
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,920
let's return.

432
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,959
Wait.

433
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,520
Could it be that he sensed

434
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,079
that you guys would be coming,

435
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,199
so he slipped off?

436
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,880
We observed the place
for a long time before we entered.

437
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,920
We can be sure
that no one came inside or left.

438
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,640
Maybe Liu Quan comes back here at night.

439
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,719
We could wait for him here.

440
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
The placement is different
from how it was last time.

441
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,439
Come and take a look.

442
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,439
I remember

443
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,079
these crates weren't here last time.

444
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,800
Liang Yi.

445
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:17,680
A secret door.

446
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,000
It's a cellar.

447
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,920
I'll go down first.

448
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,520
Slowly now.

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,680
Be careful, Qiu Yan.

450
00:23:59,199 --> 00:23:59,920
All right.

451
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,680
Beixue, you wait here.

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,800
Understood.

453
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:09,959
Be careful, sir.

454
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:32,959
Slowly now.

455
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:20,239
You've found your way here, after all.

456
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,079
Liu Quan.

457
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,199
There is nowhere else for you to go.

458
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,280
Give up and surrender.

459
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,239
Don't move.

460
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,040
Don't be afraid.

461
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,599
It's only a jar of wine.

462
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,520
I've got no way to escape.

463
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,239
Let me finish this jar of wine.

464
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,199
Look at all of the fine wine

465
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,880
from Northern Liang stored here.

466
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,719
It has been so many years
since I've tasted some.

467
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Don't you want to hear my story?

468
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,560
I can tell you my tale

469
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,800
as I enjoy my wine.

470
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,599
I won't say a single word

471
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:19,280
when I go to court.

472
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,359
Fine.

473
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,239
Go ahead.

474
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,920
When I was twelve,

475
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,560
I joined
Northern Liang's spy organization.

476
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,280
I was sent

477
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,400
to infiltrate Dashuo.

478
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:38,439
So I managed
to make my way into the palace.

479
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,640
And became
an undercover spy as a eunuch.

480
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:45,160
I was smart, and I worked hard.

481
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,040
In only a few years,

482
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,920
I outshone my peers.

483
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,119
After that,

484
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,160
I went to great lengths

485
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:01,760
to find an unorthodox fortune teller.

486
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,599
(First, I faked him out)

487
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:08,640
(as a transcendent being
that had descended into the mortal realm.)

488
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,959
(Then,)

489
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,479
(I created the opportunity)

490
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,280
(for the emperor of Dashuo
and him to meet.)

491
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,000
(That old emperor)

492
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,680
(desired longevity,)

493
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,439
(so he fell for the bluff easily.)

494
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:31,560
Good.

495
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,319
(And so, the emperor)

496
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,439
made him the Grand Preceptor

497
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,400
and even helped him
create the Hongzhen Sect.

498
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,040
And I,

499
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,520
with the help of the Grand Preceptor,

500
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
soon became

501
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,319
the emperor's personal eunuch.

502
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,959
Back then, the entire Wei clan

503
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,599
was exterminated by the late emperor

504
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,640
for advising His Majesty
to abolish the Hongzhen Sect.

505
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
(Xuan Temple)
You were behind that as well?

506
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,319
The Grand Preceptor
got the emperor to issue that decree.

507
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,599
I had nothing to do with that.

508
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,839
What about my father's death?

509
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,839
Your father, the late Marquis Weiyuan,

510
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,640
inadvertently found out
that the Noble Consort

511
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
had the blood of Northern Liang
in her veins.

512
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,740
(Memorial)

513
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,280
(So he placed her indenture contract)

514
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,280
(inside a secret memorial
and presented it to the emperor.)

515
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,160
(But he didn't know)

516
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,319
(that all these years,)

517
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,199
(all of these secret memorials)

518
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,160
(had to go through my hands first.)

519
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,319
(I realized
the graveness of the matter.)

520
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,280
(So I hid the indenture contract)

521
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,520
(and purposely led the Noble Consort
to find out about the memorial.)

522
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:52,000
(She acted as I expected.)

523
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,719
(She destroyed the memorial)

524
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,959
(and sent someone
to assassinate the late Marquis Weiyuan.)

525
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,239
Of course,

526
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,839
to make it easier
for the Noble Consort to get her way,

527
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,160
I was the one who arranged

528
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,959
for Duke Lu to shoot the late Marquis Weiyuan.

529
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
You tried to kill me

530
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,040
because you found out

531
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,439
that I was secretly pushing
for reform in the military.

532
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,520
That's right.

533
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,680
After the incident
with the Empyrean Fairy,

534
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,160
I noticed

535
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,560
that you were secretly
working with the He Family

536
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
and instating and promoting

537
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,400
young and capable officers
among the border troops.

538
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,119
It was then

539
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,199
that I was impressed by you.

540
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,160
To think

541
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,680
there was such a loyal heart

542
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,199
beneath your mask, Lord Liang.

543
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,760
So

544
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,880
I saw you

545
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,040
as a target that needed
to be eliminated as soon as possible.

546
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,239
Otherwise,

547
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,520
once the reforms were in place,

548
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,880
Northern Liang would surely
run into an iron wall

549
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,479
the day we attempted to seize Dashuo.

550
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,280
So you used my father's death
to lure me in,

551
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,040
colluded with Yuan Lang,

552
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,880
and convicted me of treason.

553
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,640
That was my only failing.

554
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,760
I had thought

555
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,400
I would be able to have you killed
on the spot.

556
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,199
But to think

557
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,920
your guard

558
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,119
would sacrifice himself
to let you escape,

559
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,319
forcing me to mobilize
the Northern Liang assassins

560
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:53,079
I had hidden
for all these years to kill you.

561
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,680
It's a pity.

562
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,040
One wrong move

563
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,160
makes all moves wrong.

564
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,640
In the end,

565
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,839
I lost everything as well.

566
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,959
That guard.

567
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,640
His name is Song Jin.

568
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,680
Song Jin?

569
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,000
I will remember that name.

570
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,160
But you must admit

571
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,199
that my scheme to kill the emperor

572
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,439
was certainly something.

573
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,760
(You guys)

574
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:37,359
(tried to test me
with those three shoddy memorials.)

575
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,760
(But the Grand Preceptor came to me
with his memorial)

576
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,000
(on the day itself.)

577
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,280
(I figured out your ploy immediately.)

578
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,439
(So I thought)

579
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,319
I would lead you guys
to eliminate Imperial Commander Yan first.

580
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,359
As long as you exclude

581
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:55,640
the lists in our hands,

582
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,280
all that's left

583
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,000
would be the one
in Imperial Commander Yan's.

584
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,199
As for the Grand Preceptor...

585
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,199
I didn't tell him

586
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:09,199
about my scheme
to poison the emperor at all.

587
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,400
He isn't one of Northern Liang.

588
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:12,839
He wouldn't dare.

589
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,959
I simply added

590
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,000
a little Anling poison

591
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,959
in the tea I gave him.

592
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,079
That dosage wouldn't kill him instantly.

593
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,959
However, if agitated,

594
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,359
he would spurt blood and die.

595
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,199
Poor him.

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,880
He only realized

597
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,680
he was

598
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,599
an abandoned pawn

599
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,479
right before his death.

600
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,479
What do you think?

601
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,599
Isn't my story a fascinating tale?

602
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,400
All right.

603
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,560
You've said what you have to say.

604
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
You've drunk the wine as well.

605
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
Come with us.

606
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,880
In the end,

607
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,760
I plotted and schemed,

608
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
but I never expected

609
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,040
that you guys would be able to catch me.

610
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,119
Impressive indeed.

611
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,359
But

612
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,839
did you guys really think

613
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,560
that I would be telling stories here

614
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,880
for no other reason?

615
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,520
Take this! All of you must die!

616
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:35,760
Qiu Yan!

617
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:06,520
(As Loyal As A Subject)

618
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,439
Xuan'er, what exactly is going on?

619
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,520
Beixue, explain the matter to my mother.

620
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,800
Madam. Please.

621
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,560
Madam, please come with me.

622
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,600
I'll explain everything to you.

623
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,840
Physician. How is she?

624
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:11,040
I've stopped the bleeding.

625
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,840
As for whether she'll be fine

626
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,760
depends on
if she can make it through tonight.

627
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Thank you.

628
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,040
We found this on Liu Quan.

629
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,919
Liu Quan has been handed over
to Yuan Lang to be dealt with.

630
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,280
I've completed

631
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,000
what you asked of me, Your Highness.

632
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,800
Very well.

633
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,919
As expected, you didn't disappoint me.

634
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,080
I've already ordered them

635
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,280
to send your mother
back to your residence.

636
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,679
You'll see her once you return.

637
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,719
As for your crime
of regicide and treason,

638
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:09,479
the Crown Prince will issue a decree
to officially vindicate you

639
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,399
after the enthronement ceremony.

640
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,000
Don't worry.

641
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,439
I keep

642
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,760
my promises.

643
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,280
I won't go back on my word

644
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,520
to a subject.

645
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:21,286
(Liang Residence)

646
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,080
Young Master.

647
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,560
Yi'er!

648
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,800
Yi'er!

649
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,280
Mother.

650
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,199
I've made you suffer.

651
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,199
Yi'er.

652
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,600
What matters is that you're safe.

653
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,993
(Autumn River)

654
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,439
Her Highness looked after me.

655
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,760
I didn't suffer a bit.

656
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,239
I'm fine.

657
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,719
I can rest easy knowing that

658
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,000
you're all right, Mother.

659
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,280
Qin Xuan.

660
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,239
Lord Liang. Please come inside.

661
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,600
How is she?

662
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,399
The physician says

663
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,800
it depends on whether
she can make it through tonight.

664
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,120
Move.

665
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,479
Kneel.

666
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,959
Let him be.

667
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,120
That's the direction of his hometown.

668
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes, sir.

669
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:31,800
Great Liang.

670
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
Your subject, Que Qing,

671
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,080
shall return now!

672
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:40,959
Do it.

673
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:02,801
(Seller, Hei Laosan,
Northern Liang girl, Qianyu)

674
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,212
(The 13th day of the 11th month
of the first year of Chengzhao)

675
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,679
I was so young

676
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,639
back then...

677
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:38,679
You're awake.

678
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,080
Qiu Yan. Qiu Yan! Min'er is awake!

679
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,760
I'll get the physician.

680
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:46,959
Min'er. Min'er.

681
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,439
Are you feeling better?

682
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,719
Does it still hurt?

683
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:03,560
Just wait a bit longer.

684
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,439
The physician will be here
to change your bandages very soon.

685
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:08,560
(Qin Residence)

686
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,479
I've already sent word
to the Qiu Residence.

687
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,080
Min'er will stay here

688
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,320
until she recovers.

689
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,800
Take good care of her.

690
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:17,199
Don't worry.

691
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,280
I'll leave my sister under your care.

692
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,120
Qiu Yan, let's go.

693
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,120
It's all over at last.

694
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,639
Are you going to leave the capital again?

695
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,520
It's a rare chance for me to be back.

696
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,040
I think I'll stay for a bit longer.

697
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:53,919
Besides,

698
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,120
Old Madam
must have received quite the shock.

699
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:57,600
I want to spend more time with her.

700
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,959
Qiu Yan, I've been thinking about it.

701
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:01,760
You and I...

702
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,520
Lord Liang.

703
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,520
I have a few things
I would like to ask you.

704
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:07,679
May I have some of your time?
