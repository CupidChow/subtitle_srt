=Episode 22=

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,119
You scared me to death.
What are you doing?

19
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,399
What are you doing?

20
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,160
I can't sleep so I want some wine.

21
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,240
I remembered Old Madam left
a jar of wine here during the day.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,919
Stop.

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,399
How dare you drink wine from my mother?

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,320
Aren't you scared she added
something in there

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,639
because she wants grandchildren?

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,279
Wait here.

27
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,919
When I was a kid,

28
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,720
I always stole my father's wine.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
I hid a lot of wine here.

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
I think I have some left here.

31
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Why are you holding the pillow?

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,720
Grab the cups.

33
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,399
Found it.

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,679
It's been here for years.

35
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,279
You can say it's been fermented
for many years now.

36
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,320
So I think it's going
to be a little strong.

37
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,039
Let me pour some for you.

38
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,240
How is it?

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,639
It stings.

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,679
Why are you still wearing this shackle?

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm too busy with official matters

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
to be concerned about this.

43
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,000
So

44
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,000
I got used to it

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,800
after wearing it every day.

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,559
You should spare some time

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,119
to put on the other shackle, then.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
So when you run into criminals
who know about weapons,

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,759
they'll know how prepared
the Firewood Office is

50
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,800
at the sight of this shackle.

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,759
Then you can subdue them
without fighting.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,559
Qin Xuan.

53
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,040
The sounds of thunder have subsided.

54
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,959
Why are you still awake?

55
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,239
Are you going to leave

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,799
after I fall asleep?

57
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,440
If you can't sleep, I...

58
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,359
I'll read you a story, then.

59
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm currently reading
Lu's Crime Investigation.

60
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,359
It's all about Lu solving cases.

61
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,480
The first case

62
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
also happens on a thunderstorm night.

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,640
I don't like investigative stories.

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,760
Then...

65
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,239
Qin Xuan,

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,799
please look at me.

67
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,200
I like rainy days the most.

68
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,279
Especially a heavy rain like this.

69
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,679
After it stops raining,

70
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
even Firewood Office

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,000
doesn't smell like blood anymore.

72
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,040
It feels like every corner of the world

73
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,239
has been washed clean.

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Don't drink too much.

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,040
You're going to get dizzy.

76
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Don't get drunk again.

77
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,559
Are you afraid

78
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
that I might spout nonsense
after drinking too much

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,079
as I did at the Royal Academy?

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,920
Rest assured.

81
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,839
I don't get drunk when I'm troubled.

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,079
When the rain stops tomorrow,

83
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,440
I'll send Song Jin to Guangji Hall

84
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,720
to inform Madam Liu and the Qiu family

85
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,119
of you and Qiu Min's whereabouts.

86
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,720
There are too many rules
in the Qiu family.

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,519
Even if it's raining,

88
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
we still need to pay respect
to the Old Madam.

89
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,359
I remembered there was a day like this.

90
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,559
The rain was heavy with strong winds.

91
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,320
Everyone gathered at Old Madam's chamber

92
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
soaking wet.

93
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,399
There wasn't any place to vent.

94
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,279
So Third Uncle and Third Aunt
started quarreling

95
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,160
in front of Old Madam.

96
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,279
Even Fourth Uncle joined in.

97
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,359
It was so irritating

98
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,119
to see them arguing.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,239
How I wish

100
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
they could all disappear overnight
from this world.

101
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
But now that they're no longer
by my side,

102
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,200
I find this world

103
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,720
to be empty.

104
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
Qiu Min has feared the thunder the most
since she was a child.

105
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,640
If there was a thunderstorm

106
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,119
at night,

107
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,839
she would run to Mother's room
and fall asleep there.

108
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,040
We had a thunderstorm like this too

109
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,359
when we were at the Royal Academy.

110
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,799
She came to me

111
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,600
trembling in fear.

112
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
I thought that she was soft and weak.

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,640
I thought

114
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,519
it wasn't right to be weak
at the Royal Academy.

115
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,359
So I heartlessly ignored her.

116
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,479
Just rest assured.

117
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,239
I'll take care of

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,799
the Qiu family's matters to the end.

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,559
I'll let your family return

120
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,599
to your side

121
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,159
and start bickering in front of you.

122
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,479
If they can still meet

123
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,880
after this crisis,

124
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,080
you can say they've gone
through difficult times together,

125
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,960
I think they'll learn something

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,599
and stop quarreling.

127
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,520
That's not necessarily.

128
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,440
We ran into more trouble.

129
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
But we didn't argue less.

130
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,880
That's because we're not a real couple.

131
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
I know you can't forget Qiu Yan.

132
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,280
It's fine with me.

133
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,200
But can't you look at me?

134
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,679
We must not keep repeating our mistakes.

135
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,440
Between us,

136
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,840
can it only be described as mistakes?

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,919
You're not the one at fault.

138
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:08,880
It's me.

139
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,280
Mother is gone.

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,599
Father is in exile.

141
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,840
Qiu Yan is no longer here.

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,719
I have no one to rely on

143
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,760
in this world.

144
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,719
I only have you now.

145
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,840
But you don't want to be with me.

146
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,200
You ignore me,
and you don't even look at me.

147
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,599
I know

148
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,640
you can't face Qiu Yan

149
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,520
who's in heaven because of me.

150
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,760
I know you're blaming me.

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
But do you know

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,159
that

153
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,359
I like you too?

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,119
I like you more than Qiu Yan did.

155
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I fell for you the first time I met you.

156
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,599
When I was at the Royal Academy,

157
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,400
I selfishly though it was good

158
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,200
that our family's property
was confiscated.

159
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,400
That's because I no longer have
to marry Lord Liang.

160
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,599
Qin Xuan,

161
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,080
don't you think

162
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,200
this is our fate?

163
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,359
Qiu Min,

164
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,640
I know

165
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,359
how you feel.

166
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,159
But my heart has no room for others.

167
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,080
Qiu Yan is gone.

168
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,239
Her shadow

169
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,039
- and our memories are here.
- I don't want to hear that.

170
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,599
Leave.

171
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,039
Get some rest.

172
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,159
Don't catch a cold.

173
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,320
How did I end up in bed?

174
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,200
A gentleman always does good deeds.

175
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,559
Why aren't you...

176
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,159
Master. Madam Su.

177
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,200
I have your water ready.

178
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,640
Come in.

179
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,559
Wan'er,

180
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,799
you've worked all night.

181
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,080
My waist hurts.

182
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,000
Let the physician

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,880
prescribe some more medicinal plasters
for you again.

184
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,880
What do you mean by "again?"

185
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,919
Didn't you say your waist hurts?

186
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,080
(Heming Building)

187
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,238
(Luojing's Secret. Today's Story.
The Concubine's Secret Residence.)

188
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,799
They were in the same room last night.

189
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,799
Nothing unusual happened.

190
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,640
Three main path leads to the center.

191
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,320
Good and evil are rewarded,
respectively.

192
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,280
Keep watching them.

193
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,440
The way of life always changes.

194
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,760
Bravo!

195
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,479
In the previous storytelling,
we've talked

196
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,760
about extreme anger because of a beauty.

197
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,520
Since ancient times,
it's hard for a hero to resist a beauty.

198
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Today,

199
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,239
I'll tell you a new story.

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,719
I'll keep the truth a secret
to avoid trouble.

201
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,760
So I'll use the story of Lengshuang
and Yanhong for adaptations.

202
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,919
"The Concubine's Secret Residence."

203
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,520
Lengshuang is an official
of the Imperial Court,

204
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,640
while Yanhong is the daughter
of a criminal.

205
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,280
How fate played a joke on them!

206
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,239
Both of them entangled with each other

207
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
and started growing on each other.

208
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,760
What does that mean?

209
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,919
What's "growing on each other"?

210
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I'll explain it to you.

211
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,559
To save Yanhong,

212
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,919
Lengshuang didn't hesitate
to save Yanhong from the dungeon.

213
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,960
Jiang Yun,

214
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,520
You've improved your means

215
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,159
of adding fuel to the fire.

216
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,919
The common folks

217
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,799
are always curious

218
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,280
who's the real person

219
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,520
referred to in the story's adaptation.

220
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,239
Lord Liang's story is captivating.

221
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,960
It'll definitely
be the talk of the town.

222
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,239
Are you ready?

223
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,039
Not yet.

224
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:52,840
Don't peek.

225
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,000
Yuan Lang is secretly investigating

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,520
Su Yiwan's background.

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
He'll use evidence

228
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,479
to testify that you're not Su Yiwan.

229
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,119
So you're saying

230
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,719
Su Yiwan is good at music and singing.

231
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,719
I'm all dressed up.
You can turn around now.

232
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,280
I can learn how to sing.

233
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
But I can't play any musical instrument.

234
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,800
That's why I found you a famous teacher

235
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,400
to help you master the skills faster.

236
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,079
Famous teacher?

237
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,800
I only ask you to help me with my hair.

238
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Why are you venerating
with such respect?

239
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,319
This is

240
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,520
to thank Miss Shi
for secretly showing consideration

241
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,959
to the Qiu family's female members
at the Royal Academy.

242
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,839
No need to thank me

243
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,239
because

244
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm Firewood Office's informer.

245
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,640
Ms. Su,

246
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,959
we meet again.

247
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,599
If you have nothing to do
at the Royal Academy,

248
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,920
I'll ask Old Madam to invite you
to sing at the residence

249
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,719
to take a half-day off.

250
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,599
Stop working so hard for someone.

251
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,599
Su Yiwan was good at "Endless Yearning"
when she was alive.

252
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,479
Teach her this song first.

253
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,800
Do you have any foundation?

254
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,439
Does she look like she knows how
to play a musical instrument?

255
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,959
Just do whatever you can to help her.

256
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,800
It takes four years to master the lute,
two years for guqin,

257
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,719
and a few months for the plucked zither.

258
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,599
The melody "Endless Yearning"
isn't complex.

259
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
The focus is to move people
with emotion.

260
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,719
Ms. Su is an intelligent person.

261
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,280
As long as she's willing
to put in some effort,

262
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
I'm confident

263
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,040
she'll be able to master it
in three days.

264
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,119
Miss Shi, you have eyes for talent.

265
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,520
Pluck the strings
with your right fingers

266
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,599
and tap the strings
with your left finger.

267
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,040
I'll play it once,

268
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
and you'll follow along.

269
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,239
We'll learn the notes one by one.

270
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,920
You sing well.

271
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
But the guqin's notes are wrong.

272
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,680
Liang Yi,

273
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,119
why aren't you going to Firewood Office?

274
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,359
Have you forgotten

275
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,160
that my mother applied
for three days' leave for me?

276
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,920
I can't even leave the residence now.

277
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,959
This song

278
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,160
is about hate.

279
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,239
But the world's

280
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,719
deepest and most obsessive hate

281
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,199
is from love.

282
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
When you're playing this song,

283
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,239
you must think about the one you love.

284
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,800
Remember his good and his bad,

285
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,000
so you can love and hate

286
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,359
and be stirred with emotions.

287
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,160
Try it again.

288
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,640
Wrong.

289
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,199
You haven't emerged yourself
in your feelings.

290
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,359
Your heart doesn't go along
with your fingers.

291
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
That's why it sounded dull.

292
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,199
It neither sounds soft nor clear.

293
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,880
That's more like it.

294
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,800
This is the sound of love and hate.

295
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,800
Miss Shi is really good
at playing guqin.

296
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,400
She's also friendly.

297
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Every mission you ask of her,

298
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,199
she always completes it.

299
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,040
She's indeed Firewood Office's
good weapon.

300
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,520
Where did you find such a great lady?

301
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,479
She was also

302
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,040
a young lady of an official.

303
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
Her family was convicted
of a crime after that.

304
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,040
Her father was prosecuted.

305
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,119
She and her younger sister

306
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,479
were also sent to the Royal Academy.

307
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,160
When I first saw her,

308
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,959
she played a cheerful song
with a smile on her face.

309
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:58,439
(Yet, her tears were flowing non-stop.)

310
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,199
Foolish.

311
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,000
Foolish.

312
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,680
Yes, I'm a complete fool.

313
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
(I found out later)

314
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,959
(that she lost her sister
to an illness that day.)

315
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,640
(The Royal Academy didn't even
prepare a coffin.)

316
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,359
(Yet, they still forced her
to entertain the guests.)

317
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,880
I helped with her sister's burial.

318
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,239
She wanted to repay me.

319
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,520
So she works
for the Firewood Office willingly.

320
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,040
It turns out

321
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,160
that we're on the same boat.

322
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,040
When she taught me
how to play the guqin,

323
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,359
I noticed she was looking at you

324
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,479
when she told me to think
about the person in my heart.

325
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,800
She likes you.

326
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
She's the Royal Academy's favorite.

327
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,000
Of course, she'll look at anyone
with that look.

328
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,680
She wasn't.

329
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
I was her servant maid.

330
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,599
I've seen how she looks at other people.

331
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,800
It's completely different
when she sees you.

332
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:05,920
Trust me.

333
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,119
It's a woman's instinct.

334
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,160
Your instinct must be wrong.

335
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,680
I guess

336
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll have to ask
for fewer favors from her

337
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,680
in the future.

338
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:20,959
Why?

339
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,160
Emotion is taboo in Firewood Office.

340
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,560
Heartless.

341
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,560
What about you?

342
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,359
You were so serious playing
with the guqin during the day.

343
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,920
What were you thinking of?

344
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,680
Me? I wasn't thinking of anything.

345
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,439
Interrogation is what I do
at the Firewood Office.

346
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,119
Don't even try to deceive me.

347
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,760
I was thinking about my mother.

348
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,959
(You booked me)

349
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,640
(only because you didn't want
Qiu Min's older sister)

350
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,839
(to make a living as a courtesan.)

351
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,479
When did I become your woman?

352
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,640
Who says I booked you

353
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,760
because of Qiu Min?

354
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,760
You really looked like

355
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,839
you were angry with jealousy just now.

356
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,959
I was taken aback for a moment there.

357
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,680
When I was angry just now,

358
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:39,199
it wasn't completely fake.

359
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,538
(Liang Residence)

360
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,920
What are you doing?

361
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,599
I'm searching for something.

362
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,064
(Spring Hill)

363
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:51,479
Who's there?

364
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,640
It's me.

365
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,280
Yi'er.

366
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,880
I brought you
deer antler with pigeon soup.

367
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,199
Hurry. Quickly.

368
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,439
Wait, Mother!

369
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm still undressed!

370
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,560
I just got up!

371
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,599
There's nothing to be shy about.

372
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,400
It's fine. Take your time.

373
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,199
I'll send it to your room.

374
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,079
Just leave it in the main hall.

375
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
I can't do that.

376
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,000
You must have it while it's hot.

377
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,000
It'll lose its effectiveness
if it's cold.

378
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,719
I'll send it inside.

379
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,359
Mother.

380
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:24,880
Yi'er.

381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,760
Come.

382
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,400
Drink it while it's still hot.

383
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,800
Greetings, Old Madam.

384
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,560
Wan'er is exercising.

385
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,800
She does it every day

386
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,560
and got used to it.

387
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,439
I was also doing

388
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,199
- Yes.
- the same thing just now.

389
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:34,640
Yes.

390
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
Exercising is good.

391
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,959
Yi'er, drink this while it's hot.

392
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,560
Give me a chubby grandchild.

393
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,599
Yes.

394
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:44,400
Thank you, Mother.

395
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
Why is the pillow here?

396
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,280
Why is it so messy here?

397
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,800
What happened?

398
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:00,800
We were...

399
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,280
Yesterday, I was upset
with His Lordship.

400
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,359
So I didn't let him sleep on the bed.

401
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,599
Yes.

402
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,400
I begged Wan'er for forgiveness all day.

403
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,160
But she refused to forgive me.

404
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,760
I could only lay out the mattress
on the floor.

405
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,280
How could this happen?

406
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,199
Tell me what happened.

407
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,359
I'll be your judge.

408
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,280
Yesterday, I invited Miss Shi
from the Royal Academy

409
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,040
to keep me company
and exchange musical skills.

410
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,439
His Lordship was here too.

411
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,599
Who knew His Lordship

412
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,800
kept complimenting and saying how great

413
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,959
Miss Shi's guqin's skills are.

414
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,880
He even asked Miss Shi to teach me
how to play the guqin.

415
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,839
Yes,

416
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,280
Miss Shi is famous for her guqin skills
in the city.

417
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,959
What's wrong with telling you
your weakness

418
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,079
and learning from her?

419
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,680
Is it wrong?

420
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,560
Yi'er,

421
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,239
apologize to Wan'er
for your mistake now.

422
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,599
Mother, to be honest,

423
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,680
it's a bargain

424
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,560
to let her learn from Miss Shi.

425
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,560
Hold your tongue.

426
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,560
How could you compliment another woman

427
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,839
in front of your woman?

428
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,599
Yi'er, listen to me.

429
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
You must apologize to Wan'er.

430
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,839
You should play down all troubles.

431
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,839
A married couple

432
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,439
should make up and get along
after a quarrel.

433
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,680
Go now.

434
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:18,760
Well...

435
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,439
Wan'er...

436
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,319
Dear. I'm sorry.

437
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,359
Well, Miss Shi

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,839
is not even half as good as you.

439
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,640
Since you say that,

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,680
I...

441
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,119
Wan'er,

442
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,359
why did you forgive him so easily?

443
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,280
You mustn't do that.

444
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,959
When something like this happens,

445
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,959
you must contain this at its root.

446
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,560
If you can't control him
after your first argument,

447
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,199
you won't be able
to control him after that.

448
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,280
Listen to me.

449
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
A married couple

450
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,760
must not minimize all problems.

451
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,839
You can't get along after a quarrel.

452
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:01,319
I see.

453
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,280
Everything you said

454
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,239
cannot diminish

455
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,640
the anger inside of me.

456
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,319
Master bought all these for Madam Su.

457
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,959
These are high-quality items.

458
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,359
They must be very expensive.

459
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,199
It doesn't matter
if it's expensive or cheap.

460
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,400
It's not for you anyway.

461
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,319
Carry it well.

462
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,640
Can't I envy?

463
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,079
Master is nice to Madam Su.

464
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,239
It'll be great

465
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,760
if I can find a good husband like this.

466
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,119
As far as I know,

467
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,800
Liuxiang Perfumery's best perfume
is Fengsui.

468
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,560
This is Guigu perfume.

469
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,800
It's not the best.

470
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,400
These are all nothing
but props for acting.

471
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,000
You shouldn't go too far.

472
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,760
I can't do that.

473
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,280
We must go all the way.

474
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,000
My Lord,

475
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,520
you show no sincerity in your apology.

476
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,800
Since it's my first mistake,

477
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,839
please forgive me this time.

478
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,640
But I've never heard

479
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,800
the Firewood Office would give

480
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,560
a lighter sentence to a first offender.

481
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,239
Hasn't Firewood Office
been handling crimes strictly

482
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,239
as a warning to others?

483
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:40,680
How can you mix personal
and official affairs?

484
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,359
Wan'er, you're a smart,

485
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,000
beautiful, reasonable,
and considerate person.

486
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,479
I'm sure you can understand me.

487
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,520
You never complimented me

488
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
this way before.

489
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,560
When you complimented me in the past,

490
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,359
they were all full of tricks.

491
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,719
You were scheming,

492
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,599
cunning like a fox,

493
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,400
and shameless.

494
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,640
Qiu Yan,

495
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,719
why are you bringing up old scores?

496
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,719
Mixing the truths and lies
would look convincing.

497
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,800
Seeing the person who has been picking

498
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,439
being so humble

499
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,599
and saying all nice things

500
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,319
is really the greatest thing
in the world.

501
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm not someone
who'd let this go on forever.

502
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,079
I know my limits.

503
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,280
I'll forgive you

504
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,079
when your compliments exceed

505
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,839
the amount of time you scolded me.

506
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,319
Qiu Yan, just you wait.

507
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:38,439
Old Madam.

508
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,800
Greetings, Old Madam.

509
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,079
I'm not going to fall for that.

510
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:42,439
Yi'er,

511
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,479
I saw how you picked on Wan'er

512
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,920
with my own eyes.

513
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,560
If you can behave this way
in front of others,

514
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
I can't imagine

515
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,800
how you bully her behind closed doors.

516
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,040
Mother, she was the one who started...

517
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,319
Wan'er,

518
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,719
don't let these little gifts

519
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,199
soften your heart.

520
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,640
Men are all miserable wretch.

521
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,119
You must use this opportunity
to put him under control.

522
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
I heard that.

523
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm never a partial person.

524
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,719
All right.

525
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,640
You should take care

526
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,719
of your issues yourselves.

527
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,599
I was only giving you advice.

528
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,880
Yi'er,

529
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,599
you're not allowed
to pick on Wan'er anymore.

530
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,199
Yes, Mother.

531
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,560
You're really something.

532
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,160
You see?

533
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,119
It's not that I refuse to forgive you.

534
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,640
Old Madam told me not
to let you off the hook that easily.

535
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,719
Have some chicken.

536
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,879
The weather is so hot.

537
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,639
I can't finish

538
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,000
the food you gave me.

539
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm sick of it.

540
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,320
It's too cold.

541
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,439
Wan'er, don't go too far.

542
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,000
Beg me.

543
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll forgive you if you beg me.

544
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,280
No?

545
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,080
Then don't come into

546
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,639
my room tonight.

547
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,600
Master,

548
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,199
are you sleeping here tonight?

549
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,840
Why don't you knock at the door again?

550
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,280
I refuse!

551
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,000
I can finally sleep in my room

552
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,479
and not sleep on the floor anymore.

553
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,199
I can't wait.

554
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,120
You never changed.

555
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,040
Master,

556
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,959
your feet...

557
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,760
Smell nice, right?

558
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,120
Turn around.

559
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,639
Go back and sleep.

560
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,479
I'll leave, then.

561
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:49,840
Sleep early.

562
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,040
You too, Master.

563
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,120
Master,

564
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,159
this ancient method

565
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,280
is effective for dark circles.

566
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:22,159
Speaking of which,

567
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,639
you don't seem to sleep well in bed

568
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,159
compared to sleeping on the floor.

569
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:28,800
Master, your glare

570
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,879
is not intimidating

571
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,879
with those dark circles
around your eyes.

572
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,719
Do you still want to apply this?

573
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,280
Do it quickly.

574
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,778
(Heming Building. Today's Story.
The Concubine's Secret Residence.)

575
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,120
How can I ever repay you

576
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,520
for rescuing me?

577
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,360
Worry not

578
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,080
since you've entered
the Marquis Residence,

579
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,840
we'll be family from now on.

580
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,040
(Today's Story
The Concubine's Secret Residence)

581
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:36,600
It seems we can't decide
our life and death,

582
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:54,600
causing resentment even after death.

583
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,000
Sir, please enjoy.

584
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,320
"Autumn River" is

585
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,479
about a Taoist nun, Miaochang,
who fell in love

586
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,080
with the Taoist priest's nephew,
Scholar Pan.

587
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,479
Their love was against the norm.

588
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,879
So Scholar Pan's family forced him

589
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,199
to sit for the examination in the city.

590
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,600
This opera is

591
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,320
about them being separated by force.

592
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
They are exchanging gifts

593
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,879
and vows by the river.

594
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,239
Sirs.

595
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,159
Sirs,

596
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:05,120
have you heard about
"The Concubine's Secret Residence?"

597
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:05,760
Yes.

598
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,120
I heard

599
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,679
it's about what happened
in Lord Liang's residence.

600
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,399
What? Lord Liang?

601
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,560
You must be mistaken.

602
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,000
Official He,

603
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,000
we're ministers of the Imperial Court.

604
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,760
You must spout outrageous remarks.

605
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,479
I only heard about it.

606
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,120
They also said
the concubine was Qiu Yan,

607
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,439
who drowned while escaping

608
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,159
from the Royal Academy.

609
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,239
Where did you hear this from?

610
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,719
Lord Liang.

611
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,159
When are you going to hold the banquet?

612
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:33,760
Lord Liang.

613
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,320
So we can meet your beautiful concubine.

614
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:39,719
Lord Liang's favorite concubine
is not of a simple background.

615
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,199
She won't meet anyone that easily.

616
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:44,239
I didn't hold a banquet
because she's not good enough

617
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,360
due to her lowly background.

618
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:48,239
I don't want to lose face
in front of you.

619
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,959
Lord Liang, you're protecting
your concubine so well.

620
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,879
Why do you want to keep her hidden?

621
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,479
Could you really

622
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,879
be hiding...

623
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm just too lazy to handle the banquet.

624
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,959
It's just troublesome.

625
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,600
All right, then.

626
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,320
I'll invite you

627
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,840
to dinner at my residence
within these few days.

628
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,199
I can also introduce

629
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,439
my concubine to all of you.

630
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,639
- Thank you, Lord Liang.
- Thank you for the invite, Lord Liang.

631
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:16,719
Court commences!

632
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,040
Lord Liang, Official Yuan,

633
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:18,879
this way, please.

634
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,239
This way, please.

635
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,000
Who says one can master
the plucked zither quickly?

636
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,080
Miss Shi,

637
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:34,360
not everyone is as talented as you are.

638
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,439
Wan'er,

639
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,479
are you still upset?

640
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:51,719
I already told you

641
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,639
I'll only let you in if you beg me.

642
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,199
All my life,

643
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,679
I've never complimented anyone this much

644
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,840
or compromised this many times.

645
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:02,199
I'm asking you one last time.

646
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,760
Are you letting me in?

647
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,199
Just beg me once.

648
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,640
(Spring Hill)

649
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,159
Please.

650
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,360
Yuan Lang is so devious.

651
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:42,439
Can't the Firewood Office

652
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:44,199
keep those storytellers' mouths shut?

653
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,000
The best way

654
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,879
to trumpet one thing is to stop it.

655
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:51,479
I can stop

656
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:52,719
those storytellers from storytelling.

657
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,280
But that will only announce to the world

658
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,360
that they've touched my sore point.

659
00:42:58,919 --> 00:42:59,639
What should we do now?

660
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,120
Rather than block it,
just let it go with the flow.

661
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:04,919
I have an idea.

662
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:06,360
What idea?

663
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,360
Beg me.

664
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,320
You still want to get even over this?

665
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,239
I won't tell you if you don't beg me.

666
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,040
You can figure it out yourself.

667
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,399
Fine.

668
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,760
Just keep it to yourself.

669
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,959
It's better for you not
to tell me forever.

670
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:31,479
This is your issue.

671
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:32,399
It's also yours.

672
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:34,280
We're now on the same boat.

673
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,080
Can't you just yield to me for once?

674
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,679
No.

675
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:40,080
All right. Fine,

676
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:41,639
it's my fault.

677
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,679
It's my mistake.

678
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:43,760
I'll yield.

679
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:45,719
Is that all right?

680
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:49,199
If I must say,

681
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:54,679
rather than let the rumors worsen,

682
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:55,600
how about we confuse them

683
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,919
with half-truths and half-lies?
