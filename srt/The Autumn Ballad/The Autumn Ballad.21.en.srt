=Episode 21=

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
Sir Jin.

19
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,199
This is the final place where Mr. Qin

20
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,039
was last seen with Miss Min.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,320
Who is the owner of this house?

22
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,360
A panhandler.

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,199
He's a gambling addict

24
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,440
so he must be at the gambling house now.

25
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,360
We have dispatched people there.

26
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,039
Search this place.

27
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,360
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,000
Miss Qiu Min.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,759
Sir Jin.

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,600
I didn't expect

31
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,240
the Firewood Office to find me
this soon.

32
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,639
Bring me to Qiu Yan then.

33
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,240
Come with me.

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,021
(Firewood Office)

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,479
Here, please, Miss Qiu Min.

36
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,839
Sir. Miss Qiu Yan.

37
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,919
We found Miss Qiu Min.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,279
Min'er!

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,039
I'm glad you're fine.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,679
I'm glad you're fine.

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,880
Come back with me.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,279
Lord Liang.

43
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,520
I have some words

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,399
for my sister.

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,199
Min'er.

46
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,479
We can talk

47
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,279
once we're back.

48
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,039
No.

49
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,399
I won't go back with you.

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,119
So

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,639
you made Qin Xuan think that I was dead,

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,399
and you were all alone

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,639
so you can only turn to him.

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,639
Yes, I did.

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,639
Shouldn't you be worried

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
that our family's name will be restored,
and when that comes,

57
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,320
everyone will see through your lies?

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,199
So?

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,399
Either way,

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,279
I had slept with Qin Xuan.

61
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,880
He's a gentleman

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,759
so I'm sure

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,880
he won't abandon me.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,600
Qiu Yan, you're always so prideful

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,800
and think you're different
from other women.

66
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,399
But now,

67
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,720
you would hit your own younger sister
for a man.

68
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,039
That was not for Qin Xuan.

69
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,720
That was for Lord Liang.

70
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:17,640
Do you know

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,359
how many people are hunting us
out there?

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,320
You ran away from Guangji Hall.

73
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,720
Do you know how risky

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,040
your endeavor was?

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,079
Fine.

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,399
Risk your life if you want to.

77
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,359
But have you ever thought

78
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,920
about those who helped us get out
of the Royal Academy?

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,519
Liang Yi, Song Jin,

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,079
those panhandlers, those boatmen,

81
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,399
and those people who manage
the Guangji Hall.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
They have all committed grave crimes.

83
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,600
If you're captured,

84
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:45,359
it's the end for them

85
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,519
and for the entire Qiu family.

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,440
Why would you risk so many lives

87
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,519
just for a man?

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,880
You're so right, Qiu Yan.

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,839
Is one slap enough for you?

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
If not,

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,760
please continue.

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,279
Once you're done,

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,359
do me a favor, Qiu Yan.

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
I told Qin Xuan

95
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,119
that after the boat disaster,

96
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,519
only I was flushed to the shore.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,720
And I had no idea
that all of you survived.

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,239
Please help me

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,519
complete this lie in front of Qin Xuan.

100
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:26,959
Also,

101
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,040
make sure our aunts and madams

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
know about this too.

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,279
That way,

104
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,959
this lie will never be found out.

105
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,640
And if I refuse?

106
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,559
If you refuse,

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,079
I will tell everyone
that the Qiu family is hiding

108
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,399
in the Guangji Hall.

109
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,040
You will not get jealous for a man

110
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,279
but I'm different.

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
For Qin Xuan,

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,119
I will sacrifice anyone

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,480
without a flinch.

114
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:56,720
If

115
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,600
I can't be happy,

116
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,279
no one can.

117
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,279
You're crazy.

118
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,239
Min'er.

119
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,640
You used to endure
for the greater good.

120
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,119
But weren't you the one

121
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,440
who said I should fight for myself?

122
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,679
You said

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
we should rely on ourselves.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
I did that and tied Qin Xuan to me.

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,440
Qiu Yan,

126
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,239
am I not your obedient sister?

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,000
Min'er,

128
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
it's only been a day

129
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
and you changed completely.

130
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,119
If my sister can seduce Qin Xuan

131
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,440
and discard him away
once she is bored of him,

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
why can't I do the same?

133
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,760
The Qiu family has fallen from grace.

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,959
The pure, innocent,

135
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
obedient,

136
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,079
and so malleable Qiu Min is dead.

137
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
She was already dead

138
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,040
in the Royal Academy

139
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,959
when you were busy vying for attention

140
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,959
and courting Lord Liang.

141
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,880
In a few months,

142
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,399
those who love me

143
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,519
either left or died.

144
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,399
If I stayed the same,

145
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,559
no one would care if I died

146
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,119
in Guangji Hall or not.

147
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,799
I would.

148
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,959
You left us a letter without reasons.

149
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,480
I was so worried that you might
take your own life.

150
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,519
Do you know

151
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,720
how scared, how frightened I was?

152
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,359
Qiu Yan.

153
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,760
You hugged me once just now.

154
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,440
If I'm not mistaken,

155
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,040
it was your first hug in a long time.

156
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
After our mother passed away,

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
I asked you to hug me.

158
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,720
During a stormy day
in the Royal Academy,

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,880
I asked you to hug me again.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
But you didn't.

161
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,559
(You cannot rely on someone else
all the time.)

162
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,399
(You have to rely on yourself one day.)

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,399
(No one can look after you forever.)

164
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,720
You weren't there
when I needed you most.

165
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,720
And now,

166
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,839
I don't need you anymore.

167
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,600
I have said my piece.

168
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,720
I will ask Lord Liang

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,239
to send me back to where Qin Xuan lives.

170
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,480
I will never ever return

171
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,839
to the old and dingy Guangji Hall.

172
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:15,799
(Qin Xuan.)

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
(We're drinking pals.)

174
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,280
(Would you drink with me tonight
till we're drunk?)

175
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,479
Qin Xuan, you're awake.

176
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,359
I bought you breakfast.

177
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:00,719
Min'er,

178
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,919
last night, did I...

179
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,640
Did I force myself on you?

180
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,799
You were drunk yesterday

181
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,119
and you grabbed me while calling
Qiu Yan's name.

182
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,239
I couldn't fight back.

183
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,000
Qin Xuan.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,719
You're a scum.

185
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,119
Don't do this, Qin Xuan.

186
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,000
You're an animal, Qin Xuan.

187
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:28,840
Qin Xuan.

188
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,280
- You took advantage of her.
- Don't do this, Qin Xuan.

189
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,039
I know you did that

190
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,039
because you were devastated.

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,599
I know

192
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,679
and I understand.

193
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,159
I won't hold you accountable, Qin Xuan.

194
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,200
Sorry.

195
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
I fail you.

196
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,239
I'm all alone now.

197
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,919
I only have you, Qin Xuan.

198
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,239
If Qiu Yan is watching us from above,

199
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,880
she will want you to take care of me.

200
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,400
Sir.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,640
Sir.

202
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,276
(Mude Hall)

203
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,840
You're...

204
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,919
Please tell Marquis Weiyuan

205
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,679
that Official Yuan
of the Main Administrative Office

206
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
would like to extend his congratulations.

207
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,919
Congratulations?

208
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,880
Madam Jin!

209
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,960
I am Jiang Yun.

210
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,119
Official Yuan told me

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,679
to wish you and Lord Liang happiness.

212
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,359
What's the occasion?

213
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,200
It's about Lord Liang's concubine!

214
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,039
Concubine?

215
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
You weren't aware of it?

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
Liang Yi refrains from overindulgence

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,760
and he keeps postponing
his marriage arrangement.

218
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,919
Perhaps, this is just a mistake?

219
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,960
Impossible.

220
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,200
Yesterday, Official Yuan detected
suspicious behavior

221
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,840
from a particular female entertainer.

222
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,359
He confronted her

223
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,840
and suddenly, Lord Liang appeared.

224
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,640
He announced publicly

225
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,919
that the female entertainer was
the concubine that he'd recently wedded.

226
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,400
When Official Yuan returned home,

227
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,039
he was worried that Lord Liang
would hold grudges

228
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:55,880
so he asked us

229
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,280
to bring you gifts this morning.

230
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
It's both an apology

231
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,239
and a congratulation.

232
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,840
The city gate is now open.

233
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,239
Disguise as a man

234
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
and I'll escort you out of this city.

235
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,119
Sir.

236
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,559
Miss Qiu Yan can't leave anymore.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,239
Jiang Yun with his cohorts
from the Main Administrative Office

238
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,119
came bearing gifts for your marriage.

239
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,200
They made a huge deal out of it.

240
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,200
And now, I'm afraid half the Capital
has caught wind of it.

241
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,719
Yuan Lang is doing this on purpose.

242
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,400
He wants to keep Qiu Yan here

243
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
so he made a huge deal out of it.

244
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:56,080
(Liang Residence)

245
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,105
(Mude Hall)

246
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,799
Mother.

247
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,640
Good morning.

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why are you in a hurry?

249
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,599
I was about to go
to the Firewood Office.

250
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,440
Many people
from the Main Administrative Office

251
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,039
came to congratulate you.

252
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:10,080
All the commoners even gathered around
to check out what happened.

253
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm sure they have made a mistake.

254
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,479
Greetings, Old Madam.

255
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,479
I am Su Yiwan.

256
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,159
Do you think I'm dumb?

257
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,239
Why didn't you tell me
this serious matter?

258
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,960
It's a complicated story.

259
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,239
It happened so quickly
that I hadn't had the time to tell you.

260
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,239
When did you wed her?

261
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,359
- Two days ago.
- Yesterday.

262
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,599
When?

263
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,960
- Yesterday.
- Two days ago.

264
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,719
Song Jin.

265
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
Tell me.

266
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,119
Two...

267
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,640
- Yester...
- So many things happened yesterday

268
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,479
that it feels like
three days have passed.

269
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:57,080
They must have gotten all confused.

270
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,400
Wan'er and I

271
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,520
wedded yesterday.

272
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,679
Right. Right.

273
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,080
What does this have anything to do
with the Main Administrative Office?

274
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,039
I was shopping and scammed
by an old lady.

275
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,119
She was bullied by a court runner
due to her lowly status.

276
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
She was first scammed by an old lady,

277
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,719
and then, she was bullied
by a court runner.

278
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,440
Mother.

279
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
Wan'er is an entertainer.
She's illiterate

280
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,599
so she doesn't mince her words.

281
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,960
Please don't mind her, mother.

282
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,239
An entertainer?

283
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,679
Attend the court.

284
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,840
I will grill her

285
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,080
about you two.

286
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,520
Mother.

287
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,760
Your work awaits, my lord.

288
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,039
I'll be fine.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,520
Wan'er.

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,440
When you address my mother,

291
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,159
you have to be polite.

292
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,719
Think before you speak.

293
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,719
Of course.

294
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:53,840
Song Jin.

295
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,359
Follow me.

296
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:03,496
(Autumn River)

297
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,479
Lord Liang.

298
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,239
Slow down, Lord Liang.

299
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,039
Congratulations.

300
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,479
I heard you found

301
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,960
a beautiful concubine.

302
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,719
Official He,

303
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,239
you know my private life very well.

304
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,640
All thanks to Official Yuan.

305
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
Or else, we wouldn't know.

306
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,400
Indeed.

307
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,520
You are always

308
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,520
so cold

309
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,760
and distant.

310
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,119
Who knows that

311
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,039
you actually have emotions like we do?

312
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,039
So, Lord Liang,

313
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,960
if you ever have any good news,

314
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,919
don't hide them.

315
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,280
We've been colleagues for many years.

316
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,719
If you have something to celebrate,

317
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,239
tell us

318
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,640
and we can all celebrate together.

319
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,840
Exactly!

320
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,840
It is time
for the morning court meeting.

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,400
All of you are dismissed for now.

322
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:03,880
Noted.

323
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,599
I must have met you somewhere.

324
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,439
You look familiar too, Old Madam.

325
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,239
It's as if we met in our previous lives.

326
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,400
Since you're a performer,

327
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,119
you must have met Yi'er when you were
performing with your troupe.

328
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,280
You agreed to his proposal yesterday.

329
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,199
I suppose you two
barely know each other?

330
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,760
Old Madam,

331
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,239
I have known His Lordship

332
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,359
for a long time.

333
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,599
This is not a dalliance.

334
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,599
Have a seat.

335
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,959
I spent

336
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,359
the entire morning court meeting

337
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,119
hearing those old ministers debating
how we should name the bridge

338
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,920
over the canal.

339
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,640
How boring.

340
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,560
Anything interesting
in the Capital lately?

341
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,040
Tell me something fun

342
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:24,800
to wake me up.

343
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:26,640
Recently,

344
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,319
when Li Wei

345
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,160
took over the late
Governor-general of Zhili, Tang Zhi,

346
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,199
he found no possession

347
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,479
in Tang Zhi's abode.

348
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,239
Liang Yi,

349
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,119
what you said here

350
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,359
is no different from the mumblings
of those old ministers.

351
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
I want to hear something fun.

352
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,040
I have nothing else.

353
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,359
Wonderful news came out of
the Liang Residence yesterday.

354
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,199
Have you heard of it, Your Majesty?

355
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,760
Apparently,

356
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,839
an old lady claimed

357
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,520
that a female entertainer caused her

358
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,400
to take a serious fall.

359
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,880
The runner of the Jingzhao Prefecture
tried to investigate this case

360
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,839
just to bump into Lord Liang having
an intimate moment

361
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,040
with the entertainer.

362
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,520
In fact, that entertainer

363
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,319
is actually Lord Liang's concubine

364
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,160
that he took in in secret.

365
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,920
Unfortunately for the runner,

366
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,800
he didn't recognize Lord Liang

367
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,479
and so Lord Liang got so mad
that he drew his sword.

368
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,359
He said whoever touched his concubine

369
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
would be beheaded.

370
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,599
Oh, Liang Yi.

371
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,160
I didn't know

372
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,880
you were this bold.

373
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,160
Your Majesty,

374
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,319
it was a lapse of judgment

375
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,920
and I made this careless mistake.

376
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,079
I shall send her back now.

377
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,199
Send her back?

378
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,560
What is she going to do then?

379
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,560
Thanks, Your Majesty.

380
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,640
Ever since you started your position
six years ago,

381
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,040
you handle everything with care.

382
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,640
I almost forget

383
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,680
you're also a man of needs.

384
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,479
You invoked your wrath just to shield
your beloved damsel.

385
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,760
The valor of Lord Liang

386
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,839
should be sung everywhere.

387
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,280
You never said

388
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,640
which woman tickled your fancy.

389
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,839
That's why the Noble Consort
recommended some to you.

390
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,239
And when the Qiu family was raided,

391
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,119
you performed your task dutifully.

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,280
But that's also why

393
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,560
your marriage was postponed once more.

394
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,040
Great.

395
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,719
Finally,

396
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,880
you found a woman that you like.

397
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,560
I shall give you a gift.

398
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,040
It's just a concubine.

399
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,319
It is undeserving of your generosity,
Your Majesty.

400
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,640
You have always been aloof and uptight

401
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,079
but I prefer the current you,

402
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,640
the fighting spirit you have
for your loved one.

403
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
May your seed continues to prosper.

404
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,439
Thanks, Your Majesty.

405
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,439
And then,

406
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,920
you have to go to Old Madam's chamber

407
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,280
and clean her room.

408
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,800
- Song Luo!
- Also...

409
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:25,680
Go now.

410
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Master.

411
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,680
Have you seen Wan'er?

412
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,760
The woman I brought back

413
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,000
this morning.

414
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
After you left for the court,

415
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,920
Old Madam brought her

416
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,359
to the study to talk to her.

417
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,520
They are not done yet.

418
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,280
That day,

419
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,880
I witnessed my family

420
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,079
leave me to the bandits

421
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,839
in order to protect my little brother.

422
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,160
When all hope was lost,

423
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Lord Liang appeared with Song Jin.

424
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,560
It was him

425
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
who freed me from the bandits.

426
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,160
He even gave me a fan as a keepsake.

427
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,680
I survived

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,359
but due to my mother's lowly status,

429
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,319
our life was a tough one.

430
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,079
The fan Lord Liang gave me

431
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,479
became the reason I persevered.

432
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,119
I know I'm from a lowly background

433
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,040
but I truly love him.

434
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,640
I don't even want any title.

435
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,199
I just want to stay by his side.

436
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,719
My child.

437
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm so sorry to hear that.

438
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,719
I didn't know

439
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,239
you have such

440
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
a tragic background.

441
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,119
Now I understand why my son

442
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,359
hid this from me.

443
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
He was worried that I would
mind your upbringing

444
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,439
and wouldn't accept you.

445
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,439
He

446
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
underestimated his own mother.

447
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,400
Before I married the Marquis,

448
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
I was just a maid

449
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,400
to Noble Consort Guo.

450
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:26,000
I came from a commoner background too.

451
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,920
But here I am,

452
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,719
the spouse of a Marquis.

453
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,000
Miss, do not

454
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,520
sell yourself short anymore.

455
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:40,920
You're a performer

456
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,040
but you're the first woman who entered
my son's eyes.

457
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,439
If he values you,

458
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,359
I will value you too.

459
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,959
From now on,

460
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,880
you won't be lonely anymore.

461
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,199
Thanks, Old Madam.

462
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,239
Yi'er.

463
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,079
You're back early.

464
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,079
Mother.

465
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
I finished early today

466
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,000
so I came back earlier than usual.

467
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,640
Great timing then.

468
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,560
You took her in hastily.

469
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,040
We couldn't prepare anything.

470
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,439
I was thinking

471
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,040
we should pick a room for Wan'er.

472
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,680
You might live with her too

473
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
so we can't let her decide alone.

474
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,560
Come with us.

475
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:41,560
Oh,

476
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,040
change your uniform first.

477
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:44,920
Okay.

478
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,359
Mother,

479
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,319
the western room is small

480
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,160
but elegant.

481
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,239
Whatever you like, my lord.

482
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,199
No,

483
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,560
the sun glare is strong there.

484
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,959
You can't live inside.

485
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,520
Mother,

486
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,319
what about the north? It's spacious
and there's no sun glare.

487
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,319
There's a fake mountain
and a pool there.

488
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,839
When you two have kids,

489
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,719
they might get injured playing there.

490
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,280
No sun glare. No fake mountain.

491
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,319
This will do, won't it?

492
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,040
No, it's too far from you.

493
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:32,640
Yi'er.

494
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,160
Perhaps

495
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,640
she could live in the study you used
when you were young?

496
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,160
That room is spacious and
has great lighting.

497
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,119
I think it's good.

498
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,719
But mother,

499
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,680
it's the study I used when I was young.

500
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,160
All my childhood keepsakes are inside.

501
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,319
It will be a chore to pack them up.

502
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,640
If I live with His Lordship,

503
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,959
I might bother him.

504
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:50,920
It's fine.

505
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,439
You should bother him.

506
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,280
We will

507
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,119
place a tea table here.

508
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,920
The color of these curtains
is not festive enough.

509
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,000
Change them.

510
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,640
Use red ones.

511
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
And this folding screen? Remove it.

512
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,359
And this place

513
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,119
should be the bed.

514
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:20,560
The duvet has to be cozy and
has a bright color.

515
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,319
Did you get everything?

516
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,319
Yes, I will see it done now.

517
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,479
Do you know what you need to get me now?

518
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,760
Yes.

519
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,920
All right. Now move.

520
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,439
Yes.

521
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,400
Miss Song Luo.

522
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
You serve Old Madam.

523
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,199
Can you tell me

524
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,479
why our Master took in a concubine
out of a sudden?

525
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,239
Where does she come from?

526
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,040
It's our Master's business.

527
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,359
Why do you want to know?

528
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,079
Right.

529
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,959
But Old Madam is over the moon today.

530
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,959
I'm curious about this concubine.

531
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,040
Isn't Old Madam's wish obvious?

532
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,839
She has always wanted our Master
to have a family.

533
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,119
Regardless of her background,

534
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,040
if she can impress our Master,
she is no ordinary woman.

535
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,560
Red and green,

536
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,520
they are the colors that suit
young women like you.

537
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,680
Look.

538
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,400
You look so much fairer in them.

539
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,719
How adorable.

540
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,359
Do you like them, Wan'er?

541
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,160
Mother,

542
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,319
she doesn't like them.

543
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,479
She prefers something plain.

544
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,640
I like whatever you pick,

545
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Old Madam.

546
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,079
Wan'er loves it.

547
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,680
I also have Huanhua fabric lying around.

548
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,640
Let me find it.

549
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,119
Why did you have
to turn your mother down?

550
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,000
Since we're acting,

551
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,000
just play along.

552
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,079
Are you willing to put on
those floral clothes then?

553
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:48,160
I can take one
for satisfying your mother.

554
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
I don't like you in them.

555
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,079
Look.

556
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,199
This is Huanhua fabric,

557
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,160
given by the Noble Consort.

558
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,319
I appreciate

559
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,119
your kindness, Old Madam.

560
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,079
Here.

561
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,199
I'll save all these fabrics

562
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,839
for you.

563
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,479
She is beautiful so she looks good
in anything.

564
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,880
A young woman should have many clothes.

565
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,000
And this

566
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:18,319
folding screen with dragon and phoenix.

567
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,319
Do you like it?

568
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,520
Embroidered by gold threads,

569
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,599
under the sunlight,

570
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,640
it sparkles like the ripples
on the lake surface.

571
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,920
I also have one with a couple
of lovebirds on it.

572
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,680
Do you want it?

573
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,880
Mother, she might feel dazed
when she wakes up then.

574
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,119
You don't get to decide.

575
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,400
Tell me, Wan'er.

576
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,359
Bring all of them in.

577
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,319
Mother,
when it comes to a folding screen,

578
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,400
she prefers a yarn folding screen.

579
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,040
Place a black soapstone ding
on the table

580
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,800
and hang the Hidden Gem Painting

581
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,119
that depicts how Judge Di tried to prove

582
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,280
his innocence.

583
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640
If you want to have clothes
made for her,

584
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,439
use Ruanyan silk given by His Majesty.

585
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,839
When did you

586
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,239
buy them?

587
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:13,839
Mother.

588
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,000
That's all for Wan'er room then.

589
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,439
I still have work to do.

590
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,040
Wan'er,

591
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,040
do you like these decorations?

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,839
His Lordship

593
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,119
did pick what I like.

594
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:39,239
It seems like he likes you a lot.

595
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,680
I don't think he even knows

596
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,479
what I like.

597
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,920
(Spring Hill)
I'm sure he does, Old Madam.

598
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm not angry.

599
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm really happy to know

600
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,040
that he cares a lot about you.

601
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,160
I have sent the servants here away.

602
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,839
It should be safe for now.

603
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,839
Just stay here then.

604
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,000
Last time when Qiu Yan and I hid here,

605
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,680
everything was in a rush

606
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,959
so I couldn't appreciate
the decor properly.

607
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,199
I promised your sister

608
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,239
that I would build her a library

609
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:39,280
that contains all storytelling scripts
about court cases.

610
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,800
I'm sure Qiu Yan

611
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,079
appreciates it

612
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,160
from high above.

613
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,359
All right.

614
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,520
Without any servant here,

615
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,640
you might run into some troubles.

616
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,520
Sorry for the inconvenience.

617
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,359
It is I who should apologize.

618
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,680
You took such a huge risk for me.

619
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,359
There's no inconvenience at all.

620
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,040
Don't apologize.

621
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,400
As long as I'm here,

622
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,760
you will be protected.

623
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:12,199
Besides, the Qiu family is innocent.

624
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm sure

625
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,040
you'll have your appeal one day.

626
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:35,400
Wan'er's order is like my order.

627
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,839
Whoever disrespects her,

628
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,680
disrespects me too.

629
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,959
You heard me?

630
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,239
Greetings, Concubine Su.

631
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,199
Concubine Su?

632
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,599
Lord Liang doesn't have a legal wife yet

633
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,719
so she should be Madam Su.

634
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,959
Greetings, Madam Su.

635
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,319
You're dismissed.

636
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,959
Yes, madam.

637
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,239
Wan'er. Come.

638
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:56,760
Let's have dinner.

639
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,199
Yi'er, bring some food for Wan'er.

640
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,640
Thanks, my lord.

641
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,239
Wan'er.

642
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,920
Don't you know Yi'er is allergic

643
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,160
to eggs?

644
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,719
That was when I was young.

645
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,599
I'm fine now.

646
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,239
Some more.

647
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,359
I'm fine.

648
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,800
It's so delicious.

649
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,880
Another bite, please.

650
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,719
Wan'er.

651
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:48,640
Have some too.

652
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,599
Okay.

653
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,199
Tell me what you like.

654
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,400
I'll have the chefs
prepare them for you.

655
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm not picky.

656
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,880
I like everything.

657
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Something just came to my mind.

658
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,040
I need to read an important document.

659
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,479
I have to go now.

660
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,760
But you barely ate.

661
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,000
I should go check up on him.

662
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,319
All right then.

663
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,839
I will have the servants

664
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,319
deliver the food to both of you then.

665
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,359
Thanks, Old Madam.

666
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,079
Are you all right?

667
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:31,599
You look so pale.

668
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,680
So you truly are allergic to eggs?

669
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:43,359
Since young, eating eggs has given me
an upset tummy.

670
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,000
I almost lost my life.

671
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,160
I'll summon the physician.

672
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,839
No!

673
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,719
I told my mother that it was gone now.

674
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,839
If you summon the physician,
she'll know it's a lie.

675
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:58,839
I can endure this.

676
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,680
Are you sure?

677
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm fine.

678
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,280
Wake up!

679
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,239
Liang Yi!

680
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,439
Oh, both of you are inseparable.

681
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,399
Song Luo, place the food here.

682
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,479
Don't disturb them.

683
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,479
Noted.

684
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,239
I just want to say

685
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,439
that

686
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,600
the food will be delivered to your room
from now on.

687
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,239
You two can dine together if you want.

688
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,360
No need to eat with me all the time.

689
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,280
Yes, Old Madam.

690
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:10,439
It seems like
I'll have grandchildren soon.

691
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,479
Song Luo.

692
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,320
You can retire now.

693
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,120
Noted.

694
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:34,120
Who would have thought

695
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,520
that the intimidating

696
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,199
inspector of the Firewood Office

697
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,840
is also afraid of something?

698
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,080
What did you say?

699
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,040
You woke up.

700
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,399
Are you all right?

701
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,320
Are you feeling better?

702
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,919
I'm a lot better now.

703
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,719
I said I had work to do,

704
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,199
didn't I?

705
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,439
I should head back then.

706
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,639
What's the matter?

707
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,120
Numb?

708
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,239
It's just steamed eggs.

709
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,600
Do you have to make me suffer too?

710
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,800
Stay.

711
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,520
Stimulate the acupuncture point
to get rid of it.

712
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:38,560
Old Madam.

713
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:41,600
You were here all the time?

714
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,840
No,

715
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:43,919
I just arrived.

716
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,199
Wan'er, it's late already.

717
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,600
Why haven't you two retired
to your room now?

718
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,320
His Lordship still has work to do.

719
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
This is unacceptable.

720
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,320
Yi'er!

721
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,360
Both of you just got married.

722
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,919
You can't possibly let her

723
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,399
spend the night alone.

724
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:06,000
She'll be the laughing stock here.

725
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,320
She doesn't mind.

726
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,919
Nonsense.

727
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,439
No girl

728
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,199
will want to spend
her first marital night alone.

729
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,080
Wan'er.

730
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Does it bother you?

731
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,840
You're so considerate, Old Madam.

732
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,600
It does,

733
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,919
actually.

734
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,080
Fine then.

735
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,439
Mother.

736
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:54,239
It's getting late now.

737
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,080
You should go to bed.

738
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,520
All right.

739
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,520
Both of you should go to bed early too.

740
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes, mother.

741
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:11,719
Oh,

742
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,040
I took a three-day leave for you.

743
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,360
Both of you should rest up here

744
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,919
during these three days.

745
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,360
How could you do...

746
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,840
My lord,

747
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,840
is Wan'er not as interesting
as those documents?

748
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,280
Of course, you are.

749
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,800
You must have had a long day.

750
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,360
Let's go to bed early

751
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,040
and make my mother proud.

752
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,000
Come.

753
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,080
Is she gone?

754
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,879
Yes.

755
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:43,560
What are you doing?

756
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,040
Someone's there.

757
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,080
She's gone.

758
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,959
Was it Song Luo?

759
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,080
So you noticed.

760
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,040
Song Luo serves Old Madam.

761
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,719
If she's just eavesdropping
for Old Madam, it's understandable.

762
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,879
But she's overdoing it.

763
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,439
When Old Madam was questioning me
during the day,

764
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,199
she dismissed all servants

765
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,879
but Song Luo used tea-serving
as an excuse

766
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:27,879
to linger in the forecourt.

767
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,600
It's just way too obvious.

768
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,919
Yuan Lang already planted
his spy in my residence.

769
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:33,879
For many years,

770
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,000
he hasn't done anything.

771
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,919
And now, it has begun.

772
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,959
If you know she's Yuan Lang's spy,

773
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,280
why not send her away?

774
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,239
Yuan Lang will find someone else
to replace her.

775
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,080
Letting her stay

776
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,199
means I can monitor my enemy in secret.

777
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
She's ready to be manipulated whenever.

778
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,399
So you're planning

779
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,520
to feed her false info

780
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,719
when the time comes?

781
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,600
Indeed.

782
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,959
Go to bed now.

783
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,080
Who did this?

784
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Who else?

785
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,800
Unlock the door tomorrow morning.

786
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,600
But not too early.

787
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,840
But how are they
supposed to relieve themselves?

788
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:48,080
My mother thought about this too.

789
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,000
What should we do?

790
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:01,560
Thank you, Lord Liang.

791
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,399
How polite of you.

792
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,159
You took me in out of kindness.

793
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,199
Naturally, I have to thank you.

794
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:11,320
Thanks for the sacrifice.

795
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,600
What?

796
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,399
I laid out your duvet already.

797
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,280
Goodnight.

798
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,560
You won't let me take the bed?

799
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,840
You want to watch me get changed too?

800
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,600
Qiu Min.

801
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:18,399
Qiu Min.

802
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,120
What's the matter?

803
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,679
Qin Xuan, the thunder is so loud.

804
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,360
I'm so scared.

805
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,439
It is quite loud.

806
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,679
I'm here to send you a blanket.

807
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,439
Autumn rain makes the day extra cold.

808
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,800
I don't want you to catch a cold
when you sleep.

809
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,080
Make sure you're covered.

810
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,520
I'll leave now.

811
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,439
Don't go, Qin Xuan.

812
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,919
Don't abandon me here.

813
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,800
Being alone in this spacious house

814
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:48,919
can be scary.

815
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,360
Can you keep me company?

816
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:53,919
Just this once?

817
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:56,000
You can leave when I fall asleep,

818
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,120
okay?
