(Double happiness)

3
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,680
I wonder what Young Master He

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,639
looks like.

5
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,080
Miss, aren't you curious
about him at all?

6
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,200
Mother has seen him before.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,400
She said he was a fine man.

8
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:38,919
I believe in Mother.

9
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,799
So Miss, have you given up
your search for the owner of this fan?

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:53,959
(Qiu Yan, Second Lady of Qiu Family)

11
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:54,799
(Qiu Yan, Second Lady of Qiu Family)
This is different.

12
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,680
This person is my benefactor.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Without him,

14
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,279
I wouldn't have been taken in
by the Qiu Family.

15
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,720
And I wouldn't have the chance
to learn how to read and write.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,080
But he only left this fan

17
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,720
and his title behind.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,480
The sky is high and the sea is vast.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,320
(Liang Yi, Head of Inspector)
Even if we meet again,

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,560
(of Firewood Office)
I'm sure he must've forgotten about me.

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,279
I'm sure he must've forgotten about me.

22
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,555

What's going on?

00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,160

-Yes.

Feng'er!

48
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,679
General He, your son was struck
by a sudden illness.

49
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,679
And the symptoms were life-threatening.

50
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,119
Sorry, but I cannot
do anything about it.

51
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Madam.

52
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,040

Feng'er!

Feng'er, wake up!

59
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,320
- My son!
- Rest in peace!

60
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,440
Madam.

61
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,799
Madam.

62
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,399
Miss,

63
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,880
what should we do?

64
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,040
Something's amiss.

65
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,399
I've seen dead people before
when I was young.

66
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,079
When they first die,
their limbs are flexible.

67
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,559
But he...

68
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,239
Yongzhong,

69
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,279
I know your residence has many things
to deal with right now.

70
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,720
My daughter will only create trouble
for you if she's here.

71
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,119
Why don't we bring her back for now?

72
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,200
That's right, General He.

73
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,279
What had happened today
was truly heartbreaking.

74
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,119
But at this moment,

75
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,279
even if we keep Yan'er here,

76
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,799
it doesn't help the situation.

77
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,239
We have brought back the dowries.

78
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,519
What?

79
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,200
Are you guys trying to
break off the engagement?

80
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,079
I am a boorish man.

81
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,320
Even so, I suppose I do not need
to teach you guys

82
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,959
(Qiu Yi, Second Master of Qiu Family)
about propriety.

83
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,281
(Han, Second Madam of Qiu Family)

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
When we got your daughter's hand,

85
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,640
the Six Etiquettes
and marriage certificate were all there.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
No matter if they had
consummated or not,

87
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,480
she is our daughter-in-law now.

88
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,920
If so, she needs to put on
a mourning appeal for my son.

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,920
But...

90
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,640
Let me do it.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,640
Your words do make sense.

92
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,839
But it was clearly stated
within the imperial laws.

93
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,880
If one party hides one's medical
history before the wedding is held,

94
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,519
the wedding can be canceled

95
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,679
once the truth has been discovered.

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,079
We did not know that your son
had contracted a terminal illness

97
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,320
before our daughter
married into your family.

98
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,359
And He, you have not
told us about it as well.

99
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,600
You are holding a wedding
to counteract his bad luck.

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,119
My son is not sick!

101
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,760
He died because your daughter
had jinxed him!

102
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,679
No.

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,160
What do you mean by that?

104
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,279
General He,

105
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,559
the two families had compared their
Eight Characters before the wedding.

106
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,760
How could you accuse us
without any proof?

107
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,200
Someone!

108
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,000
It's all because I was muddle-headed!

109
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,040
When I asked Madam Liu
about Miss Qiu's Eight Characters,

110
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,839
she said someone told her

111
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,559
that her daughter
was born with too much vigor.

112
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,560
She was afraid
that Miss Qiu's Eight Characters

113
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,559
might not match Young Master He's.

114
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,440
That's why she gave me 10 silver taels

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,119
and asked me
to alter Miss Qiu's hour of birth!

116
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,880
Miss Qiu's original Eight Characters

117
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,559
were supposed to
represent instability and harm.

118
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,359
She will bring misfortune and death
to her husband.

119
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,599
My good son

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,599
died because he was jinxed

121
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
by your unlucky daughter!

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
I have not settled
my debts with you yet.

123
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,479
But look at you two.

124
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,479
Now, you want to
take back your daughter?

125
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,239
Listen up.

126
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,559
Not only will I make her wear
a mourning appeal for my son,

127
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:55,479
but I will also let her
join my son in his grave!

128
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,440
Such nonsense!

129
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,799
What did Father and Mother say?

130
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,200
Madam wanted to argue with Master He,

131
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,280
but the He Family chased Madam
and Second Master out

132
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,479
as they had the upper hand.

133
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,479
Father is an educated person.

134
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,599
Naturally, he cannot do anything
about his encounter

135
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:11,760
with a military general like General He.

136
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,919
Qingdai, remove
the mourning appeal for me.

137
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,799
Yes, Miss.

138
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,880
From now on,

139
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,400
all personnel are only allowed to enter
the Li Residence without leaving.

140
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,320
Yes, sir.

141
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,400
What? Are you trying to raid my house?

142
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,400
Show me the imperial edict then!

143
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,080
The imperial edict is not necessary

144
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,200
when the Firewood Office
is completing its duty.

145
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,880
Liang Yi, how dare you surround my house

146
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,599
without an imperial edict?

147
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,919
My uncle is
the Minister of State Security!

148
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,906
(He Residence)

149
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,599
The backdoor has light security.
You need a pass to exit from there.

150
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,159
The front door is busy with
the mourning ceremony.

151
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,039
It is crowded and busy.

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,919
We may be able to sneak out
from there without a pass.

153
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,640
Let us go.

154
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,000
Slowly.

155
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,440
Be careful.

156
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,239
Slowly.

157
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,400
What is your name?

158
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,640
I have not seen you before.

159
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,440
Such audacity! How dare you
question us from Master's chambers?

160
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:23,359
(He Residence)

161
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,799
Miss, please pardon me.
I'm just doing my duty.

162
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,599
But we have seen all the servants

163
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,559
in Master's chamber before.

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,880
So you two are?

165
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,919
We joined the residence yesterday.

166
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,239
Our names are not on the name list yet.

167
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,039
If you do not believe me,

168
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,359
Master is in the courtyard.

169
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,559
You can follow us
and ask Master personally.

170
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,479
I dare not do so!

171
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,000
Miss, please go ahead.

172
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,200
Let us go.

173
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,320
Young Madam!

174
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,559
Have you guys seen Young Madam?

175
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,280
Run!

176
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,119
This is bad! After them!

177
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,119
Qingdai, run!

178
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,599
Hurry, Qingdai!

179
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,840
Qingdai, let's split up!

180
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,520
Run over there!

181
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,359
Okay!

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,960
Stop right there!

183
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
- Stop running!
- Excuse me!

184
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,799
Stop right there! Make way!

185
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,479
- Go over there!
- Let's go!

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,479
Over there! Capture her!

187
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,719
Capture her!

188
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,679
Sir! Please save me!

189
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,679
My father is dead!

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
My stepmother is going to sell me
to a slave trader!

191
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,840
I have an aunt who works as a servant
in the Qiu Residence at Pomelo Alley.

192
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,520
Sir,

193
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,440
I know you guys are here to rid
the world of evil and serve the people.

194
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,719
Please do something about this!

195
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,359
Please bring me to the Qiu Family
so that I can find my aunt!

196
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,359
I will never

197
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,919
forget your kindness!

198
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,880
Song Jin, send Official Li
to the Firewood Office.

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,559
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,640
Let us go.

201
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,119
Sir, please save me.

202
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,799
Your hairpin is made from
top-quality jade.

203
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,239
Ordinary people
cannot get their hands on this.

204
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,239
Your fingers are thin and slender.

205
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,159
It seems that you have never
done any chores before.

206
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,479
Move aside.

207
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,440
Sir, that's not it!

208
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,200
Sir!

209
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,760
She is over there! Capture her!

210
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,200
Stop right there!

211
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,599
Don't run!

212
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,559
Don't run!

213
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,840
Stop right there!

214
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
- Stop right there!
- Don't run!

215
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,719
Stop right there!

216
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,640
Stop right there!

217
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,760
Miss!

218
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,400
Madam is here to receive you!
Get on the carriage!

219
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,387
Over here! Be careful.

220
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:53,479
- Give me your hand.
- Let's go!

221
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,520
Come, get on.

222
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,000
Mother!

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,559
Slowly.

224
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,760
Father, let's go.

225
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:03,840
Where is she?

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,880
Let's return and report this to Master.

227
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,840
Yan'er ran away from the He Residence.

228
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,280
I'm afraid

229
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:13,919
this is not an appropriate act.

230
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,799
If so,

231
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,960
I will apologize to them later.

232
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,960
The He Family has already said

233
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,320
that they wanted Yan'er
to pay with her life.

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
What can she do
if she does not run away?

235
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,599
Don't tell me you want the He Family

236
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,880
to bury her alive?

237
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
(Chastity)

238
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,109
(Chastity Above All Else)

239
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,159
Mother!

240
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,200
Father has brought back Qiu Yan
from the He Residence!

241
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,983
(Madam Liu, Qiu Yi's concubine)

242
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,960
I am sure your father

243
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,239
has told General He that he intends
to break off the engagement.

244
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,799
This is better.

245
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:23,000
(Qiu Rong, son of Madam Liu)
Doesn't that mean my future is ruined?

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,479
I was planning to ask General He

247
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,520
to make me an inspector
for the Censorate.

248
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,719
This is great.

249
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,640
Now that Qiu Yan's marital engagement
has been called off,

250
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,159
my plan is ruined!

251
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,159
I will think of other solutions for you.

252
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
If it doesn't work,

253
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
let's search for other positions,

254
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,320
okay?

255
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,840
No!

256
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,119
I have already told the others
about my plan.

257
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,280
How can I face them now?

258
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,200
Mother,

259
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,719
you must come up with something.

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,359
You must convince Father.

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,039
You mustn't let him call off

262
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Qiu Yan's marital engagement.

263
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,159
She's your sister.

264
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,320
Do you intend for her to be a widow?

265
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,039
This...

266
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,640
Madam, Second Master is back.

267
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,520
You may leave.

268
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,840
My lord, what exactly happened
to the wedding with the He Residence?

269
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,359
Kneel!

270
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
I told you to kneel!

271
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,000
Father, what did Mother do wrong?

272
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,479
Shut up! Scram!

273
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,679
My lord.

274
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,359
Who gave you the audacity to do so?

275
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,599
How dare you alter Qiu Yan's
hour of birth in secret?

276
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,559
I was intending

277
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,479
to discuss this matter with General He
in his residence

278
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,599
so that I could call off the engagement.

279
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,799
In the end, they have the goods on us!

280
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:50,320
The Qiu Family was humiliated
because of your action!

281
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,239
My lord, my intention was kind.

282
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,599
I didn't want Qiu Yan's relationship

283
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,000
to be ruined because of
her Eight Characters.

284
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,320
Her relationship?

285
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,320
The He Residence wants Qiu Yan
to pay with her life.

286
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
You're sending my daughter to her grave!

287
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,239
Look at you!

288
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,119
I...

289
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:18,359
Ever since the era of Emperor Taizu,

290
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,320
we have adopted the tradition of burying
the living with the dead.

291
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,400
It was fine if he passed away
because of an illness.

292
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,960
But He Feng was jinxed to death
by Qiu Yan

293
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,919
because her Eight Characters
were altered.

294
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:31,840
(Old Madam Qiu, Qiu Residence)

295
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,919
That's enough.

296
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,919
Get straight to the point.

297
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,119
Rush me...

298
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm trying to rush you right now.

299
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,463
(Qiu Ning, Third Master of Qiu Family)
Even if you rush me,

300
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,159
I have to finish my words.

301
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,919
Now, in order to protect
the Qiu Family's reputation,

302
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,119
she should follow
her late husband to his grave.

303
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:45,880
(Qian, Third Madam of Qiu Family)
To...

304
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,640
To show her loyalty.

305
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,000
That's right.

306
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,880
Third Brother,

307
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,880
the He Family had hidden the fact that
He Feng was terminally ill.

308
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,960
(Jiang, First Madam of Qiu Family)
Now that he's gone,

309
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,640
they had to drag my daughter down.

310
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,233
(Mi, Fourth Madam of Qiu Family)

311
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,599
General He is a well-decorated general

312
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,479
who had helped His Majesty
to conquer the world.

313
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,320
His son is protecting the border.

314
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,959
He is popular within the imperial court.

315
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:06,320
(Qiu Hong, Fourth Master of Qiu Family)

316
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,800
Second Madam, if you're only concerned
about your personal ties with her,

317
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,000
that means you're sacrificing
the Qiu Family for your desire!

318
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,880
Yan'er.

319
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,920
Yan'er.

320
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,719
Yan'er, it's all my fault.

321
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,880
I thought

322
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,599
you would lead a luxurious life
once you were married into

323
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,719
the wealthy and illustrious He Family.

324
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,239
I didn't expect He Feng
to die on us just like that!

325
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,199
Just forget it.

326
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,079
Madam, even if you cry your heart out,

327
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
it won't make the situation better.

328
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,199
I won't blame you for this.

329
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,719
If Rong'er were half as sensible as you,

330
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,040
maybe I wouldn't suffer this much
in this family.

331
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,520
I know.

332
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,640
You had always blamed me
for being biased.

333
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,839
But until today, I finally realized

334
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,599
that sons aren't always
superior to daughters.

335
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,359
You should eat something.

336
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,239
You're such a sensible girl!

337
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,079
Why must you suffer a fate like this?

338
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Madam, you don't need to worry too much.

339
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,239
Even if they want to bury me alive,
they need my permission.

340
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,119
If I don't give them my permission,

341
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,160
they can't just rush into my house
and bring me back by force.

342
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,920
You may not know about this,

343
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,959
but they're discussing whether
to send you back to the He Residence

344
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,479
in the Old Madam's chamber!

345
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,040
I don't believe it.

346
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,479
It's true.

347
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,479
Madam Xu told me personally.

348
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,959
Are you saying

349
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
that Father, Mother,

350
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,319
Grandmother, Uncle, and Aunt

351
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,119
are going to stand there
and look as I die?

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,079
Naturally, your father and Second Madam
don't agree to it.

353
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,400
But they have to
think for the Qiu Family.

354
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,400
Yan'er, in my opinion,

355
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,199
I think you shouldn't wait for them
to send you there.

356
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,680
You should return there by yourself.

357
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,719
You should return and
try to coax General He.

358
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,000
What if I fail to coax him?

359
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,839
Does that mean I need to die together
with He Feng?

360
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,760
You were always a witty girl, right?

361
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,479
Back then, when you first
joined our residence,

362
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,959
you made Han so furious

363
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,839
that she wanted to hit you
with a paddle.

364
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,239
But after that, you managed to coax her

365
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,839
into doting you.

366
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,319
You can take down
even the vilest of people.

367
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,520
If you manage to coax them,

368
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,920
you might not need to
join him in his grave.

369
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
By the way, once He Feng's funeral

370
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,520
is over,

371
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,439
you should adopt a son
from the first chamber.

372
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,599
With a son,

373
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,199
you'll be able to make it in the future.

374
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,920
Madam, I'm sure you said that

375
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
for Rong'er's sake.

376
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,000
Just now, you said sons
aren't always superior to daughters.

377
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
In the end,

378
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,079
to you, daughters are just pawns
that can be sacrificed.

379
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,359
Yan'er!

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yan'er!

381
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,000
I know it's been tough on you.

382
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,959
But it's even tougher for me!

383
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
As women, we only live

384
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,160
to serve our husbands, children,
and families.

385
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,119
Madam,

386
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,760
that's you.

387
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
I'm different from you.

388
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,959
Yan'er!

389
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,359
I know you aren't a selfish person!

390
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:41,000
Yan'er, I know you didn't mean
what you said!

391
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm sure you won't
leave your own brother to die!

392
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,199
(Hall of Nostalgia)
Since we're a family,

393
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,839
Second Brother, Second Madam,

394
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,160
I would like to apologize to you two

395
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,959
on my husband's behalf.

396
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,040
This reminds me of the time

397
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,199
when Lord Qiu had passed away.

398
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:12,760
Old Mistress joined him
in his grave as well.

399
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,119
Even now, they are praised
for their undying love.

400
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,239
But whether Old Mistress was happy
about it was a different thing.

401
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,239
Han.

402
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,800
We should focus on the bigger picture.

403
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,439
Now, I bear the fate of
the entire family on my shoulder.

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
I am flattered.

405
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,920
Yan'er, why are you here
when the adults are talking?

406
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Leave now.

407
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,359
I'll die when I head to
the He Residence anyway.

408
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,959
Rules don't matter
when I'm about to die.

409
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,839
You guys are saying that
the second chamber is unfilial.

410
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,439
But when it comes to being unfilial,

411
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,719
my two uncles
deserve to be on the top spot.

412
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Third Uncle, as a student of
the Imperial College,

413
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,280
studying was the thing you focused on.

414
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,400
But you had never won any
scholarly honor for many years.

415
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,839
You have never earned money as well.

416
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,599
The residence has to support you
for your expenditures,

417
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,359
not to mention for you to be filial
to Old Madam.

418
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,040
So Third Uncle,
do you think you're filial?

419
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,400
This...

420
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,199
Why are you saying that
when she's asking you a question?

421
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,640
This is outrageous!

422
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,400
And Fourth Uncle,

423
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
not only do you idle around,

424
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,680
but you also visited brothels and
drank liquor during Lord Qiu's

425
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,040
mourning period.

426
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,160
You were reported to
the imperial censor.

427
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,599
My father had to handle
the aftermath for you.

428
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,079
So Fourth Uncle,
do you think you're filial?

429
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,079
Such nonsense!

430
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,839
I had already advised you

431
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,359
to act more prudently.

432
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
But you didn't listen to me.

433
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,079
Now, you're lectured by your own niece.

434
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,079
You've brought shame to our ancestors!

435
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:34,760
That's enough!

436
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,199
Tell me!

437
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,319
Qiu Yan, are you done?

438
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,439
No further discussions are allowed.

439
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,160
Qiu Yan will be sent to the He Residence
by tomorrow morning.

440
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,800
Old Madam!

441
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,439
Old Madam, this is bad!

442
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,079
What's wrong?

443
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,959
Something happened
in the ancestral hall!

444
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:03,072
(Memorial tablet of Xiao Qingrong,
wife of Qiu)

445
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,079
What's going on?

446
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,640
When I passed by the ancestral hall,

447
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,319
I realized that the door was open.

448
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,359
I thought someone had sneaked into
the ancestral hall.

449
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,439
When I went in to check it out,

450
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,959
I realized that the Old Mistress's
memorial tablet

451
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,719
was bleeding.

452
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,400
Old Mistress is making her appearance!

453
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,599
Third Brother.

454
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,424
(Memorial tablet of Xiao Qingrong,
wife of Qiu)

455
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,319
In my opinion,

456
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,959
it doesn't look like
Old Mistress is here.

457
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,319
It's more like the trick

458
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,280
charlatans used to deceive others.

459
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,599
Second Brother.

460
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,439
Don't tell me the second chamber

461
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,560
is behind this incident?

462
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,640
Did you see any suspects?

463
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,680
I didn't.

464
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,963
(Memorial tablet of Xiao Qingrong,
wife of Qiu)

465
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,719
All right.

466
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,959
All of you may wait outside.

467
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,199
Yan, stay here.

468
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I have something to tell you.

469
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,280
Let's go.

470
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,599
You should leave too.

471
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,119
Yes, Madam.

472
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,319
Yan.

473
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:08,439
Tell me. What do you think?

474
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,959
I think Old Mistress feels sorry for me
after she knew that I was going

475
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,280
to be buried alive.

476
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,319
She died in the same way as well.

477
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,040
Why should she feel sorry for you?

478
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,119
I'm afraid Old Mistress was unsatisfied
with the way she died.

479
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,719
That's why she feels sorry for me.

480
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,400
So according to you,

481
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,719
are you saying that someone forced her
to join her late husband?

482
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,160
I heard that Old Mistress
was a subservient woman.

483
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,920
I think she didn't dare to seek revenge

484
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,839
even if she had faced injustices.

485
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,319
But it's different for me.

486
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,040
If I suffer the same fate as her,

487
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,400
I will surely turn into
a terrifying ghost.

488
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,400
I would haunt those
who had caused my demise.

489
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,479
This matter is...

490
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
- If I must say...
- Old Madam is here.

491
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,560
Old Madam.

492
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,319
I've given it some thought.

493
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,959
After all, Yan is part of
the Qiu Family.

494
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,119
We can't let her return
to the He Residence

495
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,800
and let her life go to waste.

496
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,920
But the He Family
is right in the first place.

497
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,040
They will never agree to
the engagement cancellation.

498
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:28,599
Now, we need to ask someone
to plead for us.

499
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:29,920
Mother,

500
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,800
who should we ask?

501
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,479
I've thought about it.

502
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,199
The Crown Prince is our only choice.

503
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,680
The Crown Prince?

504
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,599
Mother,

505
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,319
the Crown Prince and I
aren't affiliated in any way.

506
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,719
And this is a family matter.

507
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm afraid...

508
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,280
Your father was once
His Highness's mentor.

509
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,040
Although he was only his mentor
for half a year,

510
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,280
His Highness is honest, kind,

511
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
and loyal.

512
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,800
I think His Highness
still feels indebted to our lord.

513
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,959
His Highness won't
leave us in the lurch.

514
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,359
Enough.

515
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
It's decided then.

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,880
Yes.

517
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:15,400
Yan'er.

518
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Mother.

519
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,599
This is great.

520
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,520
This is great.

521
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,560
I'm so exhausted.

522
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760
I'll make your bed for you.

523
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,520
Qingdai, I want to commend you
for your bravery.

524
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
I would've been done for

525
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,719
without you.

526

(Memorial tablet of Xiao Qingrong,
wife of Qiu)

528
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:24,793
(Memorial tablet of Xiao Qingrong,
wife of Qiu)

529
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,880
I will rewrite the memorial tablet

530
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
of Old Mistress with top-quality ink

531
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,160
when I have the chance.

532
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,239
Miss,

533
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
I don't understand.

534
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:37,439
Of all the memorial tablets,

535
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,199
why must you use the
Old Mistress's memorial tablet?

536
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,839
Isn't Lord Qiu's memorial tablet

537
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,359
more convincing to use?

538
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,239
It's because I will only
acquire Old Madam's trust

539
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,000
by using Old Mistress's memorial tablet.

540
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,719
But why?

541
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,119
You have never seen Old Mistress before.

542
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,680
Because of guilt.

543
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Since Mother said

544
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,079
that Old Mistress might be unsatisfied
with the way she died,

545
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,400
that means

546
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,719
someone forced Old Mistress to do so.
Who else do you think

547
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,199
have the capability to do so?

548
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,359
Even if Old Madam suspects

549
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,839
that someone is behind the act,

550
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,280
to ease her guilty conscience,

551
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,040
she has no choice but to believe in it.

552
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:18,800
Miss,

553
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,280
you're really intelligent.

554
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,520
I'm not intelligent.

555
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,160
I just read the Confucian classics

556
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,839
and managed to understand
how the human hearts work.

557
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,640
Okay, you should go and rest now.

558
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,439
Okay.

559
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,079
Thank you for teaching me the importance
of reading and writing.

560
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,560
You had saved me again.

561
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,949

as the Luan Bird soars freely in the sky.)

562
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,640
Promise me this.

563
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,079
You should only leave the residence

564
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,319
once you can read all of the characters.

565
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,280
What's your name?

566
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,280
I don't know your name.

567
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,160
My name is on the fan.

568
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,400
You'll know when you can read.

as the Luan Bird soars freely in the sky.)

571
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:42,760
(The Firewood Office)
Liang Yi,

572
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:45,680
at least I'm a fourth-rank official.

573
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,520
How dare you lynch me?

574
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:48,719
When I'm out,

575
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,400
I will surely report your atrocious deed
to His Majesty!

576
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,760
Official Li, although you're
a low-rank official,

577
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,959
you're daring enough to send
a secret memorial

578
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,400
to report the Firewood Office
to His Majesty.

579
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,199
I admire

580
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
your courage.

581
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,160
You know this as well.

582
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I remember you described me as

583
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,439
as a ruthless guard
who practices torture,

584
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,800
a lackey who fawns upon his superiors,

585
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,479
an arrogant individual,

586
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,239
and a stubborn dog.

587
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,959
No matter where the prey is hiding,

588
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
I can find them.

589
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,239
Official Li, I'll treat them as praises.

590
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,359
Liang Yi, don't be too happy yet.

591
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
When you were in charge of
the Firewood Office,

592
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,760
you've framed and harmed
many innocent officials.

593
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,920
Even Duke Lu couldn't
escape your clutch!

594
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,000
The imperial court had enough of you!

595
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,239
Even if I die in your hands today,

596
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,280
others will seek revenge for me!

597
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,839
You've embezzled 30,000 taels
from the military provisions.

598
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,079
Do you still consider yourself
as an innocent official?

599
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,280
Or, are you saying

600
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,359
that I made this account book myself?

601
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,239
This...

602
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,000
Speak.

603
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,160
Who instructed you

604
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,680
to write this secret memorial?

605
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,199
Sir, your guess was correct.

606
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,000
The Ministry of War
is behind this again.

607
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,439
The people of the Ministry of War
aren't silly.

608
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,400
Their good days will end

609
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,079
when we reorganize
the military structure.

610
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,400
Of course they're upset about it.

611
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,680
How many times have I told you?

612
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,719
If the civil officials
and imperial censors see this,

613
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,880
they'll say that the Firewood Office
is the devil's pit again.

614
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I'll change my outfit then.

615
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,280
Sir, those imperial censors

616
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,760
don't do anything at all.

617
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,359
All they do is point their fingers at us

618
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,760
and create trouble for us.

619
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,280
Even His Majesty and the Crown Prince
can't do anything about them.

620
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,640
We have no choice
but to bear with them.

621
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,439
His Majesty has always been kind
to his officials.

622
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,920
The Crown Prince's foothold
isn't stable yet.

623
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,359
He must keep a low profile.

624
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,839
Is that why we're doing
all of the dirty work?

625
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,839
Sir!

626
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,880
This is an edict from the Crown Prince.

627
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:05,320
(Although they are my subordinates,
the conflict between Qiu and He)

628
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,559
(is not what I expect.
Hope you can resolve it in a proper way.)

629
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,959
The Crown Prince is asking you

630
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,239
to resolve the conflict
between the Qiu Family and He Family?

631
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,359
This is an arduous task. You will offend
one of the families no matter what.

632
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
I do think

633
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,160
this is a rare opportunity.

634
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,280
A rare opportunity?

635
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,920
It's obvious that the Qiu Family
comes from a line of clean officials.

636
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,719
The head of the He Family is a general

637
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,160
who has been through life-or-death
situations together with His Majesty.

638
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,400
Sir, if you try to resolve this case,

639
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,319
no matter what you do,

640
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,680
you'll offend one of the families.

641
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
You're really dumb.

642
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
When will you become smarter?

643
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,760
Now, we wish to infiltrate the military

644
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,959
in order to curb corruption.

645
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,560
We need the He Family's support.

646
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,920
I was fretting over the fact

647
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,959
that the He Family might not support us.

648
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,640
If we offend the Qiu Family,

649
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,839
at most, we'll only be insulted
by the literati of the country.

650
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,079
But now,

651
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,359
we must obtain the He Family's support.

652
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,000
That means the girl from Qiu Family
will suffer a terrible fate.

653
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,560
You do have a tender spot for women.

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,679
I'm a boorish man. I do not speak well.

656
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,360
Even so, I know an unspoken rule.

657
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:13,320
It's reasonable to demand
a life for another life.

658
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,879
Yongzhong,

659
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,639
your son had already passed away.

660
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,439
Why bother?

661
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,959
Lord Liang.

662
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,040
Lord Liang,
you should say something.

663
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Since the Crown Prince had assigned me
to be your mediator,

664
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,199
I had no choice

665
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,080
but to offend one of you today.

666
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,760
Official Qiu, I know it's unfair
for your daughter,

667
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,840
but should Young Master He
die for nothing then?

668
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,360
Lord Liang, you're wise indeed.

669
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,560
Lord Liang,

670
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,639
I have nothing to argue.

671
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,840
But please spare my daughter's life.

672
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,360
She's still young.

673
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,080
Speaking of which, it's our fault
as her parents.

674
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,879
Lord Liang has made himself clear.

675
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,800
Qiu, you should send Qiu Yan
back to my residence by today.

676
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,879
Mr. He, I'm not finished yet.

677
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,120
Although it's disgraceful for the
Qiu Family to call off the engagement,

678
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,439
it's unsuitable for you
to send their daughter

679
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,199
to join her late husband's grave.

680
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,719
Lord Liang, what do you mean?

681
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,919
Taking a step back

682
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,399
is the golden mean.

683
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,239
Why don't we make her a nun

684
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,719
and let her fulfill her mourning duties
at Jingyun Convent?

685
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,280
She can pray for He Feng.

686
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,919
He Feng will be blessed by her actions.

687
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,360
But that punishment
is too light for her!

688
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,520
To die for one's husband

689
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,199
is what a wife should do!

690
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,800
Even if we have to bring this matter
to His Majesty,

691
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,159
I'm afraid
I will have the edge over him.

692
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,959
Mr. He,

693
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,040
as the saying goes,
don't push someone to the wall.

694
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,959
We need to be lenient
wherever it is possible.

695
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,840
Two of you are officials
of the same court.

696
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,719
Both of you are
His Majesty's trusted aides.

697
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,840
If you two get into a fight,

698
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,120
His Majesty will be worried.

699
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,919
And I would fail to complete
the duty assigned to me by His Highness.

700
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,760
Yongzhong.

701
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,199
Thank you, Lord Liang.

702
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,239
Mr. He, sorry about that.

703
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,027
(Pavillion of Effort)

704
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,560
Sir, I don't understand.

705
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,040
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

706
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,560
General He was clearly unhappy

707
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,959
when he left the place.

708
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:55,840
Sir, you...

709
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,080
Sir, if you don't tell me anything,

710
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,959
I won't be able to become smarter.

711
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,399
Do you still remember the girl

712
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,040
we saved in Yuezhou six years ago?

713
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,360
Tie up that lass!

714
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,719
Let's sell her to the slave trader!

715
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,439
Now that I think about it,

716
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,919
I think that girl from the Qiu Family
is almost at her age.

717
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,919
So what has that little girl

718
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,040
(Pavillion of Effort)
got to do with this case?

719
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,719
I suddenly think

720
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,360
that the girl is just like
the Qiu Family's daughter.

721
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,320
Both of them are human lives.

722
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,080
So Sir you do have some
petty kindness within you.

723
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,239
Don't speak if you don't know
how to use the words.

724
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,000
But now,

725
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,280
we've offended the He Family entirely.

726
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,199
We can only wait for
another opportunity.

727
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,600
(Qiu Min, Third Lady of Qiu Family)

728
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,560
Jingyun Convent is a great place.

729
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,239
Jingyun Convent is a place
where they take in women

730
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:26,760
who are performing their filial duties
for their late husbands.

731
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,239
Yan'er won't be lonely
if she goes there.

732
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,000
Madam Liu,

733
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,239
you should leave.

734
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,120
Father,

735
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,919
must I go there?

736
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:01,679
Yan'er,

737
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:05,360
this is the best situation
I can ask for with my capability.

738
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,360
At least your life was spared.

739
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,959
But living in Jingyun Convent is as good

740
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,719
as dying.

741
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,879
If I liked He Feng,

742
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,760
when he's dead,

743
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,520
I'm willing to be a vegetarian
and pray for him every day.

744
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,879
I would be willing to do so
for the rest of my life.

745
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,919
But I don't even know who he is.

746
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,719
I have never even spoken to him before.

747
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,840
Father, I'm not satisfied.

748
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,399
Qiu Yan,

749
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
we cannot

750
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,639
dictate our own fate.

751
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,879
But I don't believe

752
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,360
that I have to suffer like this
for the rest of my life.

753
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,399
Yan'er,

754
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,879
this decision is made by

755
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,800
the current Marquis Wenyuan, who is
also the head of the Firewood Office.

756
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:41,000
You don't get to make the call here.

757
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Your mother and I,

758
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,199
we have done everything we could

759
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:45,800
to ease your punishment.

760
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:48,239
I've spent a lot of effort

761
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,959
to procure such a result.

762
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,919
If you do think of us as your parents,

763
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,520
you should stop making things
difficult for us.

764
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Father, I wish to join the palace.

765
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,239
Join the palace?

766
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:06,959
That's right.

767
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,840
I wish to be a palace maid and
make it as a female official.

768
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:11,760
The inner court of the imperial palace

769
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:13,679
houses the 6 Courts and 24 Sectors.

770
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,479
You once said

771
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,919
that they hire single women
who can read and do calculations

772
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,120
as female officials.

773
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:22,560
The Noble Consort's birthday
is arriving.

774
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,280
Last month, she issued an edict

775
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,840
to invite the officials
and their families.

776
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,360
Mother was also invited
to the celebration.

777
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,120
As long as Mother
is willing to bring me along,

778
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,840
I have a way to impress Her Highness.

779
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,840
You're asking for the moon here.

780
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,520
Min'er is right.

781
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,760
Yan'er, you're asking for the moon.

782
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,560
We have already made our decision.

783
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:43,719
You cannot

784
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,120
bargain with us.

785
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,360
Father,

786
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,879
I listened to you back then.

787
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,080
Even if I have never met He Feng before,

788
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,360
even if I don't know what he looks like,

789
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,760
I said yes to the wedding

790
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,159
just because of my respect for you.

791
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,040
When I was in the palanquin,

792
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,239
I was thinking to myself

793
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,800
that I must be a good daughter-in-law
when I married into the He Family.

794
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,719
I wanted to make you and Mother proud.

795
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,639
But now, I have to become a nun
and fulfill my mourning duties

796
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,560
even before we had consummated.

797
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,719
Father,

798
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,760
I know you have done your best

799
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,879
in front of Marquis Wenyuan.

800
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,800
I don't wish to make things
difficult for the family as well.

801
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,679
I wish to join the palace

802
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,600
and find a way to survive by myself.

803
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,360
Father, I beg you!

804
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,320
Yan'er, come.

805
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,800
Get up.

806
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:26,560
Get up.

807
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,560
My lord, you should let Yan'er

808
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,679
try her luck.

809
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,360
Father.

810
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,439
I wonder if your sister

811
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,840
had already prepared the gift?

812
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,879
She didn't want me to interrupt.

813
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,639
I hope she can pass the test

814
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,360
and serve Noble Consort.

815
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,040
Mother, are you really going to bring
Qiu Yan into the palace tomorrow?

816
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,879
Of course.

817
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,320
Mother, do you really think that
Qiu Yan can join the palace?

818
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,879
Since ancient times, women
were buried alive together

819
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:45,560
with their late husbands or
they remained as widows.

820
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,719
Qiu Yan is just unlucky.

821
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,600
Mother, why are you being
so lenient to her?

822
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,520
Maybe it's because

823
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,639
she had never believed

824
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:03,159
in predestined fate.

825
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,800
Even if it's predestined,

826
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:07,639
she will do everything she can

827
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:09,520
to grab the last straw.

828
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,520
She will never admit defeat.

829
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,800
When I see a child like her,

830
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,199
I couldn't help but feel for her.

831
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,719
I wish to help her achieve
the unachievable.

832
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,280
I don't understand.

833
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:31,840
Silly girl,

834
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,879
you don't need

835
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,760
to understand everything.

836
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:42,360
I hope you will never
need to understand them.

837
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

838
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,759
(Noble Consort Guo)

839
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,000
All of you, have a seat.

840
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

841
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:42,120
A few days ago, I asked
His Majesty about

842
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,479
the people who manage
the imperial court alongside him.

843
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,479
His Majesty told me that
it was his subordinates

844
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,639
from the Three Departments
and Six Ministries.

845
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,520
The members of the Hanlin Imperial Academy
draw up his declarations for him.

846
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,800
All of you are
members of their families.

847
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,320
Since today is my birthday,

848
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,840
I wish to meet all of you.

849
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,639
Since ancient times,

850
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,600
when a wife serves her husband,

851
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,040
she needs to take care of

852
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,639
more than his basic living conditions.

853
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,080
I serve His Majesty day and night.

854
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,840
The people's livelihood is our priority.

855
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,840
I hope that all of you can encourage

856
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,840
your husbands
to serve the imperial court better

857
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:21,239
when you return.

858
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,199
Yes, Your Highness.

859
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,959
Now, Han will present her gift.

860
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:41,239
Your Highness, I heard that you liked
Fan Kuan's Snowy Scene of Wintry Trees.

861
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,399
That's why I've turned the painting into

862
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,280
a mother of pearl inlay lacquer screen.

863
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,840
It can serve as a decoration.

864
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,239
I heard that the Qiu Family
comes from a line of clean officials.

865
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,560
Even your gift has an elegance to it.

866
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,840
I like it very much.

867
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,879
Her Highness will reward you.

868
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

869
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,280
Your Highness.

870
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,560
My daughter, Qiu Yan,
has always admired you.

871
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,479
When she heard that
I was bringing her here,

872
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,879
she stayed up overnight
to prepare a simple gift

873
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,360
for Your Highness
as a token of her appreciation.

874
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,159
Your Highness, please do not blame her.

875
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,080
What is it?

876
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,719
Such audacity!

877
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,159
How dare you take
Her Highness for a fool?
