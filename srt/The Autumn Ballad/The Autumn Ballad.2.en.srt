=Episode 2=

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,120
What's going on?

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,480
How dare she!

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,960
-Such audacity.
-Yes.

21
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,319
Such audacity!

22
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,080
How dare you take
Her Highness for a fool?

23
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:03,040
The Qiu Family must be muddle-headed.

24
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,120
How dare they enter the palace
with a stupid rock as a gift?

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,880
Qiu Yan, is there any deeper meaning

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
to this rock of yours?

27
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,000
Your Highness, this is
the representation of you in my heart.

28
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,199
Such audacity!

29
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,440
How dare you offend Her Highness?

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,279
Your Highness,
please pardon her ignorance.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,160
Finish your sentence.

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,639
Since young,

33
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,600
I have heard about Your Highness's story
from my mother.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,279
When I heard that
I was coming to the palace,

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,919
I'd searched all points of interests

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,880
before

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,520
I could find the mystical rock
that represents Your Highness.

38
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,119
According to the Instructions For
The Inner Quarters,

39
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,839
to seek no wealth and be unadorned
will build one's moral character.

40
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,639
Your Highness, that's why

41
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,720
I think you have a dignified and simple
appearance, just like this rock.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,679
According to the Instructions For
The Inner Quarters,

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,440
being reserved and quiet constitutes
one part of a woman's moral nature.

44
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:10,399
Just like how the inside of this rock
represents quietness,

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,639
men represent heaven
while women represent earth.

46
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,000
The rock is a representation of women

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,440
as we endure the heavy storm
and rain in silence.

48
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,839
You're a witty girl.

49
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,279
What reward do you want?

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Your Highness,

51
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,919
if you must reward me, please reward me
with a wish.

52
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,960
My father was lucky enough
to serve His Majesty.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
I wish to join the palace

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,479
and fulfill
my father's loyal duty for him.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,080
So

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,240
do you wish to be under me?

57
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,679
Your Highness, I will obey your command.

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,880
If I can stay by Your Highness's side

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,520
and learn,

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,559
I will have no regrets in life.

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,839
You may return and wait for my order.

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

63
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,839
Thank you, Your Highness.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,119
Zhou will present her gift now.

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
It's impossible for the gift

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,640
to disappear without a reason.

67
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,079
Mother,

68
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm afraid someone who's on good terms
with the He Family

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,760
has hidden it on purpose.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,959
The walls have ears. We'll talk about it
when we return.

71
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,000
Why have they prepared two gifts?

72
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,119
This is the gift prepared by Han,
first wife of Qiu Yi,

73
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,239
the Vice Minister of
the Ministry of Works.

74
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,640
As for this, this is prepared by
Qiu Yan, eldest daughter

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,839
of Qiu Yi.

76
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,760
Qiu Yan?

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Is she General He's daughter-in-law?

78
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,480
The one who was supposed to be a nun?

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,279
She's Qiu Yi's eldest daughter.

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I think you're right.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
On the front, it looked like

82
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,720
the view where Her Highness was enjoying
the scenery together with His Majesty

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,519
during the Lantern Festival.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,128
(Instructions For The Inner Quarters)

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,720
On the back, it's the Instructions
For The Inner Quarters compiled by Her Highness.

86
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,720
Replacing ink with stitches,

87
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,079
she embroiders the entire thing
on the back of it.

88
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,799
She wants to show that
she's knowledgeable

89
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,040
and good at embroidery at the same time.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,640
The settings and objects
are well-arranged.

91
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,040
It's obvious that she has the skill
of an artisan.

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,160
It's rare for her to have an opportunity

93
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,119
to present a gift to Her Highness,
yet, she showed her capability

94
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,880
to be a female official on this gift.

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,040
She's extremely meticulous.

96
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,119
Seems like this will be
Her Highness's favorite gift

97
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,600
for today.

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,640
Liang Yi,

99
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,519
do you have any feuds with

100
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,359
that lady called Qiu Yan
from the Qiu Family?

101
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,079
No.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,239
If so, why did you swap out her gift

103
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,000
for a rock?

104
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,959
Your Highness, were you pretending
to be ignorant all along?

105
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,959
It must've been tough on her.

106
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,279
She must've been terrified.

107
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:40,040
But she's witty enough to come up
with a fancy explanation like that.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
What a poor girl.

109
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,720
Your Highness,

110
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,839
I did so for a reason.

111
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,435
(Hall of Nostalgia)

112
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,480
This is an edict from the Noble Consort.

113
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,839
Qiu Family, receive the order.

114
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,839
Her Highness said that
the second lady of the family

115
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,679
was an intelligent child.

116
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,839
She's both knowledgeable and ambitious.

117
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,559
But she hopes that Qiu Yan

118
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,320
will remember the words
she's about to say.

119
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,920
For a woman to preserve her chastity
after her husband's passing

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,640
is akin to how a man should
sacrifice his life to serve the country.

121
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
That is the way of the women.

122
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,920
It is the way of the heavens as well.

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,399
Qiu Yan is to be rewarded with
a Songyun Cypress Plaque.

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,959
This gift will serve to remind you
to preserve your chastity

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,440
for your late husband
and bring glory to your tribe.

126
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,959
I, Qiu Yan,

127
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,640
will remember Your Highness's teachings.

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

129
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,920
Thank you, Lord Liang.

130
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,720
Old Madam Qiu, Official Qiu,

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,279
I shall take my leave.

132
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,519
We're very fortunate to receive
a plaque from Her Highness.

133
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,160
Relay my instructions.

134
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,880
We shall hold a banquet for three days.

135
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,760
We will show the people of the capital

136
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,920
how dignified the Qiu Family is.

137
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,359
The women of the Qiu Family
are just as dignified.

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,079
Yes.

139
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,920
Yes, Mother.

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,079
This is great!

141
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,239
I'm so happy!

142
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,399
The Qiu Family can
hold its head high now!

143
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,399
You're right!

144
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,159
Excuse me,
I have a question for Lord Liang.

145
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,159
Sir! Sir, please save me!

146
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
My father is dead!

147
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,840
My stepmother is going to sell me
to a slave trader!

148
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,440
So it's you?

149
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,440
I assume you escaped from
the He Residence on that day.

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
Lying is in your nature indeed.

151
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,239
Lord Liang, you swapped out my gift

152
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,960
for a rock during Her Highness's
birthday celebration.

153
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,719
Is that what you mean by being honest?

154
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,559
Do you have any proof?

155
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,280
No.

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,479
How dare you question me then?

157
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,400
You've greatly disrespected Her Highness

158
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,520
by swapping out Her Highness's gift
for something else!

159
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,559
Ordinary people
don't have the guts to do so.

160
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,599
Only a person who knew that
Her Highness wouldn't punish him

161
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,640
would dare to commit such a brazen deed.

162
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,679
Lord Liang, I heard that your mother,
Madam Jin,

163
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,719
was once Her Highness's personal maid.

164
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,640
She has a special relationship
with Her Highness.

165
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,080
Back then,

166
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,559
Lord Liang, you were the one
inspecting the tributes and gifts

167
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,719
in the imperial harem.

168
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,719
Why should I do so?

169
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,520
Lord Liang, you were the mediator

170
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
for my case.

171
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,000
If I join the palace,

172
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,719
that means your arrangement
will be affected.

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,320
If so, you won't be able
to explain yourself to the He Family.

174
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,919
That's why you wanted
to teach me a lesson.

175
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
Song Jin,

176
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,479
you guys may leave for now.

177
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,479
I did swap your gift out
for something else.

178
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,000
But the reason isn't as complicated
as you think.

179
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,440
I just dislike you.

180
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,640
Since I have saved your life,

181
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,400
you should know your place.

182
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,080
In order to avoid the mundane days
of being a nun,

183
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,159
you tried to be a smart aleck.

184
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
With your witty words, you managed
to dupe Her Highness

185
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,159
into supporting you.

186
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,200
Do you really think that
you're intelligent enough

187
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,119
to fool everyone else?

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,799
Lord Liang,

189
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,559
do you think a poor and mundane life

190
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,239
is all that awaits a nun?

191
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,679
Have you ever been
to Jingyun Convent yourself?

192
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,679
Do you know what kind of life

193
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,239
they're leading in that place?

194
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,760
The nuns in Jingyun Convent
can be described as withered.

195
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,239
They usually die before the age of 30.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
I have never tried
to deceive Her Highness.

197
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,559
But you wanted me to become a nun
and remain a widow

198
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,559
for a man I don't even know!

199
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,679
This isn't fair at all!

200
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,119
So according to you, it's unfair

201
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:57,799
to all the nuns in Jingyun Convent?

202
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,559
Precisely.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,159
Everyone said that
I jinxed my husband to death.

204
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,440
They said I should die for him.

205
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,000
But Lord Liang,
let me ask you this.

206
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,960
What would happen if a man
jinxed his wife to death?

207
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,159
When a man loses his wife,

208
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,400
if he doesn't remarry,

209
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,799
he'll be deemed as unfilial
for not keeping the bloodline intact.

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,559
The same matter ends differently
for men and women

211
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,799
just because of their gender.

212
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,359
But why should women
be treated as such?

213
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,080
You might be right about that.

214
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,679
But do you know that serving the
imperial palace is very risky?

215
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,640
The lives of everyone there
are subjected to His Majesty's will.

216
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,080
It's much worse than what you think.

217
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,799
If you become a nun,

218
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,080
at least you can live in peace.

219
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,640
Once I enter the palace,

220
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,400
even if I have to live in fear
every day,

221
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,880
that's the path I have chosen.

222
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,559
It all depends on my capability
whether I survive.

223
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,679
At least it's better than
wasting my life

224
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,280
in the company of lamps
and Buddha statues.

225
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,200
With a reckless personality like yours,

226
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
you'll be reduced into ashes within
three days of entering the palace.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They'll pour your ashes on top
of the peonies in the Imperial Garden.

228
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,119
Do you understand?

229
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,679
Let me give you some advice.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,039
You should make an appraisal
of your own capability.

231
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,559
Only by improving your influence

232
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,039
will you be able to change the rules.

233
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:13,964
(Qiu Residence)

234
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,560
(Songyun Cypress)

235
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:21,683
(Hall of Nostalgia)

236
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,919
Sir,

237
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,039
the banquet held by the Qiu Residence
is quite lively.

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,600
(Qin Xuan, Prince of
Duke Ying Residence)

239
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,039
Sir?

240
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Sir, it's so lively over there.

241
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,599
Why is she

242
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,719
drowning herself in sorrow?

243
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,003
(The secondary rainbow adds a scratch to its appeal,
as the Luan Bird soars freely in the sky.)

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,400
The secondary rainbow adds a scratch
to its appeal,

245
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,599
as the Luan Bird soars
freely in the sky.

246
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,880
Is there anywhere else you can go to
besides your home?

247
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,239
The world is vast. Anywhere is fine.

248
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,559
Do you have any money?

249
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,880
Can you read?

250
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Do you know how to do calculations?

251
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,479
If you wish to leave your home,

252
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,640
you need to learn how to
be independent first,

253
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,280
understood?

254
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,840
I can read all the words now.

255
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,440
But I still can't escape
from the situation.

256
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,559
Tell me,

257
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,559
was he a liar?

258
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,200
Which chamber do you belong to?

259
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,119
How dare you drink in secret?

260
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,359
Where did a vagabond like you come from?

261
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,239
You should stay in the front hall.

262
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,239
Put down my wine. Or else, I'll shout.

263
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,479
Don't do that.

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,039
If you attract their attention,

265
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,880
what should you do

266
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,200
when they find out that
you've been stealing their wine?

267
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,039
Hurry and return our wine to us.

268
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,599
Fine, I'll return it to you.

269
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,559
My lady.

270
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,200
Return it to us!

271
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,119
I'll return it to you for a kiss.

272
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,320
- Return it to us!
- Come and get it.

273
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,559
Meng?

274
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,239
I couldn't find you just now.

275
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,559
So you were here.

276
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,359
I came out to take a breather.

277
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,520
Meng, I finally know why you declined
to drink with us just now.

278
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,840
So you were hiding from us
because you couldn't hold your liquor.

279
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,039
Who said so?

280
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,799
Qin Xuan, look.

281
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,919
The maids of the Qiu Family
are pretty interesting.

282
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:29,840
Let's have some fun together!

283
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,760
Beixue.

284
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,359
Young Master Meng.

285
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,320
Go in front

286
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,479
and tell them that Meng
can't hold his liquor.

287
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,400
He's admitting defeat

288
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,239
for a girl's sake.

289
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,520
Who said so?

290
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,359
I, I, I...

291
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,559
- I can hold my liquor well!
- Young Master Meng.

292
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,559
We have some fine wine down there.

293
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,400
Just you wait!

294
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's go.

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,479
Listen, I can hold my liquor
perfectly well!

296
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,080
- Don't you think I'm right?
- Young Master Meng, watch your step.

297
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,159
Ladies,

298
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,799
that person just now
is the son of Earl Yongyi.

299
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,679
His name is Meng Yu.

300
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,799
He's known for being frivolous.

301
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,919
Were you two shocked by his demeanor?

302
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,039
If you didn't appear,

303
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,039
he would be the one who was shocked.

304
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,640
Who are you?

305
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,359
I'm Qin Xuan of Duke Ying Residence.

306
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,840
As the front hall is too noisy,

307
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,159
I came here to hide from the noise.

308
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,320
I didn't expect to encounter
you two here.

309
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Miss, may I know your name?

310
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,479
This is our miss.

311
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,840
She's the second lady of the Qiu Family.

312
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
So you're my cousin.

313
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,159
Why didn't I know that
I had a cousin like you?

314
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,719
The first madam of your residence, Jiang,

315
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,679
is my aunt.

316
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,039
Her daughter, Qiu Mei,
is my elder cousin.

317
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,119
You're younger than Qiu Mei.

318
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Naturally, you're my younger cousin.

319
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:37,320
You two aren't related by blood at all.

320
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Two months ago,

321
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,679
my family moved to this place
from Suzhou.

322
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,119
Now that I think about it,

323
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,440
it's been five to six years
since I last saw them.

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
It's common for you not to hear of me.

325
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:47,479
But I do know who you are.

326
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,400
You know me?

327
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,760
The banquet in the front hall was held

328
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,479
to celebrate Her Highness's act
of rewarding your family with a plaque.

329
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,039
Naturally, I've heard about you.

330
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,840
What have you heard about me?

331
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,359
They said that although you're at
the peak of your youth,

332
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
you're loyal

333
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,079
and filial.

334
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,479
That is truly impressive.

335
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,719
Why don't you do me a favor?

336
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,000
It's more practical than praising me.

337
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,359
Please give me your order.

338
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
It's meaningless to drink by myself.

339
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,400
Drink together with me.

340
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,560
Here.

341
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:37,395
(Qiu Residence)

342
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,640
(Qiu Residence)

343
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,439
Cousin,

344
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,119
almost all of the guests
have returned home.

345
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,000
You should stop drinking.

346
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
I won't be able to drink again

347
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,959
after I head to Jingyun Convent.

348
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,040
Today,

349
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,719
I'm going to drink to
my heart's content.

350
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,079
Cousin, I know you're troubled.

351
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,800
- But...
- Troubled?

352
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,839
I don't need to join my late husband
in his grave.

353
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,439
I should be content.

354
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,040
I was just thinking

355
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,319
that if a woman

356
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:15,199
stops living for the sake of
her husband,

357
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,000
her parents, her siblings,
and her children,

358
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,319
if she lives for her own sake,

359
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,319
is she unfilial?

360
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,239
If I must say,

361
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
everything in the world
is divided into two parts,

362
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,079
like Yin and Yang, men and women.
And we don't have a choice.

363
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
But the saints said

364
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
husbands are the guides of their wives.

365
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
They also said

366
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,119
men have the obligation to marry again

367
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,479
while women should not
find a second husband.

368
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,920
It's clear that there's a difference
between men and women.

369
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,959
We can see that the teachings of
the saints are misleading as well.

370
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,280
Look.

371
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,199
Did you see how lively
the front hall was just now?

372
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,920
To sacrifice an unimportant daughter

373
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,359
in exchange for Her Highness's plaque

374
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,359
and glory to the family.

375
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,760
I'm sure this is a good deal

376
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,040
for every family out there.

377
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,839
Cousin, do you have any unfulfilled
wishes before you become a nun?

378
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,000
Maybe I can do something for you.

379
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,000
Sure.

380
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,040
If so,

381
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,000
give me a kiss.

382
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,199
What?

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,079
I have to become a nun

384
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,000
before I can experience
what it feels like

385
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,439
to kiss a man.

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
Why should I suffer like this?

387
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,280
This is...

388
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,079
What's the matter?

389
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,719
Are you scared?

390
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,000
Cousin, you mustn't do this!

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,359
This concerns your reputation!

392
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,520
I'll stop teasing you.

393
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,439
I appreciate the thought.

394
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,839
Besides,

395
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,479
you should stop calling me Cousin.

396
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,239
You sound like a Chinese opera actor.

397
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,760
Just call me Qiu Yan.

398
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,239
Yan as in "sweet".

399
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,479
Qiu Yan.

400
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,839
With a smile so sweet
that puts the flowers to shame?

401
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,560
Great name.

402
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,160
Actually, it was supposed to be "smoke"
instead of "sweet".

403
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,839
Back then,

404
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,839
when Madam Liu gave birth to me,

405
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,920
she wasn't willing to raise me

406
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,239
as I was a girl.

407
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,800
She abandoned me and left me
in a woodshed.

408
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,760
But I didn't die of starvation

409
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,040
even though I starved for three days.

410
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Madam Liu thought

411
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,839
that she couldn't avoid her destiny.

412
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
That's why she gave me a random name.
She called me Yan, as in "smoke".

413
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,239
After that, when I joined the residence,

414
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,760
Second Madam thought my name
was inauspicious.

415
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,760
That's how my name was changed.

416
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,680
Wang Wei once said, "From wastes of sand
one smoke plume rises sheer,

417
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,280
past the long river
the round sun sinks low".

418
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,079
Even a puff of smoke

419
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,239
will reach the azure sky one day.

420
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
As long as you don't give up,

421
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,560
things will definitely change.

422
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,199
That was a piece of great advice.

423
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
On account of that advice,

424
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,560
I shall offer you another toast.

425
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,560
Qiu Yan, since I can't share
your burden with you,

426
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,640
I shall drink with you.

427
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,520
Bottoms up.

428
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,479
Qingdai,

429
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,079
you can take them.

430
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,640
I'll ask Second Madam for a favor.

431
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,239
I'll ask her to release you.

432
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
Miss, are you abandoning me?

433
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,680
Are you silly?

434
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,319
I'm going to be a nun.
Why are you following me?

435
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,839
I'm not afraid to be a nun.

436
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,839
Miss, I'll follow you wherever you go.

437
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,640
Stop your nonsense.

438
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
If you disobey me,

439
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,319
I'll ask Mother to sell you away.

440
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:10,760
Yan'er.

441
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
I heard that life in
Jingyun Convent is tough.

442
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,680
You can take these silver taels
with you.

443
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,079
Thank you, Madam.

444
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,079
But you should keep the silver taels.

445
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,079
You can take anything from my chamber

446
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,319
if you like it.

447
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,800
Silly child.

448
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:42,839
Do you think I'm here to see you off

449
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,400
just to take your things?

450
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,680
I'll accept the money.

451
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,000
Second Lady,
Seond Madam is looking for you.

452
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,839
She wants to see you immediately.

453
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,760
Mother.

454
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,079
Yan'er.

455
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,319
The east gate isn't locked.

456
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,839
There's a blue carriage
outside the gate.

457
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,280
The abbot of Taiying Temple
is a great friend of mine.

458
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,199
You can hide there for some time

459
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,119
before you make your next plan.

460
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,199
I've prepared some money
and garments for you.

461
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,400
Qingdai, you must keep them safe.

462
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,199
Yes, Madam.

463
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,479
Mother, are you telling me to escape?

464
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,520
We'll have to send you to the
He Residence after two days.

465
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,239
It'll be too late for you
to escape by then.

466
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,040
But if I leave right now,

467
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,680
how will you be able to
face Father and Old Madam?

468
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,040
Don't worry.

469
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,160
Old Madam likes me.

470
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,800
Hurry and leave.

471
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,000
It'll be too late
if someone else sees you.

472
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,400
Mother!

473
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,119
Just go!

474
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,160
Mother!

475
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,439
(You're still young.)

476
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:41,319
(You must express your pain
when it hurts.)

477
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,280
(Collection of Odd Occurrences)
(I want to read.)

478
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,920
(Do you love to read books?)

479
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,040
(Tell me if you wish to read.)

480
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,760
(I'll think of an idea for you.)

481
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,959
Yan'er, get up!

482
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,800
Mother.

483
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,040
Alright. Time to leave.

484
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,839
Yan'er, just go.

485
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:13,880
Go!

486
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,520
Mother!

487
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,479
Just go!

488
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,680
- Go now!
- Qingdai, let's go.

489
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,160
Hurry!

490
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,479
Hurry!

491
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,599
Qiu Yan?

492
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,479
Where are you going?

493
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Mother wants me to buy something
from the west market

494
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,920
for my parents-in-law.

495
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,839
Why aren't you taking
the family's carriage then?

496
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,280
It's under maintenance.

497
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,199
Qiu Yan.

498
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,439
You could always tell a lie
with a straight face.

499
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,000
If I didn't eavesdrop on
your conversation with Mother,

500
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,680
I would've been deceived by you.

501
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,079
This is very sudden, and I have no time
to explain it to you.

502
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,280
When the trouble is over,

503
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,959
I will surely return here.

504
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,000
When the trouble is over?

505
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,280
If you leave,

506
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,239
the He Family will surely come
and ask for you.

507
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,839
By then, our family
won't be able to live in peace.

508
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,119
The trouble will never be over!

509
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,000
Do you want me to stay?

510
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,040
I do want you to leave the Qiu Family

511
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,439
and Mother badly.

512
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,439
But if you leave now,

513
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,400
what will happen to Mother?
Have you ever considered that?

514
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,520
She dotes on you so much.

515
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,319
She's constantly worried about you.

516
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,239
She helped you out when you wanted
to cancel the wedding.

517
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,119
She came up with an idea for you
when you wanted to join the palace.

518
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
Now, she's allowing you to escape.

519
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,280
But she needs to handle
the aftermath for you.

520
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,640
But you?

521
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,520
Have you ever considered
Mother's feelings?

522
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,560
Have you considered
our family's feelings?

523
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,920
I know you think I'm selfish.

524
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,199
I knew you had thought so since young.

525
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,560
You can hate me if you want.

526
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:11,680
Qiu Yan!

527
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I don't hate you.

528
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,239
Take care of Father and Mother
on my behalf.

529
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,160
Miss,

530
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,839
we finally left the city.

531
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,560
(I've dreamt about this day)

532
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,920
(Chastity)
(countless times.)

533
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,040
(Going in the direction
opposite of my house,)

534
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,400
(never turning back.)

535
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,839
(To somewhere far away,)

536
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,359
(somewhere where no one recognizes me.)

537
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,239
(To live not for Madam Liu's sake,)

538
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,040
(not for Father's sake,
and not for anyone else's sake.)

539
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,079
(To live solely for my sake.)

540
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,680
(But Min'er,)

541
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,640
(why aren't you hating me?)

542
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,520
(I've already decided to
become the most selfish)

543
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,160
(and heartless person in the world.)

544
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,079
(You should hate me for this.)

545
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,601
(Qiu Residence)

546
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,719
Is there nothing else you can do
besides crying?

547
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,239
Tell us!

548
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,800
Where did Qiu Yan go?

549
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,920
My lord! My dear Old Madam!

550
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,319
I'm in the dark too!

551
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,160
You did a great job
at teaching your daughter.

552
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,760
Escaping by herself

553
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,400
and leaving our family in the lurch.

554
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,560
I think you and your daughter

555
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,959
are here to jinx our family.

556
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,280
Yan'er has been following 
Seond Madam around every day.

557
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,760
She was never close to me!

558
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,800
I really don't know where she went!

559
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,800
Madam Liu, are you trying to push
the blame on Mother?

560
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,719
It was my fault for
not disciplining her enough.

561
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,839
Mother, please forgive Madam Liu.

562
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,280
Please punish me instead.

563
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,160
What's the use in punishing you?

564
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,359
Let's forget about our conflict
with the He Family for now.

565
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,640
If we go against the imperial edict,
we will be punished.

566
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,640
Old Madam!

567
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,280
Second Master,

568
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,040
the He Residence sent someone here
to notify us

569
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,680
that Second Lady had reached
the He Residence safely.

570
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:16,771
(Endless Happiness)

571
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,359
When Feng'er passed away, you were
unwilling to preserve your chastity.

572
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,640
Why are you suddenly changing your mind?

573
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,800
Her Highness has issued an edict

574
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,959
and rewarded me with a plaque.

575
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,359
Her Highness has shown me
both grace and might.

576
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,439
I do not dare to disobey her.

577
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,640
Since that's the case,

578
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,239
why did you return alone?

579
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,680
I alone should bear the responsibilities
of my actions.

580
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,239
I do not want to
implicate my parents again.

581
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,640
That father of yours

582
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,319
had offended me numerous times!

583
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,199
It's my fault for being obsessed
with the vain world.

584
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,359
I've implicated my parents and family
because of my foolishness.

585
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,319
I will obey

586
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,599
your every wish.

587
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,359
I only hope that you can let
bygones be bygones

588
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and reconcile with my family.

589
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,280
My lord, since she's so sincere,

590
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:03,839
why don't we...

591
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,760
She can stay for now.

592
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,520
After Feng'er's funeral is over,

593
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,800
I'll send her to Jingyun Convent myself.

594
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,280
Thank you for your kindness.

595
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:22,079
Chunxing, serve the Young Madam well.

596
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,000
You mustn't neglect her needs.

597
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,280
Yes, Madam.

598
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,920
Young Madam, please follow me.

599
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,359
Min'er,

600
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,520
be honest with me.

601
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,199
Did you see Yan'er

602
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,160
before she left the residence?

603
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,520
I...

604
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,359
I did try to persuade Qiu Yan
to stay before.

605
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,560
But I didn't expect this to...

606
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,839
How could you do so?

607
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,560
Do you know what kind of place
Jingyun Convent is?

608
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
If she goes there, she has to stay there
for the rest of her life!

609
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,040
If Qiu Yan didn't return
to the He Residence today,

610
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,959
Mother, how do you plan
to resolve the situation?

611
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't need a child like you
to question my decision.

612
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,079
Mother, have you ever
thought about this?

613
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,239
If Qiu Yan does leave us,

614
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,239
my reputation will be
implicated as well.

615
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,560
Mother, you only think about Qiu Yan.

616
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:26,839
You have never thought about me.

617
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,239
Min'er, how could you think so?

618
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,680
I know.

619
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,439
I'm inferior in everything
compared with Qiu Yan.

620
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm not as smart, as decisive,

621
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,920
or as sweet as her.

622
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,760
But Mother,

623
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,839
I'm your biological daughter!

624
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,280
Min'er!

625
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:07,463
(In remembrance)

626
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,640
(In remembrance)
I, Qiu Yan, the lowly survivor,

627
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:10,920
have implicated He Feng
and caused his death.

628
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,760
No amount of deaths shall
absolve me of my sin.

629
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,000
He Feng, I don't expect you to forgive me.

630
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
From today onward,

631
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,599
I will copy mantras and
practice Buddhism

632
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,560
to deliver your soul to the afterworld.

633
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,920
He Feng, I hope you
can achieve nirvana soon.

634
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,640
Lord Liang, please.

635
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,239
Chunxing, light a joss stick
for Lord Liang.

636
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,160
Lord Liang?

637
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,079
Why are you here?

638
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,359
My condolences, Young Madam.

639
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,439
Mr. He and He Feng's elder brother

640
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,479
have made huge contributions
to the imperial court.

641
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,880
It's my duty

642
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,319
to mourn him.

643
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,880
Lord Liang is here to mourn Feng'er

644
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,560
on account of his respect for me.

645
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,520
You better bow to Lord Liang.

646
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
Greetings, Lord Liang.

647
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,079
Lord Liang.

648
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,120
Mr. He,

649
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,800
I wish to stay here for several days
to keep vigil beside his coffin

650
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,760
and contribute what I can.

651
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,199
Mr. He, I hope you grant me my wish.

652
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,399
Lord Liang,
I appreciate the thought.

653
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,520
I would like to thank you

654
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,280
on my son's behalf.

655
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,719
Chunxing.

656
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,639
Hurry and arrange accommodation
for Lord Liang.

657
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,919
Lord Liang.

658
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:49,783
(In remembrance)

659
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:57,840
(He Residence)

660
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,000
Young Master Qin, please.

661
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,840
Master.

662
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Uncle He, Aunt He,

663
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,959
sorry for the late arrival.

664
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,639
Your father, Duke Ying, had
already sent some representatives here.

665
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,879
You do not need to go through
the trouble to make another trip.

666
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:17,199
Uncle He, you may not know,

667
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,320
He and I were once classmates in Suzhou.

668
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,320
We were considered bosom friends.

669
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,120
When Father was here to mourn him,

670
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,600
I was sick.

671
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,080
Now that I had fully recovered,

672
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:29,199
I was thinking that
I must mourn him as well.

673
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,560
Follow me.

674
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:35,600
Sir.

675
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Young Master Qin of Duke Ying Residence
is here.

676
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Qin Xuan, it's been a while.

677
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Liang Yi? Why are you here?

678
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,719
Mr. He has been grieving for
the past several days.

679
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm here to keep him company.

680
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,879
Chunxing, light the joss sticks.

681
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,439
Liang,

682
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,959
I didn't expect to see you here.

683
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,360
I didn't expect

684
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,760
to see you here either.

685
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Why have I never heard of

686
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,959
your bond with He Feng?

687
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Liang, since when

688
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,479
were you this close

689
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:28,120
with the He Family?

690
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:31,760
Young Master Qin.

691
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,800
He.

692
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,080
We became friends through
poetry and literature exchanges.

693
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,919
I thought I had plenty of opportunities
to learn from you.

694
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,120
I didn't expect our farewell in Suzhou

695
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,800
to be our last meeting.

696
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,280
I'm willing to imitate the legend of
Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi.

697
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,879
From today onward,
my brush shall be broken.

698
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,120
I will not write a single word.

699
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:12,959
If I break my vow,

700
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I shall suffer the same fate
as this brush.

701
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:23,663
(In remembrance)

702
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,959
Uncle He, Aunt He,

703
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,560
I've ordered my servants to prepare

704
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,879
some Suzhou snacks

705
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
for He.

706
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,120
I appreciate your intention.

707
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,280
Thank you.

708
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,879
Chunxing, plate them up.

709
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,679
Yes, Madam.

710
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,479
This must be Young Madam.

711
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,600
Qiu Yan, this is Young Master Qin
of Duke Ying Residence.

712
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,919
Greetings, Young Master Qin.

713
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:54,120
Uncle He,

714
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,959
I wish to keep vigil over He's coffin
for one night.

715
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,600
Uncle He, I hope you can grant me
my wish.

716
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,239
- This...
- Qin, you're a loyal man.

717
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,600
I'm keeping vigil over his coffin
for tonight as well.

718
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,000
Why don't you let me keep you company?

719
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,840
Lord Liang, you have been here
since daytime.

720
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,520
And now, you want to keep vigil
over his coffin for the night.

721
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,879
My In-laws will surely
feel apologetic if you do so.

722
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,760
She's right.

723
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,280
I appreciate your intention.

724
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,080
But Lord Liang,

725
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,919
you still need to lead
the Firewood Office.

726
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,919
You mustn't overexert yourself
because of my son.

727
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:23,879
- That's right.
- Uncle.

728
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,800
Honestly speaking, Qin Xuan and I
were playmates when we were young.

729
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,040
It's been a long time since we had met.

730
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,080
I would like to catch up
with him tonight.

731
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
Today is the day when his soul
will return to visit us.

732
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,120
Lord Liang, I do think
it's unsuitable for you to be here.

733
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,000
Young Madam, it seems as if

734
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,760
you do not wish to see me tonight.

735
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,600
Young Madam, are you hiding something

736
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,439
from me?

737
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,000
I wasn't supposed to say this.

738
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,719
But for He Feng's sake,

739
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,840
I have no choice but to offend you.

740
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,360
Everyone knows that Lord Liang
is the head of the Firewood Office.

741
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,399
I heard from people

742
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,280
that many people had died in that place

743
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,080
and that the place was haunted.

744
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,239
Lord Liang, if you're here,

745
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm afraid your presence
might scare He Feng away.

746
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,479
Lord Liang,
please try to understand.

747
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,360
This...

748
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,239
My lord,

749
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:18,802
(In remembrance)

750
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,000
this concerns the supernatural.

751
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
It's better to be safe than sorry.

752
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,360
This...

753
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,520
Mr. He, Madam He,

754
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,000
Young Madam has a point.

755
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,520
Qin, I'll leave the task to you then.

756
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Lord Liang, please head to
the guestroom and rest.

757
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,259
(In remembrance)

758
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:33,323
(In remembrance)

759
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,239
Beixue,

760
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,959
did you hear a cat?

761
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,987
(In remembrance)

762
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,600
This is bad! Where did
this stray cat come from?

763
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
A black cat is an ill omen!

764
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,239
Hurry and chase it away!

765
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,080
Someone!

766
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,439
Catch the cat!

767
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:50,719
- Where did it go?
- It's over there!

768
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:52,080
There's another one over there!

769
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,800
There's another one over here!

770
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,840
Come! Over here!

771
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,040
Over there!

772
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,520
There's another one over here!

773
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,399
Over here!

774
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,320
It's over there!

775
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,120
Over there!

776
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,560
It's over there!

777
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,520
There's another one over here!

778
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,879
Over there!

779
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:03,600
There's another one over there!

780
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,600
- The offering table!
- Over here!

781
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,520
There's another one over here!

782
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,120
There's another one over there!

783
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,280
Come here! The offering table!

784
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,600
Protect the offerings!

785
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,600
Over there!

786
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
It's over there!

787
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,479
Over there!

788
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,360
Catch it!

789
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,120
There's one over here!

790
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,959
It's on the offering table again!

791
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,800
Be careful!

792
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,320
Be careful!

793
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,000
What should we do?

794
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,399
These offerings were meant
for He Feng!

795
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,760
Hurry! Get us another set!

796
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:24,520
If not, it'll bring bad luck to He Feng!

797
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,080
- Hurry!
- She's right!

798
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,320
Hurry and notify the kitchen!

799
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,360
You should go!

800
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:28,439
I don't know where the kitchen is!

801
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:29,719
- Why are you still standing there?
- Follow me!

802
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,639
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

803
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,239
Over there!

804
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:34,399
The cat is over here!

805
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:35,360
There's another one over there!

806
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,120
It's outside!

807
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,120
Hurry!

808
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,959
Catch it!

809
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:38,879
Hurry!

810
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:40,399
Over there! Catch it!

811
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,360
Don't run!

812
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,439
Are you really going to quit writing?

813
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,479
If I didn't say so,

814
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:00,959
I wouldn't be able to move General He.
