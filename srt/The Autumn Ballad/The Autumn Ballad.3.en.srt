=Episode 3=

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,279
Stop right there!

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,712
(In remembrance)

20
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,480
Are you really going to quit writing?

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,519
If I didn't say so

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,800
I wouldn't be able to move General He

23
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,959
Sir, someone is here to see you.

24
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,440
She said she's your drinking buddy.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,440
My drinking buddy?

26
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,720
I went to the He Residence
against my will.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,639
But I wanted to take the opportunity

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,679
to unravel a question I've had.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,919
How exactly did He Feng die?

30
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,279
He Feng?

31
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,000
Didn't he pass away because you...

32
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,720
Because I jinxed him?

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,559
Don't tell me you think so too?

34
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,479
I may be of a lowly status,
but I don't believe it.

35
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,919
That my existence caused a healthy man

36
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,320
to suddenly spit blood and die.

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,720
So you mean...

38
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,160
He Feng had been sick all along.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,559
But the Hes kept it secret.

40
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,000
My parents suspect it too.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,279
But we can't prove it.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
So that's that.

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,479
So you went to the He Residence

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,839
because you were looking for evidence?

45
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,839
The current situation
is unfavorable towards me.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
But as long as I'm alive

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,279
and I'm still breathing,
I won't give up.

48
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,800
They want me to submit?

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,880
Over my dead body.

50
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,199
You are determined and unwavering.

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,600
I admire that.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
What exactly do you need me to do?

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,720
I bought these tools
from the coroner of Fengjing Prefecture

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,800
at a hefty price.

55
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,839
I've been hanging around the premise
these days

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,720
to listen in on how
to perform an autopsy.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,199
I'll show you what I've learned.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Just to be clear.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,160
You don't have to thank me.

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,800
A man is as good as his word.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,080
Since I promised to help you,

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
I will see it through to the end.

63
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,279
We don't have much time.

64
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,199
Let's get on with it.

65
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,919
Catch it...

66
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,639
The cat is loose!

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,240
Hurry! It's gone up.

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Inform master and madam!

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Young Master has regained consciousness.

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,559
Okay.

71
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,279
The show has finally started.

72
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,559
What do you mean, sir?

73
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,080
Blockhead.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,839
Stay here.

75
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,839
Sir!

76
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,559
Sir, Miss Yan.

77
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,720
Lord Liang is heading this way.

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,079
Qingdai and the maid are here too.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,239
I'll stop Liang Yi.

80
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,920
You and Beixue,
clean this place up. Quick!

81
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,359
Pack it up.

82
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:29,959
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,279
Help, Lord Liang!

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Save me, Lord Liang! Save me!

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,480
Lord Liang! Help!

86
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,320
Save me, Lord Liang!

87
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,279
Lord Liang, I...

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,079
Lord Liang, save me.

89
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,799
Thanks for saving me, Lord Liang.

90
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,399
What were you up to this time?

91
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,440
I was deeply troubled just now

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,480
and I felt dizzy.

93
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,160
So I came here for some fresh air.

94
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,760
The longer I stood there,
the more light-headed I got.

95
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Then I fell into the pond.

96
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,320
Thank goodness
you showed up just in time.

97
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,519
You really don't hold back, do you?

98
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,559
I'm not sure...

99
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,119
I understood what you meant, sir.

100
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,760
My lord, you should
change your wet clothes.

101
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,679
I will feel bad

102
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,119
- if you catch a cold.
- It's fine.

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,679
I heard a ruckus at the mourning hall.

104
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm going there to check things out.

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,959
My lord,
your malicious aura is too strong.

106
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,720
I don't think you should visit the hall.

107
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,000
Malicious aura?
It's just you and me here.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,519
Save your nonsense.

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,880
You pretended to fall into the pond

110
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,119
and pulled me with you.

111
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,799
It was so you could delay me.

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,320
Wasn't it?

113
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,839
When the wild cat appeared,

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,160
the candles before the altar went out.

115
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,040
Young Madam worried
it would disturb He Feng,

116
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
so she ordered the servants
to chase the cat away.

117
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,119
Fortunately, He Feng was blessed.

118
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,320
Coupled with Young Madam's
scripture writing the last few days,

119
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,920
the wild cats scattered

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
before any mishaps happened.

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,279
Mr. He.

122
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,760
Lord Liang.

123
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,200
Madam.

124
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,519
Lord Liang...

125
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,239
Lord Liang, are you alright?

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,640
Lord Liang.

127
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,200
Young Madam, why are you all wet?

128
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,839
I felt light-headed just now,

129
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,760
so I went to the pond
for some fresh air.

130
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
I slipped and fell.

131
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,239
Lord Liang, who tried to help me,

132
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,279
got dragged into the water too.

133
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,279
Thankfully the water wasn't deep
so Lord Liang wasn't hurt.

134
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,040
Look Madam, Lord Liang is all wet.

135
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,720
Quickly take Lord Liang to get changed.

136
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Lord Liang's well-being
is of utmost importance.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
The Hes's daughter-in-law

138
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,640
cannot afford to harm it. Hurry up.

139
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,679
Yes, Madam.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
I'll take my leave.

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Qiu Yan, don't just stand there.

142
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,799
Go and get changed.

143
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay.

144
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:39,595
(He Residence)

145
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,079
Are you going to be upfront with me,

146
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,679
or do I have to question you?

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,959
Where do I begin though?

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,839
Last night, you and Qin Xuan

149
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,079
pried open He Feng's coffin, didn't you?

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,399
No such thing!

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
You better think before you speak.

152
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,720
It won't be hard for me to prove it.

153
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,320
I just have to give the order

154
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,480
to open the coffin
and see if the body's been touched.

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,399
How would you know?

156
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,880
You mentioned "malicious aura".

157
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,600
You diverted my attention

158
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,640
because of your funny business
at the mourning hall.

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,920
I let you have your way

160
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
because I wanted
to catch you in the act.

161
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:22,760
But in a rush,

162
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,559
you left traces of tampering

163
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,480
on He Feng's coffin.

164
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,679
Lord Liang, who tried to help me,

165
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,720
got dragged into the water too.

166
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,720
Thankfully the water wasn't deep
so Lord Liang wasn't hurt.

167
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,159
Look Madam, Lord Liang is all wet.

168
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,239
If you were so sure about what happened,

169
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,840
you could've reported me
there and then.

170
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,640
Why did you want to meet me in private?

171
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,239
This is what I like about you,
getting straight to the point.

172
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,640
I want to know

173
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,799
what you two found
after opening the coffin.

174
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,599
If I tell you,

175
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,799
are you going to help me keep it secret?

176
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,840
Maybe.

177
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,559
But let me remind you
that you have no other choice.

178
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,640
If you don't tell me,

179
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll report your opening the coffin

180
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,799
to General He.

181
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,239
He Feng did not die from sickness.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
And he wasn't jinxed by me.

183
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:20,002
(In remembrance)
He was poisoned.

184
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,400
General He and Madam He

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
knew the truth,

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,960
but they still used me to cover it up.

187
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Who is the killer?

188
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
We don't know yet.

189
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:40,239
But I found this in He Feng's hand.

190
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:40,953
(In remembrance)

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,479
I think he's holding something
in his left hand.

192
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,479
On the wedding day,

193
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,960
his left hand was clenched
the whole time.

194
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll help you.

195
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,320
I can't unclench it. Quick.

196
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,280
A copper coin?

197
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
There's only half of it.

198
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
This is a token of love
between a couple.

199
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,039
There should be another half.

200
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,880
The two halves
will make a complete coin.

201
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,919
If that's the case,

202
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,520
it means He Feng had a lover
before marrying me.

203
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,719
He was holding the red silk
on the wedding day,

204
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
but in his hand, he had the love token
with another person.

205
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,400
Looks to me

206
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,760
like you're the most
pitiful bride in the world.

207
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,239
No, I'm actually delighted.

208
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,880
He Feng had a secret lover.

209
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,159
That's a clue.

210
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,799
But I know nothing

211
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,159
of He Feng's life.

212
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,000
Where should I even begin
to investigate?

213
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,919
If I were you,

214
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,320
I'd start with his personal maid.

215
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,960
Makes sense.

216
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,359
Finding evidence is key.

217
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,320
Otherwise, whatever suspicion you have

218
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
will remain as just that.

219
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,719
And what will finding evidence do?

220
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,479
If you are able to show me evidence,

221
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,039
I'll prove your innocence.

222
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,280
You...

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,559
Why are you suddenly helping me?

224
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,559
According to you,

225
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
He Feng died of poisoning.

226
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,479
And General He

227
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,760
tried to hide the truth.

228
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,640
Not only did he use you,

229
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,679
but he also tricked me.

230
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,640
He's lying to the Crown Prince
and Emperor.

231
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,960
One more thing.

232
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,400
I've been to Jingyun Convent.

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,559
I only found out

234
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,359
what the term "Jingyun Convent" meant

235
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,760
to a woman after I got there.

236
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,760
I admit I was hasty in wanting
to send you to Jingyun Convent

237
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,760
to become a nun.

238
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,520
Also, I shouldn't have changed

239
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,159
the gift you had prepared
for Noble Consort Guo.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,799
Therefore,

241
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,760
I wish to make up for my error.

242
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,840
My presence in the He Residence
is too obvious.

243
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,799
My hands are tied.

244
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,080
Whether or not you can find evidence,

245
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,280
be it eye witness or material evidence,

246
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,640
will depend on your own effort.

247
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,599
You wish to see Feng'er's personal maid?

248
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,840
I never got the chance
to get to know He Feng.

249
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,039
I feel bad about it.

250
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,320
So,

251
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
I'd like to know more about his past

252
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,119
by talking to his maid.

253
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,159
Then I'd be able to reminisce

254
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,919
when I go pray at the temple.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm afraid that's not possible.

256
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,479
You probably don't know this.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,919
Feng'er's personal maid
is called Yueying.

258
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,840
They grew up together.

259
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
Now that Feng'er has passed away,

260
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,119
the girl has to be buried with him.

261
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,280
We appreciate her loyalty all this while

262
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,919
and couldn't bear to say no to her.

263
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,280
She requested to live in the back
of the residence in seclusion

264
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,280
before Feng'er's burial.

265
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,880
It's not right for us to disrupt her.

266
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,400
Miss Yueying is indeed loyal.

267
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,679
Could I...

268
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,520
Young Madam.

269
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,400
You're here to send your regards.

270
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,880
Madam has made the situation clear.

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,080
Please don't bring it up again.

272
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:08,400
Qiu Yan.

273
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,880
Just focus on copying the scriptures
for the time being.

274
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,640
Pray for Feng'er diligently.

275
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,520
As for other matters,

276
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,400
you need not be involved.

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,760
Alright.

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
Let me out! I'm begging you!

279
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,640
Stop wailing.

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,320
You really think you're the young lady?

281
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,640
If the Madam hears you,
you'll get another beating.

282
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,320
Miss, I don't think
we'd be able to get inside.

283
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,840
Don't you find it weird?

284
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,119
A loyal maid who is mourning
their master's death

285
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,760
is normally treated well
by the household.

286
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,159
In some cases,

287
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
they'd even accept her as a god-daughter
in honor of the master.

288
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,599
But why are the Hes treating her
like a criminal?

289
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,119
Madam, look.

290
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,640
Since greeting you today,

291
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,359
Young Madam has been sneaking around.

292
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,280
Madam has said

293
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,919
no one is to disturb Miss Yueying.

294
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,159
Are you openly disobeying

295
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,640
Master and Madam's order?

296
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,919
Qiu Yan, you are unusually inquisitive

297
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,520
regarding our family matters.

298
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,159
Please don't misunderstand, Madam.

299
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,679
I've been wondering
about He Feng's life.

300
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,039
I was hoping
to take a look at his study.

301
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,840
But I got lost.

302
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,679
Liar.

303
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,919
You could've asked me
where the study is.

304
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,239
You were raising your voice
at my lady just now.

305
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,640
Is it our fault

306
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,400
for being wary of you?

307
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,679
Qingdai, don't be rude to Chunxing.

308
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,599
It's my bad.

309
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,039
I'm just missing He Feng.

310
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,919
I hope you'll give permission

311
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,919
for me to go to his study

312
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,159
and pick out a few personal items
to take with me to Jingyun Convent.

313
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,679
The days ahead are long.

314
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,479
I will think of him
when I see his belongings.

315
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,359
This way, He Feng and I could at least
be husband and wife in memory.

316
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,400
This is Young Master's study.

317
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,679
Come in, Young Madam.

318
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:45,919
Miss, what is that?

319
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,080
This is a poem by Tang poet, Bai Letian,
titled "Song of Everlasting Regret".

320
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:54,080
It tells the story of Emperor Ming of Tang
and Noble Consort Yang.

321
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,520
Everlasting Regret?

322
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,239
What is it regretful of?

323
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,479
Young Madam.

324
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,599
My Young Master's literary works
will be made into a book

325
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,599
and kept as a memoir.
You can't take them.

326
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,679
This ruler looks very well made.

327
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm guessing He Feng used it often.

328
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,359
This ruler does look...

329
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,919
Master gifted that to Young Master.

330
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,479
You'll have to ask Master first

331
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,559
before you can take it away.

332
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,760
The stamp is made from Huangtian stone.

333
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,880
It's priceless.

334
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,520
Young Master treasured it a lot.

335
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,919
I'm afraid Young Madam cannot take it.

336
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,520
This won't do, that won't do.

337
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,239
I wonder who's the master
and who's the servant?

338
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:40,400
Chunxing, although you serve Madam,

339
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,559
you seem to know a lot about He Feng.

340
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,960
Both Madam and Young Master
are my masters.

341
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,719
It's natural for the servant

342
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,559
to know their master well.

343
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,719
This inkstone doesn't seem
like it's anything special.

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,599
It will come in handy
for my scripture writing.

345
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,840
Or is there some reason

346
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,039
you wish to keep it, Chunxing?

347
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,119
That's enough.

348
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,919
The inkstone is fine.

349
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,479
Enough poking around.

350
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,199
Better to hurry back
and copy the scriptures.

351
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,280
Thank you, Madam.

352
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,719
Chunxing, look after Young Madam.

353
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,199
Yes, Madam.

354
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
I will do my best.

355
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,479
Chunxing.

356
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,280
There's no more ink.
Can you bring us more?

357
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,760
You can go.

358
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,959
Madam asked me
to look after Young Madam,

359
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,880
not to serve you.

360
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,648
(Military Journal of Shunzong)

361
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:24,740
(In remembrance)

362
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,000
Which scripture is Young Madam copying?

363
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,880
It's the Ksitigarbha Sutra, my lord.

364
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,880
(Today, I went to He Feng's study)

365
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,560
(and found his handwritten copy
of the "Song of Everlasting Regret".)

366
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,560
(My assumption was right.)

367
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,439
(He Feng did have a lover.)

368
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,400
Have some tea while you chat,
my lord, Young Madam.

369
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,160
Thank you, Chunxing.

370
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,439
I don't like Liu'an tea.

371
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,520
I hope you don't mind preparing
some Emei White Bud tea for me.

372
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,800
But...

373
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
If Chunxing doesn't want to do it,

374
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,599
I can do it.

375
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,800
Lord Liang is our guest.
We mustn't be rude.

376
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,839
I'll do it. Young Madam
has to stay at the mourning hall.

377
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,839
You must not leave.

378
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,640
Please wait, my lord.

379
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:28,921
(In remembrance)

380
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,079
Who is He Feng's lover?

381
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,839
I'm suspicious
of He Feng's personal maid, Yueying.

382
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,040
According to the Hes,

383
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,839
Yueying wants
to be buried with her master.

384
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,800
But from what I've seen,
it is not Yueying's own choice.

385
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,239
Clearly, Yueying knows something.

386
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,239
She is locked up

387
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,359
and no one can see her.

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,079
Now, think.

389
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
Who could be He Feng's lover?

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
And who would have a motive

391
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,439
and chance to poison him?

392
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,439
Are you saying...

393
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,000
The answer to the two questions
may be the same person?

394
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,959
Someone who satisfied both conditions.

395
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,280
The only possible answer is Yueying.

396
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:08,880
Yes.

397
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,239
Madam He said,

398
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,079
Yueying grew up with He Feng.

399
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,520
The two most likely
developed feelings for each other.

400
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,959
They must have secretly gotten married.

401
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:20,359
But He Feng was forced to marry me
under his parents' order.

402
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,239
Overcome with bitterness,

403
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,680
Yueying poisoned He Feng
on the wedding day.

404
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,479
The parents know the truth.

405
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,920
So they forced Yueying
to be buried with He Feng.

406
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,839
But in order
to keep the disgrace under wraps,

407
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,560
they said I had jinxed his death.

408
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,400
Lord Liang.

409
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,199
All of this makes perfect sense.

410
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,520
But what you said

411
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,359
is merely your own baseless assumption.

412
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,160
Right.

413
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,959
Looks like I have to meet with Yueying.

414
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,959
If the Hes are purposely
keeping the servant locked up,

415
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,400
it won't be easy for you to see her.

416
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,520
That's true.

417
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,800
I asked about it once,

418
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,119
but was swiftly rejected.

419
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,520
Look like

420
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,680
I'll need to find someone

421
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,199
who can't say no
to my request of meeting Yueying.

422
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,560
Do you mean me?

423
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,520
Rest assured, Lord Liang.

424
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,719
I won't trouble you
over such a trivial matter.

425
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
I already have someone in mind.

426
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,560
Are the Hes dealing with a beggar?

427
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,719
The dishes served to the master
are worse than what servants have.

428
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,520
Did you think this is the Qiu Residence?

429
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,839
Your young lady is now
a member of the Hes.

430
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,239
As per the He's household rules,
the daughter-in-law eats these.

431
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,359
Dinner was served
a full four hours late.

432
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,880
All the dishes have gotten cold.

433
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,560
Is this also the way
the Hes treat their master?

434
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,920
Whose master are you?

435
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,760
You caused Young Master's death
the moment you arrived.

436
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,920
As the legal wife, not only
is she not ashamed of her ignoble life,

437
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,520
she even leeched off the master.

438
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,640
How shameless!

439
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,599
You've stepped out of line.

440
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,439
So I did.

441
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,199
What about it?

442
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,439
I'm deliberately
making things hard for you.

443
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:58,599
If you don't want to cause trouble
for your master,

444
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,439
you better keep it to yourself.

445
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,359
You hit me.

446
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,119
I've been with the Hes
for over 10 years.

447
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,000
Not even Madam lifted a finger at me.

448
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,199
You've been picking on me
numerous times,

449
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,319
but I let it slide.

450
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,599
But you asked to be hit

451
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,839
for bullying my servant.

452
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,079
I...

453
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm going to tell Madam.

454
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,719
Stop!

455
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Let her go.

456
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,959
I'd like to find out
what the He household rules

457
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,839
say about the punishment

458
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,359
regarding a young madam
hitting the servant.

459
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,119
Qiu Yan, you think you can shut me up
with the rules?

460
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,119
I might not be able
to openly do anything to you,

461
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,359
but you better watch out in the dark.

462
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,599
If I am supposed to be

463
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
a daughter-in-law 
staying in He Residence,

464
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
do you really think I should be worried
about your threat?

465
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,719
I'm afraid I will no longer stay
at the He Residence

466
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,040
after He Feng's burial.

467
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,040
If you wish to secretly harm me,

468
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,560
you'll have to come to Jingyun Convent.

469
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
Qiu Yan.

470
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,520
Just you wait.

471
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,839
We're not done.

472
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,369
(He Residence)

473
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:12,998
(In remembrance)

474
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,359
I only asked you
to look after one thing.

475
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,680
How could you have lost it?

476
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,920
Miss.

477
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,839
I've searched the house many times.

478
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,920
I didn't find it.

479
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,280
I really don't know where it might be.

480
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,000
I wouldn't be fussing
if the thing was mine.

481
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,199
But the inkstone belonged to He Feng.

482
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,839
Now it's gone.

483
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,359
How do you expect me
to answer to his parents?

484
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,439
If they pursued the matter,

485
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,119
I'd be guilty for disrespecting
my late husband.

486
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,560
You're finally back.

487
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,079
What are you two doing?

488
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,719
We're here to catch you red-handed.

489
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
You stole He Feng's inkstone,
didn't you?

490
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,959
You're the one
who lost Young Master's relic.

491
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,479
Now you're finding an excuse

492
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,079
because you couldn't explain it
to Master and Madam.

493
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,000
You said I stole the inkstone?

494
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,319
Search my room then.

495
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,800
I doubt you'd hide
the inkstone in your room.

496
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,439
If I presumed correctly,

497
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,439
you hid the pawn receipt
for the inkstone

498
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,439
under the mat.

499
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,359
Forget it. The receipt can be destroyed.

500
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
But you won't be able

501
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
to shut the pawnshop owner's mouth.

502
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,160
We'll just bring the shopkeeper here

503
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,239
and we'll know if the inkstone

504
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,680
was pawned at the shop.

505
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,359
I...

506
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,640
I wasn't stealing for money.

507
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,319
I know.

508
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,959
Because I slapped you last night.

509
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,640
So you wanted to vent your frustration

510
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,959
by accusing me as a disrespectful wife.

511
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,800
Last night?

512
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,560
So you deliberately made me mad.

513
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,160
You set me up.

514
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,680
I guess you're not entirely stupid.

515
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,599
Of course.

516
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,800
You could've thrown the inkstone

517
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,719
in some unknown spot
outside the residence.

518
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,719
It will be lost for good.

519
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,199
However...

520
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,479
You like He Feng.

521
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,640
You wouldn't have the heart

522
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,680
to simply throw his relics away.

523
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,079
So,

524
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,359
going to the pawnshop
was your only choice.

525
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
Once I become a nun,

526
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,079
you can then redeem the item quietly

527
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,199
and keep it to yourself.

528
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,400
How did you know I liked...

529
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,199
You were being too obvious.

530
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,719
Since you started serving me,

531
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,640
I've noticed an unusual animosity

532
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,040
from you.

533
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,640
When we were at his study,

534
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
you seemed to know every detail

535
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,119
about He Feng's items.

536
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,599
You wore your heart on the sleeve.

537
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,520
If I hadn't baited you

538
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,359
with his relic,

539
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,079
it would've been a disservice
to your infatuation.

540
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,199
I don't understand

541
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,880
why Master and Madam
let Young Master marry you.

542
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,560
You're a wicked woman.

543
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,280
I've only ever met He Feng one time.

544
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,280
There was no love between us.

545
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,479
I do not feel bad at all

546
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,119
for not wanting to be buried with him.

547
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,400
What more to say ashamed?

548
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,520
You claim to love him.

549
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,920
But what have you really done for him?

550
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,479
What right do you have to criticize me?

551
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I've never met
a more heartless woman than you.

552
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,319
Now that's something I don't mind.

553
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
Listen up.

554
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm giving you two choices.

555
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,319
One,

556
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,400
you'll hand this receipt over
to Master and Madam.

557
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,839
Then you'll be kicked out.

558
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,599
Madam has always adored me.

559
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,359
Where did you get the confidence from?

560
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,359
If there weren't outsiders
in the He Residence,

561
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,520
I couldn't say I'd be as confident.

562
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,199
But Marquis Weiyuan is present.

563
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,400
In front of an outsider,

564
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm guessing Madam He
wouldn't be at liberty

565
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,520
to excuse a servant
for stealing from their master.

566
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,719
Lest people think the household is lax.

567
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,959
Then...

568
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,400
Then what's the second option?

569
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,200
(Hall of Sanguinity)

570
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,119
Chunxing.

571
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,719
How come
you're delivering the food today?

572
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,040
It's getting warmer.

573
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,160
Madam wanted me
to bring Yueying a new blanket.

574
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,000
We wouldn't want her
to be disheveled for the occasion.

575
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Open the door.

576
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,920
Okay.

577
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,439
Go on. Make the bed for Yueying.

578
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,479
Be quick.

579
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,479
Will do.

580
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,239
Close the door.

581
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,479
Miss Yueying.

582
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,719
Young Madam?

583
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,359
You know me?

584
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,560
I saw you at Young Master's wedding.

585
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,079
Good that you recognize me.

586
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,959
Miss Yueying.

587
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,359
It's not your wish to be buried, right?

588
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,119
No.

589
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,479
It is my wish.

590
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,920
Young Master had always been kind to me.

591
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
It's only right
that I follow him in death.

592
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,599
It's unrelated to others.

593
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,839
Your door is locked
and guards patrol the house.

594
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,839
If it's your own wish,

595
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,160
why would the need to guard you?

596
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,680
I wanted to be alone.

597
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,839
Madam put them in place
so I wouldn't be disturbed.

598
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,479
Is this how Madam looks after you?

599
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,680
Young Madam.

600
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,479
I've accepted my fate.

601
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
What are you trying to do?

602
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Please don't make me.

603
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,760
You poisoned He Feng, didn't you?

604
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,479
I also know

605
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,599
that He Feng loved you.

606
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,880
Because he was marrying me,

607
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,760
you felt betrayed and so you killed him.

608
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,599
He Feng's parents found out about it

609
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,800
and tormented you.

610
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,319
They forced you
to die along with him, right?

611
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:26,000
Yueying, I can help you.

612
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:30,959
Young Madam, stop pushing me.

613
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,000
I deserve to die.

614
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,119
You're not helping me.

615
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,319
You're harming me instead.

616
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,800
I know you must be scared
of being beaten.

617
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
So you dare not speak out.

618
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,680
I'll be frank with you.

619
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm not helping you

620
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,119
because I'm noble.

621
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,599
Right now, the Hes think
I was the reason He Feng died.

622
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,000
They want me to become a nun
in remembrance of him.

623
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,599
You and I are facing
the same predicament.

624
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,959
The only difference is,

625
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,760
you've accepted it, but I haven't.

626
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,959
If you're willing to tell me the truth,

627
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,479
both of us

628
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,479
might still have a chance.

629
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
You got half it right.

630
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,479
The one who poisoned He Feng was me,

631
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,719
but not really me.

632
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,880
(Young Master did have a loved one.)

633
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,959
(Her name is Zhao Rui.)

634
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,319
(Half a year ago, while studying abroad
in the north,)

635
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,319
(he met Zhao Rui and fell in love.)

636
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,319
(The two were inseparable.)

637
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,119
(Zhao Rui's father)

638
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,599
(is an elderly scholar
who helped write letters.)

639
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,959
(He didn't want Zhao Rui
to overstep her status.)

640
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,479
(Meanwhile, Master and Madam)

641
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,839
(would never have allowed Young Master)

642
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,760
(to marry a commoner's daughter.)

643
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,599
(Young Master decided
to marry Zhao Rui in secret.)

644
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,880
(He asked me to prepare
the newlywed home)

645
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,359
(and organized a wedding ceremony.)

646
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,760
(They even signed
a marriage certificate.)

647
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,313
(Happiness)

648
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This means,

649
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,359
He Feng tried to marry me
with an existing marriage.

650
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,400
According to imperial law,

651
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,599
marrying again before a divorce...

652
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,959
This means my marriage
to He Feng does not count.

653
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,000
Where is the marriage certificate now?

654
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm sorry.

655
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,439
Zhao Rui said she sent it
to her father, Zhao Mingli.

656
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,439
She wanted to reassure him.

657
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:23,959
Where is Zhao Rui then?

658
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,680
She's dead.

659
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,959
How did she die?

660
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,479
She was just a temporary infatuation
Young Master had.

661
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,839
When he learned of
the arranged marriage with you,

662
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,719
Young Master returned
to the He Residence

663
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,719
as per Madam's order.

664
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,400
Zhao Rui couldn't accept it.

665
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,160
She found a rope

666
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,880
and hanged herself.

667
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,760
That means,

668
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,479
He Feng did betray her.

669
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,000
Aren't we all used to stories
of wealthy heirs

670
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,959
fooling around with women?

671
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,880
With Zhao Rui's death,

672
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,479
her father would have all the reason

673
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,119
to seek revenge from He Feng.

674
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,199
You said you were the one
who poisoned him, but not really.

675
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,839
Did Zhao Rui's father ask you

676
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,760
to do it?

677
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,479
After Zhao Rui died,

678
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,000
I would occasionally pay respects
at her tomb.

679
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,199
I did so for Young Master's
peace of mind.

680
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,839
One day, while on the way
back from the tomb,

681
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,439
a Taoist priest stopped me.

682
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:28,599
Miss.

683
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,599
Please halt, miss.

684
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,959
Miss, I'm afraid your young master

685
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,640
will be plagued by bad luck.

686
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,119
-What a hoax.
-Miss.

687
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,680
Let me ask you.

688
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,000
Did your young master
recently lose his spouse?

689
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,359
Nonsense!

690
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,000
My Young Master
will be marrying in three days.

691
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,880
He doesn't have a spouse.

692
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:46,680
That's odd.

693
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,839
Could I have seen it wrongly?

694
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,479
Seen what?

695
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,920
I saw an aggrieved spirit

696
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,640
following you.

697
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,680
A young lady in red.

698
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,319
I sense malaise.

699
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,000
She's been following you.

700
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Once the sun sets,
she will unleash her fury.

701
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,160
Do you have a way to stop her?

702
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,839
(The priest gave me
a vial of enchanted water.)

703
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,880
He told me to let Young Master drink it

704
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,000
on the morning of the wedding.

705
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,479
He also told me not to tell him

706
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:19,599
or else it wouldn't work.

707
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,160
I was only thinking
about saving Young Master.

708
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,719
I... I hadn't suspected anything.

709
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,800
Who knew,

710
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,640
after drinking the enchanted water,

711
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:32,680
he...

712
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,000
The Taoist priest was most likely

713
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,160
a disguise Zhao Rui's father put on.

714
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:42,640
I heard Young Master mentioned
that Zhao Rui's father

715
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,719
is called Zhao Mingli.

716
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,000
But I've never seen him in person.

717
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
fallen for his trick.

718
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,359
So Zhao Mingli got away just like that?

719
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,959
He won't be able to escape.

720
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
After finding out
about Young Master's poisoning,

721
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,719
Master kept me locked up

722
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,959
while he pursued the old man in secret.

723
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,760
Master has countless skilled soldiers.

724
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,839
He won't get away.

725
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,599
Based on what you said,

726
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,719
you're completely innocent.

727
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,800
But Master He and Madam He

728
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,320
still punished you to death.

729
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,360
And you're fine with that?

730
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,239
I'm just a servant.

731
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,360
What else can I do?

732
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,760
The fact that this happened,

733
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,760
I guess

734
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,239
this is my destiny.

735
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,320
I won't give up on you.

736
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,679
But I have one condition.

737
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,399
What is it?

738
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,040
If Zhao Mingli had killed him,

739
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
why didn't the Hes report it?

740
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,159
Going to the authorities

741
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:45,080
meant that He Feng remarrying before
getting a divorce would be found out.

742
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,760
That would give He Feng
a bad rep even in death.

743
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,520
It would certainly be less honorable
than calling me the jinx.

744
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,760
Besides, General He
is an army commander.

745
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,719
It would be a piece of cake
for him to quietly kill a person.

746
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,159
No need to get the authorities involved.

747
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:01,479
It would keep their reputation intact
or invite unnecessary trouble too.

748
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,439
Remarrying before getting a divorce.

749
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,600
The imperial court may be strict,

750
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,760
but that isn't exactly
a serious offense.

751
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,360
Even if he got impeached,

752
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,600
so long as his eldest son
remained at the border,

753
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,760
the Hes will not fall.

754
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,479
So the Hes are keeping
a tight hold on you

755
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,360
and have turned against your family

756
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,959
to keep their honor and position.

757
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,560
I still find that too forced

758
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
a reason.

759
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
So why do you think it is?

760
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,600
I can't be sure.

761
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,080
It's just my intuition.

762
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,919
As for you, what will you do next?

763
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll leave the He Residence
and look for Zhao Mingli.

764
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,840
Before the Hes catch him.

765
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,959
Yueying is the only witness.

766
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,520
But Zhao Mingli
has the marriage certificate.

767
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,280
Only by finding Zhao Mingli

768
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,360
will I be able to prove
that I didn't cause He Feng's death.

769
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,719
He Feng's death

770
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,479
will only have a closure
by capturing the killer.

771
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:01,600
How do you expect
to leave the He Residence?

772
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,080
I'll need your help on that.

773
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,479
It's not impossible for me to help.

774
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,639
Beg me

775
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:14,719
and I'll help you.

776
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,919
I, Qiu Yan, solemnly ask
for your lordship's help.

777
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,199
I shall never forget

778
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,520
your lordship's great deed.

779
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,639
You sure changed your tone quickly.

780
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,399
As the old saying goes,

781
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,080
one who recognizes
the current trend is a hero.

782
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,840
If I need to ask for help

783
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,000
to accomplish something, then so be it.

784
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,399
What's there to be embarrassed about?

785
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,199
Then why didn't you ask me before?

786
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,439
Previously, I was confident
I could find out the truth alone.

787
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,040
Now, Yueying's safety is on the line.

788
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,159
I was going to ask for your help

789
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,560
at the most critical moment.

790
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,520
(Beloved son, He Feng's memorial tablet)

791
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:05,035
(In remembrance)

792
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,366
(He Residence)

793
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:25,320
Miss, we've left the city.

794
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,159
What are we going to do?

795
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,879
Get out of the way.

796
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,639
We are from the He Residence.

797
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:43,760
Which He Residence?

798
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:44,719
You people make way.

799
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,159
Our master

800
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,879
is the honorable General He Yongzhong.

801
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,760
Whoever it is,
they should at least be reasonable.

802
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,120
The more senior one gets priority.

803
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,840
We're carrying an 80 year-old.

804
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,000
How old is the one you're carrying?

805
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,479
Who cares how old?

806
00:37:58,479 --> 00:37:59,399
Get out of the way!

807
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,679
You make way.

808
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,199
You make way.

809
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,080
You make way.

810
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,959
You make way.

811
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:04,719
You make way.

812
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,199
You make way.

813
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,199
Housekeeper.

814
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,159
You people make way.

815
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,560
What's going on?

816
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:21,600
There's another funeral procession
blocking the road.

817
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,719
Carry on.

818
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,000
Who dares stop us?

819
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes, Master.

820
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,239
Everyone, follow me!

821
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,639
Come out.

822
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,159
Hurry.

823
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:49,919
Hurry. Go.

824
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:50,679
Yueying, let's go.

825
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:51,679
You first.

826
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:55,800
Untie her.

827
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,479
Quick, Yueying.

828
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,959
Quick, run! That way!

829
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,399
Run!

830
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,399
Go, run!

831
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:03,760
What about you?

832
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,239
- Go that way.
- Go!

833
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,520
Head towards the archway.

834
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,800
Qin Xuan is waiting there.

835
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,560
What about you?

836
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,280
You need not worry. Just go.

837
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,199
Come on, Qingdai.

838
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,439
Let's go, Yueying.

839
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,320
Hurry and go!

840
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,080
Come on. We have to protect General He.

841
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
Right. We have to finish the act.

842
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,719
Qin Xuan.

843
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,199
Sir.

844
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,000
Qin Xuan.

845
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:33,639
Qiu Yan.

846
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,439
Change your clothes first.

847
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,639
Then we'll go to the city
and report this.

848
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,560
Miss Yueying, you change first.

849
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,719
This is for Miss Yueying.

850
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:42,959
Get on the carriage.

851
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,479
You mean,

852
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,280
Liang Yi arranged
for the other funeral procession too?

853
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,080
Yes.

854
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,479
As a precaution, he set up
the funeral procession

855
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,760
and asked me to wait here.

856
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,399
Liang Yi has always
been very meticulous.

857
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,800
If General He

858
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,280
finds out Yueying and I are missing,

859
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,479
he'll definitely conduct a search.

860
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,479
How will we enter the city?

861
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,120
Liang Yi said

862
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,239
he will find a way to leave He's troop

863
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,120
and rendezvous with us.

864
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,199
He will personally escort us
into the city.

865
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,560
He has the Firewood Office's token.
No one would dare stop him.

866
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,320
I hate it when I owe others a favor.

867
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:34,120
Especially when
it's impossible to repay.

868
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,600
Don't worry about it.

869
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,719
Think of it as he's escorting me.

870
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,239
So you owe me the favor.

871
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,919
I'm much easier to handle.

872
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:44,879
Miss.

873
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:46,520
It's been a while.

874
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Why hasn't Miss Yueying come out yet?

875
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,120
Go and take a look.

876
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:50,879
Okay.

877
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,000
Miss Yueying.

878
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,094
(Fangsheng Bozhou)

879
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:05,840
Miss.

880
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,040
She's gone!

881
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,040
Dear Buddha.

882
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,040
I was wrong. I was so wrong.

883
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,120
But I cannot go to the authorities.

884
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,600
If I do, that'd be the end of me.

885
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,719
I'm begging you.

886
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:24,879
I'm begging you.

887
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,719
You won't live
even if you don't turn yourself in.

888
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:30,360
Zhao Mingli.

889
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,919
I followed the Hes' funeral procession

890
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,280
and saw that you tried to run away.

891
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,679
I was wrecking my brain
about how to kill you.

892
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,679
Who knew you'd escape again?

893
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,159
Young Master was the one responsible
for your daughter's death.

894
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,280
You've killed him.

895
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,719
So why are you still coming after me?

896
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
He deserved to die.

897
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,919
You are his accomplice.

898
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,239
You deserve to die too.

899
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,360
No, I'm not.

900
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm innocent!

901
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,879
If Rui'er hadn't sent me
the marriage certificate,

902
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:10,080
I wouldn't even have known
where she was buried.

903
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Please spare me. Please...

904
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,239
Don't kill me. Please.

905
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,840
You can plead with Rui'er!

906
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:20,560
No!

907
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,159
Stop!

908
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,719
Who...

909
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,399
What are you...

910
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,719
Take this.

911
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,360
How...

912
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:36,639
How did you...

913
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,159
You pretended to be my witness

914
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:41,800
so that you could escape
from the He Residence.

915
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,040
I purposely let you go

916
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:45,399
because I wanted you
to lead me to Zhao Mingli.

917
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,520
You bunch of traitors of the Hes.

918
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,679
We are not from the Hes.

919
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:50,679
I'm Qiu Yan, the one
who was supposed to marry He Feng.

920
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,719
You're the second daughter
of the Qiu family?

921
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:55,399
You almost got me buried with the dead

922
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,040
just so you could avenge your daughter.

923
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,760
Let me kill this wicked servant!

924
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:00,479
Then I'll willingly go
to the authorities with you.

925
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,399
Your willingness to own up
to your action is admirable.

926
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:04,919
It's too bad though.

927
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:06,679
You're too stupid.

928
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,560
If you had killed Yueying,

929
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,959
you would never

930
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,080
have been able to find out
who killed Miss Zhao Rui.

931
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,280
Miss Zhao Rui did not kill herself.
