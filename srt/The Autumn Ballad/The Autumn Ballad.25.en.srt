=Episode 25=

18
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,599
I think we shouldn't take the risk.

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,040
Yan'er.

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,120
Just be good and stay
at the Marquis's residence as Madam Su.

21
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,919
Just send us some money now and then.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,760
That'll be enough to take care of us.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,960
Mesdames, comfortable life isn't what

24
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,800
Qiu Yan is after in my residence.

25
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,440
What she wants the most

26
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,199
is to clear the Qiu's name.

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,199
We have thought about
this plan thoroughly.

28
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,520
It is not something reckless
born from vanity.

29
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,600
I know

30
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,520
all of you
just want to lead a stable life

31
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,759
and are not willing to take any risk.

32
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,520
But are you truly happy

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,119
spending the rest of your life
in Guangji Hall

34
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,960
for something you did not commit?

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,520
I know

36
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,240
we have all been

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,520
looked down upon recently.

38
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,919
Now that the Qiu men are not with us,

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,320
the responsibility falls onto us.

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,800
Men aren't the only ones

41
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,080
who are responsible for the continuity

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,520
of a clan. Women too.

43
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,880
Isn't this Old Madam's jade thumb ring?

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,399
Why do you have it?

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,320
Before Old Madam passed away,

46
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,919
I went to see her.

47
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,479
She gave me this thumb ring

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,960
and told me to lead everyone
through this hardship.

49
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,320
Even before she died,

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,279
Old Madam still wished to see the day
Qiu family regain its former glory.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,479
Qiu Yan is right.

52
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,279
For our father, we can't give up here.

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,399
Qiu Mei, I always trust you.

54
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,880
Among us, you're the most educated,

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,960
the most elegant.

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,679
A vis-à-vis with the Emperor.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,399
You can do it.

58
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,479
As you wish then, Qiu Yan.

59
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,960
The He family serves as generals
for three generations.

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,679
They sneer at superstition.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,399
What they did was very peculiar.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,039
It is indeed unusual of the He family
to hand in pearls as gifts.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,759
Besides, it's not the only unusual
occurrence of late.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,399
You're referring to how Liang Yi
filed an appeal for the Gao family?

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,720
Back then, to avenge his late father,

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
Liang Yi twisted and spun facts

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,799
until Duke Lu's family fell from grace.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,720
The Duke Lu then died in Gannan.

69
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,160
And now, he's singing praises
to Duke Lu's son

70
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,480
to restore his reputation.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,519
I wonder what Duke Lu's son

72
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,640
promised Liang Yi

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,119
that he's willing to work with
his father's killer.

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Liang Yi and his cohorts
have been quite active lately.

75
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,279
They must be up to something.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
I don't know their exact plan

77
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,799
but I do have a theory.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,399
Dengxian Pearl propels the He Family
to stardom

79
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,200
but there's more to it.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,119
His Majesty treasures the pearl a lot.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,839
If the Empyrean Fairy was found,

82
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,760
His Majesty would give her
everything she wanted.

83
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,320
If they have found the Dengxian Pearl,

84
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,000
they must have found the fairy too.

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Imperial Commander Yan will look for
the fairy with his comrades tomorrow.

86
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,480
Other than His Majesty
and the Grand Preceptor,

87
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,079
only the Imperial Commander Yan
knows where the fairy is.

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,839
However, due to my incompetence,

89
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,519
I am unable to dig deeper.

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
Have you found Qiu's dismissed servants

91
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,119
I told you to?

92
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,000
Bring them here.

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,040
Come.

94
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,359
Come.

95
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,359
Don't shove.

96
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:31,600
Go.

97
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,720
Hurry up.

98
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,959
What do you want to do to us?

99
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,480
Sir, we have never committed a crime.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,359
It's a misunderstanding!

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Relax, ladies.

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
I just need to borrow your presence.

103
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,160
If we can't find a solution,

104
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:05,079
we will simply erase the problem.

105
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,839
After I left the Royal Academy,

106
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,480
my family and I escaped to Bian River...

107
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,920
Mei'er, are you ready?

108
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,880
The official is waiting.

109
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,600
All right.

110
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,720
And as I sank deeper into the river,

111
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,200
I remember vaguely that someone
lifted me up.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,959
Qiu Mei, calm down.

113
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,839
Drink this tea before you go.

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,079
Thank you.

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,600
Give it to me.

116
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,679
Mei'er.

117
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,279
Mother.

118
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't worry.

119
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,799
Qiu Mei, just do what you did
in your rehearsal yesterday,

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,959
everything will be fine.

121
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,279
Let's go.

122
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,559
We have to be at Jinxian Spring

123
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
before 7 a.m.

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,600
Qiu Mei, wait.

125
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,720
Let me come with you.

126
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,320
If you have a relative by your side,

127
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,079
you'll feel more reassured.

128
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,720
Let's go.

129
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,679
I will spend most of my day
in the imperial court.

130
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:35,839
Don't worry.

131
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,519
When it's done,

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,760
when everything is over,

133
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,959
or when something goes wrong,

134
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,519
I'll inform you right away.

135
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,279
See you.

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,079
Liang Yi.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,679
Just think about

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,119
how you can thank me

139
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,839
once this is over.

140
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,159
Qiu Mei, what's the matter?

141
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,280
Are you okay?

142
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,520
Both of you need to hurry up.

143
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,520
Or else, we won't make it in time.

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,440
I can't.

145
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,159
What's the matter?

146
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't continue anymore.

147
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,359
Are you all right, Qiu Mei?

148
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,559
My stomach hurts a lot.

149
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,239
What should we do?

150
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,159
The Qiu Family relies on you.

151
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,919
It's all my fault.

152
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,080
I can't do it today.

153
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,239
I'm always a burden

154
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,760
when it matters.

155
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,080
What should we do then?

156
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:17,919
I'll go.

157
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,880
No, you can't, Miss Min.

158
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,359
Let me ask Miss Ying
if she can take her place.

159
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,559
Wait.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,280
It's late now.

161
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,479
You travel fast

162
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,919
but going back and forth like this
won't cut it.

163
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,880
No.

164
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,239
Don't hesitate anymore.

165
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,119
- Miss Min.
- The time is of essence.

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,599
See my sister back.

167
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,919
I will head there using the map.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,640
Go now!

169
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,760
Miss Min.

170
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,640
Lord Liang, let's walk together.

171
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,960
Lord Liang?

172
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,359
Official He, don't wait for me.

173
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,880
I just remember that I need
to attend to something.

174
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:13,679
All right.

175
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,080
See you, Lord Liang.

176
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,679
What is happening?

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,080
When we were nearing the spring,

178
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,880
Miss Qiu Mei had this horrible
stomachache out of a sudden

179
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,760
and couldn't proceed.

180
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,359
If I return to bring Qiu Ying,

181
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,000
it'll be too late.

182
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,679
But the fairy has to be a virgin.

183
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Qiu Min can't possibly...

184
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
It caught everyone by surprise.

185
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,000
I hope His Majesty wouldn't inspect

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
the body of a maiden.

187
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,919
I hope so too.

188
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,110
(Spring Hill)

189
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
Madam Su, a letter for you.

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,155
(To Su Yiwan)

191
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:38,361
(I have Qingdai and Xiuyu.
Your wagon awaits outside.)

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,559
Greetings, Your Majesty.

193
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
Greetings, Your Majesty. I am Qiu Min.

194
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,799
Qiu Min?

195
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,119
What is your relationship
with the incriminated minister, Qiu Yi?

196
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,039
Truth be told,

197
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,479
Qiu Yi is my father.

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Imperial Commander Yan. What happened?

199
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,880
Didn't all Qiu women pass away already?

200
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,119
Your Majesty.

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,760
I went to the spring as requested

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,320
and only found this young woman.

203
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
I dare not to make my own judgment

204
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,320
so I brought her here

205
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,479
and let you decide what to make of her.

206
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,440
The audacity!

207
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,479
You dare
to impersonate the Empyrean Fairy?

208
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,359
Your Majesty.

209
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,440
I have no idea of the fairy you speak of.

210
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,039
According to the Fengjing Prefecture,

211
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,280
all Qiu women drowned after escaping

212
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,359
from the Royal Academy.

213
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,880
Why were you beside the spring then?

214
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
Your Majesty.

215
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,760
When we left the Royal Academy,

216
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:50,000
my family and I escaped to a small boat
on the Bian River.

217
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,440
However, retribution befell us

218
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,880
and a boat disaster occurred.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,760
I thought we would all die
in the Bian River.

220
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,239
But as I sank deeper into the river,

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
I remember vaguely
that someone lifted me up.

222
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,479
I then heard a voice that said

223
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,119
even though I carried sins,

224
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,400
my mission in this world
was far from over

225
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,200
as I shared the same birth date with her.

226
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,359
The Empyrean Fairy...

227
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,000
What else did the voice tell you?

228
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,919
The voice said

229
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,400
that the current emperor
is a wise ruler.

230
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,080
The Heaven will bestow upon him
an auspicious item

231
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,880
that will guarantee his longevity.

232
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,880
And I have to personally
consecrate this auspicious item

233
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,520
before handing it to you, Your Majesty.

234
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,640
Your Majesty!

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,640
Congratulations for you have finally
received the boon from high above.

236
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,559
I shall arrange a ritual now
to thank the Empyrean Fairy

237
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,880
on your behalf, Your Majesty.

238
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,159
Your Majesty, our prayers

239
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,200
are not in vain.

240
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,400
Good.

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,719
Good.

242
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,239
Pick a good day

243
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,239
for the consecration ceremony.

244
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,840
As a token of gratitude
for the fairy's blessing,

245
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,880
I will pardon everyone!

246
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,200
Liu Quan, note it down.

247
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,239
Besides seditious traitors
and murderers,

249
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,119
all criminals will be pardoned.

250
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,000
Noted.

251
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,919
Young Master.

252
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,978
(Spring Hill)

253
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,239
Qiu Yan!

254
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,919
His Majesty pardoned the Qiu Family.

255
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:52,760
Zhou.

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,559
Young Master.

257
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,320
Have you seen Madam Su?

258
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Madam Su received a letter
and left in a hurry

259
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,840
without a message.

260
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:00,760
From whom?

261
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,919
Someone knocked.

262
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,200
I opened the door and saw no one outside

263
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,799
except for a letter on the ground.

264
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,559
Young Master, you're...?

265
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,320
Come.

266
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,840
Sir.

267
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,159
We searched everywhere

268
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,200
and found nothing at all.

269
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:52,799
What about
the Main Administrative Office?

270
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,520
According to our informant
in the Main Administrative Office,

271
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,359
Madam Su wasn't taken inside.

272
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,479
I see.

273
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,520
Bring her to me.

274
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,479
Noted.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,719
Stay put.

276
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,200
Let go of me.

277
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,799
Sir.

278
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,599
- Let go of me!
- She's here.

279
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,119
Master, what did I do wrong?

280
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,039
I serve Old Madam.

281
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,400
If you want to punish me,
you have to get through her first.

282
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,679
Just so you know,

283
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,640
I don't have time for games.

284
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,840
Where is Yuan Lang's base
outside of the city?

285
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,520
I have no idea.

286
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,840
It's you.

287
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:02,559
Go inside.

288
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,479
Young Lady.

289
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,880
You're still alive?

290
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,280
Everyone in the city said you were dead.

291
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,719
Qiu Yan, explain this.

292
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,719
I am Su Yiwan.

293
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:17,959
Official Yuan.

294
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,640
I thought you were a fine gentleman

295
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
who couldn't
see eye to eye with my lord.

296
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,520
I can't believe you would resort
to such a lowly trick.

297
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,119
As long as both of them are still here,

298
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,400
you will never get anything from me.

299
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,199
You just won't slip up, will you?

300
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,800
If you don't know them,

301
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,199
why do you come here?

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,839
Because no innocents should be
harmed because of me.

303
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,959
Don't worry.

304
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm a man of principles.

305
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,239
Come with me.

306
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,040
Come out now.

307
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,880
If you play nice, I will too.

308
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,719
Since you're already here,

309
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
I will not harm both of them.

310
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,880
I would like to toast to Official Yuan.

311
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,199
Why?

312
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,839
Are you afraid of a woman?

313
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,199
Sir, you would truly let us go?

314
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,959
Like I said, we merely borrowed you.

315
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
We're not like the Firewood Office.

316
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,319
We never harm the innocents.

317
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,599
Then...

318
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,079
Then what will you do to that woman?

319
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,119
If I tell you,

320
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,119
you won't be an innocent anymore.

321
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,199
A toast for me

322
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,280
just to buy some time for that two maids
to run away.

323
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,400
Who are you?

324
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,599
You can ask me that
one thousand times, Official Yuan,

325
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,239
and I will still
give you the same answer.

326
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,439
I am Su Yiwan.

327
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:22,479
Fine.

328
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,079
In that case,

329
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,560
I'll just have to be rough with you.

330
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,560
I want Liang Yi to lose his title.

331
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,880
I don't want him to die.

332
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,839
If you come clean,

333
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,119
I can promise you

334
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,319
the Qiu Family's and Liang Yi's safety.

335
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Is there a threat?

336
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,439
Other than me,

337
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,439
you can't hurt anyone anyway.

338
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,199
You see all these torture tools?

339
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,199
I will try them one by one.

340
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,040
Official Yuan.

341
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,079
Do you not feel sorry about yourself?

342
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,199
You laid low outside of the Capital
for three years.

343
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,479
And when you are back to the Capital,
you schemed this and that.

344
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,479
Despite all that, you still can't
outwit my lord.

345
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,959
And now,

346
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,040
you can only bully a woman.

347
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,479
Carry on.

348
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,479
Move now.
The hay cottage outside of the city.

349
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,359
Yes, sir.

350
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,719
Miss Yan. There's more to come.

351
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:01,719
Carry on.

352
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,280
Noted.

353
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,199
Miss Yan. This is a diamond dagger.

354
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,680
It's used to sever tendons.

355
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,319
It won't hurt as much
as the fingers-crusher

356
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,880
but one slice

357
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,880
is enough
to leave you handicapped forever.

358
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,719
Who's there?

359
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,560
Liang Yi.

360
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,319
Yuan Lang, when I pick a fight
with somebody,

361
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,920
I never involve his family.

362
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,560
But Lord Liang, you taught me

363
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,000
to be ruthless.

364
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,560
All right.

365
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,680
I shall show you how ruthless I can be.

366
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:46,959
Sir!

367
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,280
He's a government official.

368
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,439
If we do it right now,

369
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:52,040
Madam Su suffered for nothing.

370
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,479
Let's go back.

371
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:39,662
(Liang Residence)

372
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,359
Lord Liang, Madam Su is all right.

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Just apply some ointment to her fingers.

374
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:54,800
Thanks, physician.

375
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:55,839
Have a safe trip.

376
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,359
You can stay here, Lord Liang.

377
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,479
I told you I'm fine.

378
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:01,959
Sit back down!

379
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,839
Give me your hands.

380
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,479
Hands!

381
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,719
Does it hurt?

382
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,479
On my way back, Song Jin told me

383
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,319
Qiu Min was the one
who entered the palace.

384
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,439
Qiu Mei had a stomachache

385
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,920
so Qiu Min had to replace her.

386
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,520
Don't worry.

387
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,920
His Majesty trusts Qiu Min now.

388
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh.

389
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,760
His Majesty has also pardoned
the Qiu Family.

390
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,599
Really?

391
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,000
Qiu Min

392
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,280
was the most cowardly among us.

393
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,479
But now,

394
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,119
she's the smartest.

395
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,800
We need to talk about you.

396
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,640
Why didn't you wait for me?

397
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,119
You think you can face Yuan Lang alone?

398
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,800
I didn't lose completely, did I?

399
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,280
Where are you going? Come back here.

400
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,560
Come back!

401
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:37,839
Now you know it hurts.

402
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:38,280
No, it doesn't!

403
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,520
What happened to Qingdai and Xiuyu?

404
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,560
Let me apply the ointment first.

405
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,199
Come.

406
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
My people have found them.

407
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,079
They are doing great

408
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:52,959
and are working in a shop.

409
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:55,319
We should thank Yuan Lang
for finding them.

410
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,800
I asked Qin Xuan to redeem them.

411
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,119
Soon, all three of you will be reunited.

412
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,079
I'm glad they are fine.

413
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,800
I know you're worried about them.

414
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,079
But have you considered

415
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,439
what if Yuan Lang's torture got to you?

416
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,359
Our plan to save the Qiu Family
will crumble down.

417
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,079
I won't.

418
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,079
Before I left, I took with me
the poisonous pill

419
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,920
of the Firewood Office from your pouch.

420
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,520
You said

421
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,000
the pill wouldn't melt even if
we held it in our mouth.

422
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,640
I will swallow it when necessary.

423
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:26,800
Look.

424
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,880
I thought about everything.

425
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,479
If I can't take it anymore,

426
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,160
I'll kill myself in front of Yuan Lang.

427
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,800
Are you crazy?

428
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,040
How can you risk your life like this?

429
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,000
If you're dead,

430
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,839
what the point of executing
this elaborate plan?

431
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,920
Rescuing Qingdai and Xiuyu
was my own decision.

432
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,560
You have done enough for us.

433
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,160
I don't want to owe you anymore.

434
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,599
What do you mean by that?

435
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,359
You're now the Madam Su
of the Marquis Residence.

436
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,560
Madam Su, all right?

437
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,160
Risk your life if you want to.

438
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,439
I will forget
about your sacrifice anyway.

439
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,199
Sir.

440
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,439
Why are you back here, sir?

441
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
Why didn't you accompany Madam Su?

442
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,079
Why should I?

443
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,040
She won't take care of herself anyway.

444
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,319
Oh, Song Jin.

445
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Where is
the Cotton Rose Jinchuang Solvent

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,160
given to us by the Imperial Court?

447
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Why do you need it, sir?

448
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:16,880
Are you injured?

449
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,880
I am not.

450
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,040
Then...

451
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,000
Madam Su?

452
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,719
It's in the storage.
I'll get it for you.

453
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,719
You should be indebted to me.

454
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,400
The more the merrier.

455
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,320
(Qiu Residence)

456
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:49,851
(Qiu Residence)

457
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,320
(Sealed by the Main Administrative Office
in the 38th Chengzhao Year)

458
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:14,676
(Qiu Residence)

459
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:39,880
Aunt.

460
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,640
We heard you will be returning today.

461
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,560
My mother knows
that the daily necessity

462
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,040
must be lacking in your residence.

463
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,560
So she asked me to send some over.

464
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,680
My dear child.

465
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,199
I'm so glad you and your mother
still remember us.

466
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,560
Have I aged a lot?

467
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,680
Aunt, I came

468
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,000
with two other persons.

469
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,880
Qingdai.

470
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,760
Young Lady!

471
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,079
I thought I could never see you again.

472
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,640
Ever since the Qiu Residence was raided,

473
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Qingdai and I were sold
to somewhere else.

474
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,134
We were captured

475
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,040
by the Main Administrative Office
a couple of days ago

476
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,280
but fortunately, Second Young Lady
rescued us.

477
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,400
Young Master Qin then redeemed us.

478
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,680
I'm glad you're here.

479
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,119
Let's go inside.

480
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,640
Young Lady, let me take this for you.

481
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,560
I was wondering

482
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,920
if you would pay me a visit.

483
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,239
How did I do, Qiu Yan?

484
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,040
What you did to our family

485
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,439
is good.

486
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,479
I'm sure father will praise you too.

487
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,119
But

488
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
if father knows everything you did,

489
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,599
he might not be able to recognize you.

490
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,359
He wouldn't be able to imagine

491
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,760
that his most obedient daughter

492
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,800
poisoned her own sister

493
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,880
just to greet His Majesty

494
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,760
and to prove herself.

495
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,280
H... How did you know?

496
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,880
I already told Qiu Mei

497
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,800
not to eat anything
before she greeted His Majesty.

498
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,800
She had your tea before she left

499
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,959
and you volunteered to accompany her.

500
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,239
It's too coincidental

501
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,680
for it not to be a plan.

502
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,400
Yes.

503
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,800
I want to let

504
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,560
our family know

505
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,800
that you're not the only one

506
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
who can save the family.

507
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,000
Where will Qiu Yan go now?

508
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,000
No need to worry about my private life.

509
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,120
I admit I'm not as resourceful as you

510
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,080
and I couldn't rescue the Qiu Family.

511
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
But I will wait.

512
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,120
For what?

513
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,199
For her forgiveness.

514
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,120
What about Qiu Min?

515
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,840
I will take good care of Qiu Min.

516
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,239
Are you trying to be like Emperor Shun

517
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,239
who married the sisters,

518
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
E'huang and Nv Ying?

519
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,479
You should know this better.

520
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,520
Pleasing all parties

521
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,320
will only harm all parties.

522
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,800
Qiu Yan, you always said I was a coward.

523
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Do you like

524
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,439
the current me?

525
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,840
Do you have any idea
how risky your endeavor was?

526
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,280
So what?

527
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,719
I am now the reincarnation
of the Empyrean Fairy.

528
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,560
I am not the daughter
of an incriminated minister.

529
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,199
I can now
be part of the Duke Ying's family.

530
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,239
If you get what you want,

531
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:10,760
I'm happy for you.

532
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,840
You know Qin Xuan the most.

533
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,360
He will marry me.

534
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,479
If you have gotten what you want,

535
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:20,399
you don't need to prove yourself
in front of me.

536
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,280
You say all these

537
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,080
because you want
to hear them yourself too.

538
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,239
You want to believe that hurting me
wasn't for nothing.

539
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,199
Your life with him

540
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,159
is your private business.

541
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I do not need to know.

542
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,679
Didn't you just give me a compliment?

543
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,560
You said you would be happy for me

544
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,479
but in fact,

545
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,239
you never forgive me.

546
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,239
Qiu Yan.

547
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:02,760
Qiu Yan.

548
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,560
I have something to tell you.

549
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,040
Hear me out.

550
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,679
Just two sentences.

551
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,280
Su Yiwan and Mr. Qin
shouldn't be in contact.

552
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,399
Lord Liang helped Qiu Family this much

553
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,959
because of Qiu Yan.

554
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,439
Now that she's with him,

555
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,600
I'm sure she's in good hands.

556
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:44,520
Qin Xuan, our family has been pardoned.

557
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,800
We don't need to hide
our relationship anymore.

558
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,040
When do you

559
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,439
plan to tell your parents about us?

560
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,159
No rush.

561
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,239
I'm just too happy

562
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,120
and I couldn't help but mention it.

563
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,040
Come, First Sister-in-law.

564
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,320
This table full of dishes

565
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,120
seems surreal.

566
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,679
Did we truly return home?

567
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Madam, we did return home.

568
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,560
Back then, two tables weren't enough
to accommodate all of us.

569
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,879
And now, even one table is excessive.

570
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,159
This is like a dream.

571
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,760
Don't sulk.

572
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,159
The Qiu men will come back
to the Capital soon.

573
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,000
The Qiu Family survived the hardship.

574
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,520
It can only get better from now on.

575
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,280
This date shall be

576
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,239
our annual celebratory day.

577
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,199
All right.

578
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,840
Let's drink.

579
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,479
The Qiu Residence was unattended
for a long time.

580
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:12,520
It's time to fill it with lively spirit

581
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,280
to get rid of this misfortune.

582
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:15,919
Come.

583
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,159
We can come back here

584
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,800
thanks to Qiu Yan.

585
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,520
If she's here,

586
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,520
then this meal will be perfect.

587
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,120
Madam Liu.

588
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,439
I'm just too happy.

589
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,479
- Happy.
- Come.

590
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,280
Eat.

591
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,639
Let's eat.

592
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:01,716
(Spring Hill)

593
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,120
Song Jin told me

594
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,239
that the Qiu's servants
haven't all returned yet

595
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,879
so your family cooked themselves

596
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,879
and made a feast.

597
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,719
Thank you for everything you did.

598
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,560
You get all serious when you're upset.

599
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,439
Normally, you will bicker with me.

600
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,919
You can't reunite with them

601
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,719
temporarily.

602
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,719
Once the dust has settled

603
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,239
and your father has returned,

604
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,600
I have ways

605
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,399
to reunite all of you.

606
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,760
Oh, I'm free tomorrow.

607
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,639
Now that the Qiu Family is all safe,

608
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,280
let's go shopping together.

609
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:50,959
Okay.

610
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,320
Back then, the mesdames did not agree
with the Empyrean Fairy plan

611
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,439
but Qiu Yan convinced you.

612
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,360
Truth be told,

613
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,719
we have lived for one or two decades more.

614
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,000
But no one is as bold

615
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,320
as Qiu Yan.

616
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,719
When we hit rock bottom,

617
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,879
Qiu Yan never mentioned the insults

618
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,639
we used to hurl at her.

619
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,560
We really

620
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,239
should apologize to her.

621
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,360
Don't mind it.

622
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,199
My daughter

623
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,040
is no ordinary person.

624
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,840
Now that she's married
to the Marquis Weiyuan,

625
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,159
she's the wife of Marquis now.

626
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,239
I'm sure she won't mind it,

627
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,760
not with her nobility.

628
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Not the legal wife. Just a concubine.

629
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,040
Madam Kou.

630
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,520
You switched your stance
now that you are here.

631
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,080
Without my daughter,

632
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,280
we wouldn't be able to dine
comfortably here.

633
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,159
I did not criticize Qiu Yan.

634
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,239
But what I said is a truth.

635
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:55,520
Enough.

636
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,320
Everything was fine just now.

637
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,800
Let it slide already.

638
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,840
It must be peaceful now

639
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,840
because we're back to squabbling.

640
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,679
Qiu Min contributed a lot too.

641
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:14,840
Without her,

642
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,280
Qiu Yan's plan

643
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,600
will not work too.

644
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,199
I'm tired now.

645
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,040
My aunts, please enjoy the dinner.

646
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,479
Min.

647
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,479
What a unique girl.

648
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,239
Come. Let's tidy up.

649
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:37,040
Don't let these dishes go to waste.

650
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay. Come.

651
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,360
It's been a while since I last

652
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,679
sauntered these streets
in a carefree manner.

653
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,760
Guess I jinxed it
because someone is following us.

654
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,959
One by the blacksmith,
two by the gambling house,

655
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,159
and one by the alley to the left.

656
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,600
All of them are
from the Main Administrative Office.

657
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,840
It seems like Madam Su
needs an entourage

658
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,199
whenever she goes out.

659
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,800
And I

660
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,840
will not be merciful on your pocket.

661
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,360
Don't you underestimate me.

662
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,639
I did inherit the title of Marquis.

663
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,679
And I

664
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,679
am expensive.

665
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,080
I'm sure you already know.

666
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,600
Bring it on.

667
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,811
♪I don't know when it started♪

668
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,600
This one.

669
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,360
Okay.

670
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,680
♪When I see your smile,
my heart beats faster♪

671
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:21,959
And this one.

672
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:22,679
Sure.

673
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,360
