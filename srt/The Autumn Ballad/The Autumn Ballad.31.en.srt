=Episode 31=

18
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,000
Qin Xuan is so useless.

19
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,199
He couldn't even watch over you
like he's supposed to.

20
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,120
It's not his fault.

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,279
I threatened him
into letting me come here.

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,559
Also, let me tell you this.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
If you leave me out of it again,

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,599
I will never forgive you.

25
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,440
You asked Qingdai to leave yesterday.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,679
Why can't I do the same?

27
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,800
You and Qingdai are different.

28
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,679
Qingdai,

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Mother, Madam Liu,

30
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,000
and Min'er.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
I want all of them to be safe.

32
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,720
I don't want to drag them with me.

33
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,160
But it's different with you.

34
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,880
I wish to live and die

35
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,639
together with you.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
Liang Yi.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,839
The moment you handcuffed me,

38
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,759
our fates intertwined.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
The handcuff is the evidence.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,279
It represents our shared fate.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
You owe it to me

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,639
to reciprocate the same sentiment.

43
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,440
Qin Xuan.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,039
You didn't go to the Ministry of War today.

45
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,839
No one in your residence
knows where you went either.

46
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,440
So where did you go?

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Did you leave to see Qiu Yan again?

48
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,720
So what if I said yes?

49
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,880
Qin Xuan, don't forget

50
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,520
that Qiu Yan is Su Yiwan.

51
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,119
I am your future wife.

52
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:15,800
Qiu Min.

53
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,759
I'm tired.

54
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,880
Can you be sensible

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,520
and stop bothering me at this moment?

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,479
I'm not sensible?

57
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,039
In your eyes,

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
someone selfish and egocentric

59
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,000
like Qiu Yan

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,039
is sensible then?

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Yes.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,479
When she needed to be with you,

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,800
she seduced you.

64
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,559
When she didn't need you anymore,

65
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,679
she discarded you.

66
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,199
She never considers others' feelings.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,559
So this is

68
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,639
the kind of woman

69
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,399
you refuse to forget?

70
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,600
She doesn't love me

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,160
but that doesn't mean
she can't love someone else.

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,440
She takes love
more seriously than anyone.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,160
It's just...

74
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,559
It's just I'm not good enough

75
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,559
for her love.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,119
You think Qiu Yan
came back to Lord Liang

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,440
out of love.

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,160
But I

79
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,240
think that she's just trying
to be the heroine

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
so that you and Lord Liang

81
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,519
fall deeper into her charm.

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
If you despise her this much,

83
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,760
why do you keep imitating her?

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
Weren't you trying to be like her

85
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,559
that day you analyzed the case for me?

86
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,920
Unfortunately, you're inferior to her.

87
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,399
You can never be like her.

88
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,720
Wait.

89
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,760
You did succeed once.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,320
That night when you drugged me,

91
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,519
I mistook you for her

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,839
with my addled mind.

93
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,880
My memory did not fail me.

94
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,119
It has the same smell

95
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,480
as Mr. Ding.

96
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,040
Black green body

97
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,799
and this peculiar scent...

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,640
Your father died from Anling poison.

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,359
It seems like

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,679
Yuan Lang isn't the culprit behind.

101
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,920
It's the Northern Liangs.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,079
Mr. Zhan is not from Northern Liang.

103
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,079
There are two possible ways to explain

104
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,279
why he knew about everything.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,119
When he was diagnosing my father,

106
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,239
he discovered that my father
was poisoned.

107
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,679
Yet he couldn't tell anyone somehow.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Or,

109
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,920
he was the one who poisoned my father
on behalf of the Northern Liangs.

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,480
This poison from Northern Liang

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
is undetectable shortly after death.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,239
Its peculiar odor only appears

113
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,440
the earliest a few days after death.

114
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,480
Mr. Zhan

115
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,320
couldn't possibly detect it when
your father just passed away.

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,119
That leaves one explanation then.

117
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,480
The Northern Liangs made
Mr. Zhan poison your father.

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,440
Mr. Zhan was an Imperial Physician.

119
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,040
Why

120
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,239
was he sent to diagnose your father?

121
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,559
Noble Consort Guo
has always been close to my family.

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,359
When my father got into the accident,

123
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,440
she was very worried

124
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,559
and sent Mr. Zhan to treat my father.

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Do you know

126
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,480
that Her Highness
is a Northern Liang then?

127
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,640
Impossible.

128
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,480
She and my mother
were once inner palace maids.

129
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
Our law states

130
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
that the three previous generations
of inner palace maids

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,119
have to find their roots in Dashuo

132
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,320
and they can't be the daughters of
physicians, shamans, or merchants.

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,359
Dashuo and Northern Liang
fought for nearly a century.

134
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,559
Though peace is sometimes assured

135
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,640
and occasional business activities
are found by the border,

136
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,079
there is no way a Northern Liang

137
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,720
can enter the Imperial Palace.

138
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,079
Do you have anything to back up

139
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,799
your claim?

140
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,000
When I was by the frontier,

141
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,760
I saw many Northern Liang merchants
that traded in Dashuo.

142
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,600
I found out that the daughters
of Northern Liang merchants

143
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,480
carry a big ring on their
right index finger since young.

144
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,920
It will only be removed
when they are married.

145
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,679
Due to the size of the ring,

146
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,279
their right index finger

147
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,880
will always stick out
compared to other fingers.

148
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,320
And because they have worn the ring
for many years,

149
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,079
even when they remove it,

150
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,119
they will continue to lift their right
index finger out of habit.

151
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,559
There will also be a ring mark

152
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,600
on the second joint of their
right index finger.

153
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,040
(And in the inn back then,)

154
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,839
(Her Highness's right index finger)

155
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,160
(bore the same mark.)

156
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,119
However, I don't understand

157
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,399
why Her Highness
wanted to kill your father.

158
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,160
Old Madam told me many times

159
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,239
that she was very close to Her Highness.

160
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,279
You also told me

161
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,920
that Her Highness is like your
extended family.

162
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,160
She was kind towards you
and your father.

163
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Considering
her Northern Liang identity...

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Only when her life was at stake

165
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,679
that she would be forced
to kill someone.

166
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Besides,

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,480
if Her Highness is a Northern Liang,

168
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,600
the Crown Prince is then
half a Northern Liang.

169
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:20,279
Maybe your father discovered

170
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
her true identity,

171
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,200
or perhaps
he was real close to the truth.

172
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,279
However, the ring mark
on her index finger

173
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,320
is insufficient to incriminate her.

174
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,280
We need to retrace

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
my father's steps before he died.

176
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
Everyone he met

177
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,760
and anywhere he went.

178
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,440
Are you Hei Laosan?

179
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,919
I have a question for you.

180
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,400
It seems like you have mastered
the technique

181
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,599
I taught you in private.

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,520
I practiced it every day

183
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
to protect myself.

184
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,080
Spare me, gentlemen.

185
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,679
I have already quit

186
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,159
being a human trafficker.

187
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,320
I have stopped using

188
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,760
Hei Laosan as my moniker too.

189
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,760
We're here for something from years ago.

190
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,679
Answer us

191
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,760
and we will let you go.

192
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay. Okay.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,119
I'll speak!

194
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,479
- I'll speak!
- Qiu Yan.

195
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,400
Did the late Marquis Weiyuan

196
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,559
ask you to investigate
a Northern Liang woman?

197
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,400
Yes,

198
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,640
he did.

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,599
She was smuggled to the Capital
from Mozhou.

200
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,840
He also took away
her indenture contract.

201
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,719
How old was the woman?

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
She was around 12 or 13
when she arrived.

203
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,719
I suppose

204
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,840
she's in her 40s now.

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,479
I'll have a look.

206
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,200
Stand guard here.

207
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
Careful, sir.

208
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
Noble Consort Guo celebrated

209
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,440
her 40th birthday last time.

210
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,000
The indenture contract will contain
the year, the physical appearance,

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,159
and the thumbprint signature.

212
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,440
It can prove that Noble Consort Guo
is a Northern Liang.

213
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,159
My father had the proof

214
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
so Her Highness wanted to kill him.

215
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,359
So

216
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Noble Consort Guo killed Mr. Zhan
preemptively

217
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,520
but you found a point of interest
and continued investigating.

218
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,440
That's why you were framed
and persecuted.

219
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,159
Lord Liang, this is...

220
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
Why did you bring her here?

221
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,559
She shouldn't be involved.

222
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,599
Lord Liang, Mr. Yao is not at fault.

223
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
I need to see you urgently.

224
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,599
I suppose

225
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,159
since he's not that related
to the Firewood Office,

226
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,000
you will turn to him.

227
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,039
What's the matter?

228
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,320
It's about Madam Jin.

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm worried about Madam Jin, who is
all alone in the Marquis Weiyuan Residence.

230
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,320
So I tried to get some news in secret.

231
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,320
I found out

232
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,119
that although
the Main Administrative Office

233
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,599
delivered food at every mealtime,

234
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,239
they are often rotten food.

235
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,919
Normal folks can hardly swallow them,

236
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,119
let alone Madam Jin who is used

237
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
to a lavish lifestyle.

238
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,559
She might not be able to last for long.

239
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,280
Yuan Lang put Madam Jin on house arrest

240
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,239
but he never threatens Liang Yi

241
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,599
with her safety.

242
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,599
And now, he's mistreating her.

243
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,200
Why is he shooting himself in the foot?

244
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,599
I find it suspicious too.

245
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,640
I think Yuan Lang
did not want this to happen.

246
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,994
The Main Administrative Office

247
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:31,400
and the Firewood Office have been rivals
for many years.

248
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,479
I think some of the people there

249
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,960
are venting their frustration
on your family.

250
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,320
I wonder how

251
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,200
you can clear your name, Lord Liang.

252
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,520
If this carries on,

253
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,919
Madam Jin will be in danger.

254
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,345
I got my hands on the number of

255
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:46,719
Main Administrative Office
forces stationed there

256
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,919
as well as their shift schedule
from the guards.

257
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,320
You might need to plan

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,599
your action, Lord Liang.

259
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,239
This will serve me well.

260
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,520
Let's not dally

261
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,039
and act tonight.

262
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,679
Sir,

263
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,239
the ambush is in place per your order.

264
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,960
We're waiting for Miss Xiaoxiao
to arrive with her target.

265
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,640
But

266
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,799
Miss Xiaoxiao

267
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,520
has always been reluctant
to work with you, sir.

268
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,840
Are we

269
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,200
being set up here?

270
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,400
She is in love with Liang Yi

271
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,679
so she'll understand why it's beneficial
to work with me.

272
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,479
Just ask others to wait for my order.

273
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,119
Noted.

274
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,080
I just want to say

275
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,960
thank you.

276
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,000
It's my duty.

277
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,919
If I'm still unmarried,

278
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,599
I'm your informant.

279
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,159
Once you return to the city,
go back to the Royal Academy.

280
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,840
Why can't I come with you?

281
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,159
It's too dangerous.

282
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,799
Yuan Lang has already set his eyes
on you from last time.

283
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,919
You can't attract more attention now.

284
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,359
I told you last time

285
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,400
that you should return
to your stable life.

286
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,840
I purchased a land

287
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,000
with your name.

288
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,479
Look for the owner of Heming Building.

289
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,799
He has a copy of the deed

290
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,000
and he will take care
of everything for you.

291
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,760
Your thoughtfulness

292
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,239
is touching, Lord Liang.

293
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,359
But

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,880
why

295
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,039
did you let Miss Qiu Yan take the risk
with you then?

296
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,719
Qiu Yan said she came back

297
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,599
to go through this with me.

298
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,679
I know her

299
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,760
so I won't turn her down.

300
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:19,880
Lord Liang,

301
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,719
if Qiu Yan is willing to die for you,

302
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,400
so am I.

303
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,679
I know you are

304
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,599
but I don't need you to.

305
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,280
I don't want to owe you anything either.

306
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,679
Qiu Yan and I are different.

307
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,320
We promise each other

308
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,239
that we'll share our fate.

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,200
There's no owing whatsoever.

310
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,760
Share a fate?

311
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,159
If Qiu Yan dies for me,

312
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,760
she won't leave alone.

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,919
So I can't

314
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,679
even die for you now, Lord Liang?

315
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,479
This is not what I meant, Miss Shi.

316
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
Have you thought

317
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,520
that maybe you love me

318
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,200
because you need someone
to give your love to?

319
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
You're not me.

320
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,599
You can't dismiss
my feelings just like that.

321
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,440
I never asked for anything.

322
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,520
Is dying for someone I love

323
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,919
a luxury now?

324
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,680
What I mean is

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,959
you deserve to live your own life.

326
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,640
I see.

327
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,160
Run now, Lord Liang.

328
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,880
Run with Miss Qiu Yan.

329
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,760
Your mother is just fine.

330
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,439
I lied to you.

331
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,160
Yuan Lang and I had a deal.

332
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,119
I just have to lure both of you out of
the hay storage under Ministry of war.

333
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,439
As soon as you appear,

334
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,839
they will capture you.

335
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,239
Miss Shi.

336
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,760
Why did you do this?

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,760
He said he could keep you alive

338
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,280
and make you marry me.

339
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,959
Go now, Lord Liang.

340
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,800
If you stay in this storage,

341
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,000
they will

342
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,599
set everything on fire at night

343
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,479
and force you out.

344
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,119
You still have the time

345
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,520
to run now.

346
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,800
Come with me.

347
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,880
Someone's there.

348
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,280
Over here.

349
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,319
Wait.

350
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,400
Yuan Lang's men should be lying
in ambush on the other side.

351
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,319
If it's not Yuan Lang's men,

352
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,000
then they must be those people
who were hunting me.

353
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,319
What should we do?

354
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,920
We can't involve them.

355
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,040
Hold on.

356
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,079
Someone is on the move within the woods.

357
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,079
Sir.

358
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,239
That area falls under
the Ministry of War's jurisdiction.

359
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,079
If we barge in,

360
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,760
they will hold us accountable.

361
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:17,560
I don't care.

362
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,079
The situation has changed.

363
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,079
I'll excuse myself
in front of His Majesty later.

364
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,000
Go.

365
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,400
We can't involve them.

366
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,319
What did you do?

367
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,199
Don't worry.

368
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,319
He fainted. That's all.

369
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,920
The needle is laced with narcotics.

370
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,079
They will search this area soon.

371
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
Mr. Yao and I will lure them away.

372
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,959
When they are gone,

373
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,079
find a way to escape.

374
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,400
Miss Qiu Yan.

375
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,160
I can finally repay the kindness

376
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,920
you and Mr. Qin gave me.

377
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,000
No, we leave together.

378
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,199
There's no time.

379
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,800
If we leave as four,

380
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,079
it'll be too obvious.

381
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,959
No, there must be a better way.

382
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,079
Miss Shi, you can't go.

383
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,000
If you die,

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,040
I can't face Liang Yi.

385
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,239
There's no better way, Qiu Yan.

386
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,880
Remember.

387
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,400
I did this

388
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,160
for myself,

389
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,199
not for you.

390
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
To be frank,

391
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,880
if you die for him today,

392
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,800
perhaps

393
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,199
I might be able to stay by his side.

394
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,319
But

395
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,680
even if I do,

396
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,319
he'll miss you forever.

397
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,560
He'll think about you forever.

398
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,040
I can't stand that.

399
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,800
I'll be mad with jealousy.

400
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,319
I'll let you

401
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,319
suffer that instead.

402
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,160
Qiu Yan.

403
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,760
Live well.

404
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,479
Tell Liang Yi

405
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,560
that I might not be able to live
and die with him

406
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,560
but he will never be able to forget me.

407
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,640
And now,

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,439
I'll live in his mind forever.

409
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,079
It's them. How can this be?

410
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:41,400
Where's Liang Yi?

411
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,439
Bury the two of them.

412
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,160
Yes, sir.

413
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,839
Liang Yi?

414
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:10,479
Liang Yi, are you awake?

415
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Liang Yi.

416
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,199
Liang Yi.

417
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,000
Are you all right?

418
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,280
What happened?

419
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,040
Where did they go?

420
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,959
They dressed

421
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,800
like us

422
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,319
and lured those assassins

423
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,000
away.

424
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,359
I think they are

425
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,119
dead now.

426
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,199
Liang Yi. Liang Yi.

427
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,640
Are you okay?

428
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,800
(I got this for you.)

429
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,719
(This needle is unnoticeable)

430
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:24,959
(so you can carry it all the time.)

431
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,719
Even if someone sees it,

432
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,920
it won't raise any suspicion.

433
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,359
Its head is laced with narcotics

434
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,680
and when inserted into someone's body,

435
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,280
the target will lose consciousness

436
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,239
and be paralyzed for two hours.

437
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,439
It can protect you

438
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,199
without harming anyone's life.

439
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
You won't be a killer.

440
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,000
How thoughtful of you, Lord Liang.

441
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,239
Miss Shi.

442
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,719
Let me ask you again.

443
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,839
Do you seriously want

444
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,760
to be the Firewood Office's informant?

445
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:57,640
You can still quit now.

446
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,280
Lord Liang,

447
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,640
do you believe in what you're doing now?

448
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,199
The evil yet rules

449
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,199
so I have to use unconventional means.

450
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,800
I believe the path I took

451
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,959
is the right one.

452
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,479
I don't know politics.

453
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,199
You believe in what you're doing

454
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,599
and I

455
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,119
believe in you.

456
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,040
Every time I went to the Royal Academy,

457
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,000
she would sing and play songs to me.

458
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,760
Her music masked

459
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,719
my instructions to her

460
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,319
during each visit.

461
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,560
She played songs for me for three years

462
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,400
but I can't even recall
a single song she played.

463
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,719
All I had in my mind

464
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,760
was the instructions.

465
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,479
Before she left,

466
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,079
she asked me to tell you this.

467
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,800
She said

468
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,920
she might not be able to live
and die with you

469
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,040
but you would never
be able to forget her.

470
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,479
And now,

471
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,839
she'll live in your mind forever.

472
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
We can't stay here for long.

473
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,479
Let's go.

474
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,479
Okay.

475
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,800
Sir.

476
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,599
We have searched everywhere.

477
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,439
Liang Yi and Qiu Yan
are nowhere to be seen.

478
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:07,369
(Liang Residence)

479
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,719
How can we help, Eunuch?

480
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Her Highness asked me

481
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,760
to invite Madam Jin
to the Imperial Palace.

482
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,880
(Liang Residence)
Eunuch,

483
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,479
(Liang Residence)
this goes against the rules, I'm afraid.

484
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,079
His Majesty is handling

485
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Lord Liang's case.

486
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,119
If you mess up, your entire family
will go down with you.

487
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,000
You need not use His Majesty's title
to scare me.

488
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,680
We're here today to take Madam Jin away

489
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
on lawful grounds.

490
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,839
We're not harboring criminals.

491
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,680
If Lord Liang is found guilty,

492
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,520
Her Highness will send Madam Jin

493
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,400
to the Main Administrative Office
immediately.

494
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,839
Move aside.

495
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:04,600
(Liang Residence)

496
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,351
(Mude Hall)

497
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:13,839
Qin Xuan.

498
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,040
Yuan Lang just left.

499
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,319
Don't make any noise.

500
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:20,880
Yuan Lang was here?

501
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,760
What happened?

502
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,719
Miss Xiaoxiao and Yao Gai

503
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,839
lured our pursuers away.

504
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,319
The most dangerous place now

505
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,640
is the safest spot.

506
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,560
So after the Main Administrative Office
searched this place,

507
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,199
we returned.

508
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,439
I'm glad both of you survived this.

509
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,599
But Miss Xiaoxiao and Yao Gai

510
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,959
might be...

511
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,000
Yuan Lang killed them?

512
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,719
No.

513
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,959
Noble Consort Guo did.

514
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,119
What?

515
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,079
Noble Consort Guo is a Northern Liang?

516
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,680
Another Northern Liang.

517
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,079
Recently, Beixue and I discovered

518
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,479
that there's this odd band of
Northern Liangs in the Capital.

519
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,119
I was once tasked to investigate

520
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,319
a Northern Liang merchants robbery case.

521
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,920
Although the case has been concluded,

522
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:09,560
what was peculiar was that

523
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,640
when I returned the goods

524
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,079
to the Northern Liang merchants,

525
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,199
they weren't willing
to check their goods in public.

526
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:18,479
It was almost as if they didn't want
anyone to see what was in the box.

527
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,160
Therefore,
I followed them to their storage.

528
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,239
I found out that the goods
they were hiding

529
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,640
were just a box
full of petals like this.

530
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,680
The person claimed
in the Ministry of War

531
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:36,439
that his goods were intended to be sold
to a Dashuo merchant.

532
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,560
But Mr. Qin here

533
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,040
saw that he gave
this box of flower petals

534
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,479
to another Northern Liang.

535
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,119
What's the matter, Qiu Yan?

536
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,760
This is an Anling Blossom petal.

537
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,560
Liang Yi's father and Mr. Ding

538
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,839
were killed by the poison
extracted from this plant.

539
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,079
What did the Northern Liang
who took the box of petals look like?

540
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,880
Scary-looking.

541
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
There's a mole between his eyebrows.

542
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,160
What are you doing?

543
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,359
He is one of the assassins sent

544
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,119
by Noble Consort Guo to kill Liang Yi.

545
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,599
It seems like Noble Consort Guo

546
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,119
didn't just raise a group of assassins.

547
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,079
She even has

548
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,000
a band of Northern Liang spies
disguised as merchants

549
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
lurking in the Capital.

550
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:30,920
Lord Liang.

551
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,599
What are you doing?

552
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,719
Eunuch Wang.

553
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,160
Why are you here?

554
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,400
Lord Liang,

555
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,119
Her Highness
wishes to give you something.

556
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,800
Hold on.

557
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,479
I'll show it to you.

558
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
Lord Liang.

559
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,520
This belongs to my mother.

560
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,119
What do you plan to do to my mother?

561
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,359
Wait, Lord Liang.

562
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,719
Her Highness and Madam Jin
are practically like sisters.

563
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,359
She won't do anything to Madam Jin.

564
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,959
Her Highness asked me

565
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,760
to bring Madam Jin to her

566
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,040
for her safety.

567
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,959
Her Highness is worried
about your safety too

568
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,160
and has arranged so that

569
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,599
you can leave.

570
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:32,800
Lord Liang.

571
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,599
You won't believe me?

572
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:18,639
Your Highness.

573
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,639
They are here.

574
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,479
You're dismissed.

575
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,360
Noted.

576
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,000
Liang Yi.

577
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,280
You won't

578
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,600
greet a Noble Consort anymore?

579
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,959
Where is my mother?

580
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,959
If you play nice,

581
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,879
she will be safe.

582
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,120
You killed my father.

583
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,840
I can't possibly let you off the hook.

584
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,959
Your father was a loyal man.

585
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,040
But

586
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,439
he shouldn't have
investigated my origin.

587
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,360
You killed the late Marquis

588
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,199
and for these six years,
you maintain a close tie with Madam Jin

589
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,760
and call her your sister

590
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,679
as if nothing happened.

591
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,639
Oh, this bluntness.

592
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,239
Also, the audacity
to collude with Liang Yi.

593
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,760
You two are a perfect match.

594
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,679
Therefore, live for one another

595
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,280
and leave

596
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,800
the Capital tonight,

597
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,600
never to return.

598
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,040
As long as you don't return
to the Capital,

599
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,600
Madam Jin will be safe.

600
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,199
You won't kill me?

601
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Liang Yi.

602
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,760
You grew up under my watch.

603
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,959
If you can keep my secret,

604
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,120
I can keep you alive.

605
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Spare me the crocodile tears.

606
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,360
Do you think we're kids?

607
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,760
You set up ambushes

608
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,479
and framed Liang Yi for sedition.

609
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,639
You even sent out Northern Liang
assassins to hunt us down.

610
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,520
What assassins?

611
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,159
I found out that Mr. Ding

612
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,800
was killed by a group of Northern Liangs.

613
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,000
And that group has been

614
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,000
hunting me down

615
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,520
after I was put on the wanted list.

616
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,600
Aren't they

617
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,120
your stashed weapons made

618
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,560
to keep your secret under wrap?

619
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:11,879
Not at all.

620
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,159
When I was told

621
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,399
that you and Qiu Yan
exhumed your father's body

622
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,120
to investigate,

623
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,959
I thought

624
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,280
that you might be reopening
your father's old case.

625
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,600
Therefore, I sent out the eunuch

626
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,639
to find your whereabouts.

627
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,399
My aim was to stop you

628
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,080
from sticking your nose into
old history.

629
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,159
That's all.

630
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,639
I am a Northern Liang.

631
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,159
But

632
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,679
I never did anything

633
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,760
to harm the Dashuo Dynasty.

634
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,439
I brought both of you here.

635
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,520
If I wanted you dead,

636
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,719
you wouldn't be here

637
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,520
spewing nonsense.

638
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:01,800
In that case,

639
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,360
there's another group
of Northern Liangs then.

640
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,320
Your Highness.

641
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,479
It seems like the whole thing

642
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,879
is more complicated than I imagined.

643
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,320
Other than you and Yuan Lang,

644
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,919
another group of Northern Liangs is in play

645
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,159
and they are trying to frame you.

646
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,639
What happened between you and my father,

647
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,760
Your Highness?

648
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,159
Please do not hide anything from me.

649
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
I suppose

650
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,159
it's useless to hide anymore.

651
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,040
Have a seat.

652
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,280
I am

653
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,760
the daughter of a traveling
Northern Liang merchant.

654
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:01,600
My father traded with the Dashuos
in Mozhou often.

655
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,600
One day,

656
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,600
I went to the outskirt to play

657
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,639
and I was kidnapped
by human traffickers.

658
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
One thing led to another.

659
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,399
I got into the Imperial Palace
as a palace maid.

660
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,639
After a few years,

661
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,840
I was lucky enough to gain
the favor of His Majesty.

662
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,600
And your mother helped me

663
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,879
to become who I am today.

664
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,159
I thought no one

665
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,159
would ever find out about this.

666
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,919
But six years ago,

667
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,600
I was made a Noble Consort

668
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,479
and my son

669
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,639
became the Crown Prince.

670
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,000
I finally had a good day

671
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,080
but to my surprise,

672
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,760
I discovered that your father

673
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,159
submitted a memorandum
to make my origin known.

674
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,000
I was serving His Majesty tea
at that time

675
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,939
(Your Majesty, Noble Consort Guo is a
Northern Liang. From, Liang Yuansu.)

676
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
and I saw

677
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,159
that memorandum by chance.

678
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,040
Fortunately,

679
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,159
His Majesty hasn't read it

680
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
(Memorandum)
so I hid it

681
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,560
and destroyed it.

682
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:15,750
(Memorandum)

683
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,919
Conveniently,

684
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,879
your father was injured by Duke Lu.

685
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,120
I seized this opportunity

686
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,040
and poisoned your father

687
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,639
to nip the scandal in the bud.

688
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,982
(Liang Residence)

689
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,360
Where's father?

690
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,159
Did you see your indenture contract

691
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:59,639
alongside the memorandum?

692
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,479
My indenture contract?

693
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,399
Not really.

694
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,439
I have been retracing my father's steps

695
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,439
before he passed away.

696
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,479
I found out that my father

697
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,280
had located your indenture contract.

698
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,639
He was a careful person.

699
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,320
When he submitted the memorandum,

700
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:17,800
he must have attached the indenture too.

701
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,600
If you didn't see
your indenture contract,

702
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,639
it means someone took it away.

703
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,479
In that case,

704
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,959
why did the person
take away my indenture contract

705
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,280
but keep the memorandum?

706
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,520
Keeping the memorandum

707
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,159
for you to chance upon it.

708
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,399
If you read the memorandum,

709
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,000
you will kill my father.

710
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,040
As such,

711
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
he didn't have
to do the dirty deed himself

712
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:47,120
and he can blackmail you
with your indenture contract.

713
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,840
But all these years,

714
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,120
no one has used it to blackmail me.

715
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,159
He's been laying low for many years

716
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,280
so he definitely
is planning something grand.

717
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,000
But at the moment, we do not know

718
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
what his aim is.

719
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,360
Liang Yi.

720
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,520
Back then, the person

721
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,280
kept this piece of evidence for himself.

722
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,000
And now, Northern Liangs are sent

723
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,159
to hunt you down so that
you'll stop investigating.

724
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,600
Perhaps both parties
are working together?

725
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,479
There is a snitch in the palace.

726
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,919
If those Northern Liangs

727
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,639
wanted to blackmail me with this,

728
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,199
they wouldn't have to wait until now.

729
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Unless

730
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,840
it's the Crown Prince they are after?

731
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:40,080
Liang Yi.

732
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,199
I implore you.

733
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,679
Find the truth for the Crown Prince

734
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,439
and get rid of this snitch.

735
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,000
I know

736
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,760
you are framed for sedition.

737
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,639
You can hardly take care of yourself.

738
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:11,520
But this is an emergency.

739
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:13,320
The Crown Prince cannot act either.

740
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,959
If he did,

741
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,159
he would be eliminating dissidents

742
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,199
who knows his real identity.

743
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,679
And if he failed,

744
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,560
the truth of his bloodline

745
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,560
would be revealed.

746
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,959
We would be deceiving the Emperor.

747
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,560
Why should I help
the murderer of my father?

748
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:37,840
You've seen what the Crown Prince

749
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,120
did so far.

750
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,199
You grew up under my watch.

751
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,919
I know you're not someone
who prioritizes

752
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,919
selfish pursuits
over the bigger picture.

753
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,159
I am not doing this

754
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,040
for my son only.

755
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,040
It's also for Dashuo.

756
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,760
I know

757
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,199
the hatred you feel.

758
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,280
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

759
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,479
You cannot bring back life.

760
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:17,639
How can you give me

761
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,080
a satisfactory answer, Your Highness?

762
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,439
When you see
to the bottom of everything,

763
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,320
I will

764
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:37,280
kill myself.
