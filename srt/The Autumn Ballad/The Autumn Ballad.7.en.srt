=Episode 7=

18
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,000
The South Opera

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,080
is different
from the North Opera indeed.

20
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,360
That's right.

21
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,160
It's great in terms of
its singing, lyrics and melody.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,919
I've never seen the whole script.

23
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,440
Why would they end up like this?

24
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,120
The story of "Autumn River"

25
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,360
is about the love between
a Taoist nun, Miaochang

26
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:10,039
and the nephew
of a Taoist temple owner, Scholar Pan.

27
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,039
But their love
has violated feudal ethical code.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,000
Therefore, Pan's family sent him
to the Capital to take the examination.

29
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,080
In the end,

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,759
Scholar Pan scored the highest
in the imperial examination

31
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,679
and went home to marry Miaochang.

32
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,639
This scene

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,759
depicts the moment
when they had to separate.

34
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,839
They exchange belongings by the river

35
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,759
and promise each other.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,759
They are willing
to commit against the world

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,839
to pursue their love.

38
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,720
I admire their courage.

39
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,520
There's not much to it, really.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,279
It seems like a touching love story.

41
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,240
In fact, it's just about a guy
who succeeded in the examination

42
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,240
and a woman being granted a title.

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,039
True love and all.

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,679
It all goes back to wealth and vanity.

45
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,119
These operas

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,080
are just stories
made up by mediocre scholars

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,399
to satisfy women's fantasy.

48
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,559
Madam Jin is also a woman.

49
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you implying something?

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,839
My son has never been a fan of opera.

51
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,199
Yi'er.

52
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm sorry that you have to
watch this with me

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,720
while you are so busy.

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,119
Mother, that's not what I meant.

55
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,600
We are talking here.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Who are you to interrupt?

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,759
The napkin is dirty.

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,199
Wash it clean.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,080
Yes.

60
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,679
How do you like it, Lord Liang?

61
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,559
It's fine.

62
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Good show.

63
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Yi'er.

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
I shall take my leave now.

65
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,079
Mother.

66
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,519
Take care, Madam Jin.

67
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,600
Please send my regards to your parents.

68
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,720
I'll see you again, Mother.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
Liang, you must have had fun
making fun of us.

70
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,760
I would like to serve you again
in the future, Lord Liang.

71
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,480
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

72
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:38,515
(Heming Building)

73
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,695
(Heming Building)

74
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
No wonder he seems to be in pain.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
I can't believe you thought of that.

76
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
You knew he had a wound on his hand,

77
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,720
so you soaked the napkin in liquor.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,640
He ruined the mood.

79
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Let me ask you.

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
Which part do you like the most

81
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,040
in today's show?

82
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
"Tears flow from my eyes
when I see the Autumn River,

83
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,160
I can't bear to look at
the lonely canopy".

84
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,880
It's heartbreaking.

85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,359
I like it the most

86
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,640
when Miaochang told Scholar Pan
by the river,

87
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,119
"Not seeing you and longing for you.

88
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
I do not bear grief for being apart.

89
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,760
Only woes that you might have
a change of heart.

90
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,440
Going after another damsel

91
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,880
and casting the past aside."

92
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,440
When two people are separated,

93
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,640
it needs the perseverance
to keep the relationship going.

94
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,920
Right?

95
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,839
Qin Xuan.

96
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Do you not have anything to tell me?

97
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,359
Qiu Yan.

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
We might not see each other again

99
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,040
after I left.

100
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,839
You see...

101
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,720
Are you okay?

102
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,239
I'm okay.

103
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,440
You are being targeted.
Take the longer route.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Someone is waiting in front.

105
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,840
Why did they go that way?

106
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,119
How dare you stop the palanquin
of Duke Ying Residence?

107
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,599
Forgive us. We are looking for our lady.

108
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,080
Who are you?

109
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:38,960
- Stop!
- Hurry up.

110
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,039
Hang in there.
Suoyi Alley is just upfront.

111
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,559
Okay.

112
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,679
Qiu Yan, are you okay?

113
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I sprained my ankle.

114
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,320
Let me help you up.

115
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,359
Stop! Over there.

116
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,039
What's going on?

117
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,200
Meeting an outsider in private.

118
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,440
You sure bring honor to your family.

119
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,799
With all due respect,
you have misunderstood.

120
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,960
Qiu Yan and I

121
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
just went to the theater today.

122
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,479
We didn't do anything disgraceful.

123
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,119
Who do you think you are?

124
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,919
I'm lecturing our young lady.

125
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,359
You are in no place to give excuses.

126
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,840
A man and a woman
meeting outside in private.

127
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,760
You must be up for something.

128
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,520
All of you!

129
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,479
Tie her up!

130
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,440
Stop!

131
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,479
I am the Prince of Duke Ying Residence.
How dare you?

132
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,000
You fool!

133
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,120
His Duke Ying's son.

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,039
What do you think you're doing?

135
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
What's going on?

136
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,760
Kneel!

137
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,719
I came to stop Qiu Yan

138
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,119
when I found out that
she was meeting someone in secret.

139
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,200
I didn't know it was
the Prince of Duke Ying Residence.

140
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,320
Sister, Brother-in-law.

141
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,039
Sorry that we failed
to educate her properly.

142
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,239
How dare you pull such an indecent act?

143
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,320
Are you...

144
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,119
Are you trying to drive me mad?

145
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,960
Xuan'er, tell us.

146
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,679
What is all of this about?

147
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,239
Allow me to explain.

148
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,280
Xuan'er has always been good.

149
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,679
It's our Qiu Yan

150
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,799
who has always been wild.

151
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,679
Obviously, it's Qiu Yan

152
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,960
who tried to seduce Young Master Qin.

153
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,719
The Prince of Duke Ying Residence

154
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:09,960
is not someone
you could simply approach.

155
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,239
It's not like what you think.

156
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:11,799
Xuan'er.

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,719
You are kind, caring, and good-natured.

158
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,039
But don't get deceived by people.

159
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,359
Tell me.

160
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,400
Did she try to seduce you today?

161
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,039
Am I right?

162
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,320
What are we waiting for?

163
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
- Why are you still defending him?
- Wait...

164
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,960
My lord.

165
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,039
My lord.

166
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,200
Qin Xuan, are you okay?

167
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,599
Qin Xuan.

168
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,239
You shouldn't hit him.

169
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,400
I...

170
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Father.

171
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,440
It was me who asked Qiu Yan out today.

172
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,000
I deceived her.

173
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,640
Xuan'er, why are you doing this to us?

174
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,280
Enough!

175
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,039
Listen here.

176
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,799
I don't care how this started.

177
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,479
Clear things up with her

178
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,960
right this second.

179
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,159
You're not allowed to see each other

180
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,400
from now on!

181
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,080
Xuan'er.

182
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,200
Father.

183
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,919
Qiu Yan is the one I love.

184
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,119
She's the only one in my heart.

185
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
I will marry her.

186
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,239
What?

187
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,239
You...

188
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:13,640
My lord.

189
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,440
You...

190
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,799
My lord...

191
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,880
Do you understand what you just said?

192
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,400
My lord.

193
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,239
I do.

194
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,960
Qiu Yan.

195
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,400
I was going to serve the Imperial Guards

196
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
and propose to you after I succeeded.

197
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,919
I didn't tell you

198
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,039
because I didn't want to
give you any false hope.

199
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,559
Now that this has happened,

200
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,039
Qiu Yan.

201
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,640
You're the only one I want to marry.

202
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,880
Listen here!

203
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,280
My lord.

204
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,159
Get this ungrateful son

205
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,679
- My lord!
- back to our mansion!

206
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,719
Hurry and break them apart!

207
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,440
Xuan.

208
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,000
Quick!

209
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,760
Wait for me!

210
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,119
Wait for me!

211
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,000
- Don't be mad.
- Look at them.

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,719
My lord...

213
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,440
Why did she have to
sprain her ankle at the moment?

214
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,640
It could have happened
at any other time.

215
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,039
But it had to be at that time.

216
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,400
Our effort just went to waste.

217
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,400
No, it didn't.

218
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
She's more capable than you thought.

219
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,119
You're not saying anything.

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
It's like we have misunderstood you.

221
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,719
I didn't say anything

222
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,320
because I knew I was selfish
to leave the mansion alone.

223
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
It goes against our house rules.

224
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,000
Secondly,

225
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,919
I chose to go with Qin Xuan.

226
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
It's wrong of me

227
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,320
to go out with him.
But I don't regret it.

228
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,679
I don't think I did anything wrong.

229
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,000
You may punish me all you want.

230
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,719
You think I wouldn't dare?

231
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,119
I...

232
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,919
You are a lady.

233
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,320
Your engagement is broken off.

234
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,320
You even...

235
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,719
You even went on a date
with Qin Xuan secretly.

236
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,679
Do you think

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
we will let you marry him
just like that?

238
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:08,919
Stop dreaming!

239
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,080
Madam Qin is in Old Madam's room now.

240
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,559
She made it very clear.

241
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,159
She won't let you
marry into their family.

242
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,400
Qin Xuan said he would marry me.

243
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,400
I believe in him.

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,840
So you just believe in what he said?

245
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,359
Since ancient times, marriage

246
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
has been decided by the parents
and arranged by the matchmaker.

247
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,119
He doesn't have any say in this.

248
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,719
I can marry whoever I want
after the first marriage.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,919
I listened to you

250
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,799
and agreed to marry He Family.

251
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,760
But how did it end up?

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,359
Yan'er.

253
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,440
What happened about He Family,

254
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,119
it's my fault.

255
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,640
But

256
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
you can't degrade yourself

257
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,479
just because of that.

258
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,359
I don't get it.

259
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,919
A man is ambitious

260
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,080
when he has plans for his future.

261
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
What is so disgraceful
when I plan for my own future?

262
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,080
What nonsense! You are messing around.

263
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,559
Kneel in front of our ancestors

264
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,760
and reflect on your mistakes!

265
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,359
Madam Qin, don't worry.

266
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,400
Even if you hadn't visited,

267
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,559
we would not allow

268
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,159
such an act in our family.

269
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,679
I will be counting on you then.

270
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,640
Old Madam Qiu,
don't bother to see me out.

271
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:58,733
(Hall of Nostalgia)

272
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,239
Qian.

273
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Yes.

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,960
That relative that you mentioned before,

275
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,119
are they still looking for another lady?

276
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,960
But now that this has happened,

277
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm afraid they will cut down
the amount of dowry.

278
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,599
Money is not the main concern now.

279
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,479
It's for the best if we can chase away

280
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,000
that unlucky girl.

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Send her away

282
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,440
in a few days.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,520
Old Madam, we will excuse ourselves.

284
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,320
Hold on.

285
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,640
Qian and Mi, you two may head back.

286
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,500
(Hall of Nostalgia)

287
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,080
Kneel, both of you.

288
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,799
What you did earlier on

289
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,559
was simply venting
out for personal reasons.

290
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,359
You didn't even care to consider
the dignity of our family!

291
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,439
Old Madam.

292
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,560
We were too worried for our family

293
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
that we acted without thinking...

294
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Enough!

295
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,800
You won't fool me with these words.

296
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,439
Qiu Yan is our family's young lady.

297
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,599
You don't lecture her in public.

298
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,800
It is her fault to meet a man in secret.

299
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,959
But you have embarrassed our family
and that made it worse!

300
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Madam Xu, pass on my words.

301
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,560
First Madam and Madam Kou's pay
for the next six months will be forfeited.

302
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
If this happens again,
I won't let them off easily.

303
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:33,839
Yes.

304
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,908
(Hall of Nostalgia)

305
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,683
(Qiu Residence)

306
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,160
Qiu Yan.

307
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,040
It's you.

308
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,439
You scared me.

309
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:53,199
Qiu Yan.

310
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:55,880
Does it hurt?

311
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,280
No, it got numb.

312
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,880
Father doesn't allow visitors.

313
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,839
You should go now.

314
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,719
Or you will get implicated.

315
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,599
Hurry up and go.

316
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,520
Go.

317
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:15,319
Qiu Yan.

318
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,359
I told your whereabout to Madam Kou.

319
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,479
What?

320
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,880
Why?

321
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,319
It's...

322
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,560
It's wrong of you

323
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,439
to meet a man in secret.

324
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,040
This is not right.

325
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,520
If that's your intention,

326
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,800
you should have told Old Madam.

327
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
Since when does Madam Kou

328
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,119
have the right to interfere with
the affairs of the Second Chamber?

329
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,400
It's because you know that

330
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
if you tell Old Madam,

331
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,599
she will just give me a lecture

332
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
and ground me for half a month.

333
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,959
If you tell Madam Kou,

334
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,239
she will take this chance to set me up.

335
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:10,800
Qiu Min.

336
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,119
I know you hate me.

337
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,400
I always thought

338
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,439
we could at least get along peacefully.

339
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,319
Do you hate me this much?

340
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,839
You like Qin Xuan, don't you?

341
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,239
I...

342
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,119
When?

343
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,439
That day

344
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,800
when Noble Consort
bestows us with the plaque.

345
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,880
Congratulations

346
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,959
on receiving a plaque
by Noble Consort.

347
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,959
Thank you.

348
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,719
Do you remember Xuan'er?

349
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,000
Xuan'er.

350
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,959
Greet Second Madam.

351
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,079
Greetings, Second Madam.

352
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,199
Xuan'er has gotten so tall now.

353
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,959
Madam Qin, you are very lucky.

354
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,359
This is Qiu Min.

355
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,439
They met before. Do you remember?

356
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,719
Min'er, offer your greetings
to Madam Qin.

357
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,920
Madam Qin.

358
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,880
Greetings, Qin Xuan.

359
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,479
Greetings too, Qiu Min.

360
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,760
You hid it so well.

361
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,880
I didn't know at all.

362
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,800
You were all fixated on
winning his heart.

363
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,439
How would you notice my feelings?

364
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,760
You could tell me.

365
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,119
So what if I did?

366
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,479
Will you let me have him?

367
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,520
No.

368
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,839
But at least we can compete fairly.

369
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,880
Compete fairly?

370
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,800
How am I supposed to win?

371
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,239
I'm not as clever and quick-witted

372
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:41,560
as you.

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,839
Even Mother likes you more.

374
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,359
You are afraid of losing,

375
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,920
so you didn't even think of trying?

376
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,000
You could only hide behind

377
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,319
and play these dirty tricks.

378
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:52,000
And now you are acting all miserable

379
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,079
as if you're the victim.

380
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,359
I know I did wrong.

381
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,880
You could scold me all you want.

382
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,239
Just because you apologized,

383
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,199
I'm supposed to forgive you?

384
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,479
What do you want then?

385
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,880
Are you going to tell Mother?

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,959
If it isn't for her,

387
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,239
I won't forgive you

388
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,319
if you do this again.

389
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,359
What do we do with Liang Yi now?

390
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,119
If you like Qin Xuan,

391
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,800
you should say it soon.

392
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,119
Lord Liang is being highly regarded
by the emperor.

393
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,599
We can't afford to offend them.

394
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:30,959
I...

395
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,800
I can't make things difficult for them.

396
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,719
You're the one being weak.

397
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,839
You are too scared
to admit your feelings

398
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,239
- or reject when you don't like him.
- Enough!

399
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,880
Why are you always so harsh to me?

400
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,839
I can't stand it

401
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,040
when you act miserable!

402
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,479
Qiu Yan, I know

403
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,640
you look down on me.

404
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,760
But we all have our own paths.

405
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,000
Just leave me alone!

406
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:56,800
How I wish that

407
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm the one kneeling here,
fighting for my love.

408
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,920
But I just can't do it.

409
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,400
Sir.

410
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,160
Our men said that

411
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,280
the same kind of fake silver notes

412
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,160
was found in every bank in the Capital.

413
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,680
In terms of its paper, seal,

414
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,439
motif and secret code,

415
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
it looks exactly the same
as the genuine ones.

416
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,479
We could only tell

417
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,400
when there's the same one in a bank.

418
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,199
How many are found?

419
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,280
Did you do a calculation?

420
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,479
Based on a conservative estimate,

421
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,239
there are more than two million.

422
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Two million?

423
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,199
If there's a run

424
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,319
on all the banks in the Capital,

425
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,119
they won't last even a day.

426
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,079
Yes, if the banks collapsed,

427
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,719
the people will panic.

428
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,800
All prices will go up uncontrollably.

429
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,520
We have a huge task
for the Firewood Office.

430
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,280
Sir, one more thing.

431
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,040
A report from
the Ministry of Revenue stated that

432
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,640
there are also fake silver notes

433
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,520
submitted by the clan association.

434
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,760
(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)
It's Qiu Family.

435
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,640
Qiu Yan.

436
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,599
Qiu Yan.

437
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,000
Here's the thing you want.

438
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,680
Madam Dong.

439
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,400
Thank you, Madam Dong.

440
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,160
Before she left, Second Madam told me

441
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,680
to listen to your instructions.

442
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,560
Is the letter delivered?

443
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,239
I went to Duke Ying Residence
to enquire.

444
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:08,199
Apparently, Young Master Qin
is being grounded.

445
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,680
He couldn't even see Beixue.

446
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,239
Is Qin Xuan okay?

447
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,599
I don't know.

448
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,520
When I went there...

449
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,800
Are we really going in?

450
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:16,800
What's there to be scared of?

451
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,359
Well,

452
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,479
what if she gets all hysterical

453
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,439
and starts hitting us?

454
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,920
She wouldn't dare to do that

455
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,319
in front of our ancestors.

456
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,359
Don't go if you are scared.

457
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,160
Are you going or not?

458
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:30,680
I...

459
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:31,719
I'll go.

460
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,040
I've waited for so long.

461
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,920
This is the day we get back at her.

462
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,000
Qiu...

463
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,560
Qiu Mei, look.

464
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,479
She is being disrespectful!

465
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,719
I'll go and call for someone.

466
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:45,599
Hold on.

467
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,280
By the time they were here,

468
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,920
she would have got back up.

469
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,319
Then she would say we are accusing her.

470
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,800
Get down from there!

471
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,160
We can't act recklessly
in front of our ancestral tablets.

472
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,640
She's lying there

473
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,920
so that we can't go near her.

474
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,719
Qiu Yan, I know you are listening.

475
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,719
No matter how you try to outsmart us,

476
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,199
there's no way
to change your situation now.

477
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,199
Old Madam has spoken.

478
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,439
You will be sold
to Aunt Qian's relatives

479
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,319
as a lowly concubine.

480
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,920
That will be three days later.

481
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,000
Concubine?

482
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,400
She would be a courtesan.

483
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,599
They are a family of merchants.

484
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,439
I heard that their concubines

485
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,160
have to please the government officers

486
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,680
by singing and playing instruments.

487
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,479
They will be sent away
after they are done.

488
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,640
Qiu Yan, you have a bright future ahead.

489
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Qiu Mei, let's just go for now.

490
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's go.

491
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,128
(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)

492
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:19,214
(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)

493
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,800
If the fake silver notes are submitted,

494
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,119
our family will be doomed.

495
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,239
Lord Liang.

496
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,319
You saved our lives.

497
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,839
I am most grateful.

498
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,359
Lord Qiu, you have served for many years
and are known for your integrity.

499
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
I have always admired that.

500
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't wish to see

501
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,239
an honest man being set up.

502
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,880
That's why I'm here to inform you.

503
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,560
If you say so,

504
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,760
I'll be honest then.

505
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,880
Lord Liang came all the way

506
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,479
to save us from such a crisis.

507
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,880
How could we repay

508
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,079
your great kindness?

509
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you see me as someone

510
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,439
who only acts in my own interest?

511
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,040
I wouldn't dare.

512
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,959
You are right about me, Lord Qiu.

513
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,719
But I'm afraid

514
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,800
you'll have to be grateful to me.

515
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,800
As for my intention,

516
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,800
you will find out soon enough.

517
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,400
Second Young Lady.

518
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,359
Master has given his order.

519
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,959
Nobody can leave from the side door.

520
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,959
We have to tighten the security.

521
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,560
Yes, sir.

522
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,920
Watch over the side entrance.

523
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,880
Nobody can pass.

524
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Yes.

525
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,880
What are you doing here?

526
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,599
I should be asking you.

527
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,680
Old Madam wants to sell me off.

528
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,400
I'll have to go in three days.

529
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,800
I have to get out from here.

530
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,959
I see.

531
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:43,800
I will leave you alone then.

532
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,680
Lord Liang...

533
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,359
Lord Liang...

534
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,439
I wouldn't be able to leave by myself.

535
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,439
Can you bring me out?

536
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm begging you.

537
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,959
You brought this to yourself.

538
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,640
This is what you asked for.

539
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,119
Why are you begging me?

540
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,119
What do you mean?

541
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,800
What do I mean?

542
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,400
You fell on purpose, didn't you?

543
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,079
I didn't say it

544
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,959
because Qin Xuan has been
smitten by you.

545
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,520
He wouldn't believe what I said.

546
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,680
Don't assume that

547
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,640
nobody knows your little tricks.

548
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,680
(You took the risk
and asked Qin Xuan out.)

549
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,880
(because you wanted an answer from him.)

550
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,680
(But I ruined your plan.)

551
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,800
(When your family came to stop you,
you went along)

552
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
(and fell on purpose.)

553
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,640
(Qin Xuan had no choice
but to take an oath publicly.)

554
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,839
Am I right?

555
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,640
Yes.

556
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,359
You're clever.

557
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,199
You should have seen this coming.

558
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,199
Of course.

559
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,400
But I have no choice now.

560
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,040
With my background,

561
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,680
Duke Ying's Family wouldn't agree
to marry me.

562
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,599
And Qin Xuan seemed to be
hesitating before this.

563
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,400
The rest of my family

564
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,680
is putting pressure on me
while my legitimate mother is gone.

565
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,920
Instead of waiting and doing nothing,

566
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,199
I should just take the initiative.

567
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,839
Qin Xuan took an oath in public,

568
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,760
of course his parents would be mad.

569
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,839
But now they know

570
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,599
how important I am to Qin Xuan.

571
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
As long as Qin Xuan acknowledges me,

572
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,160
the better the odds are for me

573
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,599
as time goes by.

574
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:15,680
Lord Liang.

575
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:20,599
There has been bad blood between us.

576
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,599
But you are like brothers with Qin Xuan.

577
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,160
Please don't take it to heart

578
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
for his sake.

579
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,160
Help me out just this once.

580
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,400
My lord, you are someone forgiving.

581
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,359
Don't mind the past

582
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,959
and help me out.

583
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:36,959
I know

584
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,760
you are actually soft-hearted,

585
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,760
kind and loyal.

586
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,920
Enough...

587
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,040
Lead the way.

588
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,280
Thank you, My lord.

589
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,959
You speak elaborately
when it involves your interest.

590
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,439
I can't let someone like you

591
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,839
be with Qin Xuan.

592
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:34,959
Liang Yi...

593
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Watch her closely.

594
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,400
Without my order,

595
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,359
no one can let her out.

596
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,040
Yes!

597
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,920
Open the door!

598
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Let me out!

599
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,760
Open the door!

600
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,680
Open the door!

601
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,400
Open it!

602
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,280
Qiu Yan, I suggest saving your energy.

603
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,199
The family is all worried about

604
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,959
the fake silver notes.

605
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,760
They couldn't be bothered with you.

606
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,680
Fake silver notes?

607
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,160
What do you mean?

608
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,599
What did I do wrong?

609
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,040
Why would there be fake notes
in the family fund?

610
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:19,920
Old Madam.

611
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,199
You trusted me to manage the household.

612
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,199
I had no excuse

613
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,520
for such a grave mistake.

614
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,839
I will take the punishment.

615
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,400
Look, now is not the time for this.

616
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,800
The donation will end in a few days.

617
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,640
What's paramount

618
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,560
is to find money

619
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
for the deficit of 3,000 taels

620
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,439
after discarding the fake notes.

621
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,199
Enough. Get up.

622
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,439
Kneeling doesn't help with anything.

623
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,199
But where do we find

624
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,880
3,000 taels in such
a short amount of time?

625
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,959
My wife and I have some savings.

626
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,439
There are about 500 to 600 taels.

627
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:58,760
Maybe I could borrow some

628
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,439
from Qiu Ning and Qiu Hong

629
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,359
to at least go through this crisis.

630
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,040
Qiu Ning and Qiu Hong

631
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,439
still owe money from the family fund.

632
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,439
One of them is a scholar
in the Imperial College.

633
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
He uses the family fund for everything.

634
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
Another is a drunkard and a gambler.

635
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,679
He is still supporting his son
to travel and learn.

636
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,879
Even if they are willing to,

637
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,879
it won't be much.

638
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,000
The other clan members and officials

639
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,080
are all donating.

640
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,199
They don't have any extra money left.

641
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,760
We could only sell our land.

642
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,320
Mother.

643
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,479
The land is passed down by generations.

644
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,040
We must not sell it.

645
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,360
I will bear the sin.

646
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:49,159
Just exclude me from the ancestral tomb.

647
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,120
Mother!

648
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,679
We can't do that, Mother.

649
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,760
What else can we do?

650
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,040
Old Madam!

651
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,719
Bad news, Old Madam.

652
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,399
The Second Young Lady
is refusing to eat.

653
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,520
She said she'd rather die
than get married.

654
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,120
I will check on her.

655
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,719
Stop.

656
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
I will go.

657
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,199
There's nobody

658
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,679
I could rely on in this family.

659
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:19,840
Second Young Lady.

660
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,760
Old Madam is here to see you.

661
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,120
I heard that
you are trying to end your life.

662
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,679
Yes, even if you got their money,

663
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,560
they will only receive
a corpse in return.

664
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,560
When that happens,

665
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,520
they will ask for compensation.

666
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,840
All right. I will grant your wish.

667
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,199
Madam Qin would be happy
to hear this if you died.

668
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,000
I never thought that

669
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,919
Qiu Family who comes from
generations of scholars,

670
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,479
would be this spineless.

671
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,280
That we have to obey the Qins.

672
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,879
I will cherish

673
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,239
those who are useful to Qiu Family.

674
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,800
But I can't offend Duke Ying

675
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,520
just for your sake.

676
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:05,159
Yan, don't blame me for being heartless.

677
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,399
We are in big trouble now.

678
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,040
I can't take care of you.

679
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,239
Are you worrying about

680
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,919
the fake silver notes?

681
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:24,560
You are vigilant.

682
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,919
So what if it's true?

683
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,520
You can't find enough money
for the deficit of 3,000 taels.

684
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,199
You might have to sell
the ancestral land

685
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,520
and be accused of being prodigal.

686
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,360
Maybe I can help you with that.

687
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:42,919
You...

688
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,600
The fake notes

689
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,479
don't appear in the family fund
for no reason.

690
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,600
If we find the culprit,

691
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,159
we will have the 3,000 taels.

692
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,719
It's easy for you to say.

693
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,760
The donation period is ending soon.

694
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,439
We don't have the time
for investigation.

695
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,719
Three days are enough

696
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,919
to find out the truth.

697
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,399
If I fail after three days,

698
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,320
you may sell me away.

699
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,239
I won't cause a scene.

700
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,080
I will be good

701
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,919
and let our family have
the betrothal gift.

702
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,239
But I have a condition.

703
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,439
If I get the money back,

704
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,239
I will decide my marriage

705
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,520
from now on.

706
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,520
No one can interfere.

707
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:28,800
All right.

708
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:49,840
Qingdai.

709
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,520
The Second Chamber
is being condescending!

710
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,479
Who are you

711
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,760
to search the Third Chamber?

712
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,639
The entire household will be searched.

713
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,520
Nobody is an exception.

714
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,679
I didn't know it was you, Madam Xu.

715
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,679
Search the Fourth Chamber too.

716
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:06,679
Yes.

717
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,959
Bad news.

718
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,040
Madam Xu and Qingdai

719
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,600
are searching the Third Chamber.

720
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,520
Qiu Yi, what does this mean?

721
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,439
You have Madam Xu

722
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:24,280
to search our household

723
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,120
when all of us are eating?

724
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,520
Are you suspecting us?

725
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,000
What's going on?

726
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,479
Why are they conducting a search?

727
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,760
With all due respect,

728
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,199
First Madam and I went through
the family fund earlier on.

729
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,560
The First, Third and Forth Chamber

730
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,199
once borrowed money from the family fund

731
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,520
and returned it.

732
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,840
Now that there are fake silver notes
found in the family fund.

733
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,000
We had to do this

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,280
so that there wasn't any accusation.

735
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,120
What did you find?

736
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
We found an exact silver note

737
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,520
in the mansion.

738
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,159
Where did you find it?

739
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,360
Qiu Rong's room.

740
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:24,959
Kneel!

741
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:30,840
What did you do?

742
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,239
Explain yourself!

743
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,479
I just wanted to get some
Western candied fruit from the kitchen

744
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,600
for He Xiang.

745
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,239
I didn't know
there was a note in the jar.

746
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,520
Get something?

747
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,159
You obviously stole it.

748
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,120
My lord.

749
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,760
He was just being gluttonous

750
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:49,879
and made a mistake.

751
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:53,239
To everyone here,

752
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,159
Rong'er is still young.

753
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,479
Please forgive him.

754
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:59,000
(Hong)
If he is bold enough to steal,

755
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,520
switching the fake notes

756
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,479
should not be a problem too.

757
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,320
I really didn't know

758
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,919
there was a silver note in the jar.

759
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,719
If I knew,

760
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I would have spent it long ago.

761
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,639
Quiet!

762
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:10,959
How dare you talk back?

763
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,439
Qiu Yi.

764
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:14,000
We need evidence to catch the culprit.

765
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,320
Now that we have the evidence.

766
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,719
What is there to say?

767
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,080
W... What do you mean?

768
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,080
I thought the Second Chamber
was always honorable

769
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,479
so they never borrowed money
from the family fund.

770
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,879
I never thought

771
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,399
Qiu Rong would be
the black sheep of the family.

772
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,399
We shouldn't put it that way.

773
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,280
But for us,
Rong'er was just being mischievous.

774
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,639
For outsiders,

775
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,760
they might think the Second Chamber

776
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,120
was trying to cheat money
out of the family fund.

777
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,479
Qian.

778
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,800
If I'm that kind of person,

779
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,159
there will be no place
for me in this world.

780
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:48,520
Well then, please punish him accordingly

781
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,560
to our house rules.

782
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,120
Or it would be unfair.

783
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,800
Conduct the punishment.

784
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,479
Father.

785
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:03,919
My lord.

786
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,399
Father.

787
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,800
Rong'er is still young.

788
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,320
Leave out the beating.

789
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,479
That's right.

790
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,959
First Madam could tolerate this

791
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,679
but I can't.

792
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,280
Qiu Yi, you have to
give us an explanation.

793
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:23,760
Fine.

794
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,000
I will go and get Old Madam.

795
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,719
That's right.

796
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,919
We could have just sold the land.

797
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,280
The Second Chamber
has to mess things up.

798
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,280
Let's see what Old Madam has to say.

799
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:36,159
Hold up.

800
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,080
Old Madam just went to rest.

801
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,040
Let's not bother her

802
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,239
with something so trivial.

803
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,439
All of you are right.

804
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,320
He should be punished for his mistakes.

805
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,239
Qiu Rong, let me ask you.

806
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,840
Did you swap the notes with fake ones?

807
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:54,800
No.

808
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,040
Qiu Yan.

809
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
Don't you act all high and mighty now.

810
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,000
You want to get back at me, don't you?

811
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Listen here.

812
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:05,679
Even Father doesn't hit me.

813
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,840
What are you doing?

814
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,399
He's your biological brother!

815
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,479
The house rules are unbiased!

816
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,919
Madam, if you wish to get beaten,

817
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:14,879
go on and defend him.

818
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,080
What are you doing?

819
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,280
My lord!

820
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,719
Enough.

821
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,800
Enough.

822
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:24,840
My lord!

823
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,040
Make her stop!

824
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,159
My lord!

825
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:32,800
My lord!
