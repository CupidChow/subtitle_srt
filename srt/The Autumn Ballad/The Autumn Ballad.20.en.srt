=Episode 20=

18
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,720
Miss Ying,

19
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,239
why do you insist on
entertaining the guests?

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,120
Everyone aims to make life better.

21
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,040
Qiu Yan disrespected Shi Xiaoxiao

22
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,279
and got on her bad side.

23
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,559
I would never be rude

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,879
to my guests.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,639
It's not hard to have a better life.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,880
Official Yuan,

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,600
are you giving me an offer?

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,559
I only need you to do me a small favor.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
You will be compensated accordingly.

30
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,440
Releasing you from servitude

31
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,080
is not very difficult for me.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,839
Really?

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
Tell me honestly,

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,279
did Liang Yi discuss
anything with Qiu Yan

35
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,360
when he was in her company
over the days?

36
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,600
Yes.

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,880
My sister said...

38
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,919
Qiu Yan said

39
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,440
Lord Liang promised

40
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,919
to get us out of the Royal Academy.

41
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:52,800
However,

42
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,199
his idea scared the spirit out of me.

43
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,119
I don't find it reliable.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,199
What is his plan?

45
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,880
According to Lord Liang,

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,039
half a month from now

47
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,600
he will order someone from
Marquis Yongming Residence

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,919
to hire Qiu Yan for a performance.

49
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,600
Qiu Yan will take us with her

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,199
and we'll leave in a carriage.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,960
There will be

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
men from the Firewood Office

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,440
disguised as refugees that intercept us.

54
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,759
He will tell the public
we ran into bandits

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,160
and are captured.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
And then,

57
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,720
Lord Liang told us

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,240
he would find us shelter afterward.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,000
Is everyone ready?

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,080
We're almost done.

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
After we leave,

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
everyone must follow my lead.

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,880
It's now or never.

64
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,160
Hurry up. I'll wait outside.

65
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:29,672
(As Loyal As A Subject)

66
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,839
Halt!

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,760
Bamboo raft replacing the dragon boat,

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,959
passengers on the carriage
wear vibrant clothes.

69
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,040
Too impoverished to afford any clothing,

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,079
empty stomachs deserve some pity!

71
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,679
How pity!

72
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,760
Who are you?

73
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,559
This is the Royal Academy's carriage!

74
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,519
- Spare us some money!
- Get lost!

75
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,399
Spare us some money.

76
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,920
Spare us some money!

77
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,640
Can you spare some money?

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,119
Stop right there.

79
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:59,658
(As Loyal As A Subject)

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
Officer!

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm only here for some money

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
so I can buy some food.

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Did I break any law?

84
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,320
Where did Liang Yi find these fools?

85
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,320
Qiu Yan, come out.

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Miss Xiaoxiao.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,279
Why are you here?

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,799
The beggars had me trapped.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
I was in danger.

90
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,679
Thank you for the rescue.

91
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,480
Where is Qiu Yan?

92
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,279
Did the Marquis Yongming Residence

93
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,480
not hire her for a performance?

94
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,640
Qiu Yan was never hired.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,399
The Marquis Yongming Residence

96
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,799
always hires Miss Shi.

97
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,720
We fell for

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,799
Liang Yi's decoy!

99
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,440
Back to the Royal Academy!

100
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,119
All of you, come with me!

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,000
Women of the Qiu family
live in this yard.

102
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,480
Qiu Yan?

103
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,519
Qiu Yan?

104
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,440
Where are you?

105
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,519
We never saw them leave the place.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,359
But...

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,119
Our family was raided
and the Old Madam is gone.

108
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,119
The Royal Academy is a place of perils.

109
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
We have no one to rely on

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,160
except for each other.

111
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,320
If we don't stop fighting

112
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,239
and complaining,

113
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,480
none of us here

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
will survive this hardship.

115
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,320
We must stand together against

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
the enemy.

117
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,359
That's our only chance to live.

118
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:47,799
Yan is right.

119
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,720
We've lost our home,

120
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,880
but we are always
wives of the Qiu family.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,239
You will always be
the daughters of the Qiu family.

122
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:57,000
We must unite and brave
through this trying time.

123
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,079
Indeed.

124
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,239
We can rebuild as long as we live.

125
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,799
As long as we are united,

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
no one

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,079
can defeat us.

128
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,640
We have five days

129
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,920
to dig through the wall.

130
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,200
Once we're outside,

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,519
someone will pick us up.

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,160
I checked.

133
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,559
In the entire Royal Academy,

134
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,839
only this courtyard

135
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,600
is one wall away from the outside

136
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,799
and away from people's eyes.

137
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,320
If we leave at night,

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,119
people probably won't notice.

139
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,640
I see.

140
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,359
You argued with Miss Shi on purpose

141
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,079
so she would

142
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,559
banish us to this courtyard.

143
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,880
We finally see a glimmer of hope.

144
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:49,640
Qiu Ying,

145
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,320
I need you to deal with Yuan Lang.

146
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,679
Let's go.

147
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:08,799
Official Jiang.

148
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,640
Sir Jin.

149
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,920
Are you in a hurry

150
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,000
to go somewhere?

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm escorting women
from Lord Liang's family.

152
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,920
Lord Liang's family?

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,959
I need to check.

154
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,600
No.

155
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,079
They are the Old Madam's family.

156
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,679
Let's not meddle with them.

157
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,920
The Main Administrative Office
is investigating a case.

158
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,679
Who are you to stop me?

159
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,839
I must!

160
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,079
Mrs. Zhao, Mrs. Li,
and Mrs. Wang are inside.

161
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,119
All the ladies are in here.

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,799
Move aside!

163
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:39,719
Move.

164
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,119
Move!

165
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:43,679
Just go.

166
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,440
See you, Official Jiang.

167
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,359
We're there, Miss Qiu.

168
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,440
Hurry up!

169
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,559
Help me down.

170
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,679
That stench

171
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,320
was suffocating!

172
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,719
Stop complaining.

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,280
Without Qiu Ying,

174
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,359
we wouldn't have

175
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,119
gotten out so easily.

176
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Qiu Yan, I only did the right thing.

177
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
I did my best to help our family.

178
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,440
Sir, I should be punished!

179
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,559
I ordered not to let
the Firewood Office's carriage leave.

180
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,840
Did you notice nothing except Song Jin

181
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,919
and the Firewood Office?

182
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,640
If anyone was on the carriage,

183
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,679
would he sit at the front?

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,039
That was foolish of me.

185
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,280
I misjudged the situation.

186
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,840
The Bian River is in the southwest.

187
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,359
They must have left on a boat.

188
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,239
Dispatch!

189
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,159
Search every boat on the river.

190
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,280
Search the entire river!

191
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,159
Get moving!

192
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes!

193
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,880
Come with me!

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
Everyone, get on the boat.

195
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,520
Hurry!

196
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:15,760
Hurry up.

197
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:17,864
Watch your steps.

198
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,760
Madam.

199
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,440
Hurry.

200
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,960
Come, Min'er.

201
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,039
Sit on the inside.

202
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,320
Be careful.

203
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,719
Steady.

204
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,200
Come on.

205
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
Sail the boat.

206
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,200
- Sit tight.
- Hurry up.

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,479
Sail the boat.

208
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,719
Sir,

209
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,280
the bargeman confessed everything.

210
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,119
The boat carrying women
from the Qiu family

211
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,400
ran into reefs.

212
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,760
The bargeman was the only survivor.

213
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,119
(Fengjing Prefecture)
According to his statement,

214
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,239
this was the only body

215
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,280
stuck inside the cabin.

216
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,080
The others must have been carried away
by the current

217
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,039
and impossible to retrieve.

218
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,719
(Qiu Yan.)

219
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,000
(I could do nothing to help you.)

220
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,440
(All I can do now)

221
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,719
(is to wait for you.)

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,039
(I believe)

223
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,400
(this trying time will be over.)

224
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:30,960
Beixue,

225
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,200
perfect timing.

226
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,479
Send this letter to the Royal Academy.

227
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,080
Beixue?

228
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,280
Sir...

229
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,880
The letter

230
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,599
is never going to reach Miss Qiu Yan.

231
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:52,080
(The righteous relinquish their charm)

232
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,719
What happened?

233
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,840
I was browsing on the street

234
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,400
when I overheard the conversations.

235
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,200
They said the wives and daughters
of the Qiu family

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,640
escaped the Royal Academy.

237
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
They became wanted fugitives.

238
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,840
But their boat sunk

239
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,159
in the suburb.

240
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,520
There was a body inside the boat.

241
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,760
The Fengjing Prefecture couldn't
identify the body.

242
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,880
Where is it now?

243
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,359
Official Tong, why do you think

244
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,640
that is Qiu Yan's body?

245
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,280
The body was submerged in water

246
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,599
and eaten by the fish.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,359
The face is unrecognizable.

248
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,799
But the clothing she was wearing

249
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,200
indeed belonged to Qiu Yan.

250
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,919
You draw this conclusion
based on her clothes?

251
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,239
That's a little unconvincing.

252
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:32,840
Besides,

253
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,359
there were around eight of them.

254
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,640
If the boat sunk,

255
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
where are the rest of them?

256
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,479
Official Yuan, you should know that

257
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,000
the bed of the Bian River
is moving quicksand.

258
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,760
Bodies of those who drowned in the river

259
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,479
were impossible to retrieve.

260
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,599
When the river overflows,

261
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,440
or when washed by the current over time,

262
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,799
bones will be pulled from the sand.

263
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,719
The fishermen of Bian River

264
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,359
find a lot of human remains every year.

265
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,119
Official Tong,

266
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,039
Young Master Qin is here

267
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,960
to retrieve the remain.

268
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,479
Young Master Qin.

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,359
Sir.

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,239
Young Master Qin, Young Master Qin!

271
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,919
Young Master Qin, calm down.

272
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,479
It's not your fault.

273
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,520
Even the veterans in our office

274
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,719
couldn't recognize it.

275
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,559
Young Master Qin was close with Qiu Yan.

276
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,080
Not even he could recognize the corpse.

277
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,960
I think

278
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,080
we can't close the case just yet.

279
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,200
Official Yuan,

280
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,880
if it's unrecognizable,

281
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,039
we can't be certain

282
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,960
the corpse isn't Qiu Yan.

283
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,080
The chance is 50-50.

284
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,479
It's best to just close the case now.

285
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you in a hurry to
get this over with

286
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,840
because you have special plans
for tonight?

287
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,320
But...

288
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,159
I made this hairpin myself.

289
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,000
There will be many people
at the Chuiwan Party,

290
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:11,320
I could lose or damage this hairpin.

291
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,960
I'd feel sorry if that happened.

292
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:21,679
Sir, are you alright?

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,640
Young Master Qin?

294
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,159
Sir...

295
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,640
This hairpin...

296
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,119
Sir.

297
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,400
Young Master Qin made this hairpin.

298
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,799
It was a gift for Qiu Yan.

299
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,080
She wore it all the time.

300
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,239
It never left her side.

301
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,200
- My condolences, Young Master Qin.
-Qiu Yan. Qiu Yan.

302
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,559
Come, get up. Young Master Qin.

303
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,760
- Sir!
- Young Master Qin.

304
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,880
- Sir!
- Sorry for your loss.

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
Let's leave, sir!

306
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,520
Qiu Yan!

307
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,960
Sir!

308
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,799
Young Master Qin!

309
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,454
(Fengjing Prefecture)

310
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,000
(Fengjing Prefecture)
Qiu Yan!

311
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,919
Qiu Yan!

312
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,599
Official Yuan,

313
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,000
we have the witness, evidence,
and the body.

314
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,559
Even by the rules
of the Main Administrative Office,

315
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,640
the case should be closed.

316
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,840
So be it, Official Tong.

317
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:13,722
(Fengjing Prefecture)

318
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,799
That body looks suspicious.

319
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,960
But if Qiu Yan is alive,

320
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,799
where could they be right now?

321
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,880
They are a large group

322
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,320
and a bunch of spoiled women.

323
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,679
To leave the Capital,

324
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,760
they must follow the main road.

325
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,719
But every exit to leave the city

326
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,400
has been stationed with guards
and patrols.

327
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,200
No one saw those women.

328
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,080
If I were them,

329
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,280
I would do the unexpected

330
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,359
and stay within the Capital.

331
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,919
I'd hide in a village outside the city.

332
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,479
Take our men and search every village.

333
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,239
Yes.

334
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,760
Officers.

335
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
Is anyone living in this house?

336
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,800
This is the Guangji Hall.

337
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,280
Only the mentally ill live here.

338
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,119
When they go amok,

339
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,800
they will attack anyone in their sight.

340
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,719
They are a pain in the neck.

341
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,239
Official Chai from the city

342
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,280
built this manor

343
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,560
to keep the mentally ill inside.

344
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,160
Sir!

345
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,319
Should we go in there?

346
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,119
Let's go.

347
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:37,959
Sir,

348
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,079
we've searched

349
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,000
every town and village within
the 20 li radius.

350
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,599
We haven't found the fugitives.

351
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,119
Did they really die in the river?

352
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
How are things on Liang Yi's side?

353
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,560
Our spy said

354
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,599
Liang Yi didn't seem troubled

355
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,719
and hadn't done anything.

356
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,680
However,

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,920
he was spotted burning joss papers
in the yard.

358
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Sir,

359
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,719
Young Master Qin wants to see you.

360
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,880
Ignore him.

361
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,400
Sir!

362
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,839
Liang Yi!

363
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,790
(Liang Residence)

364
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,680
Liang Yi, come out!

365
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,479
Sir!

366
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,959
We should leave!

367
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,839
Lord Liang is never coming out.

368
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,719
No.

369
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,880
Liang Yi is not heartless.

370
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,439
There must be a reason

371
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,479
for not seeing me.

372
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,400
So,

373
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,719
maybe all of this

374
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,079
is simply part of his plan.

375
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,280
Maybe Qiu Yan is still alive.

376
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,880
The officers are gone.

377
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,000
When we were locked up with the crazy,

378
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,599
they were all drooling.

379
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,880
I almost got their spit on me.

380
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,640
It was so disgusting.

381
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,319
Yeah, I was making dinner just now.

382
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,319
Those with hysteria

383
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,359
were like children.

384
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,359
Don't be bothered by their behavior.

385
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,839
I thought Lord Liang was capable.

386
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
First, the boat sunk.
Then, he faked our drowning.

387
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,000
After pulling off a switcheroo,

388
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,640
we ended up in this god-forsaken place.

389
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,400
In the end,

390
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
it's worse than the Royal Academy.

391
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,119
Madam Liu,

392
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,599
we are wanted fugitives
of the Imperial Court.

393
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,880
Thankfully, the person in charge

394
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
is Lord Liang's friend.

395
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,160
He took great risks by taking us in.

396
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Otherwise, we'd have no shelter.

397
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,959
Indeed.

398
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,160
You are

399
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,000
getting whinier every day.

400
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,800
Why would you go back
to the Royal Academy?

401
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,599
Do you know no shame at all?

402
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,280
First Sister-in-law,

403
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,119
look at those crazy people.

404
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,160
Are you saying

405
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,119
we'll live here for
the rest of our life?

406
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,479
You still have your life

407
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,280
and your honor.

408
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,359
Be grateful.

409
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160
Where is Min'er?

410
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,319
Who knows?

411
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I haven't seen her since morning.

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,520
She's been in bed the whole day.

413
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,520
Qiu Yan!

414
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,800
Qiu Min left you a letter.

415
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,119
A letter?

416
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:28,880
What does it say?

417
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,520
(Sister,)

418
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,640
(I am slow and incapable.)

419
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,400
(I've failed at all the work
Madam Liu gave me.)

420
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,760
(I am on my own now.)

421
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:39,920
(My future is bleak.)

422
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,319
(I'll only become
a liability to everyone.)

423
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,439
(After much thought,)

424
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,079
(I've decided to leave.)

425
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,040
(After I leave,)

426
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,359
(do not come looking for me.)

427
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,839
(Sister,)

428
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,239
(take it as I'm with
our late mother now.)

429
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:53,719
The tone

430
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,119
of this letter is concerning.

431
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,000
"With our late mother."

432
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,119
Is she going to take her own life?

433
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,520
She probably is.

434
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,880
She is going to end her life
at her mother's grave.

435
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:04,880
Don't be silly.

436
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,199
Her mother was burned to ashes

437
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,800
and buried in the wild.

438
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,479
She is but a little girl...

439
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,680
Did you scold her again?

440
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,160
No.

441
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,640
If you hadn't been so mean to her,

442
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,880
why would she write this letter?

443
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:17,760
I...

444
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,040
I've been wronged!

445
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,640
Be reasonable.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,760
I haven't seen her since this morning.

447
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,880
I didn't even talk to her,

448
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,119
how could I've scolded her?

449
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,040
I've been wronged worse than Dou E.
[*Dou E: A woman died because she've been wronged.]

450
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,479
Where is she now?

451
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,239
I saw her.

452
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,479
Before we

453
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:34,640
woke up this morning,

454
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,280
Qiu Min said she was going
to the backyard

455
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,640
to forage some fruits.

456
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,719
I thought she'd be safe
because there was no one,

457
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,119
so I let her go on her own.

458
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,160
Very well, I'll look for her.

459
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,920
No!

460
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,520
Remember,

461
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,079
Song Jin told us

462
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,359
never to step out of

463
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,160
the Guangji Hall

464
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,599
after he sent us here.

465
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,800
What if the soldiers found you?

466
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,359
She is right.

467
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:56,880
I saw it from the house.

468
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,599
Officers have been

469
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,479
patrolling the main road at the base
of the mountain.

470
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,040
If you run into them,

471
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,560
you will...

472
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,160
But Min'er is missing,

473
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,319
I must find her.

474
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,520
First Aunt and Madams, don't worry.

475
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,800
To the authority,

476
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm already a corpse.

477
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,160
Even if the officers caught me,

478
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,959
they could never tell I'd be Qiu Yan.

479
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,599
Don't worry.

480
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,000
But...

481
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,800
(Northern Gate)

482
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,995
(Northern Gate)

483
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:57,760
Pass.

484
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,439
Hold on.

485
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,359
Officer.

486
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,520
Hold on.

487
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,400
Officer.

488
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,719
It's the same as usual.

489
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,119
Go.

490
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:18,994
(Northern Gate)

491
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,877
(Northern Gate)

492
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,439
Qin Xuan.

493
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,560
Qiu Min!

494
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:03,959
Qiu Min!

495
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,119
You're alive.

496
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,319
I'm glad to see you.

497
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,920
But what happened to you?

498
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:08,839
Qin Xuan...

499
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,599
Sir.

500
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,439
Look at this.

501
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,800
(Bounties on Wanted Fugitives:
Qiu Min and Qiu Yan)

502
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Miss Min,

503
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
it's not safe here.

504
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,479
Let's talk somewhere else.

505
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,359
Come to my house.

506
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,319
No.

507
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,560
She is now a fugitive.

508
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,479
Bringing her back

509
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
will put her in danger.

510
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,000
You are right,

511
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
the inns and teahouses
are not safe either.

512
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,239
I know someone who can save us.

513
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,800
Beixue, go without me.

514
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:38,880
You know what to say

515
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,599
if anyone asks.

516
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,599
Sure.

517
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,239
Follow me.

518
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,000
Come on,

519
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,920
welcome inside.

520
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,719
Nothing would come here

521
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:49,880
except for the rats.

522
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
It needs some cleaning.

523
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:53,760
Yao Gai.

524
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,439
Thank you.

525
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,319
But...

526
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,800
What is this for?

527
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,520
When I needed help the most,

528
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880
you and Miss Qiu Yan offered me help.

529
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,719
Now, I can return the kindness.

530
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,520
I...

531
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,959
I'm glad I can help you.

532
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,599
You two can carry on.

533
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,560
I'll leave you be.

534
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:13,959
Carry on.

535
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,079
Qiu Min,

536
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:19,800
take a seat.

537
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,800
I knew it!

538
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,079
This is part of the plan.

539
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,160
This is his plan,

540
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,719
am I right?

541
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,520
Qin Xuan, what do you mean?

542
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,520
You got out of the Royal Academy

543
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
with Liang Yi's help!

544
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,839
That body

545
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,239
must be his doing too!

546
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,319
I should have known!

547
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:43,880
Where is Qiu Yan?

548
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:44,959
Where is your sister?

549
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,079
Qiu Min...

550
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,199
It was Lord Liang's plan to get us
out of the Royal Academy,

551
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,239
but the boat accident wasn't.

552
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,479
Are you saying...

553
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,119
Lord Liang ordered his men
from the Firewood Office

554
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,520
to escort us out of the city.

555
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,719
We left on a boat

556
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,920
and followed the current.

557
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,640
We evaded the checkpoints.

558
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,920
But unfortunately,

559
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
our boat ran into a reef.

560
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,920
We didn't know how to swim.

561
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,079
In the end,

562
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,719
only I was washed ashore.

563
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,599
I...

564
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,560
I had no idea what to do,

565
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
so I took the risk
and returned to seek your help.

566
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,359
Is Qiu Yan...

567
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,959
When did you last see her?

568
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,400
It was chaotic when the boat sunk.

569
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,719
I remember she was in the cabin.

570
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,680
When the last wave hit,

571
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,439
we got separated.

572
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:53,719
No...

573
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,520
No!

574
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,479
She said it herself.

575
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
She said she was tough.

576
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,079
No...

577
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,479
No!

578
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,839
Sir, I'll have a bowl of wantons.

579
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,160
Right away.

580
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
Lady, you bumped into me!

581
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,839
I'm an old woman with brittle bones!

582
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:53,959
Madam.

583
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,800
I know you want money,

584
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,800
but I have none on me.

585
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,319
This is my purse.

586
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,439
It's worth some silver.

587
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,160
You bumped into me!

588
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,560
You won't get away with it!

589
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,160
You seem like a nice girl,

590
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
how could you be so unreasonable?

591
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,599
You knocked me down!

592
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,800
Everyone, you saw what happened!

593
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,479
Give me ten taels of silver

594
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,599
so I can see a physician!

595
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,000
All of you, dismiss!

596
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,640
What's going on?

597
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,839
Officers!

598
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,800
Officers, my legs!

599
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,439
Are you alright?

600
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,400
She knocked me down

601
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,680
and refused to pay!

602
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,839
She knocked me down.

603
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,640
My legs!

604
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
Stop right there!

605
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,479
Stop!

606
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:31,920
Stop!

607
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:32,760
Stop running!

608
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:34,520
Stop right there!

609
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,839
She's there! Stop right there!

610
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,119
Make way!

611
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,119
Stop!

612
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,560
Move aside.

613
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:10,920
Make way!

614
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:12,920
Stand aside!

615
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,000
(Traditional Chinese Baijiu)

616
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:17,640
Over there!

617
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,760
Go!

618
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,680
Why did you come back?

619
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,599
Come with me.

620
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,117
(Heming Building)

621
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,299
(Heming Building)

622
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,079
You should tell me

623
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,280
if you're looking for Qiu Min.

624
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,640
Have you thought about the risks?

625
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,800
And I came to
the Heming Building for work.

626
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,560
Do you realize

627
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,760
you were almost arrested

628
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,839
by the Fengjing Prefecture authority?

629
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,680
I know!

630
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,640
I know I was reckless.

631
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,119
So?

632
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,239
You knew and did it anyway!

633
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,520
It was an emergency.

634
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,079
The officers from the Firewood Office

635
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,439
won't send us food
for another three days.

636
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,560
By the time you find out,

637
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,000
Min'er will have been in danger.

638
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,680
Min'er is my mother's
only biological child.

639
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,520
If she was harmed,

640
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,119
I can never face my mother again.

641
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,359
Lord Liang,

642
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,760
I know I made a mistake,

643
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,640
so I don't mind if you punish me.

644
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,160
But could you

645
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,319
help me find Qiu Min before that?

646
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,359
Our priority

647
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,719
is to get you out of the city.

648
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,119
I'll send my men to look for her.

649
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,400
Do not act recklessly again.

650
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,160
- Lord Liang...
- Sir.

651
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,439
Something's not right outside.

652
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,400
Men of Main Administrative Office
have surrounded us.

653
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,959
The commotion compromised your identity.

654
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,236
(Heming Building)

655
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,880
Sir.

656
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,320
(Heming Building)

657
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,839
Quick!

658
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,680
Official Yuan.

659
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:01,839
Official Yuan,

660
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,160
the Heming Building is closed today.

661
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,719
What brings you here?

662
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:09,839
Search the place.

663
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,520
Yes!

664
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,119
Official Yuan!

665
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,359
Official Yuan!

666
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,439
Official Yuan!

667
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,119
The troupe is not performing today.

668
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,040
There is no one here.

669
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,280
There is nothing to find.

670
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,839
We've known each other for a long time,

671
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,760
there is no need to send soldiers here.

672
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:52,479
Stay still.

673
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,160
What are you doing?

674
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,520
Sweetheart...

675
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:17,880
Who is it?

676
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,119
Official Yuan, you are getting better

677
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,119
at spoiling the moment.

678
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,760
Lord Liang,

679
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,199
what is going on?

680
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,640
I came here for pleasure,

681
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,359
but you barged right in, Official Yuan.

682
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,280
Are you here

683
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,839
to join us?

684
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:44,800
Liang Yi,

685
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,119
you are abetting the fugitive Qiu Yan.

686
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,959
I just caught you red-handed.

687
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,479
What did you say?

688
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,560
Tell him your name.

689
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,439
Sir,

690
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,160
my name

691
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
is Su Yiwan.

692
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,359
Did you hear that?

693
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,880
I just caught the two of you in the act,

694
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,680
you can't fool me with a made-up story

695
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,520
and a fake name.

696
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,119
Arrest the fugitive Qiu Yan.

697
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:14,880
Don't you dare!

698
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,000
Sir.

699
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:27,800
Official Tong is here.

700
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,400
Why is he here?

701
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,079
Official Yuan,

702
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,520
let the lady put on her clothes

703
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,560
and meet Official Tong.

704
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,199
It's enough that you've wronged me,

705
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,560
are you

706
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
going to watch me get changed?

707
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,320
Official Tong.

708
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Lord Liang.

709
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,199
I've received reports
of fighting in this place.

710
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,120
I didn't think it'd be

711
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,439
you two having an argument.

712
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,639
Her name is Su Yiwan.

713
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,000
She is my love interest.

714
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,360
She came to the Heming Building
to meet me.

715
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,320
But Official Yuan mistook her

716
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,439
for the fugitive Qiu Yan

717
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:39,199
and insisted on saying
I abetted a criminal.

718
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,800
The world never ceased to surprise.

719
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,800
There are people with the same names,

720
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,679
of course there would be some
with similar faces.

721
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,719
Official Tong, you've seen a lot.

722
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm sure you know the possibility
of this happenstance.

723
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,439
However, Official Yuan
got the wrong person

724
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,439
and refused to let her go.

725
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,399
Official Tong,

726
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,560
you've seen Qiu Yan before.

727
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,000
Official Yuan and I
have reached a stalemate.

728
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,159
You should be the judge here.

729
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,080
Official Tong.

730
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,159
Take a close look.

731
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,360
Official Tong.

732
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,360
I've heard of the name
"Su Yiwan" before.

733
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:19,000
But only a handful of people
have seen her.

734
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:21,479
She is a songstress from Jizhou.

735
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,239
From what I see,

736
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,840
she looks exactly the same as Qiu Yan,

737
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,320
but the aura is quite different.

738
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,879
Official Tong.

739
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,800
Is she the fugitive or not?

740
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,639
She has the appearance,

741
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,479
but with a closer look,

742
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,120
they are like apples and oranges.

743
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,040
She is not Qiu Yan.

744
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,760
You have good eyes, Official Tong.

745
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,719
Oh my, Tong.

746
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,280
This is why you're known as
a slippery eel.

747
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,639
Since you're a songstress,

748
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,159
sing a song for us.

749
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,919
Who are you to me?

750
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,560
Why should I do as you order?

751
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,159
Then, I must ask...

752
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,399
No.

753
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,800
Miss Su Yiwan,

754
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,879
I'll need you to come with me
to the Main Administrative Office.

755
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:16,040
Official Yuan.

756
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,639
I forgot to mention just now.

757
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,360
Because of the great time we had,

758
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,280
Wan'er is now my concubine.

759
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,560
She only sings for me.

760
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,000
Very well.

761
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,320
Since I got it all wrong,

762
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,479
I'm done here.

763
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's leave.

764
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:48,639
The misunderstanding has been resolved.

765
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,120
I still have work to see to,

766
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,600
I must take my leave now.

767
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,159
Thank you, Official Tong.

768
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:56,879
(Heming Building)

769
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,800
Sir, why did you let them go so easily?

770
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,000
We lack the evidence

771
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
to prove that she is Qiu Yan.

772
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,360
And now Liang Yi insists

773
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,159
she is his concubine.

774
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,560
What reason do I have

775
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,479
to arrest her?

776
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,479
However,

777
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,439
now that I've startled
his beloved concubine,

778
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,000
I owe him an apology.

779
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,080
Your reaction was on point.

780
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,840
Summoning Official Tong
was an outstanding idea.

781
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,040
Sir,

782
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,120
is that woman really not Qiu Yan?

783
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,760
She looks exactly like the person

784
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,280
on the wanted poster.

785
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
Even if she is,

786
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,879
I must insist that she is not.

787
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,479
I closed the case of
the Qiu family's escape.

788
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,159
I can't possibly
bring trouble to myself.

789
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,879
Min'er.

790
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,919
I ordered Yao Gai to prepare some food.

791
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,479
Eat up.

792
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,360
I know you want to see my sister.

793
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,800
I shouldn't have come here,

794
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,439
she should have been here.

795
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,879
I've lost my family.

796
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,840
I have no attachment to this world.

797
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,919
I only came to see you, Qin Xuan.

798
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,439
That's all I ask.

799
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,639
Do not say that.

800
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,639
You must live.

801
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,520
Qiu Yan

802
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,639
is no longer with us.

803
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,760
I can't let anything happen to you.

804
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,159
Eat up.

805
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:48,800
Qin Xuan.

806
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,520
Could you spend some time with me?

807
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,040
Sure.

808
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,919
Eat up.

809
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,990
(Firewood Office)

810
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,000
Don't worry about the Heming Building.

811
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,719
I saved the troupe leader once.

812
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,959
Your secret is safe.

813
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
The city gate is closed.

814
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,520
Get some rest here.

815
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:19,679
Tomorrow morning,

816
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,159
I'll escort you to the Guangji Hall.

817
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,520
Have you found any lead on Min'er?

818
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:25,800
I dispatched my men

819
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,679
to search everywhere for her.

820
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,040
None of the offices has any report

821
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,159
of Qiu Min being arrested.

822
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,520
On the bright side,

823
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,919
at least she wasn't arrested.

824
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,679
I forgot

825
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,719
to mention something.

826
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,719
Qin Xuan came to me today.

827
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,919
I think he knows
you were behind the plan

828
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:45,719
with the boat accident.

829
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,719
So?

830
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,600
Are you going to

831
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,639
just hide from him forever?

832
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,560
He and I broke up.

833
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,439
You don't want him

834
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,679
to be in trouble.

835
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:06,080
All I want now

836
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,439
is to find Min'er

837
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,800
and to clear my family's name.

838
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,560
As for

839
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,399
everything else,

840
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:19,719
it's not my priority.

841
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,520
I am so useless.

842
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
If I had

843
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,639
taken her with me without hesitation,

844
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,280
she would still...

845
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,199
I did nothing at all.

846
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,120
I could only watch

847
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:54,800
as your family fell into danger

848
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,560
and do nothing as your family
was sent to the Royal Academy.

849
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,800
I could only watch...

850
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,520
as her corpse laid cold
in the Fengjing Prefecture.

851
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,959
I did nothing to save her.

852
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,520
Nothing at all.

853
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,600
I should be the one who died.

854
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,239
Qin Xuan,

855
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,520
have my drink instead.

856
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,800
Back then,

857
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,760
your sister and I

858
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,879
(first met each other in your garden.)

859
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,879
(We were drinking at the pavilion.)

860
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,919
(She was drunk,)

861
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:00,800
but I wasn't.

862
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,000
She came for me later on,

863
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,040
saying I was her drinking buddy.

864
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:18,639
I know you are heartbroken right now.

865
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,199
Perhaps

866
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,040
you can think of me as Qiu Yan

867
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,679
and intoxicate yourself once more.

868
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,399
To think of you

869
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,840
as Qiu Yan?

870
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,399
Qin Xuan,

871
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,800
you are my drinking buddy.

872
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,120
I dare you to drink
until we're both drunk.

873
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,879
Why not?

874
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,520
Qiu Yan!

875
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,000
Qiu Yan, don't go!

876
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:02,879
Qiu Yan!

877
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,520
You are not her.

878
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,280
She is already dead.

879
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,560
She died.

880
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,080
Qin Xuan,

881
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,959
could you give me a kiss?
