=Episode 14=

18
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:41,839
Fourth Uncle!

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,519
Fourth Uncle!

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,440
What was the treatment
you mentioned earlier?

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
It's just a slip of the tongue.

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,800
Fourth Uncle.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,599
Her life is important.
Please, I beg of you.

24
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,319
Get up.

25
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,120
Look at you...

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,839
Fine.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,440
If you want to know,

28
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,639
I'll tell you.

29
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,919
Your mother is afflicted
with an infectious disease.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,559
Do you know where you can get
infected easily?

31
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,319
Brothel and southern wharf.

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,960
I have a mist...

33
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,440
A friend.

34
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,080
She was infected two years ago.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,839
Thanks to a hand-down regimen
from a traveling physician,

36
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,000
she survived.

37
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm not talking out of my hat.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,320
When the Renshen River Disease ran amok,
he saved half a boat of people.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,199
Fourth Uncle, where is he now?

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,919
He is

41
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,240
a traveling physician.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,479
God knows where he is now.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,759
However,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,759
I still have his prescription with me.

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,240
Master, we visited all apothecaries.

46
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,559
All shopkeepers

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
said the tokay gecko and
the euphorbia decaryi

48
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,919
on the prescriptions
must be something exotic.

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,160
They have never seen them.

50
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,479
They can't find them on the market.

51
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,800
It doesn't mean it's impossible.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
I'll go find them myself.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,399
Where's Qiu Yan?

54
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,839
Miss left to purchase medicine for you.

55
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:15,600
She's not home.

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,199
Thank you so much for these few days.

57
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm feeling okay now.

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,639
You can rest now.

59
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,679
No need to stay with me.

60
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,160
If Song Jin has any news,
he'll come back immediately.

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,799
Patience.

62
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,239
Sir!

63
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,279
Anything?

64
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,000
I have news.

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,480
Tokay gecko and euphorbia decaryi
are rare

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
but with the right price,

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,000
you can find them on the black market.

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,839
However, the apothecary that supplies
for the black market

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,119
was seized last month.

70
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,320
By whom?

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,880
By

72
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,119
Main Administrative Office.

73
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:55,195
(Main Administrative Office)

74
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,679
Sir, please have mercy

75
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,959
and save my mother's life.

76
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,880
If you can do us this favor, Mr. Yuan,

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,440
the Firewood Office
will definitely repay it.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,760
Unfortunately, Lord Liang,

79
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,559
this apothecary
is no ordinary apothecary.

80
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,959
They didn't just smuggle medicine.

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,359
Everything that has been seized
has to be recorded

82
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,480
and confiscated.

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
If one thing goes missing,

84
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,720
troubles will arise.

85
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,279
If you can save my mother, sir,

86
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,920
I am willing to shoulder any punishment.

87
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
Corporal or other punishment,

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,440
anything you want, sir.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
Miss Qiu Yan.

90
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,799
We have rules.

91
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,480
Your filial piety is admirable

92
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,839
but the Main Administrative Office
has its own rules.

93
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,760
I'm sure

94
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Lord Liang knows it very well.

95
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,760
Don't do that.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,959
We're colleagues.

97
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,760
I can't accept this genuflection
from you, Lord Liang.

98
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,600
I understand your constraint, Mr. Yuan.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,640
However, this is about someone's life.
Exception should be made.

100
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,399
Please accept my kowtow.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,920
I hope you can make this exception.

102
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
Real men do not bow down.

103
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,799
You even knelt on one knee.

104
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,640
I can only say yes now.

105
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,000
However,

106
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,359
there are many lips in the office.

107
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,440
It's hard to seal all of them.

108
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:15,880
That said, I do have a solution.

109
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,799
Lord Liang, we can both put up a show.

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,679
Just let me whip you.

111
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,720
I'll summon all my underlings

112
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,679
and say you are willing
to serve this punishment

113
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,720
in exchange for the medicine.

114
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:29,160
No one can fault you for anything.

115
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,079
Yuan Lang, you made a fool of yourself
when you last

116
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,920
came to the Firewood Office.

117
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,160
And now, you're taking revenge.

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
I am the one asking for the medicine.

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,600
Mr. Yuan, if you want to take revenge,

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,760
take it out on me.

121
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
Lord Liang, you're not willing to do it?

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,799
Too bad.

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,519
Wait.

124
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,320
No!

125
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,920
Saving your mother is important.

126
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,519
Jiang Yun, bring everyone here.

127
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,119
Yes, sir.

128
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,239
Song Jin, send Miss Qiu out.

129
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,359
- Liang Yi.
- Miss Qiu.

130
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,440
Liang Yi.

131
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll be fine.

132
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,519
I'll be fine.

133
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,519
How should we do this...

134
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,079
Lord Liang confessed to a crime.

135
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,720
We're all witnesses here.

136
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,359
I don't dare

137
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,079
to whip you.

138
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,359
Song Jin,

139
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,760
you should do it.

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,760
Song Jin.

141
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,480
Sir.

142
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,119
Listen to him.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,839
Sir, just kill me.

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,760
Whip me.

145
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,279
Whip me!

146
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Harder.

147
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,599
You should consult a physician.

148
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,307
(Main Administrative Office)

149
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,280
Just some scratches.

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm used to it.

151
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,440
Come, Song Jin.

152
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Take the medicine.

153
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,719
Your mother needs it.

154
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,520
Go now.

155
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,919
I owe you this one.

156
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,559
I'll repay you.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,039
Okay. Go.

158
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,280
Father, I found the medicine.

159
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,880
Mother can be treated now. Father!

160
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:06,200
(Hall of Sanguinity)

161
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,400
Second Young Lady.

162
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,440
Madam is not here anymore.

163
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,039
She's inside.

164
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,520
I'll look for her.

165
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,239
Miss.

166
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,239
Second Young Lady.

167
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,960
Madam is not here anymore.

168
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,440
Let go of me.

169
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,280
She was infected. They had taken
her body out of the city already.

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
She really isn't here anymore.

171
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,599
Miss!

172
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,760
(That day,)

173
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,239
(when your biological mother 
gave you to me)

174
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
(to save your brother,)

175
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I know

176
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,880
you must have been through hell.

177
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,215
(Collection of Odd Occurrences)

178
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,120
(Collection of Odd Occurrences)
(But I don't want you to be a bitter kid.)

179
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,599
(But I don't want you to be a bitter kid.)

180
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,039
(Your life doesn't come by easily.)

181
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,880
(Don't shut yourself in)

182
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,359
(because of fear,)

183
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,640
(because of trust issues.)

184
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,039
(You'll only suffer more.)

185
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,200
(From now on,)

186
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,640
(live well.)

187
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,039
(I'm worried about you.)

188
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,679
From now on,
I'll leave the second chamber to you.

189
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,960
Physician Li,

190
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,159
did my mother

191
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,039
pass away peacefully?

192
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,479
Second Madam left the world
in her dream.

193
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,559
It was painless.

194
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,320
Min'er.

195
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,080
Qiu Yan, did you find the medicine?

196
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,159
It's okay if you can't.

197
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm begging our ancestors
to grant mother a speedy recovery.

198
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,400
I just have to burn one short
and two long incenses,

199
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,840
they will then grant my wish.

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
I also have to finish copying
this last chapter.

201
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,280
Mother has left.

202
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,840
No.

203
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,599
Our ancestors will not lie to us.

204
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,200
Mother has left us.

205
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,359
We even cremated her coffin.

206
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,719
No way.

207
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,359
Our ancestors promised me.

208
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,960
Look.

209
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,359
Mother will come back.

210
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,440
What ancestors?

211
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,119
What promise?

212
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,440
All lies!

213
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,400
If they actually see it,

214
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,319
if they have that
little bit of conscience,

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,280
they won't let mother

216
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,079
leave this world alone.

217
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,760
It's all fake.

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,680
- Stop!
- It's all fake!

219
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,599
- Stop!
- It's all fake!

220
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Qiu Yan,

221
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,119
why tell me mother has left?

222
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,760
I'm sure she's with us.

223
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,119
I'm sure.

224
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,680
Qiu Yan, can I have a hug?

225
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,119
Hug me like mother does.

226
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
This can't be it.

227
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,719
Mother is here.

228
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,520
Mother definitely is here.

229
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,760
Mother is gone.

230
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,079
Wake up now.

231
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,400
From now on,
no one will pamper you anymore.

232
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,920
If you're still this vulnerable

233
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,400
and delusional,

234
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,800
you will spend the rest 
of your days weeping.

235
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,119
Qiu Min.

236
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Qiu Min! Someone! Help!

237
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,160
Qiu Min!

238
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,920
Help!

239
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,680
Qiu Min, don't you scare me.

240
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,160
Stop.

241
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,479
Help!

242
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,520
Qiu Min.

243
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,800
Qiu Min, are you okay?

244
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,560
Qiu Min.

245
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,680
Wake up.

246
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,880
Help!

247
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,680
Qiu Min, are you okay?

248
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,640
You're scaring me. Help!

249
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,560
Mother...

250
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,199
You're dismissed for now.

251
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Yes, sir.

252
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,000
You did your best.

253
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,760
She won't blame you.

254
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,319
This spot is for her.

255
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
For me too.

256
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,079
Mother,

257
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,959
I shouldn't have said those things.

258
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,319
I know you're in grief.

259
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,079
We all are.

260
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,199
Blood. So much blood.

261
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,319
Min'er.

262
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,239
So much blood.

263
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,079
What? Did you have a nightmare?

264
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:22,199
So much blood. Mother must be in pain.

265
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,079
I asked physician Li.

266
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,560
- So much blood.
- Mother passed away in her sleep.

267
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,680
It was painless.

268
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,439
No,

269
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,319
I saw mother

270
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,040
vomiting blood.

271
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,800
What?

272
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,319
That day, I missed her so much

273
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,800
so I snuck into her yard.

274
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,079
Hurry up and wash it.

275
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,000
Then go back inside.

276
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,920
Don't let anyone see this.

277
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:58,920
Okay.

278
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,319
I was horrified

279
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,280
so I went to the ancestral hall

280
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,959
and prayed for mother's health.

281
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,319
You mean you saw

282
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,520
physician Li and the nurse

283
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,199
enter mother's room

284
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,479
without any protective garment?

285
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:30,430
(Lunar Steps)

286
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,439
Second Young Lady,

287
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,719
no one was infected in the temple.

288
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,640
There are two villages by the foot
of the mountain.

289
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
34 households in total.

290
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,839
I visited all of them.

291
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,319
None of them
contacted the infectious disease.

292
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,040
All right. You're dismissed.

293
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:41,880
Noted.

294
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,760
If my mother had an infectious disease,

295
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,800
why did no one from Mount Taiying
or from our family

296
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,040
contact it too?

297
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,239
Don't you think something's off, father?

298
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,760
Physician Li discovered
the infection early

299
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,079
and isolated her from us.

300
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,439
That's how

301
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:06,439
we could escape from the same fate.

302
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,560
Physician Li wouldn't even let anyone

303
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
come close to my mother's yard.

304
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,680
But Min'er saw

305
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,599
that he and the nurse went in
to treat my mother

306
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,280
without any protective garment.

307
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,959
If the infectious disease
is that lethal,

308
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,839
why is he as healthy as a horse now?

309
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,800
There's no way this infectious disease

310
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,800
can only infect my mother.

311
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,920
Perhaps he misdiagnosed,

312
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,119
prescribed the wrong medicine,

313
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,119
and that's why my mother
could never recover.

314
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,319
Yan'er.

315
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,920
I know you're a good daughter.

316
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,599
You're saddened by your mother's death.

317
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,040
I am too.

318
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
But we

319
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,719
can't accuse someone of wrongdoing

320
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,199
just because we lost someone dear to us.

321
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,479
I am not.

322
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:54,160
But my mother left this world
out of a sudden.

323
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,040
Father, shouldn't we get to the bottom of it?

324
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,479
Enough.

325
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:04,439
Your mother was afflicted
with an infectious disease

326
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,640
and died to it.

327
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,640
That's the truth.

328
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,000
It can't get any clearer than that.

329
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,920
Father, Min'er will not lie.

330
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,959
The physician lied that my mother
passed away peacefully.

331
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,280
There must be a reason.

332
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,959
Even if physician Li said that
to console me,

333
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,920
but there are no other cases from
Mount Taiying and here.

334
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,599
Where did my mother get infected?

335
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,000
And what was she infected with?

336
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,599
And what happened
before she passed away?

337
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,400
Enough!

338
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,239
Everyone is busy
organizing the funeral now.

339
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,079
As her daughter,

340
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,280
you did not perform a wake or pray.

341
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,439
All you think about
is conspiracy theories.

342
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,000
Do you have to

343
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,839
sow more chaos into this family

344
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,520
until you're satisfied?

345
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,160
Father.

346
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,640
If you won't believe me,

347
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,599
I'll investigate myself.

348
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,959
I will find out

349
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,680
how my mother passed away.

350
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,719
You...

351
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,319
Someone!

352
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,560
Someone!

353
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,160
See Second Young Lady to her room.

354
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,199
Watch over her

355
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,119
until she apologizes.

356
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,719
Second Young Lady...

357
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:16,200
(Lunar Steps)

358
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,359
Back then,

359
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,959
you groveled to this

360
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,239
and coddled to that.

361
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,000
When the moment comes,

362
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,959
only I came to take care of you.

363
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,719
Come eat with me.

364
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,680
I'm not hungry.

365
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,439
Honestly,

366
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,640
why crossed your father?

367
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
Your father

368
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,520
has a lot on his plate already.

369
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,839
Yet, you bothered him with something
he doesn't wish to hear.

370
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,239
Come eat

371
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,359
and stop brooding.

372
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,920
You know,

373
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,119
anything can change within seconds.

374
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,119
At first, I thought

375
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,560
I could never be the legal wife.

376
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,599
And I might have to be
a concubine forever.

377
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,160
Things change so quickly.

378
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,839
Oh, we should coddle your father now.

379
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:32,000
One day, your father might make me

380
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,319
his legal wife because of your brother.

381
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,359
And then,

382
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,000
you'll be the legitimate daughter.

383
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,160
So you cried so much just now

384
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,839
and hugged Qiu Min,

385
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,280
saying you would love her
and protect her.

386
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
All that was for show?

387
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,560
How can you say that?

388
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,920
Among the second chamber,

389
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,319
Old Madam loves Min the most.

390
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,520
If I don't

391
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,119
bring her to my side now,

392
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,439
someone else will.

393
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm not dumb.

394
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,760
Go away!

395
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:00,599
You...

396
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,000
What are you doing?

397
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm your mother!

398
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
No, you're not.

399
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:08,839
Fine.

400
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,199
Fine!

401
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,839
You want to be the pious daughter.
Go ahead.

402
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,880
The day when your father

403
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,239
makes me his legal wife,

404
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm sure you'll come to me

405
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,560
and call me mother.

406
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,479
Careful.

407
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:09,880
Careful.

408
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,040
Condolences, Uncle Qiu.

409
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,479
Condolences, Official Qiu.

410
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,439
Thank you.

411
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,160
Both of you

412
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,400
brought me so many medicines
to fight against infections.

413
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:55,920
Allow me to thank you
on behalf of the Qiu family.

414
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,239
It's all Lord Liang's doing.

415
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,239
He searched all apothecaries in the Capital
and amassed so many medicines.

416
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,560
You're most welcome, Official Qiu.

417
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,160
Lord Liang.

418
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,839
My wife passed away suddenly

419
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,479
and it only delayed the marriage.

420
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:18,000
I was supposed to meet you

421
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,560
to discuss it.

422
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,560
Uncle Qiu.

423
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,119
The marriage can wait.

424
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,959
The funeral for your late wife
is more important.

425
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,000
Thank you.

426
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,400
Uncle Qiu.

427
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Where are Qiu Yan and Qiu Min?

428
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,000
They are both deeply affected

429
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,640
by their mother's death.

430
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,280
Min'er is now bedridden

431
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,599
and Yan'er

432
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,560
remains too stubborn

433
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,439
to admit

434
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:55,400
that her mother has passed away
because of the illness.

435
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,040
Remember your favorite poem,
Far-off Journey?

436
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,199
You always say

437
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,479
you're envious of how the men
in the poem

438
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,719
can travel around.

439
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,400
Even though your wish
won't come true now,

440
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,040
but making a miniature world

441
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,520
in this square ceramic plate

442
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,359
should help to realize your dream
in a way.

443
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,400
I shall then ride this noble steed,

444
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,239
travel with my mother,

445
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,560
and visit all of Jiangnan
and everything beyond.

446
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,359
You're not holding a noble steed.

447
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,959
You're holding the mythical giant,
Kuafu.

448
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,119
Yan'er.

449
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,280
As women,

450
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,719
we might be confined to the house
for the rest of our life.

451
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,800
But if you have an adventurous spirit,

452
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,839
the world

453
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,719
will exist in your heart.

454
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,680
Done.

455
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,000
It looks beautiful.

456
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,544
(Lunar Steps)

457
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:04,130
(Lunar Steps)

458
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,719
Miss, Young Master Qin
wishes to visit you.

459
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,359
Tell him to go back.

460
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm too tired.

461
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,800
Qiu Yan.

462
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,439
My wet nurse told me

463
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
that when someone passed away,

464
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,839
his or her soul would linger around
the ones they loved.

465
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,400
If Aunt Qiu sees you

466
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,560
suffering like this,

467
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,479
she'll be worried about you.

468
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:10,294
(Solemnity)

469
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Lord Liang is here.

470
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,199
I'll summon Third Young Lady then.

471
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,919
No need.

472
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
The loss of a dear one

473
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,719
cannot be alleviated with
words of consolation.

474
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,959
Please take good care of Miss Qiu Min.

475
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,719
May she recover soon.

476
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,320
As for the void she feels inside,

477
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,280
only time

478
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,239
can heal that.

479
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,239
Give this to her.

480
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,800
See you.

481
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,679
I'm not hungry.

482
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,120
Just one bite.

483
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,560
You have to move on.

484
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,639
I can't.

485
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,040
My hunch is never wrong.

486
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,840
My mother passed away
under peculiar circumstances.

487
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,719
If I can't find out the truth,

488
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,840
I can't move on.

489
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,959
Qiu Yan, sorrow has blinded you.

490
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,560
Infectious disease is dangerous.

491
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,120
If the royal family contacts it,

492
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,280
they still stand a slim chance 
of surviving.

493
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,320
You won't believe me?

494
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,320
It's not that I don't.

495
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,679
But the coffin
has been turned into ashes.

496
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,399
The devil is in the details.

497
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,879
I'm sure I can find something.

498
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,760
I'll investigate

499
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,080
whatever is suspicious.

500
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,280
Thanks, sir.

501
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,199
Have a safe trip, sir.

502
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,280
See you.

503
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:43,800
Go.

504
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,719
Miss Qiu Yan, it must be stuffy inside.

505
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,560
Where's Lord Liang?

506
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:57,719
Over there.

507
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,760
Lord Liang, let's go.

508
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,080
Perhaps we can intercept the physician.

509
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,560
Song Jin, go to the Firewood Office

510
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,919
and send people to block all exits
from the city.

511
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,600
Okay.

512
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,639
Follow me, all of you.

513
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,120
(Jingqi Apothecary)

514
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,200
(Outbound for an undetermined
amount of time)

515
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
He took his saving with him too.

516
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,639
I don't think he's coming back at all.

517
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,800
Something's up then.

518
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,600
It's still warm. He's not far away.

519
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,599
(Staging post)

520
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,688
(Staging post)

521
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
This is the only staging post outside
of the city within a hundred li.

522
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,520
The watcher by the city gate

523
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,360
reported that Li Zhengyuan
and his daughter left on foot.

524
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,399
Without a horse carriage,

525
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,040
the furthest he can reach is here.

526
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,040
Sir, come in, please.

527
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,439
Firewood Office.

528
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,639
Did a middle-aged traveling physician

529
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,360
and a young woman come here?

530
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,560
Not at all.

531
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:15,959
Stop right there.

532
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,280
You mother

533
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,879
couldn't stop coughing

534
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
but her pulse was normal

535
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,639
and vigorous.

536
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,479
My benefactor asked me

537
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,280
to say that she had
an infectious disease.

538
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,600
Her pulse was normal?

539
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,159
What's the cause of my mother's death?

540
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,360
She...

541
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,320
She vomited blood before she died.

542
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,639
After she passed away, red spots
appeared on her skin.

543
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:06,600
It looked...

544
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,080
It looked like red safflower poison.

545
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
You're saying

546
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,080
someone poisoned my mother?

547
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,919
I don't know about anything else.

548
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,360
My benefactor

549
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,159
just told me to leave now
so that I wouldn't be involved.

550
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,040
I did this to repay the favor I owed.

551
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,800
Who is

552
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,919
this benefactor of yours?

553
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,280
You stayed in my house
for more than a decade.

554
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,220
(Memorial Tablet Beloved Mother
in the Qiu Family, Han Ruogu)

555
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,479
I treated you like my own daughter

556
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:54,120
and felt sorry for you all this time.

557
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,040
I had

558
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,600
to do what I did.

559
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,840
Don't blame me.

560
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,800
Second Young Lady,
let me inform her first.

561
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,399
Move aside.

562
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,879
Second Young Lady.

563
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,520
Why?

564
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,840
Why did you do that to my mother?

565
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,520
My mother treated you with respect.

566
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,639
What did she do that you had

567
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,280
to burn her corpse too?

568
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,760
Nonsense!

569
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,320
Nonsense?

570
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,320
My dear grandmother

571
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,159
bribed a physician

572
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,159
to poison my mother.

573
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,080
Is there anything else
crazier than this?

574
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:31,959
Old Madam.

575
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,360
You did this, didn't you?

576
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,439
Utter gibberish.

577
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,639
Old Madam Qiu,
we're talking about one life here.

578
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,760
Please explain yourself.

579
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,439
Ridiculous.

580
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,280
A daughter who lost her mother
started spouting nonsense.

581
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,399
No explanation is needed.

582
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:48,919
Physician Li Zhengyuan

583
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,919
is now imprisoned
in the Firewood Office.

584
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,040
If you won't admit it,

585
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,320
I will just interrogate him

586
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:56,280
and invite you to the Firewood Office
some other day.

587
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,560
Lord Liang.

588
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:00,520
This is my family business.

589
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,040
I shouldn't burden you with it,
Lord Liang.

590
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,639
Yan'er, come here.

591
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,639
Father, I found Li Zhengyuan.

592
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,399
My mother didn't have any
infectious disease.

593
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:16,840
She was poisoned by red safflower.

594
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,399
Old Madam asked him
to rule it as an infectious disease.

595
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:20,959
All right.

596
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,320
Old Madam poisoned my mother.

597
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,080
Yan'er, go back to your room.

598
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:29,879
My mother continued your bloodline.

599
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,040
She was killed

600
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,520
and you don't want to find her killer?

601
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,040
Physician Li said
your mother was poisoned.

602
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,159
Where is his proof?

603
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Without proof,

604
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,159
it's just an accusation.

605
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,080
Old Madam rushed to cremate my mother

606
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,120
to erase the evidence of her crime.

607
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,919
Enough.

608
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,639
Bring her away.

609
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,320
Uncle Qiu.

610
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,639
Qiu Yan was right to question it.

611
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,320
That physician was behaving oddly.

612
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:05,840
Lord Liang.

613
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,159
We're both government officials.

614
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,639
Just two days ago, you called me
father-in-law.

615
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,919
And now, you accused
my mother of a crime.

616
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,919
Is this

617
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,560
how you're supposed to treat your future
father-in-law,

618
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,479
Lord Liang?

619
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,919
If the Second Madam of Qiu family
was poisoned,

620
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,159
then it's a criminal case.

621
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,320
The Qiu family cannot hide it forever.

622
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,800
Lord Liang, sounding the drum
to have your case heard, that's a case.

623
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,439
Going to the court to complain about
injustice, that's also a case.

624
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:35,959
My wife died of an illness

625
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,639
and my family is struck with sorrow.

626
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,639
That's just a family business.

627
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Please don't meddle in this, Lord Liang.

628
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:58,560
Your Lordship,

629
00:41:58,919 --> 00:41:59,840
I, Qiu Yan, a commoner,

630
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,280
would like to see the death
of my mother, Han, be investigated.

631
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,320
Qiu Yan.

632
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,679
Get up now.

633
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,919
Are you crazy?

634
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:08,040
Yes, I am.

635
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:10,159
I can't compromise, I can't be soft.

636
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,439
I can't learn everything
my mother taught me.

637
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,159
You...

638
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,159
If fighting

639
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,639
is what it takes
to make an appeal for my mother,

640
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,040
then I'm prepared to die for it.

641
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:18,600
You...

642
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,639
Lord Liang.

643
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,000
The Lin of the Qiu family

644
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,159
poisoned my mother, Han.

645
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,840
May justice be served!

646
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,239
Qiu Yan, you're...

647
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,399
The insolence!

648
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,479
Official Qiu.

649
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,560
If Old Madam Qiu is innocent

650
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,399
and Madam Han truly died
from an infectious disease,

651
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,560
she has nothing to fear.

652
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:51,080
Yan'er.

653
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,159
Your mother passed away.

654
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,800
Do you think

655
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,280
you're the only one suffering?

656
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,560
She was my wife for many years.

657
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,040
My heart

658
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,239
is bleeding right now too.

659
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,479
And now,

660
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,159
you accuse

661
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:18,520
my mother of killing my wife.

662
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,239
Yan'er,

663
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,320
do you know you're just

664
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,840
adding insult to injury?

665
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,280
Father,

666
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,919
you can be the pious son

667
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,560
and take your mother's side.

668
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,719
But I will also be the pious daughter

669
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,760
and find out the truth
of my mother's death.

670
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,320
I just want the truth.

671
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:40,919
And the truth is

672
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,520
your mother died
of an infectious disease.

673
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,120
Tell yourself that lie then.

674
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,120
Yan'er.

675
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,239
Are you my daughter or not?

676
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:57,800
If being your daughter means

677
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
I have to accept
my mother died mysteriously,

678
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,600
then no.

679
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:04,560
You...

680
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:06,600
Uncle Qiu, calm down, please.

681
