(Firewood Office)

19
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:46,760
Lord Liang is usually
very lenient towards us.

20
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,160
Why is he

21
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,080
so angry today?

22
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,480
Did anyone get on his nerves?

23
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,040
He needs to vent.

24
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,639
He'll only feel better after

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,959
several months I bet.

26
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,000
He is really mad this time.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,879
What is the date again?

28
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,199
Miss Qiu will leave tomorrow.

29
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,679
Is her wagon ready?

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,520
Sir, I can tell you miss her.

31
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,880
Why not go back home early?

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,919
She will leave eventually.

33
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,520
Spending more time with her

34
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,039
will just make the parting more painful.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,479
It will always be painful.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,039
Seeing her will make your heart ache
for the parting,

37
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,479
but even more so
if you don't see her now.

38
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,240
You confine yourself to the
Firewood Office to avoid it

39
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,880
but it does nothing to lessen your pain.

40
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,199
If my loved one is leaving soon,

41
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,240
before she leaves,

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I would even go as far

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,520
as to cuff her to my side.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,759

(Plain Feathers)

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,160
Growing up,

133
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,119
no one has told me

134
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,040
that a woman

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,679
can do something else
other than being a housewife.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,279
Not until when you brought me
to meet Mr. Lu

137
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,480
and he said I had a gift
for storytelling script writing.

You know,

139
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,760
at that moment, I feel like

140
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,799
my life has another purpose.

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,399
And that purpose

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,920
isn't to be someone else's wife

143
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,200
or mother.

144
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,359
I, my very self, have value.

145
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,839
Since young, I have witnessed my mother
and Madam Liu

146
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,959
devote their lives for my father

147
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,760
and for the family.

148
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,040
That's how they spend their lives.

149
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,320
For many years, the entire family

150
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,760
doesn't even know their names.

151
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,160
Everyone knows one is Han,

152
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,279
and the other is Liu.

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,000
Perhaps they even forgot their real names.

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,839
Even on my mother's memorial tablet,

155
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,880
she's the "Qiu's wife".

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,679
After many years,

157
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,480
no one will remember them.

158
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
And no one will know

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,200
that they were once lively,
sprightly women

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,039
when they were young.

161
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
I don't want to live like that.

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,359
You made me realize

163
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
that I can have a future

164
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,200
in which I am not someone else's accessory.

165
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,000
I want people to remember the name

166
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,200
I pick for myself.

of crime fiction that will be praised
by the future generation,

169
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,559
they will remember me,

170
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,400
not as someone else's wife,

171
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
but as my true authentic self.

172
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,200
Six years ago, when we first met,

173
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,039
you were still a little girl.

174
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,559
You told me with this bold ambition

175
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,440
that you wanted to travel.

176
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,239
The world is huge

177
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,919
and you want to explore.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,640
And then you said...

179
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,200
Do you have money?

180
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,359
Can you read?

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,000
Can you count?

182
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,679
If you want to travel,

183
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,799
you need to be independent.

184
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,719
Okay?

185
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,679
And now,

186
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,440
you know everything.

187
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,440
Oh, my little girl.

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,599
I can never keep you.

189
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,039
I support your decision.

190
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,039
But promise me

191
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
that one day,

192
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,280
if you're tired

193
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,119
and you miss home,

194
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,400
let me know.

195
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,200
I look forward to the day

196
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,039
when I open my door,

197
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,520
a mischievous, sharp-witted,

198
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,719
and cheeky Qiu Yan comes to greet me.

199
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,760
I will wait for you here.

200
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,080
Our country is vast.

201
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,640
If I travel from the South to the North,

202
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,599
it might take several years.
I don't know when I'll be back.

203
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,039
You shouldn't wait for me.

204
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
You don't get to decide.

205
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,119
I'll send you off tomorrow.

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,000
Before the sunset tomorrow,

207
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,159
you're still my Su Yiwan.

208
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,312
(Plain Feathers)

209
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,103
(Main Administrative Office)

210
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:28,760
Sir.

211
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
Sir, we are now the laughing stocks

212
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,400
in the Imperial Court.

213
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,400
Are you willing
to admit defeat like this?

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,400
Back then, I couldn't outwit Liang Yi

215
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,760
and I laid low for three years
in somewhere far away.

216
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,919
This temporary loss
does not mean a thing.

217
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,919
No one knows
who will get the last laugh.

218
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,400
Sir, it's a missive.

219
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,520
I can eliminate Liang Yi

220
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,280
but I require your assistance,
Official Yuan.

221
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,239
If you are intent to help me,

222
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,640
wait for my order.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
Sir, it seems like
we're not the only one

224
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,359
who wants to defeat Liang Yi.

225
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,280
I wonder who in the Imperial Court

226
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,760
is capable of

227
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,520
killing him.

228
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
Even I don't dare to make
such a bold claim.

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,520
Sir, whoever this person is,

230
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,919
our enemy's enemy

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,760
is our friend.

232
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:40,864
(Liang Residence)

233
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,280
You're awake.

234
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,679
I have to attend the court.

235
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:44,840
Wait.

236
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,280
The seam is undone.

237
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,200
Come.

238
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,400
Sit here.

239
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,679
I'll patch you up real quick.

240
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,880
You're an avid novel reader
so I'm sure you don't know

241
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,080
a thing about needlework.

242
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,200
Don't you underestimate me, Lord Liang.

243
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,280
It's just to sew it shut.

244
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,239
Nothing too challenging.

245
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,239
I'm ambitious enough

246
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,679
to do what men can do

247
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:50,039
but that doesn't mean I can't do

248
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,159
what women can do.

249
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
Let me

250
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
take a day off today.

251
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,320
Why?

252
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,280
Attending the morning meeting
will take four to six hours.

253
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,280
That's half a day gone.

254
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Normally,

255
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,799
will you forgo your duty
for your private life?

256
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,039
So am I this

257
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,320
seductress who leads her spouse
to the wrong path?

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,640
After the meeting,

259
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,400
I will hurry back here.

260
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,520
I will not waste any time.

261
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,559
It's done.

262
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,640
I'll go now.

263
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,840
You won't see me off?

264
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,559
I'll give you the key.

265
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,239
What if I lose it?

266
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,919
Then you'll wear it forever.

267
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,520
Okay.

268
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,719
All right. Go now.

269
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,520
What are you doing?

270
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,079
I'm cooking for Lord Liang.

271
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,760
Let me help you.

272
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,800
I suppose we won't meet again?

273
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,199
Lord Liang is still upset

274
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,199
and that's why he wants to expel me.

275
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
But Old Madam,

276
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,880
you will ask him to bring me back,
won't you?

277
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,880
So perhaps, we can still see each other.

278
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,359
Don't lie anymore, Qiu Yan.

279
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,880
When I first saw you,

280
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,560
you look familiar.

281
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,439
I couldn't fall asleep yesterday.

282
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,839
As I tossed and turned,

283
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,119
I suddenly recalled

284
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,760
where I saw you.

285
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,959
When I was watching a performance
in the Heming Building,

286
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,479
the girl next to Qin Xuan was you.

287
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,359
A new maid?

288
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,280
She doesn't have any manners.

289
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
If your Master
is watching a performance,

290
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,199
you cannot sit down.

291
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,760
And the two of you put up a spectacle
in front of the Noble Consort.

292
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,839
Daredevil, aren't you?

293
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:38,920
What's wrong?

294
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,560
You should have been more careful.

295
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,359
Here. Sit down.

296
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,119
Old Madam.

297
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,520
I didn't mean to lie to you.

298
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,119
I know

299
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,880
you were the daughter
of an incriminated minister back then.

300
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,680
Yi'er wished to protect you

301
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,680
so he had to use this method.

302
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,520
You needed to lie to everyone,

303
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,800
including me.

304
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,359
Old Madam...

305
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,680
Sorry.

306
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,479
Both of you were acting

307
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,040
but the feelings you two have
for each other are not fake.

308
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,160
From the moment we have spent together,

309
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,520
I can tell you truly care

310
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,160
about Yi'er and me.

311
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,199
You promised me

312
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,959
that you would never leave Yi'er.

313
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,560
Is Qiu Yan not obliged to deliver

314
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,400
the promise made by Su Yiwan?

315
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,920
The coo of a caged bird does not

316
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,319
compare to the chirp of a forest fowl.

317
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,439
You belong to the sky.

318
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,599
You shouldn't be chained to a house

319
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
till your inexorable end.

320
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,439
Qiu Yan.

321
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,680
Wherever you go,

322
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,920
as long as I still live,

323
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,400
the Liang Residence
will always welcome you.

324
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,680
Yi'er loves bamboo shoot soup
with cured pork the most.

325
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,280
Let me teach you.

326
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,079
Come.

327
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:05,040
Cut the bamboo shoot into thin slices.

328
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,560
Then braise fresh pork

329
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,280
and cured pork together.

330
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,400
Does it smell good?

331
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,680
It smells amazing.

332
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:29,959
You made this?

333
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,599
Old Madam taught me how to make it.

334
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,560
Just one dish?

335
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,800
How many do you want?

336
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,160
Isn't this your favorite?

337
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,560
Right.

338
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,040
Come.

339
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,199
Have a taste.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,800
Try it.

341
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,239
What do you think?

342
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,319
Delicious.

343
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,040
Very umami.

344
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,680
I must have used salt instead of sugar
for the final seasoning.

345
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
It's so salty. How is it delicious?

346
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,479
I'll make another one.

347
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:21,439
It's fine. I like it salty.

348
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,560
That way,

349
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,079
I won't forget

350
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:24,680
about your cooking.

351
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,199
It's too briny. Stop it.

352
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,599
I want to drink it.

353
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,119
You'll die from the salt. Are you dumb?

354
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,319
Stop drinking it. Put it here.

355
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,599
Stop it!

356
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,560
- If I don't,
- Don't drink it.

357
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,160
I won't be able to have it anymore.

358
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,920
Don't drink it anymore.

359
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,640
It's too salty.

360
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,400
What a beautiful flower.

361
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,680
There's one small white flower
among the petals.

362
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,160
It's a paper flower.

363
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,959
A tribute from a foreign nation.

364
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,160
It favors a hot and humid weather.

365
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,160
The plants we have here
do not like the sun.

366
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,479
Paper flower, however,
flourishes under it.

367
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,040
And I thought

368
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:59,079
you only know the torture tools
in the Firewood Office by heart.

369
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,040
These plants were given to my father

370
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,359
by the Imperial Court.

371
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,680
My father wouldn't let
any horticulturist handle them

372
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,160
so he brought me with him
to take care of them.

373
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,920
After I took over the Firewood Office,

374
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,959
the time to take care of these plants

375
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,119
became a luxury I couldn't afford.

376
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,319
The garden of this residence is elegant
and sophisticated.

377
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,439
My favorite

378
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,040
has to be the plants in this garden.

379
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,520
Green and lush.

380
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
They brighten my mood.

381
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,079
Don't worry.

382
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,640
The garden will be maintained

383
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,280
to remain the same
as you first came here.

384
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,199
This branch is growing so well.

385
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,640
Why did you prune it?

386
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,680
It will indeed be great
if I keep it that way.

387
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,920
But pruning new branches

388
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,959
encourages the plant to grow.

389
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,199
That way, it will bloom even better
next year.

390
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,479
Pruning branches is trading
a short term pain

391
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,800
for a long term gain.

392
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,680
The market by the Sifang Street
is all the rage today.

393
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,599

Alas, the norm binds us so.

404
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,920
I long to spread my wing and travel far.

405
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,000
When I finally recognized
these characters,

406
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,560
I did not know the meaning they bear.

407
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,680
I read them so many times

408
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,040
until I realize

409
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,000
they are Qu Yuan's lamentation

410
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,319
regarding how our world
restricts our freedom

411
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,520
and he wants to fly away

412

that you must be busy traveling around

416
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,760

417
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,599
I was so envious of you.

Qingdai, why are you here with me?

445
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,680
I asked Lord Liang
to persuade First Madam

446
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,680
to release me
so that I can come with you.

447
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,160
This world is dangerous

448
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,800

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,959
(Am I not as interesting
as the memorandum?)

00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,193
(May your wish come true, Qiu Yan)

504
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,959
(That's already enough.)

505
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,040
(I will seek my story in this realm.)

506
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:34,979
(Collection of Odd Occurrences, Final Chapter
Evil-Purger, Devotee of Yanqi)

507
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,599
(I want people to remember the name)
Devotee of Yanqi.

508
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,800
(I pick for myself.)

509
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,520
(After chapters and chapters)

510
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,680
(of crime fiction that will be praised
by the future generation,)

511
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,280
(they will remember me,)

512
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,199
(not as someone else's wife,)

513
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,479
(but as my true authentic self.)

514
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:20,597
(Ministry of War)

515
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,280
Ministry of War Imperial Guard,
Qin Xuan, reporting for duty.

516
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,120
Inside please.

517
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,439
Those from Northern Liang traveled far
to get a piece of our pie.

518
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,399
I am so glad they got robbed.

519
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,399
Those bandits did the right thing

520
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
robbing the Northern Liang merchants.

521
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,159
It is quite a tricky case.

522
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,679
If you deal with it properly, they will
say you work for Northern Liang.

523
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:38,760
If you don't,

524
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,760
the Northern Liang merchants
will make a big deal out of it.

525
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,360
Now that this case has reached
the Ministry of War.

526
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,520
I wonder which unlucky fellow

527
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,840
has to handle it.

528
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,280
Indeed.

529
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,399
Sir,

530
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,719
Imperial Guard, Qin Xuan,
is here reporting for duty.

531
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,120
Spare the officialese, Mr. Qin.

532
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,760
How is Duke Ying

533
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,199
doing at the moment?

534
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,040
He is doing well.

535
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,199
Thank you for your concern.

536
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,800
Are you tying the knot with
the Empyrean Fairy soon?

537
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,399
She still needs
to perform her mourning duty.

538
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:17,360
It'll be at least three years.

539
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,879
Three years will pass by in a blink.

540
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,320
When that time comes,

541
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,360
do send me an invitation

542
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,760
so that I can visit
the Duke Ying Residence

543
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,439
to share this joy.

544
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,479
Sir, let's talk about work.

545
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,360
I heard

546
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,120
the Ministry of War received a case
regarding a robbery

547
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:37,760
that involved Northern Liang merchants.

548
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,840
But no one wants to handle this case.

549
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,600
That case...

550
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,239
It's best if you

551
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,919
don't take it, Mr. Qin.

552
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,760
What do you mean, sir?

553
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:52,280
A few days ago,

554
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,800
a group of Northern Liang merchants

555
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,520
was robbed by bandits
near the outskirt of the city.

556
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,239
No one was killed
so it shouldn't be a serious case.

557
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,639
But it happened when

558
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:05,199
our nation was trying to strike
a peace accord with Northern Liang.

559
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,479
If it's mismanaged,

560
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:10,639
Northern Liang
will not let it go easily.

561
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,879
And if that happens,

562
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,159
the trade deals we negotiated
so hard for

563
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,959
will all be in vain.

564
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,320
That's why it's a touchy subject
at the moment.

565
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,520
Sir, I volunteer to handle this case

566
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,959
for you.

567
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:30,400
(Ministry of War)

568
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,320
Qin Xuan.

569
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,320
Why are you here?

570
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,399
Today is your first day
assuming your duty in the Ministry of War.

571
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,679
I worry that you might not
have the time to eat

572
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,879
so I brought you some fruits and snacks.

573
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,679
I'm not hungry.

574
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,000
I still have work to do.

575
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,199
Just go back.

576
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,320
Qin Xuan.

577
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,199
I made you a perfume pouch.

578
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,040
There's a safety talisman inside.

579
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,159
If you ever run into any danger,

580
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,800
it will protect you.

581
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,479
If no one is plotting something against me,

582
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,679
I will be safe.

583
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,199
I need to tell you about Qiu Yan.

584
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:13,959
What happened to her?

585
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,719
She sent us a message two days ago,

586
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,719
saying that she would be leaving
the Capital

587
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,919
to travel around.

588
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,520
Lord Liang even sent Song Jin
to the Qiu Residence

589
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,639
to persuade First Madam
to let Qingdai leave with her.

590
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,199
I'm afraid

591
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,840
they are on their way now.

592
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:31,360
Liang Yi didn't ask her to stay?

593
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,239
Qin Xuan, you should know

594
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:35,800
that no one can stop Qiu Yan

595
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,360
when she decides to do something.

596
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,280
So

597
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,919
she chose neither me

598
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,800
nor Liang Yi.

599
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,919
Like I said to you,

600
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,879
Qiu Yan loves herself the most.

601
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,919
Just like a wisp of smoke,

602
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,280
she disappears.

603
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,000
All right.

604
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,239
I'll listen to her

605
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:06,679
and move on.

606
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,040
I will make a name for myself

607
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,479
and she'll hear it wherever she goes.

608
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:17,679
Qin...

609
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:18,719
Miss Min.

610
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,800
My Master is duty-bound.

611
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:21,560
He's not like before.

612
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,120
Also, this is a government office.

613
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:25,080
You shouldn't come here regularly.

614
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,120
If people see you,

615
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,919
they will think that Master
needs pampering.

616
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
(Ministry of War)

617
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,439
(Plain Feathers)

618
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,280
Mother.

619
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,399
Great timing, Yi'er.

620
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,360
Look. The wind grows weaker.

621
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,520
Help me pull the string.

622
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,399
Let me help you.

623
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,120
It's my first time
seeing you flying a kite.

624
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,520
Why the sudden humor?

625
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,879
Wan'er...

626
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:58,879
Qiu Yan

627
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,679
made this long-string kite for me

628
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,479
before she left.

629
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,479
She was worried that it wouldn't fly

630
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,800
because she made it
for the first time too.

631
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,159
She'll see it.

632
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,320
It's beautiful.

633
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,800
Sir.

634
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,959
Mr. Zhan sent a messenger.

635
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,040
He wishes to see you.

636
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:37,600
Mr. Zhan?

637
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,040
The imperial physician who came to treat

638
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,399
my father's wound when he was injured?

639
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,040
What else did the messenger say?

640
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,439
He said Mr. Zhan was very sick.

641
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,919
He had a rally this morning

642
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:48,959
and asked for your presence.

643
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,600
He said he needed to tell you something.

644
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:51,639
He...

645
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,719
He said he knew the truth
of your father's death.

646
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,760
Duke Lu

647
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,439
shot your father's horse by mistake.

648
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,120
I don't think it's an accident at all.

649
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,159
The Vice Minister of Justice
is Duke Lu's nephew.

650
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:23,365
(Zhan Residence)

651
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,080
Sir.

652
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:33,320
He was the messenger
who came to our residence.

653
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,639
Mr. Zhan is dead too then.

654
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,199
Sir, let me ask around.

655
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,959
That's all the neighbors said.

656
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,560
Sir.

657
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,560
I got everything.

658
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,679
Two hours ago,

659
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,000
the farmer next to their abode came
with food for Mr. Zhan as usual.

660
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:56,560
As he entered the house, he found

661
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,000
the two of them dead

662
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:58,879
from stabbings.

663
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,879
And then, he alerted
the Fengjing Prefecture.

664
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,919
What did the Fengjing Prefecture
say about this?

665
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,080
They discovered
that the home was ransacked

666
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,879
and everything valuable was stolen.

667
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,120
They plan to rule this case
as a violent break-in.

668
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,600
Mr. Zhan was old.

669
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,679
Even if it's a robbery,

670
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,600
he wouldn't be able to fight back at all.

671
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:19,479
Sir, you think
the break-in is just a ruse?

672
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,399
The killer created a scene

673
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,120
of break-in the moment Mr. Zhan

674
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
wished to see me.

675
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,199
He doesn't want me
to see Mr. Zhan at all.

676
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,280
The entire Zhan Family consists
of Mr. Zhan and his servant.

677
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,439
Now that the whole family is gone,
without a plaintiff,

678
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,040
the Fengjing Prefecture

679
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,000
will just close the case hastily.

680
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:38,959
What do you think?

681
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:42,360
Even though the interior bears
the markings of a break-in,

682
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,040
but right after Mr. Zhan sent someone

683
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,280
to tell you that your father's death
was not what it seemed to be,

684
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,199
he died to robbers.

685
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,280
The timing is uncanny.

686
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:56,199
It seems like there's more to
my father's death.

687
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,080
We have to investigate this case ourselves.

688
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Check

689
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,719
who else entered

690
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,000
Mr. Zhan's residence

691
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,479
or who met with the servant.

692
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,639
Mr. Zhan's plan to tell me
the secret of my father's death

693
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,679
was an impromptu decision.

694
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,959
If the killer could get hold of it,

695
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,439
it means he must have contacted

696
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,360
Mr. Zhan or his servant today.

697
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:13,719
Noted.

698
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:26,719
Sir, the group of bandits
has committed many robberies.

699
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,399
I have marked on this map the spots

700
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:31,080
of their recent activities.

701
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,959
Sir.

702
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,080
Miss Qiu Min has been waiting for you.

703
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,560
It rained yesterday.

704
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,600
She knows you didn't bring any
warm clothes

705
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:43,159
so she brought you some.

706
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,479
Both of you must be

707
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,120
deeply in love.

708
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,439
I'll leave you two be.

709
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:53,080
Qin...

710
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,399
Beixue. Carry on, please.

711
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:04,520
Sir.

712
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,280
The bandits frequent the path
to the feet of Huilong Mountain.

713
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,600
It's the only shortcut we have
that leads to Northern Liang.

714
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,679
It is very far from the Capital.

715
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,479
The woods are filled
with beasts and pests.

716
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,199
They must have a secret hideout.

717
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,439
Otherwise, they can't rest up
or stash the stolen goods away.

718
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,280
But

719
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,040
where do they hide?

720
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,679
I know where it is.

721
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,560
Back then, to locate where
the Empyrean Fairy appeared,

722
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,679
Song Jin searched Huilong Mountain.

723
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:39,600
I was there.

724
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,239
There are many caves over there

725
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,360
and they are all connected.

726
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,760
It's a perfect hideout.

727
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,560
I believe the bandits
must be hiding there.

728
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,000
I can show you the place, Qin Xuan.

729
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,879
The bandits are only three to four.

730
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:55,360
They shouldn't be able to establish
a base in the mountain.

731
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:58,919
They might be hiding in the caves

732
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:01,760
like what Miss Qiu Min said.

733
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,479
Impossible.

734
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,919
The cave tunnels are connected
to a subterranean stream.

735
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
It's rainy season now

736
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,479
so the tunnels should be flooded.

737
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,800
A temporary stay
will pose enough problems,

738
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,439
let alone squatting there.

739
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,600
Qiu Min.

740
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,879
If you don't know anything,
don't offer your opinion.
