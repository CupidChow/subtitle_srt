18
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,480
(Qiu Residence)
If being your daughter means

19
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,360
I have to accept 
my mother died mysteriously,

20
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,279
then no.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,239
You...

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,239
Uncle Qiu, calm down, please.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,199
You...

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,759
Stop her!

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
Old Madam Qiu, Official Qiu.

26
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,559
I don't wish to go to extremes.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,759
However,

28
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,520
you won't be keeping her here today.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,360
Are you coming?

30
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:39,639
Fine,

31
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,600
I'll go by myself.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,088
(Hall of Nostalgia)

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Yan'er!

34
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,559
Old Madam, Uncle Qiu.

35
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,679
Qiu Yan behaved rashly
because she was in so much grief.

36
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,440
I hope you won't blame her.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
Mother,

38
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,880
I'm incompetent.

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,880
I fail to stop Qiu Yan.

40
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,039
Qiu Yan,

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,039
what do you plan to do next?

42
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,000
Lodge a complaint
at Fengjing Prefecture.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,119
That can wait.

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,479
What about tonight?

45
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,240
Where are you going to spend the night?

46
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,800
My residence has a courtyard.

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,279
Why don't you spend the night
at my residence?

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,960
If the Qiu family looks for Qiu Yan,

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,679
the Duke Ying Residence
will be the first under fire.

50
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,440
When that time comes,

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
your parents
will be put in a difficult spot.

52
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,520
I can persuade my parents.

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,160
Qin Xuan,

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,880
it's inconvenient for me to stay
at the Duke Ying Residence.

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,320
Help me find an inn.

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,440
How can a girl like you stay

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,960
at the inn alone?

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
No one can help you if anything happens.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,720
Firewood Office has a room.

60
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,040
Qiu Yi,

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,600
how could you
let Qiu Yan leave like that?

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,679
With that temperament of hers,

63
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,359
she'll turn the world upside down.

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
Maybe tomorrow morning...

65
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,920
She'll go to
the Admonishment Drum Court.

66
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,640
Qiu Hong is right.

67
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,880
We don't know
how she's going to vilify the family.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,279
Let her do whatever she wants.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,720
She said she wanted the truth.

70
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,200
Let the Fengjing Prefecture
find the truth.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
So we may as well

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,559
prove the Qiu family's innocence.

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,440
Lest people say that we oppress
the younger generation

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,679
and cover up everything.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,959
All right. There's no need

76
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,440
for all of you to stay up.

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,440
Go back and rest.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,200
We know we're innocent.

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,839
A girl like her

80
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,920
can't cause huge trouble.

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,200
Since you've said that,

82
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,079
we're now relieved.

83
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,600
We hope you and Qiu Yi
will find solace.

84
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,359
We'll take our leave.

85
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,559
You should retire too.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,000
Mother,

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,079
were you involved

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,799
in Han's death?

89
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,040
Why?

90
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,040
Are you doubting me too?

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,120
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Mother
in the Qiu Family, Han Ruogu)

(Firewood Office)

93
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,600
Have a seat first.
I'll help you clean up the room.

94
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,359
I know you're heartbroken.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,600
There's no else here.

96
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,239
If you want to cry,

97
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,880
just cry.

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,440
I don't have time to cry.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,239
Qiu Yan,

100
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,320
are you seriously going to lodge
a complaint at Fengjing Prefecture?

101
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,320
I can't sit by and watch them
murder my mother.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,799
What if Uncle Qiu told the truth

103
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,079
about the physician
making a false claim?

104
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,600
What was the physician's motive

105
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
to make a false claim?

106
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,799
Saying it's a false claim is groundless.

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Qin Xuan, do you not believe me too?

108
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,640
When you investigated He Feng's death

109
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,720
and the fake notes,

110
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,519
I've always believed in your judgment.

111
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,079
Your deductions
have always been accurate.

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
Every time I see you find out the truth,

113
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,079
I'm impressed and happy for you.

114
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,880
But this time,

115
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,480
I don't want to believe

116
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,519
nor be willing to let what you think
is true.

117
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,720
I hope you're wrong.

118
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,559
Aunt Qiu's death

119
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,679
has nothing to do with the Qiu family.

120
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:21,959
Why?

121
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
Do you think I'm rebellious
against my family?

122
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,760
You already lost your mother.

123
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
I don't want to see
you lose your family too.

124
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
After Mother passed away,

125
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,000
this home meant nothing to me.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,159
You're saying that now.

127
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,840
But you're obviously suffering.

128
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,880
How I wished

129
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,559
you didn't find out this.

130
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,400
You didn't have to suffer such treatment

131
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,119
and torment.

132
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Many truths in this world

133
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,159
are already tormenting.

134
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,919
But I'm willing to be tormented

135
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,119
than lie to myself my whole life.

136
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,159
It's getting late. You should go home.

137
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,799
Lest your parents worry about you.

138
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,599
Get some rest.

139
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,960
Lord Liang?

140
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,919
I was on a night patrol

141
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,200
and passing by.

142
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,320
Why are you still awake?

143
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,520
I wanted to see you.

144
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,200
This is what I wrote for the complaint.

145
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,960
Please look at it, Lord Liang.

146
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,679
I didn't have the chance
to ask you in the day.

147
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,080
Has it ever occurred to you

148
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,559
that if you don't lodge the complaint

149
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,159
and mourn for three years,

150
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,159
Qin Xuan will still be committed to you,

151
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,760
and the Qin family's attitude
towards you

152
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
will soften over time?

153
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,919
However,

154
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,760
if your doing

155
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,280
causes a huge scandal,

156
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,760
I'm afraid the Qin family

157
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
will misunderstand you even more.

158
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,039
Madam Han wasn't your birth mother.

159
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Is it worth gambling on your future

160
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,599
for her?

161
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,200
Mother

162
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,080
was not my birth mother.

163
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,840
But she let me know

164
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,200
that there's someone who cares

165
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,080
about me in this world.

166
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,960
When I wanted to learn
how to read and write,

167
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,280
she taught me patiently.

168
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,039
I like reading investigative stories,

169
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:26,200
she searched them for me
behind my father's back.

170
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,880
This is for you.

171
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,640
I just got it.

172
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,080
It's a new arrival at the bookshop.

173
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
I knew you've been reading it.

174
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,039
Once you're at the He family,

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,960
you'd feel uneasy and anxious

176
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,840
if you don't get the new book.

177
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,039
The warmth

178
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,000
that she gave me was something

179
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,840
I'd never gotten from my birth mother.

180
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,559
I thought life

181
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,320
was still long ahead.

182
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,239
I thought I could keep accompanying her.

183
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,159
When she grows old,

184
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,320
I can repay all the love

185
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,479
she has given to me.

186
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,640
But now...

187
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,039
Avenging her death

188
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,840
is my only wish now.

189
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,440
Relationships,

190
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,039
men, or the future

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,239
are not important.

192
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Lord Liang,

193
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,919
you shouldn't have involved yourself.

194
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,840
You've offended the Qiu family
because of me.

195
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,320
It'll only bring more obstacles

196
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,200
to your marriage with Min'er.

197
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,159
Six years ago,

198
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,679
my father was murdered too.

199
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,359
At that time,

200
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:56,760
I was only a son of an official.

201
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,080
I had no power or influence

202
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
to avenge my father.

203
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
At that time,

204
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,479
I suffered from regret and remorse

205
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
every day and night.

206
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,000
How I wished

207
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,280
I could destroy heaven.

208
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,440
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Husband,
Liang Yuansu)

209
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,599
No one can truly understand how it feels

210
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,359
if they don't experience it themselves.

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,719
I understand.

212
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,159
Other than wording mistakes,

213
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,359
there's a huge loophole.

214
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,760
Why would Old Madam
want to kill your mother?

215
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,799
According to the Qiu family,

216
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
their relationship

217
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,640
had always been friendly.

218
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
She has no motive to kill.

219
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,679
What if she's only an accomplice?

220
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,159
The other Qiu members and concubines
may have harbored resentments.

221
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,760
Maybe

222
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,840
one of them is the murderer.

223
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,159
When Old Madam found out,

224
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,440
she could only choose to cover up

225
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,880
to protect the Qiu family's reputation.

226
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,359
There's one thing
that doesn't make sense.

227
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,440
Since Old Madam colluded
with Li Zhengyuan,

228
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,799
it shows she knew about this earlier.

229
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,919
She had the chance to warn the murderer

230
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,119
instead of assisting with everything.

231
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,960
Maybe

232
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,359
the murderer has something on Old Madam.

233
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,640
But Old Madam is shrewd enough

234
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,719
to think of a big picture.

235
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,359
Would she have an unspeakable secret?

236
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,840
It'll lead to nowhere

237
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,479
if we just guess.

238
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,280
To find the answer,

239
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,039
we need to investigate further.

240
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,960
I know!

241
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,119
Investigate the apothecary.

242
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,039
Physician Li

243
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,119
said my mother was poisoned
by red safflower.

244
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,559
We'll start from the red safflower
of the apothecary.

245
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,479
No matter where we start investigating,

246
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
you should get some sleep now.

247
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,000
Only with an energized mind,

248
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,239
you can investigate well.

249
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,159
But I can't sleep

250
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,159
at this moment.

251
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,200
My Lord,

252
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,000
can you let me make changes
to my complaint here

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,880
and organize my thoughts?

254
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,799
In case something confuses me,

255
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,640
I can ask you anytime.

256
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:16,640
All right.

257
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,679
I still have official documents
to look through anyway.

258
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,080
I'll keep you company.

259
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,439
Mother.

260
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:58,880
Don't go.

261
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,719
Mother.

262
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:25,590
(Qin Residence)

263
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,239
If Mother asks where I go,

264
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,599
you know what to say, right?

265
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,119
Young Master, I thought you
didn't want Miss Qiu Yan

266
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,439
to find out anything.

267
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,800
Why are you going with her?

268
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,520
I don't want to see her sad.

269
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,439
But anything that she wants to do,

270
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,719
I'll accompany her

271
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,520
even if I don't agree to it.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,599
Young Master! Young Master!

273
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,640
Young Master,
something bad has happened.

274
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,160
Madam has chest pain out of a sudden.

275
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Please go and see Madam.

276
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,359
I'm going to fetch the physician now.

277
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,160
Master, Official Yuan is here.

278
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,479
May I know what brings Mr. Yuan here

279
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,239
so early in the morning?

280
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,880
There's something

281
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,000
I want to show Official Lin.

282
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,599
Official Lin, this memorial
is for His Majesty.

283
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You mustn't dirty it.

284
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,640
If I may be bold...

285
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,640
May I be bold enough to ask
what do you request of me?

286
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,359
I beg you to have mercy and let me go.

287
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,319
Well, that's easy.

288
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,599
But

289
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,640
it's such a huge deficit.

290
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,199
Official Li, you need
to find someone accountable.

291
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,720
(Qiu)

292
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,359
Di'er.

293
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Di'er, open the door.

294
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,719
Mother, you're here.

295
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,239
I bought your favorite lotus root cake

296
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,719
for you this morning.

297
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,839
It's still warm.
Eat it while it's still hot.

298
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,439
I have no mood to eat cakes right now.

299
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,719
Something bad has happened here.

300
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,079
That mad Qiu Yan

301
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,239
is lodging a complaint
at the Fengjing Prefecture.

302
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,599
If the Fengjing Prefecture
investigates Han's death,

303
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,160
we won't get away with it.

304
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,359
Old Madam won't be able
to protect us then.

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
I manage to sneak out
behind your father's back.

306
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,599
There's no time to waste.

307
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,959
We must leave now.

308
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,000
But where can we go?

309
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,000
No matter where it is,

310
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,520
we must leave the capital city.

311
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
The further, the better.

312
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,520
I brought enough money for the journey.

313
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,199
It's enough for our expenses
in the future.

314
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,479
But Mother,

315
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,760
you've worked so hard
and suffered so many grievances

316
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,719
in the Qiu family for decades.

317
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,599
For what?

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,119
Isn't it for us to have some

319
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,239
of the Qiu family's wealth?

320
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,680
If you just walk away,

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,880
it's not worth it.

322
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,439
Moreover, the Fengjing Prefecture

323
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,760
may not find out that we were behind it.

324
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,719
Di'er,

325
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,599
I know you're not content.

326
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,000
But this is about life and death.

327
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,479
There's no room for any chances.

328
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:26,920
Listen to me.

329
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,000
We must leave

330
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,000
and get out of the city today.

331
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,359
Let's go.

332
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,199
You're not going anywhere.

333
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,000
Fourth Aunt, I've misjudged you.

334
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,199
How did... How did you find this place?

335
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,359
We've investigated every apothecary
in the city.

336
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,680
Someone has been purchasing
red safflower everywhere recently.

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,640
One of the shopkeepers of the apothecary

338
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,920
mentioned someone

339
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,439
with a black mole on the chin.

340
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought of you at that moment.

341
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,479
You return to the city
after studying away from home.

342
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,119
Yet, you sneak around here

343
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,760
instead of going home.

344
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,520
So it was to kill our family.

345
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,239
What happens next is simple.

346
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,239
You stayed at some inn
instead of Qiu Residence.

347
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,640
With that mole of yours,

348
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,880
it's easy to find you
after some investigation.

349
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,239
Who are you?

350
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,439
Song Jin.

351
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,359
Take him away.

352
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,079
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

353
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,640
- Mother.
- Di'er.

354
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:17,599
Mother.

355
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,040
Please...

356
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,319
You can speak now.

357
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,959
It's all

358
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,400
Qiu Min's fault.

359
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,199
She ratted on me to Old Madam

360
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:40,400
and Old Madam found out
about Di'er real birth.

361
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,239
I wrote a letter

362
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,959
to tell Di'er, who was studying away
from home.

363
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,000
That's why he sneaked back to the city,

364
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,760
planning the way out with me

365
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,439
for the future.

366
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,760
Was your way out to poison my mother?

367
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,319
Qiu Yan, you got it wrong.

368
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
I bought the red safflowers

369
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,520
not to poison Second Aunt to death,

370
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:57,719
but to...

371
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,680
But...

372
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:00,719
Speak.

373
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,839
It was to set you and Qiu Min.

374
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,479
Di'er handed the red safflower

375
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,719
and asked me to add it
into the plum wine.

376
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,000
And find a chance
to make you two drink it.

377
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,959
But I never wanted to kill anyone.

378
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,719
I just wanted to teach you two a lesson.

379
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,160
As I know,

380
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,439
you won't die

381
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,359
from a small dosage of red safflower.

382
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,239
It'll only...

383
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,319
It'll only cause great damage
to a woman's body.

384
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,760
If serious,

385
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,119
it'll be difficult
to conceive children for life.

386
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,359
If it's as you've said,

387
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,359
how did my mother die
from red safflower poison?

388
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,640
I really don't know.

389
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,280
I only brought the red safflower
back home

390
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,479
and hid it in my room.

391
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
But it disappeared one day.

392
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,719
I had no idea who took it.

393
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,479
I dare not make it public.

394
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,680
It was until you caused a scene
with Old Madam yesterday

395
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,520
that I found out

396
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,920
your mother died
from red safflower poison.

397
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,479
You're saying as if you're innocent

398
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,680
and have done nothing wrong.

399
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,839
Why did you try to flee
with Qiu Di today, then?

400
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:02,839
I knew

401
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,079
Di'er and I

402
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,800
can never prove our innocence
no matter what we say.

403
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,760
If we don't flee,

404
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,319
can we

405
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,439
still live in the future?

406
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,160
I don't believe
a single word Madam Mi said.

407
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,479
The only possible killer is her.

408
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,560
Min'er and I ruined Qiu Di's future.

409
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,280
So she revenges it on my mother.

410
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,880
If it was Madam Mi,

411
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,400
what kind of information does she have

412
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,000
on Old Madam, then?

413
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,400
Well...

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,439
I haven't figured it out yet.

415
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,199
There's one more doubt.

416
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,400
I just couldn't figure it out.

417
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,520
Li Zhengyuan said your mother

418
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,079
had symptoms of internal heat,

419
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,760
but her pulse was normal.

420
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,439
How do we explain this, then?

421
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,719
Other than the red safflower poison,

422
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,160
they must have secretly fed

423
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,920
my mother

424
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,359
some other medicine before that.

425
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,160
It was to create the illusion
of my mother's strange disease.

426
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,119
By doing this,

427
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,719
no one would doubt
if she died from an illness.

428
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,119
Where are the other medicine, then?

429
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,199
Sir,

430
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,079
let me torture them for a bit.

431
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm sure they'll reveal everything.

432
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,520
It's not the Firewood Office's case.

433
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,880
A public case has its own rules.

434
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Even if you have to use punishment,

435
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,439
you can only carry it out at prisons
like Fengjing Prefecture and above.

436
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,000
The findings
through personal investigation

437
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
are not only invalid.

438
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,959
We could also be charged
for abuse of power.

439
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,599
Since we have the proof

440
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,959
of Madam Mi and Qiu Di's purchase
of red safflower,

441
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,560
as well as Li Zhengyuan's testimony,

442
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,680
I'll bring this matter
to Fengjing Prefecture.

443
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,640
Only by forcing the Old Madam

444
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,880
to confront me on the spot

445
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:27,359
can we know the whole truth.

446
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,160
But there are still many things

447
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,839
that are not clear yet.

448
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,839
Besides, I have
a royal court meeting tomorrow.

449
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,920
It can't be delayed anymore.

450
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,839
Madam Mi and Qiu Di
almost escaped today.

451
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,839
If Old Madam finds out
Madam Mi hadn't returned all night,

452
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,160
she'll definitely be alert.

453
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,079
You can attend your royal court meeting.

454
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:40,880
I'll go myself.

455
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,439
You mustn't.

456
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,800
The longer we drag this on,

457
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,680
the more time they have
to cover up their crimes.

458
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,719
Sir, how about

459
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,319
I go with Miss Qiu Yan?

460
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:04,839
Lord Liang,

461
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,280
can I speak to you in private?

462
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,719
Lord Liang, Qiu Yan has left home
for two days now.

463
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,599
I don't know where
she has spent the nights.

464
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,680
Qiu Yan is staying in a wing room
at the Firewood Office.

465
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,800
She's safe.

466
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,400
Official Qiu, you can rest assured.

467
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,479
All right.

468
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,359
If Qiu Yan needs anything,

469
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,680
please inform me.

470
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I have someone send it over.

471
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,599
Your love for your daughter is deep.

472
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,520
I'll convey the message.

473
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,479
However,

474
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,680
I still need to remind you.

475
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,199
The one you're betrothed with

476
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
isn't Qiu Yan,

477
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,520
but Qiu Min.

478
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,239
I hope you can be considerate of Min'er.

479
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,199
His Majesty decreed

480
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,920
that today's royal court meeting
is canceled!

481
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,760
His Majesty summons the presence
of Inspector Liang Yi of Firewood Office

482
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,839
at the Imperial Study!

483
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,960
(Fengjing Prefecture)

484
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,817
(Fengjing Prefecture)

485
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
Liang Yi,

486
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,280
I heard it's been chaotic

487
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,199
at your future father-in-law's home
for the past few days.

488
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,880
What happened?

489
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,160
Your Majesty,

490
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,719
Official Qiu's wife died

491
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,680
of a strange cause.

492
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,040
The daughter, Qiu Yan

493
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,880
finds it strange. So she left home
to investigate the case

494
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,160
after a slight disagreement
with the family.

495
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,680
If I'm not mistaken,

496
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,079
the Qiu family's second daughter

497
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,280
was betrothed to the He family's son.

498
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,040
The marriage was annulled after that.

499
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,079
Your sister-in-law

500
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,839
is really something.

501
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,560
I heard

502
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,400
the Qiu family's Second Young Lady
has always been deviant.

503
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,000
She refused to preserve her chastity
after her husband's death before this.

504
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,079
Now she's taking her grandmother
to Fengjing Prefecture.

505
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,439
I didn't expect that Lord Liang,

506
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:35,000
who has always been self-restraint
and self-respect

507
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,040
allowed his sister-in-law

508
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,079
to behave recklessly.

509
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,959
Not only did you hide Qiu Yan
at the Firewood Office,

510
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,760
but you also mobilized
Firewood Office's men

511
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,040
to investigate all apothecaries
and inns in the city.

512
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,000
Treating the Firewood Office as your own

513
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,719
is an abuse of power.

514
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,959
Is what Official Yuan said

515
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,880
true?

516
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,920
Sir, I'm innocent.

518
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,560
Please investigate this thoroughly.

519
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,079
Sir,

520
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,880
we've brought Old Madam Qiu
and Official Qiu Yi here.

521
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,719
Sir.

522
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,920
Old Madam, rise and speak.

523
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,680
Sir, I did order someone
to take the red safflower.

524
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,119
Go on.

525
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
My fourth son

526
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,599
has the habit of stealing.

527
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:39,160
He even stole something
from my room too.

528
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,040
As a precaution,

529
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I arranged a maid at the fourth chamber.

530
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,479
I had her observe every move
of the people of the fourth chamber.

531
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,319
She was the one who found out

532
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,079
Mi hiding red safflower

533
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,239
and notified me first thing.

534
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,560
So I told her to steal the red safflower

535
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,959
for my safekeeping.

536
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,560
I wanted to deal with Mi

537
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,160
after Han's funeral was over.

538
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,359
But I didn't expect

539
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,119
Qiu Yan would get involved.

540
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,760
In this case,

541
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,439
the biggest suspect

542
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,959
is you, then.

543
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,479
My granddaughter claims

544
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,680
that someone used red safflower
to poison my daughter-in-law.

545
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,359
But this statement

546
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,479
is the biggest joke ever.

547
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,880
What do you mean?

548
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,119
Please lend me
a set of cooking utensils.

549
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:46,119
Bring forth the cooking utensils.

550
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,880
Everyone knows

551
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,520
that a small dose of red safflower
can cause miscarriage

552
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:59,000
and a higher dose is fatal.

553
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,719
But few people know that the lethal dose

554
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:05,400
far exceeds the dose
that causes people to miscarry.

555
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
So

556
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,160
red safflower can cause miscarriage.

557
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,000
But to use it to kill someone...

558
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,439
May I ask you this?

559
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
When you see a bowl like this,

560
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,719
would any sane person be willing

561
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,479
to drink this?

562
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,680
If you don't believe,

563
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,000
you can summon the physician
and ask him.

564
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,359
Qiu Yan, what else do you have to say?

565
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,920
What if someone forced my mother
to drink the poison?

566
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,119
Official Tong,

567
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,599
if someone forced her to drink poison,

568
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,040
she would have told me
before she passed.

569
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,760
I hope you can investigate
this thoroughly.

570
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,640
Yan'er,

571
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:04,160
if you still think of me as your father,

572
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,839
stop harassing others endlessly.

573
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:06,920
Come home.

574
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,239
I won't allow you

575
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,959
to further taint your mother's funeral.

576
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,760
Sir, I still have a witness.

577
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,400
You...

578
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:17,079
Physician Li Zhengyuan
who treated my mother's illness

579
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,239
told me himself

580
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,199
that there were signs
of red safflower poisoning

581
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,239
on my mother's body after she passed.

582
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,560
It wasn't caused by
an infectious disease.

583
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,119
The so-called infectious disease

584
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,119
was Old Madam told him to make it up.

585
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,119
Summon Li Zhengyuan for questioning.

586
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,040
Summon Li Zhengyuan!

587
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,880
I, Li Zhengyuan at your presence, Sir.

588
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,640
Li Zhengyuan,

589
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,839
did you see signs of poisoning

590
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,479
on Han's body?

591
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,599
Don't be scared.

592
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,479
Just repeat

593
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,680
what you told me.

594
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,119
I'll assure your safety.

595
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,520
With me on your side,

596
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,520
just speak without worries.

597
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,839
Sir, I...

598
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,439
I never said

599
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:15,479
Madam Han died from safflower poisoning.

600
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,359
So did Old Madam Qiu

601
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,839
tell you to make up Han's illness?

602
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,359
No either.

603
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,199
That was not what you told me!

604
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,959
Sir, please uphold justice for me!

605
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,199
It was because Miss Qiu Yan

606
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,400
and Lord Liang of Firewood Office

607
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,839
intimidated me

608
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,199
and even used my daughter
to threaten me.

609
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,880
I had no choice

610
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
and was scared.

611
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,439
That's why I just spout nonsense

612
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,680
as they wanted.

613
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,959
Do you know the consequence of lying
at the court hall?

614
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I know.

615
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,680
But I'm telling the truth

616
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,640
and not a single lie.

617
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:53,760
Liang Yi,

618
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,479
do you have anything to explain?

619
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,359
I couldn't bear to see my mother-in-law
die of an unknown cause.

620
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,839
That was why I mobilized
the Firewood Office's men thoughtlessly.

621
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,239
I can't defend myself.

622
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I deserved to be punished.

623
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
You have a betrothal
with the Qiu family.

624
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,879
It is only normal

625
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
to help them out.

626
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,639
However, no more next time.

627
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,919
During the mourning period
of the Qiu's Young Ladies,

628
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,800
you are not to meddle
in the Qiu family's affairs anymore.

629
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,840
Rise.

630
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,399
Thank you, Your Majesty.

631
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,040
Shouldn't we do something

632
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,159
about Official Liang using
the physician's daughter

633
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,280
to threaten him to be a witness?

634
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,959
I'll have the men

635
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,439
to release Li Zhengyuan's daughter.

636
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,719
No need.

637
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,360
I've already sent someone to free her.

638
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,120
Eunuch Liu.

639
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,320
Father!

640
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,239
My child!

641
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,120
Are you all right?

642
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm fine. Are you all right?

643
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,280
Li Zhengyuan,

644
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,959
I've returned your daughter to you

645
00:34:58,959 --> 00:34:59,840
safe and sound.

646
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,239
Song Jin,

647
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,760
when the hearing is over.

648
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,360
Don't stop them from going home.

649
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,399
Do you hear me?

650
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,360
Yes.

651
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,840
Now, the case is clear.

652
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,399
I'll announce my verdict.

653
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:16,320
According to law and order,

654
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,360
Qiu Yan's complaint
against the Qiu family

655
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,719
for the murder of her mother

656
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,600
is a false charge.

657
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,679
According to the law,

658
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,719
whoever falsely accuses their relatives
will be punished.

659
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,959
I'll sentence you to 20 floggings.

660
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,120
Sir, Qiu Yan couldn't control herself

661
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,600
due to her grief.

662
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,399
That's why she cause a scene here.

663
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,760
A punishment of twenty floggings
on a young lady

664
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,600
is too harsh.

665
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:38,159
I can't bear that to happen.

666
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,760
I hope you can show her some mercy.

667
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,040
Since Old Madam Qiu pleaded for you.

668
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,439
Never mind, then.

669
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,600
As a last kindness from me,
seeing you're grieving from your loss,

670
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,760
I'll save you from the pain of flogging.

671
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,239
I'll punish you to recite
the Filial Piety Commandment

672
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,080
at the entrance
of Qiu Residence 1000 times.

673
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,719
Court is dismissed!

674
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,719
- Thank you for your mercy, Sir.
- Thank you for your mercy, Sir.

675
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,080
Mother, do you still have chest pain?

676
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,199
Luckily, you were here.

677
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:25,600
Young Master!

678
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:26,719
It's bad! The Fengjing Prefecture...

679
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,080
What?

680
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,199
My chest is hurting again.

681
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,280
Mother, stop pretending already.

682
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,560
Since your aunt sent someone
to inform me

683
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,600
that Qiu Yan lodge a complaint
against Old Madam,

684
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,439
I knew you wouldn't sit still.

685
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,560
I won't allow you to get into this mess.

686
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,360
Stop right there!

687
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,600
If you dare step out of the house today,

688
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,080
I'll ask your father
to beat you to death.

689
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:04,879
You can punish me anyhow you want.

690
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,479
You...

691
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:22,036
(Qiu Residence)

692
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,840
Kneel.

693
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,080
Start reciting.

694
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,520
Qin Xuan?

695
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,080
Mr. Qin,

696
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,719
the law is strict.

697
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,360
I suggest you don't look for trouble.

698
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,239
I'm fine.

699
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,199
Qin Xuan, what are you doing?

700
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,479
I'll accompany you.

701
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,199

713

What are you two still standing there?

714
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,679
Close the doors.

715

"You shall not move
when your parents are present."

716
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,320
Yes, First Young Lady.

717
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,600
You should be punished
for your mistakes.

718

728
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,719
Second Madam is no longer here.

729
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,719
Madam Liu doesn't dote
on Second Young Lady at all.

730
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,959
She even called her a disgrace.

731
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,360
She refused to look at her.

732
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,199
No one is standing up for her now.

733
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,399
Third Young Lady,
can you plead Second Master?

734
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,399
Qiu Yan is a stubborn person.

735
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,320
It's harder for her to kneel

736
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,360
and admit her mistake than to kill her.

737
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,239
However, this was a punishment
by the Fengjing Prefecture.

738
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,239
It'll be in vain even if I go.

You're done, Qiu Yan.

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,800
You've recited 1000 times.

762
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,199
She has recited 1000 times.

763
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,959
I think there are two more times.

764
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,000
Mr. Qin, don't try to trick us.

765
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,760
I've counted it very clearly!

766
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,919
All right.

767
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,919
If Mr. Qin said, it's 1000 times,
1000 times it is, then.

768
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Let's go back and report this.

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,600
Be careful.

You've returned?

Yan'er,

785
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,120
are you hurt?

786
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,479
You're still young.

787
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,439
If it hurts, you should say it hurts.

788
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:52,080
Mother, it doesn't matter how it hurts

789
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,439
as long as you're with me.

790
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,560
Yan'er,

791
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,919
I can't stay by your side.

792
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,520
You have to take care of yourself
from now on.

793
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,760
You mustn't force yourself
to be tough in everything,

794
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,639
understand?

795
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,399
Take care of yourself.

796
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,280
Mother.

797
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:11,239
Take care of yourself.

00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,360
How did I get in here?

801
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,280
You fainted at the entrance.

802
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:35,600
Qingdai and Qiu Min carried you in.

803
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,800
Otherwise, you'll have
to keep suffering.

804
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,399
As a girl,

805
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
don't you feel ashamed at all?

806
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:48,560
Come and eat something.

807
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:57,959
Where are you going?

808
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:02,000
Li Zhengyuan changed his statement
at the court because he was threatened.

809
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,399
I...

810
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,840
I'm going to make a complaint
to the emperor.

811
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,760
You never learned your lesson.

812
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,959
Is it not enough to be punished
at the entrance?

813
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:13,840
I couldn't go out all day
because I was too ashamed.

814
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,199
Yan'er, your legitimate mother
has passed.

815
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,040
But your birth mother still lives.

816
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,280
She's not like you.

817
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,679
How different?

818
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,520
Even if we're different,

819
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,639
I'm still better than she was.

820
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,000
I forbid you to say that about Mother.

821
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:31,760
Do you think your legitimate mother

822
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,840
was the world's most noble
and gentle woman?

823
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,159
Listen.

824
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,360
She was just an ordinary woman.

825
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:40,320
She can't be compared to one.

826
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,280
I dare you to say that again.

827
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,439
I'm going to say it anyway.

828
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,000
I bet you never knew

829
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:46,120
that she was actually

830
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,080
