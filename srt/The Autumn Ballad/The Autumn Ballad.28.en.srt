You can let it all out here.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,039
Madam, you may leave me be.

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,160

28
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,759
you don't like to see me.

29
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,240
But now,

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,880
both your mother

31
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,039

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,800
You, Rong'er, and I are the only ones
left in the second chamber.

33
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,320
Whatever the case is,

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,960
I must take care of you.

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
Otherwise, when it's
finally my time to go,

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,399
I'll be ashamed to even
face my husband.

(Memorial Tablet of

38
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,199
You should behave yourself.

39
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,479
Mourn your loss at home

40
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:45,360
and have a grand wedding
when you're married to Qin Xuan.

41
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,320
That should put my lord's mind to ease.

42

43
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,559

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,359

Ping'er?

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
His Majesty has pardoned many inmates.

51
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,760
Of course she's free now.

52
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,679

53

Are you alright?

54
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,559
I told you,

55
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,440
to avenge my father,

56
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,640
I will hunt you down
to the edge of the world!

57

Liang Yi.

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,480
My family fell apart because of you.

59

Ping'er.

60
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,799
Hear me out.

61
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,119
The law is absolute.

62
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,000
By the law,

63
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,119
your father embezzled the state's fund.

64
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,359
His whole family would be executed.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,119
Without firm evidence,

66
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,959
why would I raid your home?

67
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,079
But if you insist on
taking your revenge,

68
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,359
brush up your fighting skill.

69
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll wait.

70
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,239

71
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,920

72

Why can't you open your eyes?

79
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
Think about the luxurious life you had.

80
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,279

82

His Majesty pardoned you.

83

This is your chance to start a new life.

84
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,839
Let it go.

85
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,200
Begin a new life.

86

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,920

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,443
(Liang Residence)

175
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
(Liang Residence)
Physician, how is he?

176
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,159
Don't worry.

177
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,200
I've let him inhale
the painkiller incense.

178
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,520
(Spring Hill)
It helps him rest.

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,400
You managed to suck
the poison out in time.

180
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,919
Otherwise, the poison would have spread.

181
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,080
He's survived the worst part of it.

182
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,280
All there is to have attentive care

183
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,440
and prevent infection and gangrene.

184
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,679
I'll check on him tomorrow.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,799
Thank you, sir.

186
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,280
I'll walk the physician
to the Firewood Office.

187
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,159
I leave Lord Liang in your care.

188
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Please.

189
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,479
Please get well.

190
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,599
Please.

191
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,640
Don't worry.

192
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,599
I'll live.

193
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,479
You said...

194
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,840
you'd always be my...

195
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:41,919
Don't go.

196
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,719
I'm not leaving.

197
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,760
Does it hurt a lot?

198
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,559
No.

199
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,599
Liar.

200
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,559
Just say so if it hurts.

201
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,159
Does it hurt?

202
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,520
No.

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,719
I see it now.

204
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,640
Watching someone get hurt

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,919
is worse than getting hurt myself.

206
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,440
Was it

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,760
as painful for you
when you saw my wound?

208
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,200
No.

209
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,760
You wouldn't be as scared.

210
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,400
I thought

211
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,760
there was nothing

212
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,679
I'd ever fear again.

213
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,440
But I am terrified right now.

214
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,520
I'm scared that you might leave me.

215
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,760
I might not hear your voice again.

216
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,159
I'm so scared that I might
never see your poker face again.

217
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,559
Don't you dare leave like this.

218
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I have so many things

219
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,960
to tell you.

220
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,359
(When I was in the Marquis Residence,)

221
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,760
(it felt like a dream,)

222
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,559
(a dream)

223
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,280
(of a place called "Home.")

224
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,440
(Please.)

225
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,919
(Don't die.)

226
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,640
(I don't want to wake up)

227
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,640
(from this dream just yet.)

228
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,919
You're awake.

229
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,080
Is the wound still hurting?

230
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,599
Slowly.

231
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,559
Help me up.

232
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,119
Come.

233
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,159
Does it hurt?

234
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:44,640
Yes.

235
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,679
Has the fever receded?

236
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,520
I heard everything

237
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
you said last night.

238
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,520
I should get a physician
to check your wound.

239
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,560
I won't let you down.

240
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,839
But how will you repay me?

241
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,319
Forget it.

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's no big deal.

243
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,520
It was just an assassination.

244
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,280
I should check on him.

245
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,479
He might need something.

246
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,319
Never mind. It's just a minor wound.

247
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,959
Let's leave.

248
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,199
I never said anything like that.

249
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,599
Are you going back on your words?

250
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,439
The physician let you inhale
the painkiller incense.

251
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,479
You must be dreaming.

252
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,040
I never said that.

253
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:36,959
Where are you going?

254
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,640
I need to use the restroom.

255
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,520
I've been sitting still the whole night.

256
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,959
Well? How do you feel?

257
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:43,839
I'm alright.

258
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,560
It's been weeks.

259
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,719
The physician says you're
making a good recovery,

260
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:30,920
so why is it still hurting?

261
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,680
No sickness heals that easily.
We should be patient.

262
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,199
What if it takes forever to heal?

263
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,680
So be it.

264
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,920
It can't be helped.

265
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,400
Your right arm was shot.

266
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,439
You need your right arm

267
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,920
for everything in your life.

268
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:50,959
Indeed.

269
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,319
So, you should be worried.

270
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,079
If it didn't get well,

271
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,079
would you still look after me?

272
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,839
What is that supposed to mean?

273
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,079
Is that a no?

274
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,239
Whatever it is,

275
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,959
you need to get well.

276
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,719
I want some tea.

277
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,719
It's right here.

278
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,160
Your left arm is perfectly fine.

279
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,400
I held the cup with my right hand.

280
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,680
Delicious.

281
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,839
I'd like to have some lychees.

282
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
Can you be more thoughtful?

283
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,680
Fine.

284
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,439
I don't eat the skin.

285
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:49,760
Sure.

286
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,119
Lord Liang, should I feed it to you?

287
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,560
If you don't think
I'm a good caretaker,

288
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,160
then you should get well immediately.

289
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,839
This is sweet.

290
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,640
When I went to the palace,

291
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,760
Her Highness asked about your injury.

292
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,359
His Majesty knew

293
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,040
you were attacked by an enemy
from the previous investigation.

294
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,839
He is really concerned about you.

295
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,520
Yi'er.

296
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,560
Could you use this opportunity

297
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,719
and request to be transferred?

298
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
You have a family with you now.

299
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,760
You must leave the fighting behind you.

300
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,959
Even if it's not for me,

301
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,760
you should do it for Wan'er.

302
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,239
I understand your concerns
about Lord Liang's work,

303
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,119
but he has his pursuits.

304
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,280
He would gladly make the sacrifice

305
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,959
to maintain justice and order.

306
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,800
I have no objection against that.

307
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,319
But if I limited him to this house

308
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:30,400
because I wished for stability in life,

309
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,079
I'm afraid he would
never be happy again.

310
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,199
Wan'er, you and I have
agreed on so many things,

311
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,719
why are you defending him now?

312
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,959
Just as you do,

313
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,640
I want him to be safe.

314
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,079
However, I would rather

315
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,760
live in fear for the rest of my life

316
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,959
than binding him

317
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,239
to the comfort of home.

318
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,880
Come, Wan'er.

319
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,239
Eat up.

320
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:06,880
You should eat up too.

321
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,040
What do you need?

322
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,479
This one.

323
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,520
So,

324
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,040
were you serious just now?

325
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,079
Serious about what?

326
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,400
To live in fear for me.

327
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,119
Su Yiwan said it, not me.

328
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,439
Are you alright?

329
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,319
I thought you were still recovering.

330
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,560
I was just about to say it hurt.

331
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,400
Come on, don't be mad.

332
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,280
Open the door, let me in.

333
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,599
Open the door.

334
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:02,567
(Firewood Office)

335
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:03,599
The District Magistrate of Chengyang

336
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,160
admitted that
half of the charity provision

337
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
was sold to the Xinglong Rice Store
of Chengyang.

338
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,880
The business is hoarding supply

339
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,920
to fill its pockets.

340
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,640
Deal with it as usual.

341
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,199
What day is it?

342
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,319
The eighth of the month.

343
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,479
It's been three days.

344
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,479
Three days?

345
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,160
She hasn't talked to me.

346
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,400
How long

347
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,560
before she is willing to see me again?

348
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,599
I wouldn't know.

349
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,839
To get her to care for you,

350
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:33,119
you played sick and

351
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
got yourself exposed.

352
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,560
She didn't reply to my apologies.

353
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,359
She returned everything I sent.

354
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,040
I've interrogated criminals,

355
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,000
but none is as resilient as her.

356
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,079
So,

357
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,280
if she keeps being so upset,

358
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,439
what else should I do?

359
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,920
Put up with it.

360
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,280
If you have no idea what to do,

361
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,239
it's not like my stiff brain
could do better.

362
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,560
Sir.

363
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,920
A madam from the Qiu family
wants to see you.

364
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Let her in.

365
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,119
Yes.

366
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
Sir, this is your chance.

367
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,239
The direct approach failed,
try her family instead.

368
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,439
Sir.

369
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,760
Peace be with you, Lord Liang.

370
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,319
Greetings, Madam Liu.

371
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,119
What brings you here?

372
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,199
Does your family need help?

373
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,800
What he meant was,

374
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,119
he would gladly help with any problems

375
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,599
you and your family have.

376
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,800
He is very reliable.

377
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,280
You'll be satisfied with his service.

378
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,599
I see.

379
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,599
If that's the case,

380
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,520
I might as well ask away.

381
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,800
Song Jin, brew Madam Liu some tea.

382
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,400
Madam Liu, have a seat.

383
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,400
No, never mind.

384
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,239
I need you

385
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,719
to pass Yan something for me.

386
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
I mean, for Madam Su.

387
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,319
The tenth of this month

388
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,680
is her birthday.

389
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,880
I made her a pair of embroidered shoes.

390
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,160
As her mother,
I want to send her my regard.

391
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
If it's a gift,

392
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,319
you should come with me

393
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,479
and hand it to her personally.

394
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,599
Forget it.

395
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,199
Perhaps you didn't know,

396
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,520
but she and I never saw eye to eye.

397
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,439
We'd probably get into a quarrel
if we met.

398
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,599
That would be embarrassing.

399
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,719
I must ask you to pass it to her.

400
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,400
I take my leave now.

401
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,199
Lord Liang,

402
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,079
meeting you

403
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,520
is a blessing in her life.

404
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,760
She's always been a stubborn girl,

405
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,599
but she is a great person.

406
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,959
I hope you can tolerate her temper

407
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,439
and take care of her.

408
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,560
I will.

409
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
Her birthday...

410
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,920
Sir, I asked Qingdai.

411
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,040
Madam Su's favorite

412
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,599
is the three-flavor
bamboo shoot with quail.

413
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,520
Her favorite dessert is

414
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,160
osmanthus candy with fudge.

415
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,520
Her favorite wine is the Bamboo Green.

416
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
I have everything arranged.

417
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,479
Sir, when are you going to confess

418
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,079
to Madam Su?

419
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,800
Confess?

420
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,959
Yes.

421
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,599
The others buy it,
but you can't fool me.

422
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,640
The way you look at her

423
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,199
is overflowing with affection

424
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,520
and burning with passion.

425
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,280
We went to great length

426
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,400
for this birthday celebration

427
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,839
to turn the spark

428
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,599
into a roaring flame.

429
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,400
Seize the momentum and win her back.

430
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,800
Do you think it's hard for me

431
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
to have a woman's heart?

432
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,880
Sir, I think you got it wrong.

433
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,040
Even with all these plans,

434
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,599
you still might not win her heart.

435
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,439
Try saying that again.

436
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,199
Sir, good advice can be unpleasant.

437
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,680
The scholars stuck their necks out
to give advice.

438
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,520
I serve you,

439
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,439
I can't feed you lies.

440
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,839
It's now or never.

441
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,119
You should

442
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,400
strike while the iron is hot

443
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,920
before regrets strike back.

444
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,040
- Shut it!
- Sorry!

445
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,560
- It's true!
- Shut it!

446
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,839
I'll teach you a lesson!

447
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm being honest.

448
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,400
Sir, I'm sorry.

449
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,319
- Honest?
- Sorry!

450
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:29,760
Sir!

451
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,839
Lord Liang wants you in his study.

452
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,359
What is it?

453
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,680
You'll know when you're there.

454
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,239
Can't you see I'm busy?

455
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,880
Madam Su,

456
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,959
he didn't want me to tell you,

457
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,640
but his wound is hurting again.

458
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,400
I visited him. It looked really bad.

459
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,800
Let go of me.

460
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,520
No.

461
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,239
I'll start yelling.

462
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
Your mother will deal with you.

463
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,439
I'm not letting go.

464
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
You can be mad at me

465
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,119
another day,

466
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,880
but today is your birthday.

467
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,479
Can you not be mad for one day?

468
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,680
My birthday?

469
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,560
Wait here.

470
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,599
Madam Liu came to me.

471
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,119
She wants me to pass you
the shoes she made you.

472
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,800
She says it's your birthday today.

473
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,520
She never celebrated my birthday for me.

474
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:26,520
Indeed.

475
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,160
She knows I'm your wife now.

476
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,800
She has use of me.

477
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,640
Of course she remembers.

478
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,640
Tell her

479
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,800
I keep her gift.

480
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,239
What about mine?

481
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,839
Yours?

(Collection of Odd Occurrences-Final
By Evil-Purger and Devotee of Yanqi)

483
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,640
Devotee of Yanqi...

484
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,880
It's you.

485
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:57,400
You gave the book an ending.

486
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,599
This is your work,

487
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,920
it should have your name on it.

488
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,119
You didn't have a pen name,

489
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,560
so I gave you one.

490
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:04,920
But of course,

491
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,959
if you don't like it,

492
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,959
I can change it.

493
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,760
I like it.

494
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,479
Really?

495
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,319
I'm glad you do.

496
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,079
Devotee of Yanqi...

497
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,800
Mr. Lu wrote this epilogue
for the new edition.

498
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,520
He doesn't know you wrote the ending.

499
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:33,640
See?

500
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,680
Writing a story

501
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,199
is easier than you think.

502
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,719
Even Mr. Lu approves
of your writing skill.

503
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,520
Believe in yourself

504
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,880
and you can write

505
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,040
outstanding detective storytelling scripts.

00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,640
I talked to my mother.

00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,839
I ordered the cook

511
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,880
to prepare your favorite food.

512
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,280
I even have your favorite wine.

513
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,359
A troupe from the south

514
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,719
is performing at
the Heming Building tonight.

515
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,880
We'll watch it together.

516
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,959
Don't cry.

517
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,079
What's wrong?

518
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,959
If you like some quiet time,

519
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,839
we can

520
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,439
stay home and celebrate.

521
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
It's your birthday today,

522
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,920
you get to decide everything.

523
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,640
Today

524
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,280
is the first time someone
celebrates my birthday for me.

525
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,199
Back in Yuezhou,

526
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,880
Madam Liu only celebrated
Rong'er's birthday.

527
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,520
No matter how hard our life was,

528
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,760
she would still
make an effort to celebrate it.

529
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,920
But no one

530
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,760
ever remembers my birthday.

531
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,119
I thought she had forgotten.

532
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,280
One year, I reminded her
about my birthday.

533
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,520
Do you know what she told me?

534
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,040
"Keep it to yourself.

535
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,439
It's a day of suffering for me.

536
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,119
Do you really think I would celebrate

537
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,760
the birth of a burden?"

538
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,479
Then, I went back to the Qiu family.

539
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,840
In the first year,

540
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:19,320
Mother wanted to hold
a birthday celebration for me.

541
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,000
But Madam Liu's words

542
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,800
still haunted me.

543
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,239
I told my mother

544
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,840
that I hated my birthday.

545
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,919
And the more I say it,

546
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,679
I started to believe it.

547
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,320
For the first time ever,

548
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,280
I have a proper birthday.

549
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,399
Receiving a birthday present
is such a joy.

550
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,879
I am not a burden to anyone.

551
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,080
Me being alive

552
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,479
is still worth celebrating.

553
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,360
So...

554
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,120
If you want,

555
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,520
I'll celebrate your birthday every year

556
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,280
for the rest of your life.

557
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,679

00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,320
Thanks.

560
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,239
Thank you.

561
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,760
I like celebrating my birthday.

00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,600

Sir, what you told Young Master Qin
the other day

00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,280
touched even my heart,

652

658
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,159
She went through so much
for her family's misfortune.

But the case is over.

661
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,600
I thought

662
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
she would shed her burden

663
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,080
and accept me.

664
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,320

665
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
and sensitive.

666
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,800
I want her to be the happiest noblewoman

667

of the Capital.

668
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,479
But now I realize...

669
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,959
the freedom I can give her

670
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,840
is the space inside this manor.

671
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,679
What she really desires

672
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,719
is to roam freely

673
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,959

674
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,000

675
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,639

677
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,080
But, she understands

678
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,120
that I've been working hard
for my career for years,

679
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,199
and that my work is not finished.

680
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,760
She knew I wouldn't leave with her.

681
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,000
This is her way

682
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:25,479
of bidding me farewell.

683
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,320
Forget it.

684
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
There are things she wants to do.

685
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,560
I'm just the same.

686
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:44,320
I understand now.

687
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,959
You want her to be free.

688
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:51,159
You refuse to ruin her dream

689
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
out of selfishness.

690
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,199
Since we can't have this love,

691
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,560
there is no point in telling her.

692
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:05,040
It'd only make us both sad.

693
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:06,879
Am I right?

694
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,280
I know I am in no place to say this,

695
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,439
but if I were you,

696
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,439
I'd follow Miss Qiu Yan on her journey.

697
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,639
You were once a wanderer too.

698
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,040
Over the years,

699
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,479
you've kept yourself

700
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,840
to the Firewood Office

701
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,199
for your father and your ambition,

702
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,840
but you've never been happy.

703
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,159
Don't forget,

704
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,320
your father's last wish

705
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,439
is for you to stay out of

706
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:39,479
the struggles of the Imperial Court.

707
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,719
Song Jin,

708
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:57,360
pack my things.

709
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,159
Starting tomorrow,

710
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,479
I'll live at the Firewood Office.
