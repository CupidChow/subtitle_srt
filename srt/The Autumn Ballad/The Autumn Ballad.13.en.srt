=Episode 13=

18
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:44,400
Min'er,

19
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,319
this silver gilded ruyi headdress
is for you.

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Thank you, Mother.

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Yan'er,

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,519
you're not engaged yet,

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,320
but I'll leave this pair
of silver jade pearl earrings to you.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
Thank you, Mother.

25
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,199
These two are

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,679
my favourite things among my dowries.

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,600
When you get married,

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,279
I'm not able to keep you company
all the time,

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,679
these two pieces of jewelry

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,679
will accompany you on my behalf.

31
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,080
Min'er is getting married.

32
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,679
First Madam.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,520
Thank you.

35
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,960
I hereby congratulate Second Madam

36
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,119
-and Qiu Min on it.
-Thank you.

37
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,199
Thank you, thank you.

38
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,440
These are the dowries for Qiu Min
from our family.

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,080
So I brought them here to show you.

40
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,559
I appreciate your concern, thank you.

41
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,440
Congratulations, Second Madam.

42
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,039
Madam Kou.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
Everything is fine.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Why are Qiu Ying's eyes red?

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,440
She cried as she hated

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
to see Qiu Min leave.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,639
Sister-in-law, just let me know

48
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,679
if you need any help.

49
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,279
-It's okay.
-We'll be happy to

50
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,960
since you mean it.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,759
Yan'er.

52
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,199
As Qiu Mei and Qiu Ying are good
at embroidery,

53
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:21,520
they can embroider a wedding dress
for Min'er, what do you think?

54
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm afraid we can't make it
as it's less than a month

55
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,759
before Qiu Min's marriage.

56
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,720
You were able to use boundary method

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,279
to embroider "Yan" in a moment.

58
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,080
There's still a month left.

59
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,440
The time is more than enough.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,279
Isn't it?

61
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:48,544
(Firewood Office)

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,360
Lord Liang.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,559
Official Qiu is going
to be my father-in-law.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
Just call me Liang Yi will do.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,839
The reasons I come here,

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,240
firstly, is to show my appreciation
for the betrothal gifts.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,559
Secondly,

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,880
I have some questions on my mind.

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,039
As my daughter is just an ordinary girl,

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,399
what makes her worthy of your effort?

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
Do you want to hear the truth

72
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,720
or the platitudes?

73
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,119
Of course I want to hear the truth.

74
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,119
To be honest with you,

75
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,519
I've investigated your background.

76
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
You're a man of integrity

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
and you're incorruptible.

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,399
I've worked in Firewood Office
for many years.

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,279
It's very rare to have

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
someone like you.

81
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,119
Since I've chosen you
to be my future father-in-law,

82
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,959
I'll just cut to the chase.

83
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,559
As I put much effort on Qiu Min,

84
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
actually,

85
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,279
it's because I have my eyes

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,440
on you, Official Qiu.

87
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,359
I hold a low level position
and have no power in the imperial court.

88
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,279
I'm from the baron's family

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,920
but my brother is the one
who inherits the title.

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Indeed, you hold a low level position.

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,399
But your father was the chief
of the Imperial College.

92
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,200
His students and former crews are
all over the world.

93
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,640
Even if your father has passed away,

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,959
the scholars will

95
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,320
more or less show some respect
to Qiu family.

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Those are just casual acquaintances.

97
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
It's as clear as the water.

98
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm afraid

99
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,839
the reputation of Qiu family

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
wouldn't be useful for your affairs.

101
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,559
I'm not expecting you to order
those people around.

102
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,119
And I don't need anything from them.

103
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,000
I just need you to help me

104
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,559
select talents.

105
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,600
Recommend those shrewd people to me.

106
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,000
The selection of talents is the affair

107
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,559
of the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs
and the Imperial College.

108
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm afraid you got the wrong guy.

109
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,600
In my opinion,

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
comparing to Northern Liang,

111
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
we, Dashuo, have three weaknesses.

112
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:59,079
We have superfluous troops,
unnecessary expenses and dead wood.

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
Now that Northern Liang is eyeing us

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,799
and the vagrants have been rebelling.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,440
There are many incompetent
and corrupt officials at court.

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,799
If there's another invasion,

117
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
we, Dashuo, might lose
the right to negotiate

118
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,640
and ally with Northern Liang.

119
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,040
You deliberately eliminated

120
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,600
those people in Firewood Office?

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,359
Most of them deserved it.

122
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,119
The reason I eliminated them is

123
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,559
that I need a group of personnel

124
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,440
who are capable

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,559
and dare to bear to take the places.

126
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,640
Selecting talents isn't my strong suit.

127
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,640
And those old men
in the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs

128
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,040
are untrustworthy.

129
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,519
You're the only one
I can seek help from.

130
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,160
So General He is the one

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,079
in the military you seek help from.

132
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,119
As you can extrapolate it,

133
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,320
I don't need to hide it from you.

134
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:56,359
Yes.

135
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,920
Lord Liang, you're a precocious

136
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,239
and wily man.

137
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm fully aware of it today.

138
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:15,799
I think you've planned
for this since that day

139
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,440
when you mediated my family affairs.

140
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,480
What can you see if I took away

141
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,839
those people who had been eliminated

142
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,679
during the last year and a half?

143
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,920
Most of them were
from the Ministry of Works,

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,239
Ministry of War and Ministry of Revenue.

145
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,359
Those are the department
that provides liberal wages.

146
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,279
This is the only part
you're able to see.

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,279
Look.

148
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,239
Xia Zhengji from the Ministry of Revenue
who he eliminated.

149
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:49,772
(Xia Zhengji)

150
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,880
His deputy was

151
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,559
the scholar in the 16th year
of Chengzhao.

152
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,640
But he hadn't been promoted
within years.

153
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:55,115
(Vice Minister of Ministry of Revenue
Yuan Ji)

154
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
Once Xia Zhengji was eliminated,

155
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,359
this scholar could rightly take

156
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,239
Xia Zhengji's place.

157
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:01,920
(Vice Minister of Ministry of Revenue
Yuan Ji)

158
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,399
So Liang Yi was bribed by this man?

159
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
Liang Yi couldn't care less
about such little money.

160
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,679
I think his true purpose

161
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,760
is to secretly control
the imperial administration.

162
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,519
Secretly control
the imperial administration?

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,480
Look.

164
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:27,119
Why would Liang Yi marry Qiu's daughter?

165
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,596
(Qiu Min)

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,839
It'd be a joke
if you said he fell for Third Young Lady

167
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,159
from Qiu family.

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,039
He isn't someone
who will be attached to relationships.

169
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,159
Qiu family is a humble family

170
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,679
but it has accumulated deep resources.

171
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,640
(Vice Minister of Ministry of Works, Qiu Yi)
Qiu Yi's father had many students.

172
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,159
This is the biggest reason
why Liang Yi has his eyes on Qiu family.

173
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,919
As Qiu family and Liang Yi join forces,

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,919
one for the selection of talents,

175
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,239
one for the elimination of obstacles.

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
Within a few years,

177
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,479
he'd be able to secretly control
the imperial administration.

178
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,000
I infer that you think

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,159
we must get rid of Qiu family.

180
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,359
I can't just sit by
and watch the imperial administration

181
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,919
fall into the hands
of the villain like Liang Yi.

182
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,659
(Taiying Temple)

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,119
Aunt Qiu.

184
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,159
Qiu Min.

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Qiu Yan, what a coincidence.

186
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
Young Master Qin,
you're going to the temple too?

187
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,719
Today is the 15th day of the month.

188
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,719
So I'm going to the temple

189
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,400
to get the safety amulets for my family.

190
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,320
I didn't expect that I'd meet you here.

191
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,960
What a small world.

192
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,239
Why don't you

193
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,280
travel with us?

194
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,520
I'd love to.

195
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,239
Xiuyu, you wait outside the door.

196
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,479
Yes, Madam.

197
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,640
Beixue, you wait here.

198
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,479
Yes, sir.

199
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,880
Why are you here?

200
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,760
I've copied the new chapter
of Lu's Crime Investigation.

201
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,159
I thought you must be in a rush
to read it.

202
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,080
So I brought it for you.

203
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
When we enter the temple,

204
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
you go and pray with Aunt first.

205
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
I'll wait for you
at the Cangjing Chamber.

206
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,200
Sir,

207
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,119
I've rummaged through the storage room.

208
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,000
I finally found the key

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
before your marriage.

210
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,119
You finally can get rid

211
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,960
of that annoying eyesore.

212
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,359
I'll ask someone to send the key
to Qiu Residence after that.

213
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,599
So Miss Qiu Yan can take it off too.

214
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,599
You'll be going to my house
to propose in these few days.

215
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,039
Wouldn't this create a disturbance
if you kept it?

216
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,280
They're praying at Taiying temple today.

217
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,960
I'll bring it to her.

218
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,039
Sir, your true intention is not
to send the key

219
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,960
but to see Miss Qiu Min, right?

220
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,371
(The true and false in the world)

221
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,599
Amitabha.

222
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,840
This is Master Zhenyan
from Taiying Temple.

223
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,760
I got the amulets
that you've had since childhood

224
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,760
from him.

225
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,520
I've made the amulets
for your daughters for years.

226
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,320
This is the first time I meet them.

227
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,239
As Qiu family's wedding is around
the corner,

228
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,520
I think it must be the good karma
you've accumulated for years

229
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,559
as you sincerely learn Buddhism.

230
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
Your daughter will be safe and happy

231
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,679
after getting married.

232
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,760
Thank you, Master.

233
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,919
Sir,

234
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,080
that street vendor looks
very suspicious.

235
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,119
He's a man
from the Main Administrative Office.

236
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
He's been following us for a while.

237
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:56,960
A street vendor should be carrying

238
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,280
the goods of the day in the morning.

239
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,559
But he's still able to carry them
while standing upright.

240
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,559
Yuan Lang is not willing

241
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,840
to let us go for even a moment.

242
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,479
I'll go and size up the situation.

243
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,760
Now that I have to act like
I'm preoccupied with the marriage

244
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,840
and come to the temple to pray
and worship Buddha.

245
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,520
How could I act without audiences?

246
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,840
But it's okay to go and see

247
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,159
how many people there are.

248
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:16,960
Yes.

249
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,679
Sir, do you think I'm in your way?

250
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,498
(Cangjing Chamber)

251
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,919
Qiu Min.

252
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,026
(Cangjing Chamber)

253
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,960
Qin Xuan.

254
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,039
Are you here to read the scriptures?

255
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,559
I've been plunged
into a gloomy mood lately.

256
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,200
Maybe reading the scriptures

257
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,119
could help to relieve it.

258
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,799
Your wedding is around the corner,

259
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,200
why would you feel gloomy?

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,159
There's something within reach
but I can't get it

261
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,239
and fight for it.

262
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,799
But I can't learn to let it go.

263
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,880
Why are you here?

264
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,719
Why can't I come here?

265
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,239
I didn't expect you'd be
so obsessed with Min'er.

266
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,919
You used to plan for it.

267
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,119
Now that you're justifiably engaged
to her.

268
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,679
Yet, you still can't kick the habit
of secretly pestering her.

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,080
You spout off a lot
even in this holy place.

270
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm here to pray and worship Buddha,
can't I do that?

271
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,119
I...

272
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,200
I have something to tell you.

273
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,640
Follow me.

274
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,640
Why must you say it here?

275
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,400
I take you here to enjoy the view.

276
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,440
My mother said

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,520
that it'd be a spectacle here
after the rain in the early summer.

278
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,080
It's nothing special.

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,039
I have something to give you.

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,760
Look.

281
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,200
I didn't lie to you.

282
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:16,719
By the way,

283
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,479
didn't you say you have something
to tell me?

284
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,760
What is it?

285
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,359
Every time when we meet,

286
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,640
we'll bicker

287
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,239
and never spare each other.

288
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,559
But for the matter of He family
and the fake notes,

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I should thank you

290
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,119
for everything.

291
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,719
I thought it was some serious matter.

292
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,159
These matters are nothing to you

293
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,479
but you've saved me from troubles.

294
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,119
You could care less about it

295
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,320
but I must say thank you.

296
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,479
It scares me even more

297
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,000
as you solemnly thank me.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
I thought

299
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,080
you were going to pull a prank on me.

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
I'm afraid

301
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,599
you'll be frightened later.

302
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,440
There's one more thing
that I have to thank you for.

303
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,560
It was six years ago.

304
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,560
You rescued a girl

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,319
from a group of bandits

306
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,599
on the outskirts of the capital city.

307
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
You didn't leave your name back then.

308
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
You only left a folding fan.

309
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,560
She knows the name of the owner now.

310
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,160
And she wants to say

311
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,160
thank you.

Before the bandits came,

00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,199
my mother had escaped
with my little brother.

315
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,160
I watched her escaped.

316
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,880
I called her.

317
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,280
I kept calling her

318
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,160
but she didn't even look back.

319
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,119
I hate my mother

and little brother.

321
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,319
I hate myself even more.

322
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,839
Why weren't I born as a son?

323
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,760
But what's the point of it?

324
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,199
Is there any place you can go
except home?

325

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,719
That day

331
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,280
when you rescued me from He family,

332
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,119
it was Lantern Festival in the city.

333
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,359
You wrote on the sky lantern.

334
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,560
"Evil-Purger".

340
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,280
Since you already knew it at that time,

341
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
why are you only saying it now?

342
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,040
I was disappointed
as I knew that you used me

343
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,520
so I was unwilling to recognize you.

344
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,280
That was because I wanted
to use you to find the truth.

345
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,920
General He is a veteran

346
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
with great achievements
and high seniority.

347
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,680
He and his son were unwilling
to listen to me.

348
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,079
But it's different

349
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,880
from now on.

350
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,560
(I suggest you not to be a smartass.)

351
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,280
(That you thought you were special
as you were educated.)

352
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,279
(You thought you could see through
people's minds.)

353
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,520
(It's such a joke.)

354
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,719
(I'm never a gallant knight
who defends the weak.)

355
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,160
(Rescuing you is
because you're useful to me.)

00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,560
In these six years,

360
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I've been hoping that one day,

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,239
I could meet you again.

362
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,319
I can tell you

363
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,400
that I know every word

364
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
in the folding fan.

365
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,319
And I can count, keep books
and do house chores.

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
I'm no longer

367
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,640
that homeless little girl back then.

♪Even if all creations go silent♪

369
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,800
Now that we've resolved
our misunderstandings.

370
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,319
My wish is fulfilled

371
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
as I'm able to tell you this.

372
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,680
Moreover, both of us are relatives now.

373
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,680
I sincerely wish you and Min'er
live happily ever after.

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,239
I just gave you my blessing.

375
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,560
It's a two-way street, shouldn't you

376
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,680
wish me something?

377
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,520
I wish you

378
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,560
find your loved one sooner.

379
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,199
I'll leave first.

380
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,319
Didn't you say

381
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,800
you have something for me?

382
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,040
I have a honoraria for you.

383
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,319
But I found that I forgot to bring it.

384
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,319
It's all right.

385
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:33,040
I finally told you these.

386
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
I'll leave first.

387
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,079
You may go to Min'er now.

388
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,400
Qiu Yan.

389
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,640
Have you finished talking with Qin Xuan?

390
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,680
I...

391
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,239
He asked me to meet him
at Cangjing Chamber.

392
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
I looked for him just now

393
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,280
and I saw you two talking.

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,680
You...

395
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,319
You heard everything?

396
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,760
You should be happy
that I'm the one who heard it

397
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,800
instead of others.

398
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,319
Do you know
that Liang Yi has come today?

399
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,199
He came here to see you.

400
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,880
I understand
that he's not the one you love.

401
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,160
But you shouldn't push his limit

402
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,560
since you've chosen this path.

403
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,479
I didn't interrupt you two

404
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,040
because I wanted to give you a chance

405
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
to finish what you wished to say.

406
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,640
After marrying
into Marquis Weiyuan Residence,

407
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,319
stop being hesitant
and having a reciprocal relationship.

408
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,079
Otherwise,
Qiu family couldn't protect you.

409
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,719
They won't protect you either.

410
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,479
Don't worry, Qiu Yan.

411
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,520
My lingering dream is over today.

412
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,520
Qin Xuan looks particularly happy.

413
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,199
I don't know what methods you've used.

414
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,680
But since you can cheer him up now,

415
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,319
I hope

416
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,479
that you could cheer him up
in all his life.

417
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,719
I'll think of you

418
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,800
every time when I see this jade pendant.

419
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,320
(Xuan and Yan will be together, Xuan)

420
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
(Qin Xuan)

421
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,040
When I first started reading,

422
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,880
I aspired

423
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,199
to read everything the boys read.

424
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,479
Because

425
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,479
I promised a person when I was little.

426
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,719
Childhood friend?

427
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,719
He's my benefactor.

428
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,959
Like you.

429
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,439
Have we met before?

430
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,119
No.

431
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:43,199
We had never met
before we entered the palace

432
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,160
to celebrate Her Highness's birthday.

433
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,439
Sir, I've investigated it.

434
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,920
The street vendor is all alone.

435
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,959
Sir, why are you so moody?

436
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,839
It turns out I'm the cabbage head.

437
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,359
She was right in front of me

438
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,520
but I didn't recognise her.

439
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,239
Then, I'll leave first.

440
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,199
Let's go.

441
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,880
Let's go, Min'er.

442
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,439
She seems to be on your mind.

443
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,160
You've fallen for her.

You've been guessing all day long.

465
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,239
Just go.

466
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,439
Hold the ladder, be careful.

467
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,959
Be careful, slow down.

468
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,479
Okay.

469
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,280
Madam.

470
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,880
Madam.

471
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,239
What are these?

472
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,800
Put them in Third Young Lady's room.

473
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,359
Yes.

00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,359
Easy does it.

Madam! Madam! Madam!

478
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,640
Madam, what's wrong with you?

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,359
Madam! Madam! Madam!

Is Physician Li here?

481
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,479
I've sent someone
to the staging post to pick him up

482
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,560
with the fastest horse in the residence.

483
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,479
He'll be here today.

484
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,680
Miss, you've been up for several days.

485
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,800
Let me serve her.

486
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,359
It's all right.

487
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,439
What's wrong?

488
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:03,479
Speak up.

489
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,280
Mother just took the medicine and slept.

490
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,800
First Madam and Third Madam
are here to visit her.

491
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,199
So she's got to get changed
and talk with them.

492
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Consulting the physician
and attending the relatives.

493
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,400
I see her have a serious cough

494
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,280
and she has to get changed
a few times a day.

495
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,920
Why didn't you kick them out?

496
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,760
There's no point crying.

497
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,119
They mean well
as they're here to visit her.

498
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,839
And I'm a junior.

499
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,359
You're still young.

500
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,359
If anything happens to you,

501
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,800
what's the point of living

502
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,760
a life like this?

503
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,160
Qiu Hong got this ginseng

504
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,839
in Liao Dong a few years ago.

505
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,160
It's best for making tonic soup.

506
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,959
Qiu Hong has asked me for this
for a few times

507
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,000
but I didn't give it to him.

508
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
I appreciate your concern.

509
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,760
The physician said

510
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,199
the reason why there was blood
in her phlegm

511
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,040
was the interior stagnation of heat.

512
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:59,479
Ginseng is a nutritious food,

513
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,760
wouldn't this worsen her situation?

514
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,479
Third Aunt, you should take it back.

515
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,239
Yan'er, your Third Aunt means well.

516
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,839
Yes, we know nothing
about the pharmacology.

517
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
Anyway, this is a good thing.

518
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,040
The physician said
that Mother needed to rest.

519
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,079
First Aunt and Third Aunt,
you shouldn't frequently come here

520
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,520
to disturb Mother for her sake.

521
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,439
Yan'er.

522
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,839
She's worried about you.

523
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,839
All right, then, we'll head back first.

524
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,439
Just get some rest.

525
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,319
Okay.

526
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,239
Yan'er,

527
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,160
do you know you've done wrong?

528
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,079
They didn't do it for your good.

529
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,959
They did it for themselves.

530
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,839
So they could be tolerated
by the second chamber.

531
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,599
There are some relationships

532
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,560
that we must maintain.

533
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,839
As you can't go soft

534
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,040
on your own family,

535
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,000
how are you supposed to live

536
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,280
after getting married?

537
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,439
I'll just live my life.

538
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,199
I'll be nice to those who treat me well.

539
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
If someone bullies me,

540
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,439
I'll return the favor.

541
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,439
Let's see who's the tough one.

542
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:37,160
For those who gossip behind my back,

543
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,920
I'll just pretend like it didn't happen

544
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,199
if they don't do it in front of me.

545
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,239
You're smart and clever.

546
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
You're not afraid of things

547
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,479
and you don't pick fights.

548
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,760
It's good.

549
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,400
But do you know

550
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,839
that being overly tough
will make things vulnerable?

551
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,160
You're unwilling to back down

552
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,640
but keep acting tough.

553
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,000
It looks like you've won

554
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,400
but you'll also hurt yourself.

555
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,839
Mother, are you ashamed of me?

556
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,239
Look at Min'er.

557
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,079
Although

558
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,599
she's too weak,

559
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,760
sometimes, the unyielding can be
conquered with the yielding.

560
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,760
I thought

561
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,920
I could wait until you get married.

562
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,040
But Heaven forbid it.

563
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,439
The future is

564
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:50,880
in your hands.

565
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,160
I'm worried about you.

566
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,760
Mother, it's normal
for humans to fall sick.

567
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,719
You only have a headache
and fever once in a while.

568
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,040
How can you recover
if you keep thinking this way?

569
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,560
It's my body.

570
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,760
I know it.

571
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:10,800
There are some words

572
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,399
that I have to say

573
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
or I may not get another chance.

574
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,639
I've been a wife

575
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,800
and a mother

576
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,919
for my life.

577
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
I didn't have any regrets.

578
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,639
Just that I can't let go
of you and Min'er.

579
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,840
The medicine is getting cold,
I'll heat it up for you.

580
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,199
Yan'er,

581
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,000
I know you're listening.

582
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,000
Your dad is an educated man.

583
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,560
Either it's the house chores
or national affairs,

584
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,000
Min'er is too weak.

585
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,040
From now on, I'll leave

586
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,399
the second chamber to you.

587
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,439
I can't promise you.

588
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,399
I'm not able
to take care of this family.

589
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Physician Li, hurry up.

590
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,600
Physician Li, I beg you,
please save my mother.

591
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,479
Miss, don't panic.

592
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,959
I'll try everything I can.

593
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,040
Min'er.

594
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,600
Physician Li, what's wrong with her?

595
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,320
Your wife suffers
from infectious disease.

596
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,560
All of you leave this room now.

597
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,840
From now on, without my permission,

598
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,560
no one is allowed to come in,
understand?

599
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,439
Get out.

600
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:05,560
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

601
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,959
Hurry up! Quickly get out!

602
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:07,520
Quickly get out!

603
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,560
My lord, hurry up.

604
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:09,959
Young Ladies.

605
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,879
Quickly get out!

606
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,239
Close the door.

607
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,479
Mother hasn't gone out
since she came back

608
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,639
from Mount Taiying.

609
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,040
How could she be infected
with the infectious disease?

610
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,479
Father,

611
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:40,760
I think you should send someone
to Mount Taiying.

612
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,239
If someone is ill there,

613
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,239
you have to quickly report
to the imperial court

614
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,360
to prevent the disease from spreading.

615
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,600
We can't even protect ourselves
but you still mind others' business.

616
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,399
In my opinion, we'll be the first ones

617
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,360
to get infected
if it's an infectious disease.

618
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,719
What are you talking about?

619
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,600
My lord,

620
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,600
this kid is insensible and ineloquent.

621
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:04,560
But it does make sense.

622
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:05,959
The infectious disease appears
to be ferocious.

623
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:09,600
I should take Rong'er and the kids

624
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,080
to stay in the courtyard for a few days.

625
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:15,080
That's all we can do now.

626
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,760
I don't want to go.

627
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,959
Physician Li has said
that we're not allowed to go in.

628
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:21,439
What's the point of staying here?

629
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Is there no other work to do
besides serving her?

630
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,080
Like decoction and meal preparation.

631
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,199
I can't leave them to the others.

632
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,080
I know you're afraid
that Rong'er will get infected.

633
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,080
You don't have to bring me with you.

634
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,959
Jeez.

635
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,479
I'm your biological mother.

636
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,719
I do it for your own good.

637
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,280
My mother is sick.

638
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,080
I won't go anywhere.

639
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,719
You...

640
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,199
Qiu Yan.

641
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:47,280
Madam, why don't you take
Rong'er there first?

642
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:49,199
Qiu Yan and I will stay here
for few more days.

643
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,600
Min,

644
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,239
your sister is stubborn.

645
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,080
I'll just leave her alone.

646
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,959
But you're weak.

647
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,280
If anything happens to you,

648
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,080
how am I supposed to explain
to your father and mother?

649
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,040
Mother,

650
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,399
as they are not willing to leave,

651
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,320
just let them be.

652
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,439
Anyway, I'm leaving.

653
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,760
Master, this is the tonic medicine

654
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,360
from Young Master Qin
of Duke Ying Residence.

655
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:26,399
Qiu Yan.

656
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,303
(Qiu Residence)

657
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,080
Miss,

658
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,080
eat something and take a break.

659
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,399
Just let me do it.

660
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,080
Where is Min'er?

661
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,360
Keep an eye on it.

662
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,080
Yes.

663
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,959
Mother is waiting for us
to take care of her.

664
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,560
Yet, you're hiding in here.

665
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,360
I'm hand-copying the scriptures
to pray for Mother.

666
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,560
As long as I'm sincere,

667
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,600
I'm sure they'll keep Mother safe.

668
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,840
If these were useful,

669
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,520
no one would suffer
from a serious illness.

670
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,080
Only medicine and food can cure
the disease.

671
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,520
Not some sort of divination.

672
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,080
We've been looking for physicians
and medicines in the capital city.

673
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,800
The medicine she takes is more
than the food she eats.

674
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,320
Yet, her condition is getting
more serious.

675
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,639
Physician Li said
that Mother couldn't even drink water.

676
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,919
Didn't you say
Physician Li is incredible?

677
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,080
Even he can't treat Mother,

678
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,760
what can I do?

679
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,080
I have faith in the ancestors and gods.

680
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,399
As long as I'm sincere,

681
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:54,360
I'm sure they won't lie to me.

682
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,239
(Dear ancestors,)

683
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,320
(if you can keep Mother safe,)

684
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,879
(I, Qiu Yan, am willing
to stay unmarried forever)

685
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,879
(to serve you ancestors.)

686
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:33,879
Is Physician Li not around?

687
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,600
He freshened up to meet Master.

688
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,840
How is my mother?

689
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:51,360
This infectious disease is no joke.

690
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:53,600
You're not allowed

691
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,520
to go to the second chamber
before Han's belongings

692
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
get cleaned.

693
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,360
Also,

694
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:01,040
about the aromatherapy,

695
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:04,000
the mistresses of every chamber
should pay more attention to it.

696
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:05,919
As a precaution,

697
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,199
Qiu Ning, Qiu Hong,

698
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,600
you guys go and prepare
the things for the funeral.

699
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:11,080
Just keep it simple.

700
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,879
Wait.

701
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,439
My mother is still alive.

702
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,959
Old Madam is preparing
for her funeral instead of thinking

703
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,280
about the way to save her.

704
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:23,080
Yan, you don't understand
as you're still young.

705
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:25,800
Discussing the patient's funeral
is to counteract her bad luck.

706
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:27,520
Aunt, stop shutting me up
with such fancy words.

707
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,639
I've heard everything.

708
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,320
This is not a discussion.

709
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,679
You're giving up on her.

710
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,000
Yan'er,

711
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:35,959
the adults are having discussions.

712
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,280
What are you doing here? Just go back.

713
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,120
I don't want to.

714
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Qiu Yi,

715
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,879
why don't you try it my way?

716
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,760
Qiu Hong, stop messing around.

717
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,080
Li, Li.

718
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,439
Physician Li has no hope for her.

719
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:52,040
How could we count on the remedy
of a charlatan?
