=Episode 6=

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,639
Ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,440
the owners of the folding fans
and the earrings which are paired up

20
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,599
will be the teammates in the last round
of Chuiwan competition.

21
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,080
Wei, we're a team.

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,120
I don't want to be teamed up with you.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,559
I want to pair with Qin Xuan.

24
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,839
Qin Xuan, we're in the same team.

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,800
(Men only competed with women
in previous years.)

26
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,160
They had never formed a team.

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,520
They innovated a new idea this year.

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,000
I heard Noble Consort wanted
to choose a wife for Marquis Weiyuan.

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,320
Maybe the powerful Marquis Weiyuan

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
has his eyes on a lady

31
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,520
so she authorises this.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,399
God bless

33
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:36,679
us sisters.

34
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,839
Please don't get targeted
by that living Yamla.

35
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,119
Min'er,

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
switch your earrings with mine.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,119
I don't have time to explain.

38
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,000
Listen to me, hurry up.

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,119
Lord Liang, you're frowning.

40
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,279
Seems like you're unwilling to be
on the same team with me.

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,360
You must've done something
and kept your sister away.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,759
Yes.

43
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,679
As Lord Liang wants to take a wife,

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,759
there are many noble ladies
in the capital city.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,039
But don't you dare hit
on my younger sister.

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,960
Who told you that I wanted
to hit on your younger sister?

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,160
I thought you were meticulous.

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,559
Can't you tell

49
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,360
I don't want you
to get close to Qin Xuan?

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,759
And the reason I approach

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,440
your younger sister is to hit on you.

52
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,639
Lord Liang, are you kidding me?

53
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,639
Look at me.

54
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,039
Do I look like I'm kidding you?

55
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,000
Qin Xuan, I'm not good at playing it.

56
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm afraid that I'll hold you back.

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,839
It's okay, it doesn't matter
if we win or lose.

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,199
I'll try my best to help you.

59
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,919
Marquis Weiyuan is of lower ranking
than Duke Ying

60
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,440
but there are many siblings
in Qin family.

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,320
And Qin Xuan is not the eldest son.

62
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:10,240
Of course he couldn't inherit the title.

63
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:11,880
By contrast,

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
my title of marquis is

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,279
rather an actual fact.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,279
So Lord Liang, you thought

67
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,399
I had my eyes on the lineage
of Qin Xuan?

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,760
Didn't you?

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,399
There are many well-born ladies
around Qin Xuan.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,559
By contrast,

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,799
it's easier to pursue me.

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,239
I wanted to pursue you.

73
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm just worried that you had
a deep bias against me.

74
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,359
As you didn't hold it against me,

75
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,679
of course I appreciate it.

76
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Just that I wonder

77
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,239
what you see in me.

78
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,679
You're good at playing Chuiwan.

79
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,119
And?

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,480
You don't look ugly.

81
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,119
That's all?

82
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,119
You're smart.

83
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,040
Men and women will be
in the same team in this match.

84
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,239
The rules are

85
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,079
starting from the service court,

86
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,119
two teammates have
to hit the ball alternately.

87
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
You're allowed to interrupt
the opponents.

88
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,160
Only the team that first gets the ball
in the hole of the opponent's region

89
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,519
have the right to race
to the final hole.

90
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,760
The team that first hit the ball
to the final hole

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,799
will be the winner.

92
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,079
Participants, get ready,

93
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,799
take your positions.

94
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,079
The match begins now.

95
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:23,920
Min'er,

96
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,839
play it well, we must beat Liang Yi.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,720
You're in the same team with Lord Liang.

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,279
I'm not in the same team
with that kind of person.

99
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:36,959
Min'er,

100
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,320
keep hitting the ball.

101
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,640
Look, look, look.

102
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,359
Your young lady...

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,920
Shut up.

104
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,200
Qiu Min,

105
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,600
don't be nervous.

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,600
You can do this.

107
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Qin Xuan, I scored.

108
00:07:59,119 --> 00:07:59,760
You did great.

109
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,320
Good.

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,079
Sir!

111
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,600
Good!

112
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,799
They scored.

113
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,920
Min'er, you did great.

114
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,080
Nice!

115
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,479
Nice!

116
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:45,919
Qin Xuan.

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,159
It's all right, you have me.

118
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,479
You can do this, sir!

119
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,200
You can do this!

120
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,799
Nice!

121
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,159
Full score.

122
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,559
Liang Yi, Marquis Weiyuan,
and Qiu Yan of Qiu Residence

123
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
win the first place.

124
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Great! Nice!

125
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
Lord, you've been making fun

126
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
of me for the day.

127
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,159
You pretended to approach me.

128
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:27,280
In fact, you wanted to prove
that I'm a woman of easy virtue.

129
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,679
You're really despicable.

130
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,599
Didn't you keep defaming me

131
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,960
in front of Qiu Min?

132
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,200
Likewise.

133
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,520
Min'er, let's go.

134
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,760
Anyway, you've lost this match.

135
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Remember what you've said.

136
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,280
No.

137
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,320
I didn't lose.

138
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,559
Didn't Liang
personally verify it for me?

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,640
Miss Qiu Yan isn't an inconstant person.

140
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,400
Influence peddling, a hypocrite.

141
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,039
Cunning and shameless.

142
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,760
Marquis Residence has held
a flower-viewing banquet today.

143
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,200
You two can set out

144
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,760
for Marquis Residence together
after taking a break.

145
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,159
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

146
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,080
Go on.

147
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,760
As long as Min'er has me around,

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,760
I'll never let you have your way.

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
Likewise.

150
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,160
(Marquis Yongming Residence)

151
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,919
You mean Lord Liang wants to marry me?

152
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
Don't mess with him.

153
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,880
He has a bad reputation
in the imperial court.

154
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,159
I guess

155
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,880
he must've had his eyes
on the lineage of Qiu family.

156
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,880
Father has a low official position,

157
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,799
but he has many friends and pupils.

158
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,679
Joining affinity with the Qiu family

159
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,520
is less invisible

160
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,679
and it's helpful for him
to get promoted.

161
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,239
You're easygoing

162
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,520
so he can easily control you.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,320
How could you be certain

164
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,239
that this is Lord Liang's thought?

165
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,479
I've crossed paths with him
because of He family's matter.

166
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,719
This kind of lackey

167
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,760
will only consider
his own future and benefit.

168
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:42,840
I can tell what he's planning
by just one look.

169
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,640
Actually, everything Lord Liang did
today was the same

170
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,840
with what you did to Qin Xuan,
wasn't it?

171
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,719
Qiu Yan, you want to marry
Qin Xuan, don't you?

172
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Yes, I wanted to win his favor.

173
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,039
And I've indeed used tricks.

174
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,159
Do you really like Qin Xuan?

175
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,200
Actually, I only had feelings

176
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,239
for him until today.

177
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,039
I'm a person without a future.

178
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,960
As I saw a ray of hope,

179
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,960
I wanted to give it a try,
to take the chance.

180
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,440
But by seeing how he treated me today,

181
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,400
I think he indeed has...

182
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,239
My matter is not important.

183
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,520
What matters is that Liang Yi...

184
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,960
I'll remember your words.

185
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Qiu Yan, congratulations
on finding your beloved.

186
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,520
Madam Kou,

187
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,200
how's Chuiwan Party going?

188
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,479
The tagalongs said

189
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,239
that Fourth Young Lady was disqualified
as she violated the rule.

190
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,479
First Young Lady was injured.

191
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,479
I haven't heard anything
about Third Young Lady.

192
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,479
Instead, Second Young Lady

193
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,919
has won jade ruyi
of Marquis Yongming Residence

194
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,960
and stolen the show.

195
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,679
How could this happen?

196
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,520
Didn't First Madam meddle in it?

197
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,039
Regardless of which young lady steals
the show,

198
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,440
all of them represent Qiu family.

199
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,679
How could First Madam
meddle in it?

200
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,719
Why hasn't Old Madam

201
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,880
married this brat off?

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,799
We can't blame this on Old Madam.

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
It's because that brat is cunning.

204
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,679
She drove the matchmaker away last time

205
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,960
and Old Madam was embarrassed.

206
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,640
But I know a guy.

207
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,960
I have a distant relative.

208
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,039
He got rich by doing business
a little while ago.

209
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,960
He's looking for concubines
with several thousand taels.

210
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,320
He doesn't mind second-hand good

211
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,960
as long as he thinks she's pretty.

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,200
Second Madam will pray at Taiying Temple
for a few days every month.

213
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,239
As a result, she should
be leaving tomorrow.

214
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,039
After she leaves,

215
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,359
let's tell Old Madam about it.

216
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,280
Those in the capital city,
who would dare to marry her now?

217
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,200
We do this for her own good.

218
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,880
Qiu Mei.

219
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,359
Qiu Mei, are you getting better?

220
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,760
Save it.

221
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Qiu Mei, I didn't mean

222
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,640
to hit you on the field today.

223
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,200
It was because of Qiu Yan...

224
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,760
Does it matter?

225
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,039
Anyway, it's a waste of time

226
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,960
to come here because of you.

227
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,919
Qiu Mei, I know

228
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,039
that it's all my fault.

229
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
But Qiu Mei,

230
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,440
Qiu Mei,

231
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,359
try to think about it.

232
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,200
You were injured
and I was punished today.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,320
Who would be pleased because of this?

234
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,239
Qin Xuan comes from a fine family,
he's kind and elegant.

235
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,359
Only people

236
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,159
like Qiu Mei who's the first daughter

237
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,679
could be his companion.

238
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,039
As an absolute minimum,

239
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm an illegitimate daughter,

240
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,760
but I'm at least a lady
who has yet to get married.

241
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,520
But Qiu Yan, she's a second-hand good.

242
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,960
What makes she think she's a fit?

243
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,919
You want to deal with Qiu Yan?

244
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,239
Are you enjoying
the night-blooming cereus?

245
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,679
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,039
They say it's a flash in the pan.

247
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
We've never seen how it looks
when it blossoms.

248
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,039
The night-blooming cereus is so small.

249
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,760
I think it won't blossom.

250
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:55,960
The night-blooming cereus is pretty,

251
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
but I think

252
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,039
you're prettier.

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,039
I wonder

254
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,520
- if you're interested in accompanying...
- Qin Xuan.

255
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,280
Qin Xuan, you're here, Qin Xuan.

256
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,400
Qin Xuan, you're here.

257
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
What are you looking for?

258
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,520
Have you seen
Second Young Lady of Qiu Residence?

259
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,919
Qin Xuan,

260
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,320
why do you have eyes
only for Qiu's young lady?

261
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,479
Why can't you see us?

262
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,039
- Yes.
- Right.

263
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,880
You've played with them

264
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,960
for so long in this morning.

265
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,320
Then,

266
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,840
you should accompany us now.

267
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,239
Yes, yes.

268
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,599
Qin Xuan,
let's enjoy the night-blooming cereus.

269
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,719
Young Master Meng,

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,359
why do you look so depressed?

271
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,039
What's the matter?

272
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,799
I think you've got the wrong guy.

273
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,760
Your Qin Xuan is over there.

274
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,880
At this rate,

275
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,200
just invite him

276
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
to the Chuiwan Party will do.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,280
Young Master Meng, ladies

278
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,039
have eyes only for Qin Xuan

279
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,320
but I couldn't forget

280
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,520
how great you were on the field.

281
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Are you for real?

282
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,942
(Yan)

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,960
Look.

284
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,880
Do you see this word?

285
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,160
Is this

286
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,359
Qiu Yan who causes
He family's second son's death?

287
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,319
Meng, don't get involved
with this kind of woman.

288
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,959
Yes.

289
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,520
She was in a rush
to shove this handkerchief

290
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,800
to my hand.

291
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,359
Wouldn't I be too heartless

292
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,839
if I rejected her?

293
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,920
Qiu Mei,

294
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,239
I only flattered Young Master Meng
with a few words

295
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,839
and he did whatever I said.

296
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,920
Thanks for your quick handwork.

297
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,000
In just a moment,

298
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
you've embroidered
the handkerchief with words.

299
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,680
Your idea was good.

300
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,119
I guess the matter

301
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,000
about the handkerchief
is all over the garden now.

302
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,119
Yes.

303
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,920
If my face wasn't swollen,

304
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,439
I would've walked out there
and taken a look.

305
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,439
Qin Xuan,

306
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,880
you came at the right time.

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Help me take a look at it.

308
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,560
Is this a character of bliss or curse?

309
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:55,920
Meng,

310
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm looking for my handkerchief.

311
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,880
I thought someone had

312
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
picked it up,

313
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,239
I see it's you who found it.

314
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:02,839
Thank you.

315
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,439
What do you mean by your handkerchief?

316
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,680
Clearly, Qiu Yan handed it to me.

317
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,160
To be honest with you,

318
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,719
I've fallen for a famous actress
in Six Flowers Troupe lately,

319
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,959
Miss Yan Xiang.

320
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,760
So I asked someone
to embroider this handkerchief

321
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,079
with a character of "Yan".

322
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,520
Besides,

323
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,800
you said that Miss Qiu Yan gave this
to you,

324
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,199
has anyone seen this?

325
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,359
No.

326
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,040
Meng,

327
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,319
even if you want to prove
that you're popular,

328
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,040
you can't just use my handkerchief

329
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,880
for your gift from Young Lady.

330
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,079
Qin Xuan, you mean
this is your handkerchief?

331
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,920
Do you have proof?

332
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,040
We're buddies.

333
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,400
If you're jealous,

334
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,920
you can just tell me.

335
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,040
I can prove it.

336
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,160
This handkerchief belongs to Qin Xuan.

337
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,359
I've seen him used it before.

338
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,560
Young Lady,

339
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,560
something has happened.

340
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,560
Young Master of Earl Yongyi Residence

341
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,920
took an unknown handkerchief

342
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,000
and said it was a gift from you.

343
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,760
Young Master Qin was about
to get into a fight with him.

344
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,119
Mei and Yin just won't give up.

345
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,160
Where is Qin Xuan?

346
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,920
Let me take you there.

347
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,119
They were right here just now.

348
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,520
Are you here for Qin Xuan?

349
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,079
It's none of your business.

350
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,599
Will it be my business

351
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,599
if I know where he is?

352
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,719
It's inconvenient for him

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,560
and Meng Yu
to talk in Marquis Yongming Residence

354
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,800
so they went out.

355
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,800
You don't believe it?

356
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,199
Then, you could just wait.

357
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,040
You wait here, I'll be right back.

358
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,839
Please.

359
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,920
Where is Qin Xuan?

360
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,599
Stop the boat.

361
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,479
Stop the boat!

362
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,359
Boatman, stop the boat.

363
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,280
Stop yelling.

364
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,000
Qin Xuan will be back to his house

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,280
when we pull over.

366
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,839
I fell into your trap

367
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,239
because of my carelessness.

368
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,479
Liang Yi,

369
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,880
you keep obstructing Qin Xuan and me.

370
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
as I don't let you approach Min'er.

371
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,560
You're so despicable.

372
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,079
You're too self-righteous.

373
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,599
You couldn't stop me
even if I wanted to marry Qiu Min.

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,439
Besides, I don't think

375
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,959
you'll sincerely treat Qin Xuan.

376
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,400
Whether I'm true to Qin Xuan or not,

377
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,599
you're in no position to judge it.

378
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,439
About He Feng,

379
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,880
I let you mess around in He family

380
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,680
as I pity you for suffering
from an unexpected accident.

381
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,319
But you should keep your nose clean

382
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,599
after you go home.

383
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,119
Who knows you use the affection
as a lever

384
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,199
to make bets on everyone.

385
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,119
If you hope to find a rich husband,

386
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,439
you can seduce anyone

387
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
except for Qin Xuan.

388
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,359
He is my best friend.

389
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,880
I won't just sit by and watch.

390
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,439
Lord Liang, do you mean the thing
between Young Master Meng and me?

391
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,239
Believe it or not.

392
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,160
I've never seduced Young Master Meng.

393
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,800
You're self-righteous in front of me.

394
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,439
But you've been exposed.

395
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,719
Meng Yu told me in person

396
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,079
that you gave him this handkerchief.

397
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,079
The character of Yan
was embroidered on it.

398
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,239
This handkerchief is not mine.

399
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,359
Ask yourself.

400
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,479
As Qin Xuan and Meng Yu are friends,

401
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,160
if I really wanted to date two men,

402
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,959
and gave Meng Yu the handkerchief
to seduce him,

403
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,319
I would've hidden it from public view.

404
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,599
Why would I embroider

405
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,599
the handkerchief with my name?

406
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,239
Even if I was silly enough

407
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,800
to gave Meng Yu a handkerchief
which is embroidered with my name,

408
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,760
but it was stitched
using the boundary method.

409
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,640
I hate needlework the most.

410
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,000
It's impossible for me

411
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,680
to make such delicate embroidery.

412
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,199
Lord Liang, you can investigate it
if you don't believe in me.

413
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:02,880
So you're saying

414
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
that Meng Yu frames you?

415
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,959
Why would he frame you for no reason?

416
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,040
I only met Meng Yu today.

417
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,560
He certainly has no reason to do that.

418
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,359
But someone in my family
has reason to do it.

419
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,079
If I'm not mistaken,

420
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,479
only Qiu Ying, the fourth daughter,
uses the boundary method in Qiu Residence.

421
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,719
You can ask about it.

422
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,199
Goodbye.

423
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:26,635
(Marquis Yongming Residence)

424
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,319
Qiu Min,

425
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,719
are you going back?

426
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,839
Where is your sister?

427
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,439
Qingdai said Miss Xue wanted
to talk to Qiu Yan.

428
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,520
So she'll go back later.

429
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,839
I see.

430
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,040
I'll just wait for her.

431
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Qin Xuan, are you not going back?

432
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,119
I haven't seen Qiu Yan
since we were at Chuiwan Party.

433
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,599
I think I should say goodbye
to her in person before I leave.

434
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,479
You go back first.

435
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,479
Aunt is waiting for you.

436
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:09,880
Fine.

437
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,239
Even if you have no relationship
with Meng Yu,

438
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,119
about everything you've done to Qin Xuan

439
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,959
in Chuiwan Party,

440
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,920
have I misjudged you?

441
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,959
The tricks you used,

442
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,359
although Qin Xuan couldn't notice them,

443
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:21,719
I saw it all with a clearness.

444
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,199
Lord Liang, as you saw it all
with a clearness,

445
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,520
isn't it because you're

446
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,719
the same kind of person?

447
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,599
Comparing to the ruthless means
you used

448
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,560
to win over He family
in order to achieve your goal,

449
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,959
these little tricks of mine

450
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,680
are a lesser evil than yours.

451
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,079
But I never used love
to scheme against others.

452
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,119
Isn't it love too

453
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,359
even if I get it by using tricks?

454
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,520
How could every relationship fall
into place?

455
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,520
There are many professions in the world,

456
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,160
painstaking efforts
and hard work are required

457
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,239
in every profession.

458
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,680
Tricks are also being used
in the imperial examination,

459
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,079
verses and poetry.

460
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Why is it worth being praised

461
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,160
if it's used to make a living
and to pursue aspirations and fames?

462
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,719
But why must the women

463
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,280
be sitting around
and waiting for a godsend

464
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,719
when it comes to the relationship?

465
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,160
Lord Liang, will you wait
for the criminals

466
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,239
to grow a conscience
when you interrogate them?

467
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,520
In your opinion,

468
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:08,599
falling into place

469
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,280
and a match made in heaven don't exist
in the world.

470
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,400
I believe there's love at first sight

471
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,920
in this world.

472
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,560
Just that

473
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,760
I don't think I could have
this kind of luck.

474
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,079
Do you know my grandmother wants

475
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,280
to marry me off

476
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
to a dying old man

477
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,719
as his concubine
after the suspension of business?

478
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,439
If I don't grab this chance,

479
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I'll be trapped

480
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,800
in the richly ornamented residence

481
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,040
and I'll become a dependent person

482
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,280
who competes with those concubines
for the rest of my life.

483
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,520
In your eyes, I'm a social climber.

484
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,959
In the others' eyes,
I'm a broken woman who's got rejected.

485
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,760
Qin Xuan is the only one who treats me
as a regular person.

486
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,520
He respects and understands me.

487
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,760
Among a person like him

488
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,199
and an old man
who's a complete stranger,

489
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,479
who would you choose?

490
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,359
Or maybe Lord Liang thinks

491
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,760
that I should just accept my fate.

492
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,839
You said that I wasn't sincere.

493
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,800
May I ask Lord Liang

494
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,359
if you're really sincere
to my younger sister?

495
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,680
Goodbye.

496
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,035
(Marquis Yongming Residence)

497
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,760
- Take care.
- Take care, goodbye.

498
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:32,880
Take care.

499
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,000
- We'll head back first.
- See you.

500
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,079
Qingdai.

501
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,199
Young Lady, what takes you so long?

502
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
The people in the garden are dismissed.

503
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
First Madam has brought the ladies back.

504
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,439
It's complicated.

505
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,839
Is there no one else in this garden?

506
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,400
All of them have left.

507
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,400
Let's just go back, then.

508
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,000
Qiu Yan.

509
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,599
Qin Xuan.

510
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,439
You haven't gone back yet?

511
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,760
I wish to see you before leaving.

512
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,680
I've been looking for you.

513
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
The handkerchief that Meng Yu had...

514
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,359
Say no more.

515
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,520
Follow me.

516
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,599
I've noticed this night-blooming
cereus since the daytime.

517
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,040
They said it won't blossom today.

518
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,079
But I think

519
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,359
anything can be achieved with a will.

520
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
Do you think it'll blossom tonight?

521
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,239
Qin Xuan,

522
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,959
don't you want to hear my side
of the handkerchief matter?

523
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,079
I know.

524
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,239
There's nothing between you and Meng Yu.

525
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,560
I was mad because he ruined
your reputation in public.

526
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,800
Don't worry.

527
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,359
I'll believe in you no matter what kind

528
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
of rumour it is.

529
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,319
Qiu Yan,

530
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,119
I understand you're
in a harder situation

531
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,439
than you were before.

532
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,479
But the hard time will pass.

533
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,760
When I was little,

534
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,680
Madam Liu was biased
towards my younger brother.

535
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,239
She scolded and beat me because of him.

536
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,079
At that time, I told myself

537
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,719
that everything will be fine
when I grew up.

538
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,640
But now that I've grown up.

539
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,959
But nothing is getting better.

540
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
The master
from Taiying Temple has told me

541
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,760
that everything in this world happens
for a reason,

542
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,040
that the bliss
and curse are interconnected.

543
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,079
The toughest one's life was in the past,

544
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,640
one will be compensated in the future.

545
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,199
Nonsense.

546
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,239
This is the reality.

547
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,439
Not to mention me,

548
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,280
just like Mr. Zhao and Miss Yueying.

549
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,280
The grievances they've suffered

550
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,400
haven't been redressed.

551
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,239
Bliss and curse are interconnected?

552
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,319
It's just to comfort people.

553
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,119
Actually, I thought

554
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,719
these words were funny at first.

555
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,520
But ever since I met you,

556
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,719
I've increasingly wanted the things
master said to come true.

557
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,079
Actually, Mr. Zhao

558
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,359
and Miss Yueying are safe.

559
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,199
Really?

560
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,400
You sent someone to take care of them?

561
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,520
Kind of.

562
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,719
I can't say much about it.

563
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,920
Anyway, they're still locked up
in the jail

564
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,719
but they are safe.

565
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,239
Qin Xuan,

566
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,280
I'm starting to believe

567
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,599
in what that master said.

568
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,719
It blossoms.

569
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,719
It really blossoms.

570
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,599
It takes a long time to blossom

571
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,839
but the time will come.

572
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:27,713
(Qiu Residence)

573
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,599
This time, I'll stay at Taiying Temple
for a little bit longer.

574
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,719
You two have to listen to Master.

575
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,079
Don't leave the second chamber
unless it's essential.

576
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,239
Yes.

577
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,439
Mother, you have to take care
of yourself.

578
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,119
Min'er, go help Xiuyu.

579
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,119
I've informed Madam Dong
from the East Side Door.

580
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,319
During this period,

581
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,520
just go to her if you want
to exchange a letter with Qin Xuan.

582
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,719
I got it, Mother.

583
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,839
Mother, get in the carriage.

584
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,400
Okay.

585
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,400
Careful, Mother.

586
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,119
Okay.

587
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,920
(Sincere)

588
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:27,920
Young Lady,

589
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,000
Madam Dong handed this to me.

590
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,240
(To Qiu Yan)

591
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,280
(I heard you like
to read legal case novels.)

592
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,680
(This is the latest chapter
of Donghu Grievance Collection.)

593
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,079
(It hasn't been printed.)

594
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,160
(So I copied it by hand.)

595
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,560
(Hope that you don't mind.)

596
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,723
(The planting of night-blooming cereus
ends well)

597
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:42,703
(and it's lucky to see it blossoms...)

598
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,324
(Qiu Yan)

599
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:04,969
(Qin Residence)

600
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,400
(Qin Residence)
Madam, Master is back.

601
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:07,839
My lord.

602
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,479
Xuan'er.

603
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:12,599
Father.

604
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,640
I saw you've been going out lately.

605
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,160
Do you have eyes for a lady?

606
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,920
Whoever you have eyes for,

607
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:21,920
there's only one rule.

608
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,800
Do not do something obscene and immoral.

609
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,319
My lord, don't you know
what kind of person

610
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,560
Xuan'er is?

611
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,359
But I think

612
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Minister Xue's daughter is a fine lady.

613
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,959
Mother, I have no intention
of finding a wife.

614
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,280
Father,

615
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,385
I want to train myself

616
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:42,479
at the Imperial Guards Camp
in the suburb of the capital city.

617
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
You used to reject us

618
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,680
when we asked you to go there.

619
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,319
What's with the sudden whim?

620
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:48,920
Right.

621
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,280
It's not a place for fun.

622
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,439
You'll have to live in wilderness

623
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,760
no matter who you are.

624
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,079
Don't be silly.

625
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,560
Mother, Father,

626
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,319
I didn't decide it on a whim.

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,640
At the beginning of the dynasty,

628
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,839
my ancestors and Emperor Wu built
the dynasty together.

629
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,359
That's how Duke Residence
was established.

630
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,920
I'm your child,
as the descendant of Qin family,

631
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,239
how could I stay at home
and do nothing in the prime of life?

632
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,359
I wish to get ahead

633
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,400
to win honor for you.

634
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,880
Father, I hope you can agree to it.

635
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,079
It's good that you're ambitious.

636
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,920
I'll sign you up for it later.

637
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:27,800
Thank you, Father.

638
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,040
I haven't used it for a long time,
it's rusted.

639
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,319
Take it to the smithy later.

640
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,319
Yes.

641
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:43,160
Sir, are you really going to serve
in the camp in suburb of the capital?

642
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,400
Qiu Yan is a lady
of particular parentage.

643
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,199
If I want to convince Father and Mother,

644
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,680
I'll have to gain more clout to do that.

645
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,640
At least I'll have a job
if I go to the camp.

646
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,319
And if I receive credit,

647
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,800
I could propose to Qiu Yan by then.

648
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,760
So that Father and Mother could say
nothing more.

649
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,760
I see.

650
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,400
No wonder you didn't answer Master

651
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,880
when he asked you if you had eyes

652
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:03,839
for a lady.

653
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,319
If I had told him that,

654
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,959
they would've rejected me.

655
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,719
Then, there would be no turning back.

656
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,080
That was very thoughtful of you, Sir.

657
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,320
I'm envious of Liang Yi
at a time like this

658
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,560
(because he has a job
and he gains trust from the palace.)

659
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,600
(That he can make his own decisions.)

660
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,199
Xia Zhengji,
official of Ministry of Revenue,

661
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,040
greets Your Majesty.

662
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,560
Liang Yi, inspector of Firewood Office,
greets Your Majesty.

663
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,360
As usual, the Ministry of Revenue

664
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,479
has allocated

665
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,919
300,000 taels
for your Majesty's birthday next month.

666
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,959
Your Majesty,

667
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,159
the magic pill has been developed.

668
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,560
As is customary.

669
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,520
I've always wanted
to build three more temples

670
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,840
at the imperial park

671
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,360
to pray for the people.

672
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:23,040
It'll cost over a million taels
to build three temples.

673
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,959
The Ministry of Revenue couldn't
afford that much.

674
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
Your Majesty, I have an idea.

675
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,520
It can share your burden

676
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,040
and it won't cost much.

677
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,040
The clan associations in the capital
should donate to share

678
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,159
the cost of building the temples.

679
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,239
Okay.

680
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,520
The Ministry of Revenue
should create a statute.

681
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:46,080
You can't do that.

682
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,120
Lord Liang's idea would put

683
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,879
the clans and scholars
on the backburner.

684
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,439
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

685
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,320
By the way, Liang Yi,

686
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,280
what are you going to report?

687
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,479
Xiang Zhengji,
the official of Ministry of Revenue,

688
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,679
embezzled the public funds
which amounted to several thousand taels.

689
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,199
Firewood Office has identified it.

690
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,679
It's left for your decision.

691
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,360
I...

692
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm innocent!

693
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,080
Search Xia Zhengji's house.

694
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:23,848
(Xia Residence)

695
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's go, hurry up!

696
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,639
Go, hurry up!

697
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,679
Go over there!

698
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,719
Stand still!

699
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,199
Stand still, go over there!

700
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,199
Go!

701
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Sir, we've finished checking the assets.

702
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,560
There are 123 pieces
of pure gold jewelry,

703
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,919
30 strings of pearls,
nine strings of beads,

704
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,840
231 pieces of jades,

705
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,679
90 pieces of leather goods,

706
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:45,919
500 taels of pure gold,

707
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,479
5,300 taels of silver,

708
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,479
and 14,000 taels.

709
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,959
You could make it to the annual income

710
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,600
of the Ministry of Revenue
if you put more effort into it.

711
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Confiscate the gold,
silver and jades artifacts.

712
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,760
Hand the taels to the Ministry of Works

713
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,000
as the money for His Majesty
to build the temples.

714
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,560
Sir, there's one more thing.

715
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,879
Upon inspection of these 14,000 taels,

716
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,840
11,000 taels of them are forged.

717
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:15,239
These taels

718
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:16,719
were collected

719
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,919
from all over.

720
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm unaware of it, I'm serious.

721
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,199
Take him back to Firewood Office
and interrogate him.

722
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,199
Yes.

723
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:31,944
(Xia Residence)

724
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,120
(Firewood Office searched)

725
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,879
(Xia family all night yesterday.)

726
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,000
Old Madam Xia fainted
as she saw the people

727
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,879
from Firewood Office searched the house.

728
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,879
She hasn't woken up yet.

729
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,199
I guess the donation is unavoidable.

730
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,639
Jiang,

731
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,679
how much should our family donate
by right?

732
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,360
Five thousand taels.

733
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,760
Just pay it with the public account.

734
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:07,439
Hand the account book to Madam Xu later.

735
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,120
Let her handle this.

736
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,760
Yes, Madam Xu has worked
with you for many years.

737
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,560
She'll conduct it
in the most impartial manner.

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,760
The granges have just reported
on the heavy flooding.

739
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,959
Now that we have to donate money.

740
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:25,159
The spending is higher than the income.

741
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,000
We have to scrimp

742
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,760
from now on.

743
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
Unlike before.

744
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,159
Old Madam,

745
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,479
it's not that we suffer
from a complete lack of income.

746
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,320
My distant relative

747
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,639
that I mentioned to you last time.

748
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,959
He's willing to pay even more

749
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,679
as he knows
it's the lady from Qiu Family.

750
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,719
Stop thinking about this.

751
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,000
Yan is an insolent girl

752
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,760
but she's never made

753
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,000
any serious mistakes.

754
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,000
Yet, you're already talking

755
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,919
about selling her to the merchant
as a concubine.

756
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,719
You'll be ashamed
to meet the second chamber.

757
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,639
Even I

758
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
can't face her father.

759
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,120
As Old Madam has spoken,

760
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:22,600
it seems like this method won't work.

761
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,120
You don't understand
what Old Madam said.

762
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,560
Selling her was inexcusable
as she didn't make

763
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,040
any serious mistakes.

764
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,040
What if she makes mistakes?

765
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,639
What mistake could she make?

766
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,560
How would I know that?

767
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,879
Speaking of which,

768
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,080
I have no beef with Yan

769
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,239
and I'm not lacking money

770
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,879
so I don't have to get involved in it.

771
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,120
There are many kinds of stuff

772
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,639
you've exchanged with Young Master Qin.

773
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,199
Yet, you still refuse
to break it to him.

774
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,399
What is this for?

775
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,840
The relationship between man
and woman is like playing chess.

776
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,439
The one who first pours out the feelings
will result in a loss of sovereignty.

777
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,040
I'll never confess before he does it.

778
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,159
But I heard

779
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,040
the people from First chamber talking
in the garden today.

780
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,360
That Qin Family is seeking around
to find a wife for Young Master Qin.

781
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,760
There are many people having eyes

782
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,520
for a talent like him.

783
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Young Lady, you shouldn't miss it.

784
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,120
You're right.

785
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,560
It's best not to miss it.

786
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,040
I have to quickly find a way

787
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,919
to make Qin Xuan say it first.

788
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,203
(Heming Building)

789
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:46,588
(The orphan girl becomes a nun,
breaking her vows to meet the scholar)

790
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:55,199
(Today's title: Autumn River)
Mr. Pan.

791
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,520
Mr. Pan.

792
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,159
Mr. Pan.

793
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,719
Seems like it's more interesting
to listen to the opera out here.

794
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,800
As long as you like it, Mother.

795
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,760
Hualin Troupe is a troupe from Yuezhou.

796
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,120
It's rare that they come
to the capital city.

797
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,040
You're used to listening
to the North Opera.

798
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,959
You should listen
to the South Opera this time.

799
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:22,679
Okay.

800
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,040
This way, please.

801
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:39,679
Sir,

802
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,360
look.

803
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:51,080
She has a date with a man
at the theatre in public.

804
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,280
She is indeed unscrupulous.

805
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,719
Customers, please enjoy.

806
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,520
Mr. Qin, Miss Qiu,

807
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,560
my master and Madam Jin are in the loft.

808
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:09,840
As you're here,

809
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,679
they invite you to come upstairs
to enjoy the opera.

810
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,005
(The orphan girl becomes a nun,
breaking her vows to meet the scholar)

811
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,527
(Today's title: Autumn River)

812
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,496
(With superior skills,
He takes the first place)

813
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:41,679
Sir.

814
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,840
Qin Xuan,

815
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
you're here to enjoy the new opera?

816
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,600
Greeting to Madam Jin.

817
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,000
It's been a while.

818
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:49,919
Is your mother doing well?

819
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,120
She felt a little sick a while back.

820
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,560
She has felt better in these few days.

821
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,360
Come, sit down.

822
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,360
Sit down and talk.

823
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,800
Is this your new servant?

824
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,360
Why is she so ignorant?

825
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,199
The master is enjoying the opera.

826
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,719
How could she sit here?

827
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,239
Is she some kind of a young lady?

828
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,679
So you're in disguise
and secretly dating.

829
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,040
Qin Xuan, you've committed
a terrible crime.

830
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,719
Lord, you're absolutely right.

831
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,239
Sorry to violate the rules as it's
my first visit to Duke Ying Residence.

832
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,919
Yi'er, have some sense of propriety.

833
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:30,840
Qin Xuan doesn't look

834
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,919
like an immature kid who screws around.

835
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,840
Come, have a seat.

836
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,080
It's all right
that you don't know the rules.

837
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:42,239
As long as you're willing to learn.

838
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,239
The most important capacity of a servant

839
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,520
is to be observant.

840
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,520
You should understand

841
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,320
what your master wants at just a glance.

842
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,679
First Madam, First Madam.

843
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:32,520
The second chamber's girl
and Qin Xuan are

844
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,360
secretly dating and enjoying opera
at Heming Building.

845
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,120
Really?

846
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:37,399
Yes.

847
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,679
My subordinates watched
them being together.

848
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:43,040
That's very bold of her.

849
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:45,199
Who lets her out?

850
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,919
Quickly send someone to bring her back.

851
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:47,560
First Madam,

852
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,719
are you going to let go

853
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,399
of this great chance just like this?

854
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:54,479
First Madam, think about it.

855
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,320
If we only bring her back,

856
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,239
perhaps she'll accuse us of framing her

857
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,520
as she's eloquent.

858
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:02,399
But if we send someone

859
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,199
to catch her red-handed with Qin Xuan,

860
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,399
we'll have solid proof
of her violating the family rules.

861
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:07,639
By then,

862
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,560
she'll be at your disposal.

863
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,479
But if we catch them in public,

864
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,239
won't this embarrass Qin Family as well?

865
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,280
Anyway, our daughters

866
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,080
couldn't marry into Duke Ying Residence.

867
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,439
What makes Yan have the ability

868
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:23,040
to approach this rich family?

869
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:26,600
Now that our family is short of money.

870
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:28,280
Even Madam Qin

871
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,360
will thank you
for disciplining her child.
