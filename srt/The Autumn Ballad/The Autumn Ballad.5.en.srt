=Episode 5=

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,720
Liang Yi?

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,919
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,639
I just finished talking with your dad.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,040
So I stopped by to see you.

22
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,279
Why would you want to see me?

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm just a rich idler.

24
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,879
I'm no match to Marquis Weiyuan.

25
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,120
You've been doing great business.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,000
What's wrong?

27
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,279
Are you angry at me
because of He family?

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,279
How would I dare?

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,119
Let me ask you.

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,520
Did you send someone to the jail

31
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,240
to take care of Zhao Mingli?

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,559
How did you know that?

33
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:16,720
In the capital city,

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,320
nothing could be hidden
from Firewood Office.

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,279
Let alone you.

36
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,080
I have some advice for you.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Zhao Mingli and that girl are
at Firewood Office now.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,080
Stop sending money
to Fengjing Prefecture.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
You're being taken advantage of

40
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,360
by those guys in Fengjing Prefecture.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
Both of them are at Firewood Office?

42
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,720
You protect them two?

43
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,919
I knew it.

44
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,679
You're not a cold-hearted man.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
Who told you that?

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,080
Don't talk nonsense
if you don't know anything.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,440
Look at you.

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
I'll write Qiu Yan a letter about this.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
So that she could rest assured.

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,639
Stop there.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,320
They would die if you told her this.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
Fine, I'll listen to you.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,199
I won't tell her.

54
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,320
Why is this fan here?

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,440
Madam has invited Qiu's daughters over
to play cards this morning.

56
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,919
One of the ladies must've left it.

57
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,960
I think it belongs to Qiu Min.

58
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,960
I saw her used it when we were eating.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
Qiu Min?

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,240
She is Qiu Yan's younger sister,
Qiu Min.

61
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,279
She is my cousin too.

62
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,360
Give it to me, I'll return it to her.

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,880
I found it, I'll return it to her.

64
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,199
Let's try another day.

65
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,000
Why must it be another day?

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,279
We're in our uniform today.

67
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,240
This would scare her.

68
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,520
Please pass the message.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,360
That Third Young Lady of Qiu Family
left something at my place.

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,399
She wanted to look for it.

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
Are you looking for a folding fan?

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,880
Yes.

73
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,000
I found it
at Duke Ying Residence's garden.

74
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,679
I never thought it was yours.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,519
Thank you.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,399
May I know your name?

77
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,200
So that I could send you
a gift to thank you.

78
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:35,680
(Evil-Purger)

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
What's your name?

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,079
I haven't known your name yet.

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
It's a trivial matter.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,399
Don't mind it.

83
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,239
Let's go.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,440
Fate brings people together
no matter how far apart they may be.

85
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,559
I didn't expect Third Young Lady
of Qiu Family

86
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,079
was the young lady
you rescued back then.

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,799
However,

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,359
why does she seem to have

89
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,480
no impression of you?

90
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,480
Seeing her being well-educated,

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
she's different compared
to that stubborn girl back then.

92
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,720
I guess she must be doing well.

93
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,279
It's good to forget

94
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,799
those bad memories about the past.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,799
As you made a scene
in front of the matchmaker,

96
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,519
I'm afraid no one would dare
to propose to you in the future.

97
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,399
I'm worried about you.

98
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,799
That's great. I'll be less troublesome.

99
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,239
But you can't just stay at home
for your entire life.

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,679
Even if Seond Madam agrees with it,

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,119
Old Madam and the others
wouldn't accept it.

102
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,839
I can't take care of all things now.

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,040
I thought everything would be fine
after we returned from He Residence.

104
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,679
If I knew it'd become this way,

105
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,799
I'd rather stay in the temple,
it'd be clean and quiet.

106
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,239
The temple has its own difficulties.

107
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,399
Life is nothing more than forging ahead

108
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,720
or you'll fall behind.

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,160
Men are free,
they'll naturally have ways.

110
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,000
But we're women.

111
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,079
There's nothing we can do
to forge ahead.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,079
How nice would it be
if we were this wisp of smoke?

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
So that we can go

114
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,359
anywhere we like with the wind.

115
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,000
Qingdai,

116
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,519
will there be a day

117
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,320
which women can read

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,679
and study freely like the men?

119
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,480
That we can take the liberty
to choose our mate for life.

120
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,679
And we don't have to be despised
and controlled by our families.

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,239
Miss, don't you want to open the gift

122
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,480
from Young Master Qin?

123
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,760
Qin Xuan gave them jade pendants.

124
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,679
He casually asked Min'er
to bring one to me.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,519
It's just a courtesy.

126
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
Miss,

127
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,040
it's not a jade pendant,

128
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,559
it's a wooden hairpin.

129
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,959
Let me have a look.

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
First Young Lady and Fourth Young Lady

131
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,399
got jade pendants.

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,559
But he gave us a broken piece of wood.

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,279
When we were at He Residence,

134
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,119
seeing Young Master Qin helping you
that way,

135
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,920
I thought he was a nice guy.

136
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
I didn't expect he was a snob, too.

137
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,920
(Lonely smoke straight in the desert,)

138
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,160
long river setting a round sunset.

139
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,000
Even if it's a wisp of smoke,

140
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,079
one day, it'll go straight
to the blue sky.

141
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,839
There are always options

142
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,559
as long as we don't give up.

143
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,359
I'll throw it away for you now.

144
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,079
Don't.

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,799
It's a wooden hairpin,

146
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,440
but it means something.

147
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,839
Could a wood be better than a jade?

148
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,600
He knew that I was trapped here.

149
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,359
He wanted to use

150
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,600
this wooden hairpin
to advise me not to sulk.

151
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:23,880
But

152
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,239
there's no lettering

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
on it.

154
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,679
Put it on me, I want to try it.

155
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,880
Yes.

156
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:51,159
Sir, Madam said she'll send
the matchmaker to Qiu Residence

157
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,479
to propose after you look
over these betrothal gifts.

158
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,000
You go tell Madam

159
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
to postpone the proposal
for several days.

160
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,440
If she wants to know why,

161
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
just tell her that I have my reasons.

162
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:01,599
Yes.

163
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:10,320
Sir, why do you want to postpone it?

164
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,479
If the matchmaker went to propose,

165
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,679
of course Qiu Family
wouldn't reject it.

166
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,960
Just that I don't know
how Qiu Min feels about me.

167
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Why would you care about her feelings?

168
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,359
Since ancient times, a lady's marriage

169
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,200
has been decided by the parents
and arranged by the matchmaker.

170
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,239
I saw her as an ordinary lady.

171
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,880
I'd just marry her.

172
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,520
But I never thought

173
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,719
that she was the little girl
I rescued back then.

174
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,679
As I rescued her back then,

175
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,280
why would I make her marry

176
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,119
a man she doesn't like?

177
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,880
Sir, you should just tell her the truth.

178
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,320
That you're her benefactor.

179
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm sure she'll agree with it.

180
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Threatening a lady with a small favor,

181
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,039
what would it make me then?

182
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,559
What's your plan?

183
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,239
Tomorrow,

184
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,400
you stop by Marquis Yongming Residence.

185
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,480
(Invitation card)

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,051
(First Madam Qiu, Jiang, Marquis Yongming
Residence will hold Chuiwan)

187
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:05,619
(in the late spring, Qiu's young ladies
are invited to the party)

188
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,840
Traditionally, only the children
of the third-rank officials

189
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,039
or the officials
with a higher ranking can attend

190
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,479
Chuiwan Party
in Marquis Yongming Residence.

191
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,080
Second Brother is
a fourth-rank official.

192
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,239
Why did they send the invitation card
to our residence?

193
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,599
Marquis Yongming Residence
has been officials for generations

194
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,159
and it's supported by the palace.

195
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,000
The officials and their wives

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,760
in the capital city will attend
Chuiwan Party every year.

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,599
Ostensibly,

198
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,799
it's a party.

199
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:34,039
In fact, it provides chances
for the royal princes

200
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,919
to meet young ladies.

201
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
(Madam Kou, Qiu Hong's concubine)

202
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm afraid someone has already had
their eyes on our daughters.

203
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,119
Those who can attend Chuiwan Party

204
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,719
have higher status than our family.

205
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,679
That's our daughters' karma.

206
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,400
You don't have to show your happiness
on your face.

207
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
People will look down on you.

208
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:53,767
Old Madam has agreed to it.

209
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,400
We, Qiu family, will send
three young ladies over.

210
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,280
Three?

211
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,719
Old Madam didn't allow Yan to go.

212
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,080
Didn't she say she's weak
and hard to recover that day?

213
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,760
Just let her stay at home to recuperate.

214
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,400
I knew that Old Madam

215
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
wouldn't let you off the hook easily.

216
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,359
Obviously, she's trying
to embarrass you.

217
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,440
It's expected.

218
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,960
There's nothing to be mad about.

219
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,679
Didn't you want to thank
Young Master Qin in person?

220
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,039
I thought that you could meet him
at Chuiwan Party.

221
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,559
It's impossible now.

222
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,119
I must thank Qin Xuan
for sending me this gift.

223
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,760
You go tell Second Madam

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,679
that I have to go out
tomorrow afternoon.

225
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,119
I'll be back in one hour.

226
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:44,588
(Liang Residence)

227
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,799
Sir, Sir, Sir,

228
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,919
it's the letter
from Marquis Yongming Residence.

229
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,479
It said all three young ladies
from Qiu family would attend it.

230
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,119
Including Qiu Min.

231
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,080
Young Master,

232
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,000
Second Young Lady of Qiu Residence sends
us an invitation card.

233
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,000
Miss Qiu Yan?

234
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,239
How is it possible?

235
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,239
I think it's Third Young Lady
of Qiu family. You've misheard it.

236
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,919
Sir Jin, I didn't hear it wrong.

237
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,359
It's Second Young Lady of Qiu family.

238
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,599
She asked to meet me at Guiyun Building.

239
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,400
She is Qiu Min's sister.

240
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
I must show her some respect.

241
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,400
Greeting to Lord Liang.

242
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,840
This is from our Young Lady.

243
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,280
What does Miss Qiu Yan mean by this?

244
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,119
My Young Lady said

245
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Lord Liang will understand it
by seeing it.

246
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,799
Qiu Yan.

247
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,640
You've put a lot of effort into it.

248
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,760
I think Lord Liang

249
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,719
must've understood what I wanted.

250
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,440
You wanted to use this stone
to remind me

251
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
that I was the one
who switched your gift

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,159
for Noble Consort to a stone.

253
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,919
I owed you this.

254
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,679
You want to attend Chuiwan Party.

255
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,640
Unfortunately, your engagement
with He family is broken off.

256
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
You've dishonoured your family.

257
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,640
So they want you to keep a low profile.

258
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:20,559
You want me to help you.

259
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,960
I like to talk with you, Lord Liang.

260
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,840
As it's easy.

261
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,119
If I didn't misremember it,

262
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,679
you said that

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,960
you hate me.

264
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,479
Why would I help

265
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
a person who hates me?

266
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,760
I couldn't help it if you insisted

267
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,159
not doing me this favour.

268
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,479
But I bet that you're unwilling

269
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,760
to owe anyone any favours.

270
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,760
You're arrogant.

271
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,159
Sir,

272
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,640
Miss Qiu Yan doesn't seem
like a sociable person.

273
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,159
Why would she take
Chuiwan Party so seriously?

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,320
Everyone knows that there'll be

275
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,760
many royal princes at Chuiwan Party.

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,119
I guess she has decided
to be a social climber.

277
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,440
I've never seen

278
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,559
a lady as shameless as she is before.

279
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,200
These four Chuiwan Rods

280
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,119
are made of the finest scented Rosewood
which is picked during autumn and winter

281
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,559
and they're made
during spring and autumn.

282
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,119
The rubber is mutually adhered,
it's a suitable time to make them.

283
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,919
I'm sure
the Young Ladies can take the top slot

284
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
by using them to compete.

285
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,239
Thank you, Madam.

286
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,679
Just that

287
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,960
Qiu family replied that only
three young ladies would attend it.

288
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,679
There's an extra one.

289
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,239
The extra one

290
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,880
is for Second Young Lady, Miss Qiu Yan.

291
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,239
Please have a seat.

292
00:14:59,221 --> 00:14:59,885
(Walking under the moonlight)

293
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Miss, you didn't see it.

294
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,200
First Madam looked awful.

295
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,719
And she became surly
and said that you're so capable.

296
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,159
I never thought
Lord Liang would be willing to help you.

297
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,799
Just that

298
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,840
I don't understand

299
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,520
why you didn't ask

300
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,520
Young Master Qin to help you
with this matter.

301
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,239
The reason I attend it is
to thank Qin Xuan.

302
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,919
How could I ask him a favor?

303
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,919
As for Liang Yi,

304
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
he went to any lengths to use me,

305
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,719
then I should just use him for this.

306
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,559
It's a two-way street.

307
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,400
Let's go.

308
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,719
Yan'er,

309
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,640
be honest with me.

310
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,039
How did you know
the wife of Marquis Yongming?

311
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,880
Is it because of Qin Xuan?

312
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,760
You've told me

313
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,840
that Qin Xuan had helped you a lot

314
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,359
when you were at He Residence.

315
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,719
He sounds like a righteous kid.

316
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,840
Is it because of him?

317
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,280
Nothing gets by you, Mother.

318
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,159
When we had dinner
at Duke Ying Residence,

319
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,880
Qin Xuan asked Min'er
to bring this hairpin to me.

320
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,679
He has indeed
put a lot of effort into it.

321
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,200
As I'm at Qiu Residence,

322
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,760
everyone despises me,

323
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,239
except you, Mother, you're nice to me.

324
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,159
After I came back from He Residence,

325
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,919
it became more serious.

326
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,119
This hairpin is like the skyglow

327
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,599
in the dark clouds

328
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,000
to me.

329
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,159
I can't help but grab it.

330
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,559
I want to get close to it.

331
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,199
I never thought
that Qin Xuan would be so attentive.

332
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,280
But Duke Ying Residence
has been officials for generations.

333
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,800
It's out of our league.

334
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,119
But if I don't take a leap of faith,

335
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:18,400
I could only marry
to that strange bones.

336
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,719
I remember you've told me

337
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,719
that it's tough to be a woman.

338
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,400
We have to bear kids and educate them.

339
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,040
There are many hardships
we have to go through

340
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
in our lives.

341
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,959
But I'm not afraid to suffer.

342
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,239
I want to entrust my life

343
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to a man who's genuinely nice to me.

344
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
I don't want to entrust

345
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,119
my life to another in a haze.

346
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,959
I understand.

347
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,839
But I'm worried

348
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,479
this will get you into great trouble
if you do this.

349
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,760
I don't understand

350
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,280
why women should be controlled.

351
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,719
Why can't we have our own ambitions?

352
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,319
We can't speak it out even if we have.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,880
I always remember

354
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,119
the poem you used to read me,

355
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,520
Spring Excursion.

356
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:06,160
If I could just be married to him,

357
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,719
my destiny would be forever set.

358
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,719
He might at last forsake me,

359
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,079
I'd have nothing to regret.

360
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,520
No matter how it ends,

361
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,599
I want to fight for it.

362
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,880
So that I won't regret.

363
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,280
Okay.

364
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,520
Since you've made up your mind,

365
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,239
just go at ease tomorrow.

366
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,760
Since ancient times, young men will
always pursue a fair lady.

367
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,280
Who sets the rule

368
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,760
that a lady couldn't take
the initiative?

369
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,280
Yes.

370
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,400
I'll be the one.

371
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,640
You'll be the one.

372
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,319
Hurry up, let's go there.

373
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,359
It's so lively.

374
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,280
Let's go, go there, let's go.

375
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,959
Come here.

376
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,000
Marquis Yongming is very generous.

377
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,119
- Madam is coming.
- Madam is here.

378
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
- Madam.
- Madam.

379
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,599
Madam is here.

380
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,880
Madam, you're here.

381
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,319
How are the young ladies doing?

382
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,280
They're ready.

383
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Sorry for the inadequate care.

384
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Don't mention it.

385
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,760
Min'er.

386
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,920
I'll take a look over there.

387
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,560
Sure.

388
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,040
You've done a great job
on the thing I requested.

389
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,839
I never owed anyone any favours.

390
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,839
From now on, we're even.

391
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,199
That's all I wanted.

392
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,400
However,

393
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,839
why do you come to Chuiwan Party?

394
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:04,959
What about you?

395
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Why did you go to such lengths
to come here?

396
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:21,839
Qiu Yan,

397
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,800
what's wrong with you?

398
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,959
Are you upset?

399
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,079
Look at that man.

400
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:33,719
I saw him.

401
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:34,800
What's the matter?

402
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,719
That man is the inspector
from Firewood Office,

403
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,760
Liang Yi, Marquis Weiyuan.

404
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,719
He's mad for power.

405
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,160
He's hateful.

406
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,599
Qin Xuan is here.

407
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,439
Qin Xuan.

408
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:47,300
- Qin Xuan.
- Qin Xuan.

409
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,000
- It's been days since we met.
- Qin...

410
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Even if you're restless now,

411
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,040
he won't speak to you either.

412
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,560
But...

413
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,599
What should I do, then?

414
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,520
Enough, you can just look at him.

415
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,560
Did you forget to buy
the sandalwood ink

416
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,880
that I asked you last time?

417
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,319
How would I dare to forget
the things Miss Xue asked of me?

418
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,160
Here you go, Sir.

419
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,079
Qin Xuan, you're great.

420
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,160
Thank you, Qin Xuan.

421
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,920
Qin Xuan, what's in your box?

422
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,959
It's fruit cake.

423
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,319
It's made with mint and basil.

424
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,599
It can soothe emotions
and improve eyesight.

425
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
It's efficient for strengthening
the stomach and spleen.

426
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,640
I've lost appetite lately.

427
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,479
I've been thinking
about Qin Xuan's fruit cake.

428
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,359
Qin Xuan, how could you be so stingy?

429
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,119
Yes, we want to eat it too.

430
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,560
No, just take as much as you like.

431
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,160
Thank you, Qin Xuan.

432
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,040
Beixue, serve everyone for me.

433
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,800
Yes, sir.

434
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,239
Qin Xuan.

435
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,680
Ladies, ladies,

436
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,640
the fruit cakes are here.

437
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,680
Greeting to Aunt and Sisters.

438
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,800
Qiu Yan, you're here too.

439
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,640
Good boy.

440
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,199
Are your mother here?

441
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,319
Aunt, my mother couldn't come
as she's handling

442
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,160
some family affairs.

443
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,280
All right.

444
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,959
Greet her for me.

445
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,839
Mei'er, come.

446
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,560
You and your cousin

447
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,079
should talk more.

448
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,479
This is the game for you youngsters.

449
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
I'll just leave you to it.

450
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,199
I didn't learn Chuiwan for long.

451
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,599
I heard that Qin Xuan had won

452
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,040
the first place
on the previous Chuiwan Party.

453
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,800
Can you teach me about it?

454
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,439
Qiu Mei,

455
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,680
everyone in the family knows
that I'm the weakest player.

456
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,079
Qin Xuan should teach me first.

457
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,359
Qin Xuan, look,

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,920
I embroider it myself,
does it look nice?

459
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,040
It's nice.

460
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,599
Qiu Ying is indeed a handyman.

461
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,439
Qin Xuan,

462
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,920
can you teach us
the rule of playing Chuiwan?

463
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,439
Meng Yu.

464
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,800
Qiu Ying, Qiu Mei,

465
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,079
Young Master Meng is good

466
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,319
at playing Chuiwan.

467
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,160
You may directly ask him
if you have any questions.

468
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,040
Qiu Yan, did you receive the hairpin
that I asked Qiu Min to bring to you?

469
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,359
Did you?

470
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,160
I received it.

471
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,000
Thank you.

472
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,119
I didn't see you wearing it.

473
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,839
Do you not like it?

474
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,160
There are many people
in Chuiwan Competition.

475
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm afraid I'd lose it

476
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,640
or break it if I put it on.

477
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,160
It'd treat your favours not amiss.

478
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,319
I see, it's fine as long as you like it.

479
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:12,920
To be honest with you,

480
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,640
I made that hairpin myself.

481
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm not good at making it.

482
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,400
I was afraid
that you'd think it's coarse

483
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,359
and dislike it.

484
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Thanks for your kindness,
I'll see you at the game.

485
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,800
Qin Xuan, why are you standing here?

486
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,560
Follow me.

487
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,839
There are few rich ladies
that would like to meet you.

488
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,359
Let's go.

489
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:38,880
Miss,

490
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,079
I thought Young Master Qin
only treated you nice.

491
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,160
Who knew he'd spread his gifts around.

492
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,160
No wonder you treated him that way.

493
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,920
I don't have the prettiest face

494
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,119
and innate talents.

495
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,680
Why would he

496
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,079
only treat me nice?

497
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm not the female character
in the skit.

498
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,319
It'll be harder to get

499
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,599
what you want now.

500
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,640
Why don't you teach them?

501
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,680
No, no.

502
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,640
Young Master Meng is tired,

503
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,800
just let Qin Xuan teach us.

504
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,920
All right, let's go over there.

505
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,520
All right, let's go.

506
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
If he has eyes only for me,

507
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,280
of course it'd be a precious fate.

508
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,719
If I haven't got the luck,

509
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
it'd be my strength

510
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,640
if I could make him fall for me.

511
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,560
Sir, I've asked around.

512
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,760
Miss Qiu Min is practising
Chuiwan alone over there.

513
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,239
Why do I get

514
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,239
the sense that she comes here
for Qin Xuan?

515
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,640
Fellow participants,

516
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,680
please provide prizes
in accordance with your capacity

517
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,160
as the reward for the winner
of this Chuiwan competition.

518
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,520
How could she offer a wooden hairpin?

519
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,680
It's embarrassing.

520
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,719
Fourth Young Lady is right.

521
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,800
This hairpin is given
by Young Master Qin.

522
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,520
Miss, you should keep it.

523
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,599
So this is the hairpin
that Qin Xuan mentioned just now.

524
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,880
It's just a cheap thing.

525
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,000
How is it a cheap thing?

526
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,800
A treasure box is not
as worthy as the ebony.

527
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,719
This hairpin

528
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:43,040
is made of Golden Silk Nan Ebony,
it's rare.

529
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,119
Only you will treat it

530
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,119
as an ordinary wood

531
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,119
as you grew up in the landfill.

532
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,599
Qiu Yan,

533
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
since this hairpin is a valuable item,

534
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,439
why don't you give it out as a prize?

535
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:58,119
It's Young Master Qin's gift
for Young Lady.

536
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,319
You've donated it,
there's no turning back.

537
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,800
Are you going to take it back?

538
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,400
A nobleman wouldn't take
what others are fond of.

539
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
Why would you two force her?

540
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,599
Greeting to Lord Liang.

541
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,119
It's just a joke between us sisters.

542
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,719
Moreover,

543
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,800
as I ask Qiu Yan
to donate her favorite item,

544
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,839
it's for the sake of our Qiu family.

545
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,760
Yes.

546
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,119
Indeed,

547
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't have
other valuable items to donate.

548
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll help Miss Qiu Yan

549
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,280
to donate the prize.

550
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
Miss Qiu, you should cherish the gift

551
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
from others

552
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,839
even if you don't like it.

553
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,959
Miss, you were trying
to use the wooden hairpin

554
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,560
to test Young Master Qin's feelings.

555
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,000
So that he could see First Young Lady's
and Fourth Young Lady's true colors.

556
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,880
But who knows
Lord Liang would meddle in it.

557
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Liang Yi is ill-intentioned
and he hates me.

558
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
He must've done this

559
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,839
for some purpose.

560
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,319
Sir, as you helped the she-devil
and gave the ring out,

561
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,079
those unwitting people

562
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,319
would think that you have
your eyes on her.

563
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,640
This woman is cunning.

564
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,239
I must keep an eye on her.

565
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,079
Instead of waiting
for her to make a move

566
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,479
to start a relationship with Qin Xuan,

567
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,160
let's just pretend to be nice to her.

568
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,560
As Qin Xuan sees it,

569
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,880
he certainly won't compete with me.

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,719
This could make him
give up on his thought.

571
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,680
This is the preliminary round.

572
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:43,040
Participants, ready.

573
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,439
Participants, take your positions.

574
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,800
The match begins now.

575
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,239
Madam.

576
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,719
She's good.

577
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,319
I didn't expect that.

578
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,479
It's all right, leave it to me.

579
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,040
Qiu Mei!

580
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Qiu Mei, are you all right?

581
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,640
Qiu Mei!

582
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,719
Qiu Ying,

583
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,839
you can't hit Qiu Mei's face on purpose

584
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,959
even if you're jealous of her skills.

585
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,400
You've gone too far. Let me take a look.

586
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,000
Qiu Mei's face is swollen.

587
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,280
Someone help Qiu Mei
and take her to rest.

588
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,119
And ask Seond Madam 
to send a physician over.

589
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,119
How could I face people like this?

590
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:24,439
Yes.

591
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,119
Easy.

592
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,239
Qiu Mei, have a good rest.

593
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Qiu Mei,

594
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,479
Qiu Mei, I didn't do it on purpose.

595
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
Sure.

596
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,760
You were trying to hit me, weren't you?

597
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,439
Fortunately, I guarded against you

598
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,199
and stood behind Qiu Mei.

599
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,640
I see.

600
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,199
You framed me.

601
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:47,199
Don't blame me, you're bad at it.

602
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,079
Qiu Yan!

603
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,719
Do it in accordance
with the competition system.

604
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,920
- Qiu Yan, are you all right?
- Qiu Yan!

605
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:06,640
Qiu Yan.

606
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,400
Qiu Ying, what have you done?

607
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,079
I didn't do it.

608
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

609
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,400
here's a message from Madam.

610
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,400
As Qiu Ying, Fourth Young Lady
of Qiu Family, loses her manners

611
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
at the game,

612
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,040
based on the system,
she's disqualified from the game.

613
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,520
Host, Qin Xuan, she framed me.

614
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,920
Qiu Ying, the rod is in your hand.

615
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,199
Why would you hit Qiu Mei and me

616
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,719
if you didn't have evil intentions

617
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,800
towards us?

618
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,920
Miss.

619
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,800
Just wait and see.

620
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,000
What a good series of taunts.

621
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,359
She uses every means

622
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,239
to get rid

623
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,880
of all the eyesores to her.

624
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,000
Sir,

625
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,520
why don't I just call Mr. Qin back?

626
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,280
You're a cabbage...

627
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:51,800
Head?

628
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,680
Qiu Yan,

629
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,079
are you all right?

630
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,640
I'm fine.

631
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,280
In the next match,

632
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,880
please show me what you got.

633
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,479
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair.

634
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
This won't do.

635
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:08,839
You're a lady.

636
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,920
Since this is a match,

637
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,400
all people are equal at the game.

638
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,359
Please show respect to your opponents.

639
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,640
I'll take you up on that.

640
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,079
Miss Qiu Yan,

641
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,479
I saw you had quite a fall.

642
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,280
Don't walk too fast.

643
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,119
Lord Liang, thanks for your concern.

644
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,160
I'm fine.

645
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,239
You're a delicate lady.

646
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,839
You can't get used to being hit,
unlike men.

647
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,800
You'll regret it all your life

648
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
if you hurt your body.

649
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,760
Let me carry you down.

650
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:36,959
Qiu Yan...

651
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,280
Liang Yi.

652
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,239
The more you move,

653
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
the more suspicious you look.

654
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,640
Liang Yi, what are you trying to do?

655
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
What do you think?

656
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,680
I can't bear to see you having contact

657
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,040
with the other man on the field,

658
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,680
can't I do that?

659
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,760
Since you knew that it was a dive,

660
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,119
why didn't you expose me?

661
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Why would I expose you?

662
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,359
I don't want you to get mad at me.

663
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,400
Qiu Yan, how's your leg?

664
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,119
It's fine.

665
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,359
As usual, I'll let you have
one handicap point.

666
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:33,640
It's unnecessary.

667
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,280
I want to compete fairly with you.

668
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,479
Do you mean Chuiwan

669
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,079
or Qiu Yan?

670
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,640
It's the rematch,
participants, get ready.

671
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,319
Take your positions.

672
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
The match begins now.

673
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,599
Qin Xuan, you can do this.
Qin Xuan, you can do this.

674
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,920
Qin Xuan,

675
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,640
do you really fall for that girl?

676
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,760
Yes.

677
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,319
I'm telling you this for your own good.

678
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,040
Stay away from her.

679
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:51,800
Liang, I might listen to you
if it's about the other matters.

680
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,959
Anything else

681
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:53,880
except this.

682
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,280
Go on.

683
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,520
Nice shot, Qin Xuan.

684
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,879
Good job, Qin Xuan!

685
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:16,879
Great!

686
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,639
Qin Xuan, young master
of Duke Ying Residence, wins.

687
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:45,600
Young Master Qin, congratulations

688
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:46,800
on winning the match.

689
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,760
These prizes are all yours.

690
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,719
Young Master Liang, congratulations.

691
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,000
Keep it up.

692
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,719
Liang,

693
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,560
I didn't beat you

694
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,879
for these

695
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,280
useless gold and jade items.

696
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,040
You can have it all.

697
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,360
As I can beat you in Chuiwan,

698
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,840
I can also win Qiu Yan over.

699
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,120
You...

700
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:34,959
Ladies,

701
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,479
Young Master Qin won the match.

702
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,120
He asked my master

703
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,360
to distribute today's prizes

704
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,959
to all the participants.

705
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,360
Young Master Qin said

706
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,159
sharing is caring.

707
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,320
These gold and jade items are useless
to him.

708
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:49,760
He'd rather use it
to make everyone happy.

709
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,159
Come on.

710
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,199
Let me see it.

711
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,399
Let me see this.

712
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,919
Look, this is nice.

713
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,479
I like this.

714
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,520
Let me see yours.

715
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:03,679
Miss Qiu Yan,

716
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:06,560
why don't you pick a favorite item?

717
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,040
This is a token
of Young Master's Qin regard.

718
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,919
Song Jin.

719
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,080
As Lord Liang helped me preserve
the Ebony hairpin,

720
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
I should give this back to you.

721
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,320
I don't want to owe anyone

722
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,159
any favors like you.

723
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,959
Isn't that Qin Xuan?

724
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,959
Qin Xuan.

725
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,879
Qin...

726
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,800
Qin Xuan.

727
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,399
I thought you forgot about us
after winning the competition.

728
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,199
How could it be?
Qin Xuan is not that kind of person.

729
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,360
This item you give me looks very nice.

730
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,239
Thank you, Qin Xuan.

731
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,000
This looks very nice, yes.

732
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:57,919
I'm serious.

733
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,360
Yes, this is particularly good.

734
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,120
It's suitable for me.

735
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,600
Is that so?

736
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,679
You did great on today's match.

737
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,560
Yes.

738
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,760
Young Master Qin grew up
in an environment that's full of women.

739
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,719
He is nice to everyone.

740
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,879
I won't approach him
like the other ladies do.

741
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,879
So that he could remember me.

742
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,520
Later, you go forward and make an excuse

743
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,560
to draw Qin Xuan here.

744
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,959
Remember to avoid Liang Yi.

745
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,760
The others can play Chuiwan well

746
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:34,120
except me, why am I so stupid?

747
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,600
You're too nervous.

748
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,239
That's why you can't play it well.

749
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,560
Let me help you.

750
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:50,280
Are you afraid of me?

751
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,080
You were graceful

752
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,560
when I last saw you.

753
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,239
But you're jumpy today.

754
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:58,520
Why is that?

755
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,800
That guy is the inspector
from Firewood Office,

756
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
Liang Yi, Marquis Weiyuan.

757
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,120
He's mad for power.

758
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,600
He's very hateful.

759
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,639
It's nothing.

760
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,080
I understand.

761
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,800
There's a discipline in Firewood Office.

762
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,719
Seeing is not believing.

763
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,199
What you hear may be false.

764
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,959
Let me teach you.

765
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,840
Okay.

766
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,399
As soon as I'm not around,

767
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Qin Xuan

768
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,280
is going to be distracted

769
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,239
by that cunning vixen again.

770
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,520
Song Jin.

771
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,120
Come here.

772
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,439
Teach Miss Qiu Min Chuiwan for me.

773
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,080
Miss Qiu Min and I be alone together?

774
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,239
I don't think it's appropriate.

775
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,399
Look.

776
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,399
Qiu Yan, I've been looking
for you just now.

777
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,239
But I couldn't find you.

778
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,399
Fortunately, I met Qingdai.

779
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:15,639
Can you sit by and watch your buddy

780
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,719
go down in flames?

781
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,000
I can't bear to see it, just go.

782
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,080
Liang, Liang,

783
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,399
I need you to help me out.

784
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,719
What has Qin Xuan got that I haven't?

785
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,879
Meng, I have something on.

786
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,560
Everything happens for a reason.

787
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,959
On the ancestry, we're the descendants
of the important ministers.

788
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,600
We're evenly matched in education.

789
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,879
Besides, I'm good at playing Chuiwan.

790
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,360
Why do the ladies only like him?

791
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,800
This is poria cake.

792
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,159
It can moisturize the skin
and tone the stomach.

793
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,639
I don't want it.

794
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:43,679
Why?

795
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,360
I specially made this for you.

796
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,080
If you treat everyone equally nice,

797
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:49,280
I'd rather not to accept it.

798
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:51,080
Maybe it's because of my appearance.

799
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,879
As I'm handsome,

800
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:55,639
the ladies can only dream
of winning me over.

801
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,760
- Right?
- Song Jin.

802
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,120
Help me counsel Young Master Meng.

803
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,520
Come.

804
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Liang, Liang!

805
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,720
Young Master Meng.

806
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:20,399
Min'er.

807
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:20,719
Qiu Yan.

808
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,760
Where did you go just now?

809
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,320
Lord Liang from Firewood Office
taught me Chuiwan just now.

810
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,479
Liang Yi?

811
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,040
When did you get acquaintance with him?

812
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,520
I never got acquaintance with him.

813
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Just that he was patient enough
to teach me Chuiwan as he saw

814
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,159
I was terrible with it.

815
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:36,800
Besides, I've met him once before

816
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,879
at Duke Ying Residence.

817
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:39,439
Miss, have some water.

818
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:40,760
Okay, thank you.

819
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,120
Last round.

820
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,760
Ladies, please put an earring on it

821
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,679
as a keepsake.

822
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,719
Gentlemen,

823
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,679
please put a marked folding fan on it

824
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:57,919
as a keepsake.

825
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Madam will pair you up.

826
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:01,800
Men and women will be paired up.

827
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,800
The final winners

828
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,879
will get the reward from Noble Consort.

829
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,439
I think you're coming after me today.

830
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
You're right.

831
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm coming after you today.

832
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,320
Qiu Yan is very cunning,
you can't get involved with her.

833
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,360
I think you've stayed in Firewood Office
for too long.

834
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,600
You think everyone is a criminal.

835
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:43,679
Her engagement
with He family is broken off.

836
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,280
She is distressed
as she thinks her future is ruined

837
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,879
so she wants to use some tricks

838
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:48,840
to seduce a stately house.

839
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,320
She has her eyes

840
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,520
on the lineage of yours,
Duke Ying Residence.

841
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,040
Liang Yi,

842
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,439
I think you have a deep bias
against Miss Qiu Yan.

843
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:56,919
Let's make a bet

844
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,399
on the last round.

845
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,320
If I win,

846
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,520
I hope that Liang will stop

847
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,320
meddling in the affair
between Qiu Yan and me.

848
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,879
Why are you so stubborn?

849
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:05,040
You just won't believe me.

850
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,679
Which earring belongs to Miss Qiu Min?

851
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,360
Madam, this is the one.
