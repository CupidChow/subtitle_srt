=Episode 18=

18
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,360
Lord Liang?

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,639
Lord Liang.

20
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,760
Lord Liang, you're early today.

21
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,919
Remember the rouge you told me about?

22
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,240
I bought it for you.

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
Come have a look

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,759
if it suits you.

25
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,279
The shopkeeper always tells me
they are running low on stock.

26
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,160
But you get it so easily, Lord Liang.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,960
Did you use your position

28
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,919
to scare him into submission?

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
As long as I can see you smile,
Miss Shi.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,559
Thanks, sir.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,759
Qiu Yan.

32
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,919
Why are you staring at Lord Liang?

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,960
You didn't even brew the tea.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,800
Oh, nothing.

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
Lord Liang is all cold and distant

36
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,839
when he goes about his business.

37
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,399
But today, I see him

38
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,759
treat you so kindly

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,119
and he even bought you a rouge.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
I learned something new
about Lord Liang today.

41
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,440
I'll bring the tea leaves.

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,279
No need for that.

43
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,559
Fetch me some dishes.

44
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,000
I haven't eaten so far.

45
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,279
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,839
It's so hot.

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,679
You're a handmaid
for a few days already

48
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,039
and you still don't know how to serve
someone properly?

49
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you looking at?

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,199
Is Miss Shi supposed to be the one
to cool it down for me?

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
Taste it yourself
and see if it's still hot.

52
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,320
Do

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,679
as you're told.

54
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,279
Sir.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,600
It's good now.

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,839
Disgusting.

57
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,920
But what I had just now was delicious.

58
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,959
Because you had too little.

59
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,399
It's bitter.

60
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,000
Try it yourself.

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,079
It's delicious.

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,679
Try it again.

63
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,440
Something's wrong with your tongue.

64
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,160
Taste it again.

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,200
Stop wasting my time.

66
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,839
My taste buds can tell they spent

67
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,160
at least ten hours
brewing this fish broth.

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,359
There's no foul smell whatsoever.

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,279
You're just being extra picky.

70
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,519
Lord Liang always praises the chef here.

71
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,920
He wouldn't criticize the food.

72
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,440
Lord Liang must have seen
how hard you have worked

73
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,000
and awarded you this bowl of soup.

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,320
Not at all.

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,839
It does taste different now.

76
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,279
Miss, Mr. Qiu wants to see you.

77
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,239
Can't you see that I'm dining
with Lord Liang?

78
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Of course, I can.

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,480
But Mr. Qiu is not satisfied with

80
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,399
the other girls here.

81
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,799
He wants you.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,600
He also has people
from the Main Administrative Office with him

83
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,880
and they said we shouldn't keep him
waiting for long.

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
My hands are tied, you see.

85
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,600
Miss, imagine this.

86
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
If they know

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,720
you turn them down
because of Lord Liang,

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,160
it will attract criticism.

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,600
Is Mr. Qiu

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,320
the gentleman with a mole on his chin?

91
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,559
Yes, that's him.

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,799
Ms. Wang, wait outside.

93
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,320
Miss Shi will be available soon.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Noted.

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,359
Qiu Yan, give us a moment.

96
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
Noted.

97
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:30,799
My Lord,

98
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,440
are you truly willing to hand me over
to another man?

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
If you don't want to see him,

100
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,200
give him this.

101
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,239
Qiu Yan.

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,200
I didn't expect to see you here.

103
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,480
Why are you here?

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,559
What did you promise Yuan Lang?

105
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,519
Why did he let you go?

106
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,519
Nothing.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,799
I just have to frame the entire family.

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,079
I'm not a criminal now.

109
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm a key witness.

110
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,279
I negotiated with Official Yuan.

111
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,160
As long as he makes me happy,

112
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,519
whatever testimony he wants,

113
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,040
I'll write it.

114
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
Even though the Qiu blood
doesn't flow in you,

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,559
Old Madam, Fourth Uncle, and Fourth Aunt

116
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,000
cherished you for more than a decade

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,119
as if you're one of their own.

118
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,480
Is there any good conscience
left in you?

119
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,839
I never asked
to be part of the Qiu family

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
but now, I have to.

121
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,359
Once Second Uncle is incriminated,

122
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:38,000
I have to lead the Qiu family.

123
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,119
Do you have no...

124
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,679
Mr. Qiu.

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
Weren't you asking for me?

126
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,920
Why are you dallying with a servant?

127
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,119
I was waiting for you.

128
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,480
You're impatient, Miss Shi.

129
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,600
Come. Let's go.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,880
I'll make up for you.

131
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,079
Wait.

132
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,279
I'm busy now,

133
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,519
Qiu Yan.

134
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,239
Qiu Di is a shameless scum.

135
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,320
Hurl all your insults at him

136
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,359
and still, he won't feel a thing.

137
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,839
My enemy is in front of me

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,600
yet I can't do anything

139
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,000
but to see him walk away arrogantly
and have fun.

140
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,760
It's as if

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,040
someone just stabs me in my heart.

142
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,880
Qiu Di is your enemy

143
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,679
and also mine.

144
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,239
Don't worry.

145
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,760
Xiaoxiao.

146
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,520
(Royal Academy)
Wait for me tomorrow night.

147
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,280
Mr. Qiu,
don't forget the thing I gave you.

148
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,799
Light it up for one night

149
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,080
and when you come here again tomorrow,

150
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,479
you will experience

151
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,280
otherworldly pleasures.

152
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,760
I know.

153
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,200
This, right?

154
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,119
You think I'll forget?

155
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,200
Of course, not.

156
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,799
All right. Bye.

157
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,760
No sign of a break-in.

158
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,039
No external wound either.

159
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,320
The coroner has checked the corpse.

160
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,400
No sign of poisoning too.

161
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
His cause of death

162
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,640
is presumed to be asthma for now.

163
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,200
The timing is just too uncanny.

164
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,760
Who was he with?

165
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,000
Sir,

166
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,119
he went to the Royal Academy
to see Miss Shi Xiaoxiao.

167
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,719
He was fine when he left

168
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,640
the Royal Academy.

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,640
Once he retired to his room,

170
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
we stood guard and never left our post.

171
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,440
What meticulous planning.

172
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,760
Even if I suspect the Royal Academy
of foul play,

173
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,479
I can't do anything about it.

174
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,159
It's all my fault, sir.

175
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,119
Qiu Di said he wanted to have fun
for a day.

176
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,320
I shouldn't have said yes.

177
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I await my punishment.

178
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,119
It's fine. Get up now.

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,119
Thanks, sir.

180
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,280
I set Qiu Di free

181
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,000
because I wanted to use him
to frame Liang Yi

182
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,119
and asked His Majesty to punish him.

183
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,280
But now, Qiu Di is dead.

184
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,200
Qiu Yi will definitely say he is the one

185
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,080
behind the embezzlement.

186
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
No one else is involved.

187
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,640
Sir.

188
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,880
Liang Yi is a cunning foe

189
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,440
but he will slip up eventually.

190
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,960
Knowing how resourceful you are, sir,

191
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,840
finding his weakness is but
a matter of time.

192
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,239
Just this morning,

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
His Majesty ordered

194
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
that all men of the Qiu family
are to be exiled to Gannan.

195
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,200
Either way,

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,640
Liang Yi can't possibly ally with

197
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,599
the Qiu family anymore.

198
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,719
We didn't do everything in vain.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,080
I didn't summon you for a while.

200
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,000
Do you feel left out perhaps?

201
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
You're a man of many duties,
Your Majesty.

202
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,520
I commit great sins already
as I fail to reduce your burden.

203
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,520
Therefore, I do not feel left out.

204
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
You're not the only one
who has to stay out of the Qiu scandal.

205
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,280
I have to too.

206
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,359
You are close to the Qiu family.

207
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,080
If the other ministers
think that I favor you

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,520
and judge the Qiu case leniently,

209
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,880
that means trouble.

210
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm fine with it.

211
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,200
Those ministers will just complain
a bit more than usual

212
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
but I'm worried

213
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,919
that they might try

214
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
to impeach you.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,919
Thank you for your consideration,
Your Majesty.

216
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,359
Words cannot express my gratitude.

217
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,520
Fortunately, you handled it very well.

218
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,159
You annulled the marriage

219
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,559
decisively too.

220
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:54,960
You know to look at the bigger picture.

221
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,400
I can see that.

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Let me know which woman

223
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,440
tickles your fancy.

224
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,599
I will arrange a marriage for you.

225
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,520
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Majesty.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,719
Sir, what did His Majesty say?

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,479
Nothing in particular.
He was just consoling me.

228
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,679
Since His Majesty is willing to see you,

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
it means His Majesty begins
to trust you again.

230
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,200
So the Qiu scandal

231
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,880
is over now?

232
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,000
We can start

233
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,880
buying the freedom of the Qiu women.

234
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,679
Let's go to Mr. Qin.

235
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,039
He will help us.

236
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,000
Qin Xuan has the spirit

237
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,080
but he doesn't have the final say.

238
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,239
Let's go to

239
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,919
General He.

240
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
After he annulled Qiu Yan's marriage,

241
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,359
his wife became bedridden.

242
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:43,960
He will not help us.

243
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,799
Then, let's go to
Marquis Yongming's wife.

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,479
Using someone close to me

245
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,880
is akin to doing it myself.

246
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,159
If we don't want Yuan Lang
to find our weakness,

247
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,119
we need to spend a few days
to find the best candidate.

248
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,080
It's raining soon. Pack everything up.

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Hurry up.

250
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,280
Collect the laundry.

251
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,479
Madam Liu gave you her work again?

252
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,000
Madam Liu was busy this morning

253
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,599
making food for me.

254
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,960
She takes good care of me

255
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
so I should do her work.

256
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,000
She's just taking advantage of you

257
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,760
and you...

258
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,960
Madam Liu is my elder.

259
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,559
An elder can punish the young
to teach them a lesson.

260
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,559
She's not taking advantage of me.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
You're afraid of thunder.

262
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,520
If she really treats you well,

263
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,479
you will seek refuge in her embrace now,

264
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,119
instead of doing two persons' work

265
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,799
here alone.

266
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,679
You're just too meek

267
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,960
to confront anything.

268
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,799
Even if you can't deal with her,

269
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,159
you can come to me.

270
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,840
She is your biological mother.

271
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,440
You can't do anything about it.

272
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,359
Madam Liu will never change.

273
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,919
I will be the one who gets scolded
at the end.

274
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:04,960
Qiu Yan.

275
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,520
You said I should wake up now.

276
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,840
But I would rather

277
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,280
live in my dream

278
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,000
than witness the truth.

279
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,880
Just let me believe

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,799
that Madam Liu
is as kind to me as before.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,520
All right?

282
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,239
Yes, Madam Liu will never change

283
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,599
but you can change yourself.

284
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Don't be this meek.

285
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,359
Don't lie to yourself anymore.

286
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,960
Qiu Yan, the thunder is loud.

287
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,280
Can you hug me?

288
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,400
Qiu Yan.

289
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,119
Qiu Yan.

290
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,239
You cannot rely on someone else
all the time.

291
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,359
You have to rely on yourself one day.

292
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,119
No one can look after you forever.

293
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,300
(As Loyal As A Subject)

294
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,880
Isn't this Miss Shi?

295
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,479
It is her!

296
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,679
I wonder which noble man's tea party

297
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,960
manages to entice Miss Shi.

298
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,500
(Marquis Yongming Residence)

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,760
Look!

300
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,359
Come.

301
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,599
I am Miss Shi's maid,
from the Royal Academy.

302
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,199
I have to prepare pear soup
to soothe her throat.

303
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,560
May I know where the kitchen is?

304
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,719
Walk along this path and you'll find it.

305
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,680
Thank you.

306
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,400
(The monk of Taiying Temple
once told me)

307
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,280
(everything has a cause and effect,
and that fortune)

308
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,239
(and misfortune will eventually
balance out.)

309
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,920
(The tougher your past is,)

310
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
(the more happiness
you will have in the future.)

311
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,319
(At first, I sneered)

312
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,119
(at those words.)

313
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,719
(But after I met you,)

314
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,040
(I really hope
that what he said is true.)

315
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,800
You're slimmer than

316
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,599
we last met.

317
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I bet

318
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,160
you haven't been eating

319
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,239
or sleeping well

320
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,319
recently.

321
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
I know.

322
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,880
Because I suffer too.

323
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,239
Qiu Yan.

324
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,640
I know you're Miss Shi's handmaid.

325
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,239
You will attend this tea party with her.

326
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,560
No matter how hard I beg my mother,

327
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,400
she won't let me step foot
into the Marquis Yongming Residence.

328
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,040
Out of wits,

329
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,400
I scaled the wall

330
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,479
and fell.

331
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,160
I really want to see you.

332
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
I know you must have a reason

333
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,800
why you want to cut ties with me.

334
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,280
But can you hear me out just this once?

335
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,280
I don't care if you're the daughter
of a criminal.

336
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I don't care if you work
in the Royal Academy.

337
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,280
I just want to be with you.

338
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
No matter the hardship,

339
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,920
if it's you in the end,
it'll be worth it.

340
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,560
Mr. Qin.

341
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,359
You ventured out alone,

342
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,239
unaccompanied by Beixue.

343
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,319
He must be

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,839
taking the heat for you
in your residence

345
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,560
and is being punished by Madam Qin.

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
What did you just call me?

347
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,760
You want to sneak out

348
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,760
so you let your servant
be the scapegoat.

349
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,719
You want to see me

350
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,880
and I'm expected to greet you
with a smiling face?

351
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,920
You don't mind that I work
in the Royal Academy.

352
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,359
Should I kneel down

353
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,319
and thank your generosity
with tears of joy?

354
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
That's not what I meant.

355
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,400
If you truly wish me well like you

356
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,160
claim to,

357
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,119
then I have great news for you.

358
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,920
At the moment,

359
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,560
I'm Miss Shi's handmaid.

360
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,400
I meet so many officials every day.

361
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I have many targets now.

362
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,319
And now,

363
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,400
I just have to pick the best among them

364
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,119
and use my trick to seduce him

365
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,479
like what I did to you.

366
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,839
Don't worry about me anymore.

367
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,119
I'm doing great now.

368
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
And I

369
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,359
will do better in the future.

370
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,479
I have to prepare pear soup
for Miss Shi.

371
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,479
Mr. Qin,

372
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,719
you're in my way.

373
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,560
♪We met as innocent children♪

374
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,240
♪But our love was destined♪

375
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,400

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,920
♪With the greasepaint in my hand♪

377
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:31,920
Qiu Yan.

378
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,319
I will wait for you.

379
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,880
Whatever you say,
I will wait for you forever.

380
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,280
♪The spring breeze has come♪

381
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,840

♪That will never change♪

386
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,199
Great!

387
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,680
Young Master Meng.

388
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,719
Play us another song!

389
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:42,959
Great performance.

390
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,119
- Give us another.
- Great performance.

391
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,719
So beautiful!

392
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,239
Well...

393
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,319
Young Master Meng.

394
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,880
Times are different.

395
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,560
Even a mere courtesan

396
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,199
dares to disrespect you,
the son of an earl, blatantly.

397
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,599
It is precisely because
she does not cater to him

398
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,959
that shows
that she has talents and a vision

399
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,079
of a higher class than other ladies.

400
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,959
Talent?

401
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,719
All in all,

402
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:14,199
she was just
putting on airs and graces.

403
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,000
Are you tired, Miss Xiaoxiao?

404
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,640
I'll only play again
when it's quiet outside.

405
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,040
Making a ruckus
and throwing coins at me.

406
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,239
What did they take me for?

407
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,719
Miss Shi, your pear soup.

408
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,719
Now, now. Don't be mad.

409
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,000
Look at how beautiful you are.

410
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,359
Miss Xiaoxiao.

411
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
You were playing so well.

412
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,359
Why did you run off all of a sudden?

413
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,479
I felt unwell.

414
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,800
Please forgive me, Young Master.

415
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,760
I am familiar
with the ways of a courtesan.

416
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,119
You may fool others
with those words, but not me.

417
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,119
You avoided me the moment I praised you.

418
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,400
Are you looking down on me?

419
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,319
You've misunderstood, Young Master Meng.

420
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,239
Out of my way!

421
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,400
I was just getting into the mood.

422
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Who do you think you are?

423
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,000
I show a little support,
cheer you girls on,

424
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,119
and you all act high and mighty with me.

425
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,680
Did you really think
you are still some innocent girl?

426
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,880
In the end,

427
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,479
you are but a wh...

428
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Xiaoxiao.

429
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,920
It's the rule of the Royal Academy.

430
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,599
Guests may not force the ladies.

431
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
Even Lord Liang

432
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,560
was respectful and courteous
when he was in Miss Shi's company

433
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,599
the other day.

434
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,760
Young Master Meng is a gentleman.

435
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,920
Why act in such a manner?

436
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,479
The second daughter of the Qiu Family.

437
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,640
Who do you think you are?

438
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,079
Look at you.

439
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,959
You couldn't even become
a lady at the Royal Academy.

440
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,160
And you dare lecture me?

441
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,239
All right.

442
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,680
I can't do anything to her.

443
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,520
But I can certainly take care of you!

444
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,439
Come here!

445
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,239
Let go of me!

446
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,160
- Come here...
- Meng Yu!

447
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,760
If you don't stop, I'll let you have it!

448
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:56,640
Let me go!

449
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,199
Let me have it then!

450
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:57,680
Let go of me!

451
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,079
Who is it?

452
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,160
I...

453
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,400
What do you mean, huh?

454
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,400
Miss Shi needs peace and quiet.

455
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,760
Liang Yi, I know you like Shi Xiaoxiao.

456
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,599
I didn't touch her.

457
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,479
It was her maid

458
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,719
who offended me.

459
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,880
I am the son of Earl Yongyi.

460
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,520
She should be honored that I want her!

461
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,000
Besides, she offended you too.

462
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:23,839
Get out.

463
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:24,719
I...

464
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,239
Scram!

465
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,359
Fine.

466
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:29,680
Just you wait.

467
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,640
Wait and see.

468
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,400
Just you wait!

469
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,800
Are you all right, Miss Shi?

470
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,800
I'm used to it.

471
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,920
Qiu Yan, bring me a basin of water.

472
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,239
I want to wash my face.

473
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:48,800
Yes.

474
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,920
I'll take my leave then.

475
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,079
Stop!

476
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,520
Why did you do that just now?

477
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,119
If I hadn't done something,

478
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,239
Meng Yu would have...

479
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,839
It's normal for courtesans
to encounter such things.

480
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,520
What can a little maid like you do?

481
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Miss Shi treats me very well.

482
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,040
I can't watch her

483
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,479
being forced against her will
and not do anything.

484
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,040
Why can't you learn to endure?

485
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,760
Endure it!

486
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,640
Your father's case is closed.

487
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,119
He will be exiled to Gannan.

488
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,680
I'm asking around
to see if anyone can redeem you.

489
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:36,839
Please behave yourself

490
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,239
for the time being.

491
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,640
Don't cause any more trouble, all right?

492
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,040
Wait!

493
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,640
I heard Qiu Di is dead.

494
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
Did you do it?

495
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,920
Sir, ever since Liang Yi
had an audience with His Majesty,

496
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,160
he has been contacting many officials
and their family members lately.

497
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,800
But all the men of the Qiu Family
have been exiled.

498
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,199
Is he doing all of these things

499
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,079
to reverse the verdict on Qiu Yi's case?

500
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,040
He contacted their family members too?

501
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,800
Yes.

502
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,239
No.

503
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,839
He wants to redeem
the Qiu Family's women.

504
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
So Liang Yi's ruthlessness

505
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,239
on the day of the raid

506
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,599
was all just an act meant to deceive us.

507
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,280
It may look like
he was hitting a man when he was down

508
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,560
by having the Royal Academy
take the Qiu Family women as servants,

509
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,119
but he actually did that
to protect their innocence!

510
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,680
Since he wants
to protect their innocence,

511
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,719
we mustn't let him have his way.

512
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,479
(Liang Yi-Deng Yuan, Chen Jinhong)
Let all the officials in the court see

513
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:55,520
what happens if they ally with Liang Yi.

514
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,199
(Royal Academy - Qiu's women)
That is a masterful move, sir.

515
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,319
It will let Liang Yi's plans fall short.

516
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
Not to mention if he dares make a move,

517
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,640
we'll be able to follow his trails

518
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,640
and find evidence of him
colluding with the Qiu Family in secret.

519
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
Summon the madam
in charge of the Royal Academy to see me.

520
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,239
Understood.

521
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,200
(Royal Academy - Qiu's women)

522
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,120
(Liang Yi-Deng Yuan, Chen Jinhong)

523
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,920
Why did Ms. Wang ask us

524
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
to come here all of a sudden?

525
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,079
Perhaps the verdict
on Qiu Yi's case has been decided.

526
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,400
What could it be?

527
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,880
- Ms. Wang.
- Greetings, Ms. Wang.

528
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,479
We called all of you here today

529
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,479
to tell you

530
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,520
that the verdict
on the Qiu Family's case has been given.

531
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,520
Qiu Yi embezzled public funds.

532
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,599
All living males of the Qiu Family

533
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,400
have been exiled to Gannan.

534
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,239
Exiled?

535
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,479
Now that convictions have been made,

536
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,520
the women of the Qiu Family

537
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,560
will have
to be punished accordingly as well.

538
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,599
Ms. Wang.

539
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,239
From now on,
all the women of the Qiu Family

540
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,079
are officially registered
in the Royal Academy.

541
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,239
All of you may not be redeemed.

542
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,119
May not be redeemed?

543
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,040
What does that mean?

544
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,239
Qiu Yan previously attended

545
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,000
a tea party at the Marquis Yongming Residence
with Miss Shi.

546
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,400
She stepped out of line.

547
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
She wounded the son of Earl Yongyi.

548
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:35,839
Therefore, the Qiu Family's women

549
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,400
are doubly guilty.

550
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,359
None of you may leave
the Royal Academy until your death.

551
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,520
Ms. Wang! Why?

552
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,119
Lord Liang told me...

553
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,920
Lord Liang?

554
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,160
The Royal Academy
serves more than one official.

555
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,920
The Royal Academy
is under the Ministry of Rites.

556
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,560
We are officially
part of the government.

557
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,479
These are orders from above.

558
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,599
You are in no place to ask questions.

559
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,439
Not to leave until death...

560
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:09,040
Doesn't that mean
we will be here until we die?

561
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,640
If I had to
wash toilet buckets here my entire life,

562
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,479
I would rather die.

563
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,079
My lord.

564
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,599
My lord.

565
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,160
Rong'er.

566
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,880
Sister-in-law.

567
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,280
Whatever will we do?

568
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,640
Sir, you went through
all the effort and secretly arranged

569
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,839
for Official Liu
of the Imperial College to redeem them.

570
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,680
But the Ministry of Rites
issued the orders.

571
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,439
They wouldn't even spare the women.

572
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,959
Yuan Lang is absolutely heartless!

573
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,240
(Royal Academy)

574
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,880
What's the matter, Miss?

575
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,079
It's your turn to sing tonight.

576
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,479
The guests are waiting.

577
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,839
Why aren't you getting ready yet?

578
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,920
Ms. Wang, I'm not feeling well today.

579
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm too tired to sing.

580
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,359
But there are so many guests waiting.

581
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,839
What am I going to tell them

582
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,560
if you don't sing tonight?

583
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680
Qiu Yan.

584
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,040
Tell Miss Yilan to come here.

585
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,680
Have her put on the golden veil
and perform tonight.

586
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,719
Miss Yilan
went to attend a tea party today.

587
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,000
Then, have Qiao'er perform! Hurry!

588
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,079
A guest just asked for Qiao'er.

589
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,920
What are we going to do?

590
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,079
I have an idea.

591
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,199
Perhaps we can give it a try.

592
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,239
Dear guests.

593
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,239
Dear guests.

594
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,959
I, Qiu Yan, will be giving
a humble performance today.

595
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,000
I will tell a story.
"The Vermilion Bird Saves Its Master."

596
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,959
It is said that a rich man
with the surname Ma lived

597
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,239
in Anshun Village, under the rule
of Taikang County, Wenzhou Prefecture.

598
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,319
The rich man had an old servant.

599
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,680
For years, he was dull-witted.

600
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,160
One day,

601
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,560
the old servant suddenly
began to recite poetry

602
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,199
and performed
a set of cultivation techniques.

603
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,160
He said,

604
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,079
"I was originally
the Vermilion Bird from above.

605
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,839
I was relegated to the mortal world.

606
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,599
I have served my time.

607
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
I will be returning to the heavens.

608
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,199
If any of you should ever
find yourselves in trouble,

609
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,079
shout, "Vermilion Bird, help me!"

610
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,359
and I will come and save you."

611
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,400
With that,

612
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,800
he flew off!

613
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,640
Wang Shun.

614
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,839
What do you think?

615
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,199
I didn't expect this.

616
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,319
She is good.

617
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,160
Go and have a new nameplate made.

618
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,319
We'll put up
Qiu Yan's nameplate tonight.

619
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,479
Right away.

620
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,160
A pair of scissors covered in blood.

621
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,319
And the corpse
that had bled out beneath him

622
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,520
had long turned cold.

623
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,880
Ma's son was falsely accused of murder

624
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,040
and sent to the dungeons
to await his death.

625
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,239
The execution was about to take place.

626
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,959
Just as the guillotine fell,

627
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,479
Ma's son suddenly remembered

628
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,359
the dull-witted old servant.

629
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
He immediately shouted,

630
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,199
"Vermilion Bird, help me!"

631
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,280
"Vermilion Bird, help me!"

632
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:29,719
Sir!

633
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,760
A message just came
from our informant in the Royal Academy.

634
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
They said...

635
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,119
They...

636
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
They put up Miss Qiu Yan's nameplate.

637
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,280
This way, sir.

638
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:45,959
This way, please.

639
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:46,599
All right.

640
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:51,680
All right.

641
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,599
Sir, in the evening,

642
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,239
I had someone let Song Jin know

643
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,880
that the second daughter
of the Qiu Family, Qiu Yan,

644
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,319
is receiving guests in the forecourt
of the Royal Academy starting today.

645
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,800
All we have to do now
is wait and see if they come.

646
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,880
He's here.

647
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,040
Lord Liang.

648
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,959
Lord Liang.

649
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,400
What a pleasant surprise.

650
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:15,880
Will you be asking for Miss Shi again?

651
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:16,959
Ms. Wang.

652
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,800
I remember Qiu Yan
was unruly and untamed.

653
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,359
When they raided her house,
she even tried to escape.

654
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,959
Not long ago, she even caused trouble
at the Earl Yongning Residence.

655
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,479
I specifically had her be a servant.

656
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,319
Why was her nameplate
suddenly put up today?

657
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:33,839
My lord, it was her own idea.

658
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,400
I didn't agree at first.

659
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,800
She can't do anything.

660
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,800
But she said she could learn on her own.

661
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,199
And she could tell stories.

662
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,000
She told an interesting story,

663
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,160
so I figured I would let her try.

664
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,040
Lord Liang. What a coincidence.

665
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,839
I had my eye on her first.

666
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,439
Qiu Yan.

667
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,119
If I remember right,

668
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,959
she should be your sister-in-law.

669
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,719
You have a wide range
of interests, Lord Liang.

670
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,639
Since she joined the Royal Academy,

671
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
then she is now one of the ladies here.

672
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,320
Everyone has the right to ask for her.

673
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,399
That's right.

674
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,719
I picked up this nameplate first.

675
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:21,360
You've always been one to turn
your nose up at places like these.

676
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,000
Why the sudden interest today?

677
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
Please don't fight.

678
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,000
It isn't unusual for two men

679
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,719
to have their eyes on the same lady.

680
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:32,760
How about this?

681
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,520
Let's call for Miss Qiu

682
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,120
and have her decide.

683
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,639
No matter which person
receives the perfume pouch, it is fate.

684
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,520
No regrets
after you give away the pouch.

685
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
Lord Liang, I'm sorry.
I can't keep you company.

686
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,159
No regrets
after you give away the pouch.

687
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,800
You can only keep me company tonight.

688
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,959
Well, congratulations
on winning over the beauty, Lord Liang.

689
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,320
Thanks.

690
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,800
Are you mad?

691
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,120
Yuan Lang was clearly

692
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,080
testing you to see
if you still cared about the Qiu Family.

693
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,239
You snatched me from him.
You did exactly what he wanted!

694
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,000
Do you think I could let him have you?

695
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,040
I have already lost everything.

696
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,600
I have nothing else to lose.

697
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I can't redeem you guys for now.

698
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,000
But I've already
taken care of everything

699
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,040
in the Royal Academy.

700
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,360
No one can force you guys
to put your nameplates up.

701
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,120
Why must you
put your nameplate up then?

702
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,800
What does it matter
if I remain pure or not?

703
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,679
I can't leave anyway!

704
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,199
Qin Xuan would be upset.

705
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,959
I have nothing
to do with Qin Xuan anymore.

706
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,239
What I do,

707
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,280
whether I am well or not,

708
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,719
has nothing to do with him.

709
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:18,959
Miss Yan.

710
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,040
Come in.

711
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,000
It's your first time
attending to a guest.

712
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,199
This is a gift. Chunhui wine

713
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,399
for Lord Liang and Miss Yan.

714
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,000
Leave it there.

715
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:37,919
Yes.

716
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,320
It's Yuan Lang.

717
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,959
You dare drink wine from Yuan Lang?

718
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,080
No matter how much he hates me,

719
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,479
he wouldn't poison the wine.

720
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,120
Chunhui wine is fine wine.

721
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,560
It would be a waste not to drink it.

722
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,199
Official Yuan, I delivered the wine.

723
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,479
How was the situation inside?

724
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,919
He was holding her like this.

725
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,320
Not too far. Not too intimately.

726
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,199
It's probably because
they didn't have any wine.

727
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,120
You are dismissed.

728
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,159
Yes.

729
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,000
Sir, you are most wise indeed.

730
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,719
Liang Yi still has feelings for Qiu Min,

731
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:34,879
and it extends to her sister.

732
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,879
To protect Qiu Min's sister, Qiu Yan,

733
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,959
he doesn't even bother
to try to avoid others' suspicion.

734
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:40,879
Based on what that maid said,

735
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,719
the two of them
did not have any intimate interactions.

736
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,199
That further proves
that Liang Yi only did this

737
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,159
to protect Qiu Yan's purity.

738
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,080
If he wants to save Qiu Min,

739
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,199
he will definitely
discuss an escape plan with Qiu Yan.

740
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,520
If we catch them all in the act then,

741
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:57,719
I can at least accuse him
of bending the law for personal reasons

742
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,879
and harboring criminals.

743
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,959
Harboring a criminal makes him
punishable for the same offense.

744
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,080
Qiu Yi was exiled to Gannan.

745
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,199
Liang Yi would at least
get the same punishment then.

746
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,120
It seems this trip

747
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,000
was well worth it.

748
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,159
It is good wine.

749
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,199
Take it easy.

750
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,080
Don't worry. I can hold my liquor.

751
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,199
Moreover...

752
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,639
If we look a little tipsy,

753
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,959
it would be even easier
to trick Yuan Lang.

754
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,959
I mean,

755
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:00,080
can't you pretend to be drunk?

756
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,080
How could that compare
to the real thing?

757
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,719
Could it be
that you can't hold your liquor?

758
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,479
So you don't dare drink, Lord Liang?

759
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,199
Yuan Lang is gone.

760
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,679
All right. I'll be heading back then.

761
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:55,600
Don't drink anymore.

762
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,439
I haven't drank in a long time.

763
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,560
Let's finish this jar.

764
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,719
I remember my mother once said

765
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,320
that people become stars
in the sky after they pass away

766
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:39,919
and light the paths for the living.

767
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,560
Do you think

768
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,840
she lights my path too?

769
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,080
She does.

770
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,320
But your mother must feel sad

771
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,719
to see you like this right now.

772
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:57,760
Is there another reason

773
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,000
behind your mother's death?

774
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:01,919
How did you know?

775
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,520
You're the type to never give up

776
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,840
in the face of obstacles.

777
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,000
Qin Xuan told me

778
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,239
he wanted to elope with you.

779
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,959
That would have been

780
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,560
a good option for you,

781
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,239
but you turned him down.

782
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,879
Qin Xuan thinks

783
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,320
you didn't want to drag him down.

784
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
But to me,

785
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,120
I think

786
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,560
you must have had your own reasons.

787
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,919
Yes.

788
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,479
I can't leave.

789
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:33,560
Whether your father's
suffering and injustice

790
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,479
may be righted...

791
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,600
You must live on

792
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:46,199
with the Qiu Family's women.

793
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,520
Old Madam told me the secret.

794
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,879
And gave me the thumb ring.

795
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,919
How could I leave with Qin Xuan then?

796
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,399
You rejected him.

797
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,040
I'll probably

798
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
never meet another guy

799
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:20,919
that will treat me as well as he did.

800
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:31,199
My mother told me

801
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,159
never to hold a grudge or hate

802
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,000
no matter what happens.

803
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,159
Just live on and live well.

804
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,360
But I still hate them so much.

805
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,439
I hate Yuan Lang! I hate His Majesty!

806
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,959
Six years ago,

807
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,000
my father told me
something similar as well.

808
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,080
But I couldn't do
a single thing he said.

809
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,479
Letting go

810
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,120
is harder than getting revenge.

811
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
But do you know who I hate the most?

812
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,719
You.

813
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,360
If it weren't for you,

814
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,520
Yuan Lang wouldn't
have come after my family.

815
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,560
You're his target!

816
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,600
The entire Qiu Family

817
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,080
was only collateral damage
between your fight with him.

818
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:21,840
Sorry.

819
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,199
Well, you are not to blame.

820
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,199
You didn't do all of this.

821
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:33,000
You didn't want this to happen.

822
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:36,040
But who else can I blame?

823
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,479
Who else can I hate?

824
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,479
(I will get justice for your family.)

825
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:51,919
I'll help you.
