=Episode 4=

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,040
Miss Zhao Rui did not kill herself.

19
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,400
What?

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,120
He Feng and

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,199
Miss Zhao Rui each
possessed one-half of this coin.

22
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,440
This half

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,319
was found in He Feng's tight grip
after he was dead.

24
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,839
You said He Feng

25
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,480
was a philanderer.

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,199
But which philanderer

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,040
would clutch the romantic keepsake

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,199
he and his loved one shared

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,039
the day he was due
to marry someone else?

30
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,199
I am sorry. It's too late.

31
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,880
You're saying He Feng was still in love
with Rui'er?

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,520
The is the Song of Everlasting Regret penned

33
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,360
by He Feng in his study.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
His handwriting is different here.

35
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,559
He must have felt

36
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,080
extreme anguish when he penned this.

37
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,039
You work as a letter-writer.

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm sure you can tell

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
what he felt when he wrote this.

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,399
So?

41
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,839
Even though he was in love with Rui'er,

42
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,479
it was you he married.

43
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,039
Can't you see it?

44
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,240
You killed the wrong target.

45
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,559
He Feng isn't the reason why
Miss Zhao Rui was dead.

46
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,839
It was someone else.

47
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,279
I suppose it's time for you to hand in
the other half

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,800
of the coin.

49
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,000
The story you told me

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,199
mixed truth and lies.

51
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,479
It was very convincing.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,199
However, you didn't know
that He Feng was holding this half

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,520
the moment he died.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,240
So when you said

55
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,399
He Feng cheated on Zhao Rui,

56
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,320
I knew straight away you were lying.

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
You didn't want to go to the court

58
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,720
because the crime you committed here

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,919
will definitely

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,639
net you the death penalty.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,600
Do you have anything else to say?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,479
Speak.

63
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,080
Who killed Zhao Rui?

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,320
It was Master and Madam.

65
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,559
They said as long as I could convince
the Young Master to return

66
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,960
and marry you,

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,720
I could be his concubine.

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,919
They forced me to do it.

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,799
Hang her on the beam in the house.

70
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,679
Don't make Young Master
suspect anything.

71
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,239
Noted.

72
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,239
Also,

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,799
this is the will.

74
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,519
Put it on the table in her room.

75
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,760
Young Master saw the will

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,000
and believed Zhao Rui killed herself
upon learning

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,839
that his marriage had been arranged

78
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,160
by his parents.

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
And then,

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,679
Young Master was utterly devastated.

81
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,119
You traitor.

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,720
You killed my daughter.
You betrayed Young Master.

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,440
How can someone

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
be as heartless as you?

85
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,839
Calm down, Mr. Zhao.

86
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,679
I should have made you take

87
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,079
that heartbreak grass.

88
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,040
Heartbreak grass?

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Shouldn't it be arsenic?

90
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,720
Perhaps heartbreak grass
can turn the needle black too?

91
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,920
Impossible.

92
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,880
Silver needle can't detect
heartbreak grass.

93
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:31,679
Then...

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
There must be more to it.

95
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,239
Tell Master that we found Zhao Mingli.

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,839
As disobedient as always.

97
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,480
I did this to survive.

98
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,359
My, my.

99
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,239
He's family business caused troubles

100
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,519
to you, my dear nephew.

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,399
Do accept my apology.

102
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,920
Uncle He.

103
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm afraid this is just not
a family business.

104
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,279
How is this not?

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,799
Qiu Yan is my daughter-in-law.

106
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,959
Yueying is my fugitive maid.

107
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,119
A family business, it is!

108
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,559
Explain the death of Zhao Rui
to me then.

109
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,920
She couldn't marry a rich husband,

110
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,239
felt mortified, and killed herself.

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,480
It has nothing to do with me.

112
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,880
He killed my son.

113
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,880
That's the fact.

114
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,200
You animal.

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,040
I studied for half my life.
I have no fame nor glory,

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,679
except for my daughter.

117
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,239
You're a parent too.

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
Won't your heart bleed if it were you?

119
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,799
It's precisely because I'm a parent

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,839
that I have to kill you today

121
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,799
to avenge my late son.

122
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,239
You can't kill him.

123
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,239
If he's dead,

124
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,559
Qiu Yan will always be branded

125
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,480
as a husband killer.

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,239
Move aside.

127
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,480
General He.

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,559
You know very well
I didn't jinx your son.

129
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,359
Yet you asked me to die
or become a nun for him.

130
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,600
Perhaps

131
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,079
you should know that the one
who killed your son wasn't Zhao Mingli,

132
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,320
but you and your wife.

133
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,119
Nonsense!

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,440
Zhao Mingli already confessed.

135
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,119
The poison he gave Yueying
was heartbreak grass.

136
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,239
I'm sure the coroner told you

137
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,000
that He Feng died from arsenic.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
There can only be one explanation.

139
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,239
And that's before He Feng could drink

140
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,920
the tea Yueying served him,

141
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,880
he took arsenic himself.

142
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,079
Impossible.

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
Why would Feng'er ingest arsenic?

144
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,399
Because he already knew

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,000
that you killed Zhao Rui.

146
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,559
But you're his parents.

147
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,119
He couldn't do anything about you two

148
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,720
so

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,720
he could only poison himself

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,679
on the day of marriage

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,239
as a way

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,160
to protest.

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
No way.

154
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,959
Feng'er wouldn't be this dumb.

155
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
The day before the marriage,

156
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Young Master said there was
a rat problem in his room.

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,839
He asked me to buy some arsenic.

158
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,839
It all lined up.

159
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,839
You killed Zhao Rui

160
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,679
for He Feng's own good,

161
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,440
but that only pushed him

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,160
to take his own life.

163
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,720
Your son is dead

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,079
and now, you want me to die for him too.

165
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,880
All of you

166
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,679
are just a bunch of scums donning

167
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,400
third-rank or second-rank
minister uniforms.

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,119
You...

169
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,159
- Give my son back!
- My dear.

170
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,440
Give my son back!

171
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,599
You old devil.

172
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,599
Bring the Madam away.

173
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,719
Give my son back!

174
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:50,719
But what can you do?

175
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,719
My son is dead now

176
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
and you have to pay for it
no matter what.

177
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,799
With so many eye-witnesses here,

178
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,479
stop making more mistakes.

179
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,239
Qiu Yan.

180
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,679
You're just

181
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,440
a scapegoat.

182
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,400
You only have yourself to blame

183
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,359
for running into me.

184
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,200
You think having Yueying

185
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,479
and Mr. Zhao with you

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
will change anything?

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,119
Uncle He.

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,320
This case cannot be any clearer.

189
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,320
You can't keep us here

190
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,960
unless you plan to kill all of us.

191
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,159
Qiu Yan and I are no commoners.

192
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,159
Have you thought

193
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,960
about the consequences?

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,679
You just gave me a great idea.

195
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,640
Who's there?

196
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,919
Insolence!

197
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,239
Let's go.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,719
You...

199
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,479
Bring these two eye-witnesses
to the Firewood Office.

200
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,239
Noted.

201
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,119
So you're saying

202
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,039
that the He family murdered Zhao Rui

203
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,000
and inadvertently forced their son
to take his own life.

204
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,679
To cover up,

205
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,479
they tried to force Qiu Yan and
other servants to sacrifice their lives

206
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,400
in exchange for silence.

207
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,159
Interesting.

208
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,200
You weren't there to see
General He today.

209
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,799
He committed such a deed
under His Majesty's nose.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,919
The Firewood Office

211
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,239
should investigate the He family.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
Someone who disregards laws like him

213
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
must be even worse

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,719
when he works.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,960
You can't simply investigate
the He family.

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,880
I know it is a revered family,

217
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,239
but we have laws here.

218
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,919
Justice will prevail.

219
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,159
My Lord, you said you would
right my name

220
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,799
but it shouldn't just be my name.

221
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,640
There are also Miss Yueying's name,

222
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,119
Zhao Rui and her father's name.

223
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,640
Only you can right their name.

224
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,359
This is no trivial matter.

225
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,239
General He plays an important role
in the imperial court.

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You can bring your case

227
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,239
to the Fengjing Prefecture

228
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
but no one will entertain you.

229
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,000
We have all the evidence.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Don't we have laws?

231
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,559
If the Fengjing Prefecture
won't entertain me,

232
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,479
I'll bring Miss Yueying and Mr. Zhao

233
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,880
with me to the High Court.

234
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,080
Qin Xuan and you
do not hold any official title.

235
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,440
You can bring it to the High Court

236
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,919
but according to the law,

237
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,080
the adjudicator will have to administer
20 flogs first.

238
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,919
If that means justice can be done,

239
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,320
I will endure it.

240
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
Many men have endured 20 flogs

241
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,239
and they are left crippled,

242
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,719
let alone you.

243
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,960
Firewood Office takes secret orders

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,880
and keeps a low profile.

245
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,320
If I get anything,

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,719
I will let His Majesty
know straight away.

247
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,840
No need to thank me.

248
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
It's just a piece of cake.

249
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,320
I am not here to thank you.

250
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,719
I just want a promise.

251
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,119
I want you to keep your words

252
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,840
and stay impartial
despite He's influence.

253
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,239
Qiu Yan.

254
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
Lord Liang is a righteous man.

255
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,679
He won't lie to us.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,719
Don't worry.

257
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,559
I didn't do this

258
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,119
for you.

259
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:26,880
All right. Let's go

260
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,159
lest they shut the city gate.

261
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,919
Bravo.

262
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,400
Marvelous.

263
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,320
Wow! Pyrotechnics!

264
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,679
Oh, I forgot

265
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,000
that the Chinese Valentine's Day
is tomorrow.

266
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,640
That explains the lanterns.

267
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,719
I suppose the fireworks rehearsal
will come later.

268
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,919
I can't believe

269
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,760
the night in the city
can be this joyous!

270
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:01,799
Qiu Yan.

271
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,640
You never came out at night?

272
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,640
As per the house rules,

273
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,200
no venturing out after sunset.

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,280
If Master found out,
you'll take a beating.

275
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,239
I see.

276
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,039
I have an idea.

277
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,039
Why don't we

278
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,520
visit this city at night?

279
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,520
I know

280
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,080
of a good restaurant nearby.

281
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
We can drink and admire lanterns there

282
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,559
to celebrate our narrow escape.

283
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,760
What do you think?

284
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Sure.

285
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,119
I love that idea, Young Lady.

286
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,799
Qin Xuan, you should see
Second Young Lady Qiu home.

287
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,880
It's late now.

288
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,840
Liang, it's only 7 PM.

289
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,359
Also,

290
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,840
you're our benefactor.

291
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,919
By right,

292
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,880
Qiu Yan and I should thank you

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,119
over a meal and wine.

294
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't you think?

295
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,400
Lord Liang,

296
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,280
allow us to express our gratitude.

297
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,960
Gratitude is not what you're after.

298
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,400
It's but a pretext

299
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,559
for your nightly city tour.

300
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,119
Qiu Yan.

301
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,119
The Chinese pickles in Shengxin Restaurant
are the best in the Capital.

302
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,239
His Majesty even permits them

303
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,080
to pickle with the water
from Jiuqing Fountain.

304
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,000
This one here?

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,440
Yes.

306
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,679
Wait.

307
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,400
Daoyu Pastry is just right in front.

308
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,280
Let me buy some glutinous snacks.

309
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,400
Wait for me here.

310
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,080
Qin Xuan, what's so special about them?

311
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,320
Lord Liang, you have no idea.

312
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,719
Their glutinous snacks

313
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,479
are only available on the 14th
and the 15th

314
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,080
of each month.

315
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,119
You can't get them any other time.

316
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,159
Young Lady, can I go with him?

317
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
Go with Mr. Qin then.

318
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,559
Don't get lost.

319
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,400
All right.

320
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,599
Let's go.

321
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,679
Qin Xuan.

322
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,880
Bravo!

323
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,479
The final chapter of
The Peculiar Case of Xiangyun.

324
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,880
Only one copy in the Capital.

325
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,359
So when I stuck inside the He residence,

326
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,280
the final chapter of The Peculiar Case
of Xiangyun was released?

327
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,080
It's just a storytelling script
conjectured by someone

328
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,119
to earn the common folk's money.

329
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,719
So

330
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,679
the Firewood Office
doesn't carry out investigations

331
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,960
the same way
the book describes it to be?

332
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,599
Our investigations are often marked
with peril.

333
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,119
We are not armchair strategists.

334
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,880
Mister,

335
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
I will take this book.

336
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,919
Thanks, miss.

337
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,479
Thank you.

338
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,400
Your book.

339
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,840
Okay.

340
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,599
The secondary rainbow adds a scratch
to its appeal,

341
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
as the Luan Bird soars freely in the sky.

342
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,719
This must be the scene.

343
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,840
You recited Far-off Journey by Qu Yuan.

344
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,679
Why?

345
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,440
Only men can read now?

346
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
I didn't say that.

347
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,599
Unfortunately, our dynasty prefers
illiterate women.

348
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,419
Those who read mainly read
Examples for Women

349
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,960
or Instructions For The Inner Quarters.

350
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,000
Not many studies Verses of Chu.

351
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,880
When I picked up books, I vowed

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,239
to read what men read.

353
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,679
It's a promise

354
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I made to someone.

355
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,760
Your childhood friend?

356
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:56,840
My benefactor.

357
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:57,960
Like you.

358
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,400
If I died for my husband
or become a nun,

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,320
I would never be able
to view scenery like this.

360
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,840
What are you looking at, My Lord?

361
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,080
You are always frowning

362
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,440
and brooding.

363
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,760
I was surprised to see you smile

364
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,799
just now.

365
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,520
Make your wish with a sky lantern.

366
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
It will come true!
Five wen for a sky lantern.

367
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,559
Sky lantern?

368
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,479
Make your wish with a sky lantern.

369
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,840
It will come true!

370
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,719
Five wen for a sky lantern.

371
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,159
Mister.

372
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,679
How do I wish?

373
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400
I have the brush and the ink here.

374
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,400
Jot down your wish on the lantern

375
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,320
and set it free.

376
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,760
The God from above will see it

377
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,320
and grant you your wish.

378
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,080
Thanks, mister.

379
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,000
Two lanterns, please.

380
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,559
- My treat.
- Miss.

381
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,359
Due to high demand,

382
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,280
I only have one left.

383
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,680
You two look good together

384
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,760
so using one sky lantern

385
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,280
might be better than using two.

386
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,800
I barely survived today.

387
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,079
It's worthy of a celebration.

388
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,280
Of course,

389
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't mind sharing this
with Lord Liang.

390

Miss, Mister.

391

392

393
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,719

It's been one night

00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,280
Because the He family is
an uprising force

509
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,239
and I don't want to cross them.

510
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,040
I saved you

511
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,719
out of pity

512
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:10,880
and that move caused me tons of trouble.

513
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,359
I went to the He family
to offer my condolences

514
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,400
and made up with them.

515
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,880
I will not cross them again

516
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,000
because of you.

517
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:16,880
Understood?

518
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,000
Nonsense.

519
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,959
If you're afraid of the He family,

520
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,520
why would you come to my rescue
so many times?

521
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,439
If you wanted to get on He's good side,

522
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,239
you could have ratted me out

523
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,599
when I opened the coffin.

524
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,160
The He family kidnapped me
and wanted to kill me.

525
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,439
You could just do nothing.

526
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,160
But no, you didn't, Lord Liang.

527
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,760
Because I was using you
to find out the truth.

528
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,359
General He is a veteran.

529
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,439
He accomplished many things
and is well-respected.

530
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,280
His son and he never listened to me

531
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,640
but now,

532
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,400
everything has changed.

533
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,199
So you're

534
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,760
using Mr. Zhao's

535
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,760
and Yueying's life to gain their favor.

536
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,239
More precisely,

537
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm blackmailing them.

538
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,400
You're not someone like this.

539
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,439
Do you know me very well?

540
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,920
Don't get ahead of yourself.

541
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,680
You know a few words and you think
you're better than anyone else.

542
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,800
You think you can read people?
How quaint.

543
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,839
I am not

544
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,119
a righteous servant of justice.

545
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,560
I saved you because you're useful.

546
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,040
No.

547
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:20,800
You were.

548
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,239
You just forgot about it.

549
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,560
If there's nothing else, go back.

550
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,000
When did you start to use me?

551
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,839
After you opened the coffin

552
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,160
and said He Feng died from poison.

553
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,560
Back then,

554
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,640
you told me you went to Jingyun Convent.

555
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,319
You said you wanted to make up
for your mistakes.

556
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,319
I was being toyed around by you.

557
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,239
Did what I say upset you?

558
00:24:59,239 --> 00:24:59,800
No,

559
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,040
it makes me hate you.

560
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,719
Have we met before?

561
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,920
My Lord,

562
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,599
never.

563
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,640
Before Noble Consort's birthday,

564
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,439
we had never met.

565
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,640
General He replied.

566
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,800
He agreed to all your conditions.

567
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,040
He will now do his best to work with

568
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,839
the Firewood Office
should we have business

569
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,880
in the Ministry of War.

570
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,160
Great.

571
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,040
The Ministry of War is corrupted
to its core.

572
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
They are just a bunch of old men
sitting in the court

573
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,760
and profiting from the fund allotted
by the Imperial Court

574
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,199
while the soldiers by the border
wear tattered clothes

575
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,359
and shed blood.

576
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,400
This time.

577
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,040
I'll make sure he loses a great deal.

578
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,199
Indeed.

579
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,160
With the cooperation from General He,

580
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
the Firewood Office can now carry out
its tasks unhindered.

581
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,839
Song Jin.

582
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,400
Use whatever reason

583
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,640
to transfer Mr. Zhao and that maid

584
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
from Fengjing Prefecture Penitentiary

585
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,040
to here.

586
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:37,000
General He might be all cooperative now

587
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,160
but when we wring harder,

588
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,520
he will be desperate enough
to kill them.

589
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,040
I will right both of their names.

590
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,920
Talk to them if you can.

591
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,359
Don't let them kill themselves
for a temporary inconvenience.

592
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,359
Noted.

593
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,359
I'll get it done now.

594
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,640
Song Jin.

595
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,560
Is it just me

596
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,680
or does the Second Young Lady
from the Qiu family

597
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
look familiar?

598
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,520
The Second Young Lady?

599
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,319
No, I don't think so.

600
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,239
Okay.

601
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:15,920
Go do your work.

602
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,680
Careful.

603
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,040
Eunuch Wang.

604
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,800
We have prepared refreshments inside.

605
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:36,560
Please help yourself to them

606
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
and take a break.

607
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,920
We still have work to do.

608
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,640
Officer Qiu, no need for the hassle.

609
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,439
Okay.

610
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,680
It is my fault

611
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,760
for bringing shame to our family.

612
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,719
Sorry for making you worry, mother.

613
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,280
Those who know

614
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,359
will know we are innocent.

615
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,920
Those who don't know

616
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,199
will not listen to your explanation.

617
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,439
All they have to say is,

618
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,239
the Qiu's plaque has been taken down,

619
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:19,400
to create all sorts of rumors.

620
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,959
Qiu Min is still celibate.

621
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,520
Now that the rumor is running amok,

622
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,760
who will wed her now?

623
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,560
I fail this household.

624
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
Please tell me what I have to do.

625
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,719
Marry Qiu Yan to someone else now.

626
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,719
Only when she leaves the Qiu family

627
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,160
that the name of the three other girls
will not be sullied.

628
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,920
Mother, I...

629
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,719
Qiu Yan is my granddaughter

630
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,560
and so are

631
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,319
the three other girls.

632
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,280
If a household wants to prosper,

633
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,680
someone has to be sacrificed.

634
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,880
She was born to an ill fate.

635
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Let her

636
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,439
take the short end of the stick.

637
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,400
His Majesty didn't inquire about
the familial business of his ministers

638
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,359
because he hoped

639
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,280
that everything could solve itself.

640
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,199
You did a great job mediating

641
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,280
between the He Family
and the Qiu Family.

642
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:34,880
You flatter me, Your Highness.

643
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,680
It is only dutiful of me to carry out

644
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,119
the Crown Prince's order.

645
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,719
You did a great job

646
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:45,920
so I want to reward you
on behalf of the Crown Prince.

647
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,720
(Bian, Madam Jin, Liang Yi's mother)

648
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,280
What about marriage?

649
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,280
Your Highness, as an inspector
in the Firewood Office,

650
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,359
I am busy enough as it is.

651
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,560
I have no time for marriage.

652
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,800
Family before career.

653
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,719
You cannot let your duty

654
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,079
distract you from your future.

655
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:15,920
Besides, your mother is concerned
about this too.

656
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:20,479
Yi'er, a marriage arranged
by Her Highness is a great blessing.

657
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
You cannot say no.

658
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,959
All right then.

659
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,920
All the government officials'

660
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,839
bachelorettes are in here.

661
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,119
Pick one you like

662
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,800
and I shall arrange for it.

663
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,719
This is inappropriate, Your Highness.

664
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,119
You should be the one who decides.

665
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,199
It's a reward

666
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,760
so you should pick someone you like.

667
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,439
Or else,

668
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,920
what's the point of this reward?

669
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,320
(Vice Minister, Ministry of Rites,
Daughter of Xiao Shen...)

670
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,990
(Qiu Min, Second Daughter of Qiu Yi,
Vice Minister, Ministry of Works...)

671
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,677
(Second Daughter of Qiu Yi, Vice Minister,
Ministry of Works, 19 years old)

672
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:17,920
Your Highness,

673
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,359
may I marry the second daughter
of Qiu Yi, from the Ministry of Works,

674
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,520
Qiu Min?

675
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,800
Why the Qiu family?

676
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,199
Indeed.

677
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,079
The marriage of Qiu Yi's daughter
was a massive mishap.

678
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,479
Qiu Yan is said
to be a tempestuous woman.

679
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,640
I'm sure his other daughters

680
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,400
are the same.

681
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,880
Your Highness, Mother,
you might not know

682
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,520
but I once went to the Qiu Residence
to announce a decree.

683
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,239
I met Qiu Min once.

684
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:47,680
She's shy, reserved,

685
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,640
mannered, and honest.

686
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,920
She's different from her sisters.

687
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,073
(Firewood Office)

688
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,439
Quite savvy of Madam.

689
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,599
She even used the Noble Consort

690
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,839
so you'll have to say yes this time.

691
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,680
But I think it's the Noble Consort's
intention to marry me off.

692
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
She merely used my mother
to deliver the message.

693
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,040
Why is Her Highness concerned about
your private life out of a sudden?

694
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,760
You truly think Her Highness
is behind all that?

695
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,959
It is His Majesty.

696
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,439
Better use someone who repents
than someone with great achievements.

697
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,359
I lead the Firewood Office now.

698
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,920
Other than my mother, I have no family.

699
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,479
So His Majesty...

700
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,239
Sir, how can you still be in the mood

701
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,319
of toying with your thumb ring?

702
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,760
It's normal that he feels anxious.

703
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,599
I suppose they have thought about it

704
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,680
for a long time already.

705
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,760
But sir,

706
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,800
when did you fall in love
with the Third Young Lady Qiu?

707
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,920
I wasn't aware of it.

708
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,920
I'll be honest with you.

709
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,520
When I announced the decree,

710
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,400
I had no idea who Qiu Min was.

711
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,160
So...

712
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,520
Why her then?

713
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,239
What do you think you'll die from?

714
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,000
From old age?

715
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,280
From your stupidity.

716
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,360
I get it now.

717
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,520
The Noble Consort asked you
to take your pick.

718
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,159
If you picked someone too popular,

719
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,919
you'd look too eager.

720
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:22,800
In the name list,
Qiu Yi is the lowest-ranking official.

721
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,719
He is neutral and keeps a low profile.

722
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,560
Finally, you become smarter.

723
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:30,719
When Lord Qiu was still alive,

724
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,879
he had many students and followers.

725
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,840
Lord Qiu has passed away

726
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,040
but they still followed Qiu Yi
out of respect.

727
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,239
People like them

728
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,719
are useful to me.

729
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,520
As for the appearance
of his second daughter,

730
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,959
as long as she doesn't throw tantrums
like Qiu Yan did,

731
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,719
it will be fine.

732
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,520
See? I get you, sir.

733
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,879
Only sometimes.

734
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:00,600
Mother.

735
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
It looks good.

736
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,159
I like this gown

737
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,280
but it doesn't go with my fan.

738
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,959
Aunt Qin is not an outsider anyway.

739
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,320
It shouldn't be a huge deal.

740
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:19,239
I finally get to go out

741
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,919
so I want to dress up nicely.

742
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,600
I can't bring dishonor to you.

743
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:25,719
Oh,

744
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,760
Qiu Yan.

745
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,679
I remember you have a folding fan
with Verses of Chu on it.

746
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,199
Can you lend me that?

747
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,919
Min'er.

748
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,040
That's the most precious belonging
of your sister.

749
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,879
Qiu Yan, you're generous, aren't you?

750
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,560
Mother, it's nothing precious at all.

751
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,199
It's just a fan.

752
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,879
Qingdai, bring it here.

753
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,520
If you like the fan a lot,

754
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,360
I can give it to you?

755
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,719
Really?

756
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,360
I'll go with Qingdai then.

757
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:02,479
Young Lady...

758
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Go.

759
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:05,919
Let's go.

760
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,521
(Peace of Mind)

761
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:39,667
(Majestic)

762
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,479
The Qin family is cruel this time.

763
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,159
They invited all the other girls

764
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,760
except you.

765
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,560
I don't care, Mother.

766
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,320
I can't imagine

767
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,320
what you have been through
in He Residence.

768
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,120
Even back home,
you have to deal with rumors.

769
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,479
Whether I'm at home or outside,

770
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,040
as long as they don't talk

771
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,439
in front of me,

772
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,840
I can pretend not to hear anything.

773
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,560
Haven't you taught me this, Mother?

774
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,879
My heart is an untainted land.

775
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,479
If I don't take anything to heart,

776
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,760
then I will become invincible.

777
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,679
The word invincible describes you aptly.

778
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,760
Yan'er. You haven't been eating

779
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,040
or sleeping much lately.

780
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,399
If it's not the marriage annulment
that bothers you,

781
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,520
what else then?

782
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,479
Nothing.

783
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:45,800
You're still the same.

784
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,080
You keep everything to yourself.

785
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,679
Is it related to the fan?

786
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,679
Not at all.

787
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,959
It has nothing to do with the fan.

788
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,520
It's an old fan.

789
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,959
I'm just used to using it.

790
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,679
I'm getting sick of it now

791
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,080
so I've been meaning to get a new one.

792
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,560
I should go back, Mother.

793
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,899
(Qin Residence)

794
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:12,239
The girls from Mr. Qiu's four wives

795
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,760
have all bloomed so beautifully.

796
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,399
When I saw you six years ago,

797
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:18,679
you were just a little girl.

798
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,760
What is your name?

799
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:22,959
Qiu Ying.

800
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,120
Inspired by the accessory, keyura.

801
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,239
The Qiu sisters
all have interesting names.

802
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:32,919
Mei, Min, Ying.

803
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,719
Their Chinese radical is yu.
It's more masculine-sounding.

804
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,520
Quite a refreshing take.

805
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,439
Only my cousin, Yan,

806
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,239
whose Chinese radical is nv.

807
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:43,959
She was raised by the concubine.

808
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,520
Any name will do.

809
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
There's still a difference.

810
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,399
Qiu Yan grew up outside.

811
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
Madam Liu and her cannot be included
in the family tree

812
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,520
so that's why her name is Yan.

813
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,840
I see.

814
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,399
Why is Qiu Yan not here then?

815
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,840
Han. Han.

816
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,760
The match maker from the Jia family
is here, you're...

817
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,080
Mother gave me the order.

818
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,600
What can I do?

819
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,159
I will talk to her then.

820
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,199
Han.

821
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,520
Mother said

822
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
if Yan'er stays with us,

823
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,399
the name of the other girls

824
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,719
will suffer too.

825
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,360
Including our Min'er.

826
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,399
But Mr. Jia is old.

827
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,919
He has many wives and maids.

828
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,199
If you marry Yan'er to him,

829
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,919
you're just sending her
to a bunch of wolves.

830
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,600
My heart aches for Yan'er too

831
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,639
but what can we do?

832
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,439
If Yan'er is married to Mr. Jia,

833
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,520
at least she's still his rightful wife
by name.

834
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:52,520
Han.

835
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,479
We have done

836
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,000
everything we can as parents.

837
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,719
I know you're a considerate person.

838
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,000
Let's put a stop to our disagreement

839
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,679
about how we should handle Yan'er.

840
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:08,439
Han.

841
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,479
Yan'er.

842
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:19,639
Hurry up.

843
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,520
The match maker
has been waiting for a long time.

844
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,800
Young Lady.

845
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Perhaps you can still

846
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,040
- talk to your parents.
- Coming!

847
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,600
Your mother will find a way.

848
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,280
No.

849
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,919
My parents have done everything
they can.

850
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,040
I have to

851
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,919
get out of this myself.

852
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,120
Qiu Min.

853
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,800
Qin Xuan.

854
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,199
Can you

855
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:56,439
give this to Qiu Yan?

856
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,399
She's not here today

857
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,800
so I suppose
she must be quite upset lately.

858
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,879
Please send my regards to her.

859
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,239
I was supposed to give you a gift too,

860
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,040
Qiu Min.

861
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,199
But I run out of jade.

862
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,360
I owe you this one.

863
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I'll give it to you next time.

864
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,879
No problem, Qin Xuan.

865
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,520
I will give it to her.

866
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,840
Thanks, Qiu Min.

867
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,560
She looks good.

868
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,239
But her waist is thin.

869
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,600
It might be hard for her
to bear a child.

870
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,520
I...

871
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,320
Do you have any illnesses lately?

872
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,479
What illness?

873
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:14,439
She's strong and healthy.

874
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,639
The physician said she was fertile.

875
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:17,840
Exactly.

876
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,639
The physician

877
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:20,879
said I was strong.

878
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,560
But ever since I was conceived,

879
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,879
I have this heat energy with me.

880
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,399
I'm fine with it.

881
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,320
But if I ever get pregnant,

882
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,879
I might end up miscarrying.

883
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,479
Even if I don't,

884
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,239
the baby will either be deformed

885
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:37,479
or have jaundice or hernia.

886
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:38,439
Shut up.

887
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
No physician has ever said that.

888
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:40,600
Madam,

889
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,360
granny is here to see me
for the arranged marriage.

890
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:43,840
If I conceal all my defects,

891
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,560
I will just ruin someone else's life.

892
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,879
But don't worry about it, granny.

893
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,199
The physician said

894
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,080
that if I could

895
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,879
have ginseng, bird nest, and ganoderma

896
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,159
every day,

897
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,879
I might recover

898
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,560
within three to five years.

899
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:03,000
Granny.

900
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,399
She's just spewing gibberish.

901
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,879
She's a mischievous girl.
It's all a joke.

902
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,320
It's great seeing Miss Yan here.

903
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,120
I have to inform Mr. Jia.

904
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:13,320
See you.

905
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:14,959
Granny, you'll leave this soon?

906
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,159
Granny?

907
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:16,959
See you.

908
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:17,760
Careful.

909
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,879
Oh, dear.

910
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:20,760
If you say this in front
of the match maker,

911
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,000
you'll never find a suitor.

912
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,320
Granny, let me see you off.

913
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,879
Granny, she was just joking.

914
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:28,760
Don't take it seriously.

915
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,879
She's as healthy as a horse.
