=Episode 32=

18
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,239
Sir.

19
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,360
Yao Gai and Shi Xiaoxiao
have been buried

20
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,919
next to Song Jin's tomb.

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,160
Liang Yi's hunters

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,919
are all trained assassins.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,879
Elusive and cruel.

24
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,279
It seems like the culprit behind

25
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,800
isn't just a political rival of his.

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,800
Sir, if you're concerned,

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
I can investigate further.

28
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:15,960
Good.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,320
Sir, Liang Yi turned himself in.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,730
(Main Administrative Office)

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,559
Sir.

32
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,520
Official Yuan,

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,119
wanted criminal, Liang Yi, escaped
with his concubine, Su Yiwan.

34
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,720
They have been captured by me

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,399
and will be handed over
to you, Official Yuan.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,240
We have told you everything we know.

37
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,279
You should realize

38
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,199
that this is just not a rivalry
between you and him.

39
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,600
It's between Dashuo and Northern Liang.

40
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,759
Based on what you said,

41
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,639
Northern Liang spies
want to eliminate Liang Yi

42
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,839
in case he reveals the Noble Consort's
true bloodline.

43
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,160
One thing doesn't add up.

44
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,119
Liang Yi, before Mr. Zhan went to you,

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,320
the mastermind came to me.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,199
Mr. Zhan's dying words

47
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
isn't the reason
why you have to be eliminated.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
It's a bait to lure you into this trap.

49
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,720
You are their target
from the very beginning.

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,039
Then there's only one reason left

51
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,520
why Northern Liang spies
want to kill me.

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,520
They want to stop me from launching
a military reform

53
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,720
within the Northern Army of Dashuo.

54
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,639
What a fancy name you have there

55
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,800
for collusion and conspiracy.

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,479
I am collaborating
with different parties in secret.

57
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,600
But what I'm doing is uniting
different forces in the Imperial Court

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,639
to reform Dashuo's heavy military budget

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
and increase its military power.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,720
Northern Liang and Dashuo fight
back and forth

61
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,039
in secret for many years.

62
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,199
A war will break out eventually.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,600
We have to be prepared.

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,199
So for all these years, you have been
sacrificing yourself

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,320
for the greater good.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,080
You don't have to believe me

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
but please understand
what's at stake here.

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,440
Getting rid of the Northern Liang spies
should be the priority.

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,440
And His Majesty cannot know of this.
We'll tell him later.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,919
We all know

71
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,080
the Crown Prince
is a wise and virtuous man.

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,520
He will be a fine ruler in the future.

73
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,919
But if His Majesty

74
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,800
knows that the Crown Prince
is half a Northern Liang.

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,360
His title will be revoked.

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,359
Worse, he might die.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
In that case,

78
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,720
if I work with you,

79
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
not only am I an accomplice,

80
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,480
I will also be lying
to the Emperor then?

81
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,799
You're a loyal servant, Official Yuan.

82
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm sure you will put Dashuo's needs
above your own.

83
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,559
Considering our less-than-friendly past,

84
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,160
it is naive of you to think
you can come here,

85
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,559
pull the "nation before self" card,

86
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,480
and persuade me to join your cause.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
Yuan Lang.

88
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,839
We have fought many times.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,679
Let me ask you this.

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,359
Why do you want to get rid of me?

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
Because I cannot bear seeing

92
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,559
Dashuo fall into the hands

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,799
of unscrupulous officials like you.

94
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,640
Well said.

95
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,519
We fought and fought.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,799
You framed the Qiu family
and killed Song Jin.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
I would love to take your life.

98
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,799
But after all, this is between us.

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,799
Brothers can argue among themselves
but they will fight an enemy together.

100
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,559
Like you said, we might not see
eye to eye

101
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200
but we care for Dashuo.

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,480
Qiu Yan and I turned ourselves in today

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
because we're willing to bet

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,799
that you're still a patriotic person
despite your thirst for power.

105
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,959
Yuan Lang,
we're trying real hard to convince you.

106
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,119
Can you be more sensible?

107
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,480
You think highly of me

108
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,720
and so I won't let you down.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,079
Yuan Lang,

110
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,079
we have to raid

111
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,279
the Northern Liang merchants' storage

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,079
immediately.

113
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,279
Before the operation,

114
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,640
there's one more thing to do.

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,359
We need to get rid of

116
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,399
the snitch
within the Main Administrative Office.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,679
What do you mean?

118
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,440
Previously, when you asked Shi Xiaoxiao

119
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,160
to lure me out of the area under
Ministry of War's jurisdiction.

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,679
Those Northern Liang assassins

121
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,399
were also lying in ambush.

122
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,519
Someone is working for them
in the Main Administrative Office.

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
We surrendered ourselves in plain sight

124
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
so that the snitch
knows what is happening.

125
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,279
If he sees us talking to you in secret,

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,079
he'll try to spread the news
as soon as possible.

127
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,799
Now, we wait

128
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,200
and see

129
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:13,320
who tries to sneak out
of the Main Administrative Office.

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,880
That person will be the snitch.

131
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:26,028
(Main Administrative Office)

132
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,000
Lord Liang is now a witness
in the Main Administrative Office

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
and will be assisting us
in the investigation.

134
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,480
Follow his orders

135
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,440
in the next few days.

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,239
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,200
Is everyone here?

138
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,000
Sir, one is absent.

139
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,040
It's Wang who is in charge
of the keys to torture devices.

140
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,279
Where is he?

141
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,239
He's a mute

142
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,399
so we didn't ask.

143
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,839
This is Wang's abode.

144
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,720
Search this place.

145
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,359
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
It's in Northern Liang's tongue.

147
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,920
Wang looks like an honest man.

148
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,959
I didn't know he is this cunning.

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,519
Sir.

150
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,600
Wang has been captured
per your order.

151
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
He's outside now.

152
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,559
Come.

153
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,679
Give him a brush and paper.

154
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,159
Make him confess
all about his espionage.

155
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:34,200
Yes, sir.

156
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,719
Sir, Mr. Wang is illiterate.

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,640
He is indeed mute

158
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,559
but he is not illiterate.

159
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,253
(Main Administrative Office)

160
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
If you keep pretending,

161
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,880
you will be tortured.

162
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,520
Come forth.

163
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,239
Interrogate him.

164
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,320
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,559
Get up.

166
00:08:59,359 --> 00:08:59,840
Come.

167
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Wait.

168
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:20,719
What?

169
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,359
We just met Wang.

170
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,559
When he was looking for a key,

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
he had to hold that bundle of keys
this far away to identify it.

172
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,280
This indicates that he has bad eyesight.

173
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,840
He can only view something clearly
if that object is far from him.

174
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,919
His handwriting can't possibly
be as small as these.

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,559
He is not the Northern Liang spy.

176
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,679
Someone framed him.

177
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,840
In that case,

178
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,760
that spy is definitely something.

179
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,799
Not only did he find out about our plan
beforehand,

180
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,320
he even came up

181
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,080
with an impromptu strategy
to frame the defenseless Wang.

182
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I have an idea

183
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,719
but I need your help, Official Yuan.

184
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,559
How can I help?

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,119
You can claim

186
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,960
that Main Administrative Office will counteract
with the same strategy

187
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,520
and send someone to Northern Liang
as a secret agent.

188
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,880
By saying

189
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
that you need someone who can imitate
handwriting the best,

190
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,799
you'll ask everyone to copy this note.

191
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,880
We just have to find out the one
who shares similar handwriting.

192
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,119
I'll see it done.

193
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,200
Sir, all copies are here.

194
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,520
Everyone has done it?

195
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,080
Yes.

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,080
I think

197
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,000
someone is missing.

198
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,760
Impossible. I did a headcount.

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
You haven't done it.

200
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,080
Everyone has to do it, including you.

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,559
Right, Jiang Yun.

202
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,559
Go write one copy.

203
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,159
Yes, sir.

204
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,200
Stop.

205
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,239
No need to pretend.

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,840
You slipped up there.

207
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,159
I said "stop" in Northern Liang's tongue
just now.

208
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,599
You understood it.

209
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,159
If you don't know
the Northern Liang's tongue,

211
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,960
you'll look up out of curiosity.

212
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,679
If you know
the Northern Liang's tongue,

213
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,200
you will try to hide it

214
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,919
and stifle your curiosity.

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,599
Jiang Yun.

216
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
Those who wear a mask for a long time

217
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,640
are used to suppressing
their basic instincts.

218
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
I was too focused just now

219
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,080
and I didn't react in time.

220
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,440
Liang Yi,

221
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,280
you can't possibly think you can

222
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,840
incriminate me with this?

223
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,239
Sir.

224
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,760
Liang Yi and that woman
are up to no good.

225
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,719
They are trying to sow discord among us.

226
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,280
That alone is not enough, of course.

227
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,400
The real proof hides

228
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,159
on this paper.

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,520
Imitating handwriting is just for show.

230
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,359
The trap is what comes after.

231
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,880
I will copy this letter first.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,799
I'm sure my technique

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,799
will be able to fool the spy.

234
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,760
I will then modify slightly

235
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,719
one character.

236
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll change the Horizontal here
to a Throw.

237
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,640
Those who don't know
the Northern Liang's tongue

238
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,159
will imitate everything

239
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,760
and place a Throw here.

240
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,840
But the spy who knows
the Northern Liang's tongue

241
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,559
will be too focused on changing
his own handwriting

242
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,520
and he will assume this letter given
is the one he wrote,

243
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,039
so he won't pay extra attention.

244
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,880
He will then place a Horizontal here
out of habit.

245
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
This character here.

246
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,960
Explanation, please?

247
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,320
Come forth.

248
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,960
Jiang Yun.

249
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,400
It is you.

250
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,440
You worked for me for many years.

251
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,440
Why

252
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:33,799
did you do this?

253
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,719
Put him in jail.

254
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:00,719
Yes, sir.

255
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,719
Speak.

256
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,200
Confess now!

257
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,719
You disguised as a Dashuo
and spied on us for many years.

258
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,440
Due to our shared history,

259
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,119
I will be a bit more lenient to you.

260
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,559
Come clean already.

261
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,719
Let me die!

262
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,799
You want to die

263
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,359
and be a national hero?

264
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,679
You know what the Main Administrative Office
is capable of.

265
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,000
I will use every torture method

266
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,919
on you once today.

267
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,479
I confess!

268
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,599
I confess!

269
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,479
I confess.

270
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
This spot west of the city

271
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,919
is the hideout of Northern Liang spies.

272
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,080
Sir, Miss Qiu Min is here.

273
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,760
Qin Xuan.

274
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,839
Why are you here?

275
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
I went to the Ministry of War

276
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,560
and they said Official Yuan

277
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,319
of the Main Administrative Office required
your assistance for a few days.

278
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,000
I was worried that he might
be extra harsh on you

279
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,800
so I rushed here.

280
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,439
I have an urgent business here
in the Main Administrative Office.

281
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,400
Just return home.

282
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,839
Qiu Yan is here too?

283
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,199
It's complicated.

284
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,439
I'll explain to you later.

285
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,040
Wherever she is,

286
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,599
you will be there too.

287
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,199
She can help you

288
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,319
with every case.

289
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,199
Why can't I?

290
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,479
Qiu Min.

291
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,800
The Northern Liang assassins normally
hide within the civilian buildings.

292
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,239
There are only a few of them

293
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,439
but they

294
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,119
are well trained

295
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,640
and can fight multiple enemies at once.

296
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,119
Win by wits, not by force.

297
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,680
The Firewood Office has this
colorless and odorless sleeping gas

298
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,239
that can make the target lose
consciousness straight away.

299
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,839
With our people and this gas,

300
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,040
it shouldn't be a problem.

301
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,920
However, the Firewood Office was raided.

302
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,199
I have no idea where the gas cans went.

303
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,760
Everything from the Firewood Office

304
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,319
is confiscated within our storeroom.

305
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,719
Raiding the Firewood Office

306
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,560
sure enriches
the Main Administrative Office's reserves.

307
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,160
Without you and the Firewood Office,

308
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,800
these new gadgets

309
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,800
would be given to
the Main Administrative Office anyway.

310
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,199
They merely came home.

311
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,079
Enough bickering.

312
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,959
Gentlemen, I have one concern.

313
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,640
The residential area by the west
is populated.

314
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,239
If those ruthless killers hold

315
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,040
those civilians hostage

316
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,800
in a desperate move,

317
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,760
it makes the matter
more complicated.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,760
We need to find a way
to evacuate the civilians

319
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,359
without alerting
the Northern Liang assassins.

320
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,640
The poor

321
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,040
live by the west of the city.

322
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,400
We can post a notice by the street

323
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,520
that says the government is handing out
free rice per capita

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,239
to help them.

325
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,040
All the residents in that area

326
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,239
will be mobilized.

327
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,319
Good thinking.

328
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,719
All right.

329
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,119
Let's do it then.

330
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,959
Qiu Yan.

331
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Stay here

332
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,359
and wait for me.

333
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,640
Okay. Don't worry about me.

334
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,160
Line up properly.

335
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,479
Two lines.

336
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,640
Don't shove.

337
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,439
There's enough for everyone.

338
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,479
Come. Line up properly.

339
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,599
Come.

340
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,800
Make two lines. Queue properly.

341
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,959
Don't shove.

342
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:47,959
Don't shove.

343
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Hurry and claim free rice!

344
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,760
No more rice if you're late. Hurry up!

345
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
No more rice if you're late.

346
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,920
You two, leave by the east.

347
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,040
Yes, sir.

348
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,880
You three, leave by the north.

349
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,119
Yes, sir.

350
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,640
Why are you so clingy towards Qin Xuan

351
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
that you even came all the way here?

352
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,520
Funny you said that, Qiu Yan.

353
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,359
If I don't come here,

354
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,959
how can I see him?

355
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,040
Did our mother find our father

356
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,280
in the Ministry of Works every few days?

357
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,239
He can't refuse to see you

358
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,520
in public.

359
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
But being this eager will only backfire.

360
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
Why not give him more time

361
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,439
so that he can accept you gradually?

362
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,520
When it comes to romance,

363
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,479
I'm not as calculating or conniving

364
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
as you.

365
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,920
I want to help you.

366
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,880
I don't need your help.

367
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,119
Where are you going?

368
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,040
I don't want to be
in the same room with you, all right?

369
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,680
What are you doing?

370
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,040
Don't worry.

371
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,239
It will be a quick death.

372
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,719
You let us capture you on purpose?

373
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,520
Using Wang as the scapegoat

374
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,880
was a flawed plan

375
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,920
so I was prepared
for the eventual exposure.

376
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,479
What?

377
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,160
You think I don't know

378
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,280
how to play along?

379
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,920
What about Liang Yi and others?

380
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,079
What will you do to them?

381
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,079
Those who know our secret

382
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,800
will die.

383
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
If you despise her this much,

384
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,599
why do you keep imitating her?

385
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,400
Weren't you trying to be like her

386
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,479
that day you analyzed the case for me?

387
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,680
Unfortunately, you're inferior to her.

388
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,239
You can never be like her.

389
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,199
Qiu Min.

390
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,319
Min'er.

391
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,359
Qiu Min. Min'er.

392
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,719
Min'er.

393
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:41,597
(Main Administrative Office)

394
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,359
Min'er.

395
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,680
I thought something bad
happened to you too.

396
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:46,800
Thank the God.

397
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,199
Qiu Yan.

398
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,160
What happened?

399
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,560
Jiang Yun escaped from the prison.

400
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,640
They have been playing along
with our plan.

401
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,199
An ambush was set in place
in the hideout Jiang Yun told us.

402
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,800
Qin Xuan is still there.

403
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,959
We need to save him.

404
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,479
We can't.

405
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,359
We don't have any manpower now.

406
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:03,880
What...

407
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,160
What should we do then?

408
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,800
Think!

409
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
You ruthless killers.

410
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,640
Surrender at once!

411
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,400
Take them down.

412
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,719
Sir, one Northern Liang is still alive.

413
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,119
Bring him back for questioning.

414
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:15,719
Yes, sir.

415
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Bring him in.

416
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,319
Official Yuan, why is Liang Yi here?

417
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,640
The Empyrean Fairy told me

418
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,199
this was where they made
counterfeit money.

419
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,319
Yet

420
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:29,239
I found no objects relevant
to the counterfeit notes in the house.

421
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,280
What is happening?

422
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,920
Wanted criminal, Liang Yi, is now
under the Main Administrative Office

423
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,560
to assist us in the investigation.

424
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,520
It is a grave matter

425
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:41,239
so I will submit a memorandum
to His Majesty to explain everything.

426
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,319
Please bear with me for instance.

427
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,119
Thank you for this favor, Official Tong.

428
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
How do you know we were ambushed?

429
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,599
It was all part of Jiang Yun's plan.

430
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,000
The Northern Liang assassins
would lie in wait here

431
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,239
while he

432
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,079
prepared to break out of the prison
in the Main Administrative Office.

433
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:04,920
When all of you were gone,

434
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
he wanted to kill me.

435
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,760
He did?

436
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,199
Are you injured?

437
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,760
Let me check.

438
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,400
Good.

439
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,079
Where is Jiang Yun?

440
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
He's dead.

441
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,079
I killed him.

442
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,119
It's my fault

443
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,839
for letting Jiang Yun lure me here.

444
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,760
And you were left all alone
in the Main Administrative Office.

445
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm sorry.

446
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,280
It's not your fault.

447
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,160
The Northern Liangs are cunning.

448
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,760
Does it hurt, Qin Xuan?

449
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,000
It's fine.

450
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:02,800
Thank you.

451
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,800
Sir, you're back finally.

452
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,079
I came back after distributing the rice

453
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,520
but I couldn't find Qiu Yan and Qiu Min.

454
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,119
And then, I heard that Jiang Yun escaped

455
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,079
and all of you were ambushed.

456
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,439
I was worried sick.

457
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:50,760
Where's Lord Liang?

458
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:56,920
That man confessed.

459
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,839
The Northern Liangs plan to reveal

460
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,239
Her Highness's indenture contract
once the Crown Prince

461
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,199
ascends to the throne.
His Northern Liang bloodline

462
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,199
will incite other feudal lords
to rebel against the new Emperor.

463
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
When Dashuo is rife with in-fighting,

464
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,520
Northern Liang will take advantage of it
and invade southward.

465
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,599
A huge crisis awaits Dashuo.

466
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
The key of their plan is
that indenture contract.

467
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,079
The good news is

468
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,000
the contract

469
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,640
is still in the hands of the snitch
within the Imperial Palace.

470
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,239
If we can find him,

471
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,040
we find the indenture contract.

472
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,640
What the spy did

473
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,920
already revealed who he is.

474
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,599
If he could single out the evidence

475
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,119
and made so that Noble Consort Guo
would chance upon the memorandum,

476
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,000
he must be someone His Majesty trusts

477
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,319
and has access to the memorandums.

478
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,920
His Majesty's confidants are

479
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:38,599
the Grand Preceptor,
Imperial Commander Yan, and Eunuch Liu.

480
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
Their presence is allowed when
His Majesty reads the memorandums.

481
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,640
In other words,

482
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,280
it's one of them.

483
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,599
Since it's just one-way communication,

484
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,599
it means he

485
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,439
still doesn't know
that the assassins' hideout was dismantled.

486
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,439
In that case,

487
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,239
I have an idea.

488
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,479
They have access to the memorandums

489
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,839
but due to their different position,

490
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,160
the time and space they can touch
the memorandums

491
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,119
will vary.

492
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,640
If we can let them see

493
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,959
different memorandums,

494
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,319
they will disseminate
different messages.

495
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,160
We can use this to identify

496
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,839
the snitch in the Imperial Palace.

497
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,760
(To make the snitch circulate an info,)

498
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
(that information has to be
irresistibly enticing.)

499
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,400
(I will submit three memorandums.)

500
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,040
(All of them)

501
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,359
(are to suggest His Majesty send
a secret agent to Northern Liang.)

502
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,640
(I will attach the list of candidates)

503
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,319
(so three memorandums will come with
three different lists.)

504
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:29,560
(And then,)

505
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,079
(I'll submit two of them
to the Noble Consort in advance.)

506
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,800
(Her Highness will need to work with us)

507
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,239
(and bribe the eunuch)

508
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,400
(in charge of delivering memorandums
to His Majesty.)

509
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,599
(The first memorandum)

510
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,719
(will be submitted alongside other
memorandums from the ministers.)

511
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,079
(Eunuch Liu will be organizing)

512
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,760
(the memorandums in order of importance)

513
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,680
(inside the Imperial Study
for His Majesty.)

514
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,880
(The second memorandum)

515
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
(will replace the first by the
bribed eunuch before he enters)

516
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,040
(the Imperial Study.)

517
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,359
(After receiving the memorandums,)

518
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
(the bribed eunuch will hand them over
to Imperial Commander Yan for check-ups.)

519
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,520
(The third memorandum)

520
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,000
(will replace the second
before the bribed eunuch enters)

521
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,560
(the temple.)

522
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,680
(Grand Preceptor will read
the memorandums out loud to His Majesty.)

523
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:40,680
(That way,)

524
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,880
(these three individuals
will come in contact)

525
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,079
(with three different memorandums.)

526
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,880
(We just have to wait for the
carrier pigeon from the spy.)

527
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,831
(Memorandum)

528
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,479
Your Majesty,

529
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,879
profit is important for the friendship
of two nations.

530
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,199
Northern Liang merchants often travel
to the Capital to trade.

531
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,159
Today, I discovered

532
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
a group of Northern Liangs...

533
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,919
Everyone is asleep.

534
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,199
Why are you awake?

535
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,479
You're also awake.

536
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,679
Let me keep you company.

537
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:58,919
Let's sit.

538
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,360
In the Royal Academy,

539
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:15,800
you told me

540
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:17,879
that when we die,

541
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,280
we will become stars

542
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,320
that illuminate the ground
for the living souls.

543
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,479
Do you think

544
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,520
Song Jin can forgive me for the decision

545
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,439
I made today?

546
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,439
Song Jin grew up with you.

547
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,120
I'm sure he understands what
you're trying to achieve here.

548
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,479
I believe

549
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,600
my parents

550
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,919
will understand my decision too.

551
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,159
What?

552
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,000
You can kiss me
but I can't kiss you now?

553
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,439
When I was chased by Jiang Yun,

554
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:17,120
I thought I would die there.

555
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,679
At that moment, I regret

556
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,760
that I never kissed you once.

557
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,399
The carrier pigeon is here.

558
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:49,639
Qin Xuan.

559
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,874
(For Eunuch Liu, Grand Preceptor,
and Imperial Commander Yan respectively)

560
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,959
It's Imperial Commander Yan.

561
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,896
(Map of Luojing)

562
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
If we want to arrest him in secret,

563
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,719
we need to get rid of his guards.

564
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,760
Otherwise, this plan won't be foolproof

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,120
and we might alert him instead.

566
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,919
We need to find a way
to lure him out alone.

567
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,199
I'll do it.

568
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,919
Official Yuan, you worked with
the Northern Liangs once.

569
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:35,479
If you go to him,

570
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:37,120
it'll raise suspicion.

571
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,479
Liang Yi is a fugitive now

572
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:40,679
so he can't go either.

573
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,199
Are you sure?

574
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,000
Qin Xuan.

575
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,280
Wait for me.

576
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,959
Qin Xuan.

577
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,120
Carry this pouch with you.

578
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,639
You're facing a Northern Liang
spy this time.

579
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,439
There's a safety charm inside.

580
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,760
Just for peace of mind.

581
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,000
If I die,

582
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,000
I'll be emancipated.

583
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,120
Be careful.

584
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:40,679
I'll wait for your news
in the Main Administrative Office.

585
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,479
Come with me.

586
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,000
Why?

587
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:51,639
I left you alone
in the Main Administrative Office last time

588
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,000
and you almost lost your life.

589
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,000
I will not let that happen again.

590
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,840
From now on,

591
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:00,000
you have to be in my view.

592
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,199
Let's go.

593
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Imperial Commander Yan.

594
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,120
Mr. Qin.

595
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,479
Imperial Commander Yan,

596
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,600
a conflict broke out between the
Ministry of War and Imperial Guards.

597
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,479
Ministry of War is in chaos now.

598
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
I'm afraid that the situation
might snowball.

599
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,879
It will look grim
if His Majesty knows of it.

600
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,760
Can you come
to contain the situation, sir?

601
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,959
Go first. I'll come later.

602
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:47,639
Yes, sir.

603
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,439
Why did they fight?

604
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,760
It's just a misunderstanding.

605
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,879
Ministry of War got a budget cut
this month

606
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,760
so they couldn't give good equipment
to the Imperial Guards.

607
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,840
The Imperial Guards aren't aware of this

608
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,360
and thought the Ministry of War

609
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,479
was embezzling the money.

610
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,360
The logistics member of
the Imperial Guards

611
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,280
then caused a scene
in the Ministry of War.

612
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,600
They talked

613
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,120
and fought when everything went sour.

614
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,159
Here, please, Imperial Commander Yan.

615
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:21,639
Mr. Qin.

616
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,679
Who is the one
leading the Imperial Guards?

617
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,120
He didn't give us his name.

618
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,639
He just said
he's in charge of logistics.

619
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:31,000
But the one in charge of logistics

620
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,479
is convalescing at home.

621
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,879
Perhaps I misheard.

622
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,520
How does he look like then?

623
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,159
Like a brute.

624
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,439
Nothing special.

625
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,199
You brat. Where are you bringing me to?

626
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,600
Who are you?

627
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,280
Let go of me.

628
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:56,800
Liang Yi!

629
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,760
Pardon me, Imperial Commander Yan.

630
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,320
What are you doing?

631
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,959
I will report this to His Majesty

632
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,280
and all of you will pay dearly!

633
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,840
Yuan Lang, you're colluding
with traitors now?

634
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,439
You want to betray your country too?

635
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,439
We know what you're up to.

636
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:26,719
Stop pretending.

637
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,959
What do you mean?

638
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,719
Imperial Commander Yan,
you're the Northern Liang spy.

639
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,959
What Northern Liang? What spy?

640
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,280
All of you are mad.

641
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,159
This morning,

642
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:38,439
a carrier pigeon was sent to the
Northern Liang spy hideout.

643
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,840
It carries the list
of secret agent candidates

644
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,760
who will be operating in Northern Liang,
proposed by Official Yuan.

645
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,199
Other than us, only you

646
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,439
saw this list.

647
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,239
If you're not the Northern Liang spy,

648
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
how did you get your hands
on this info then?

649
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,360
Nonsense.

650
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:51,760
I have no idea

651
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,159
what list you're talking about.

652
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,159
It's no use to deny.

653
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,560
If you won't confess,

654
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,239
I'll bring you back
to the Main Administrative Office

655
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,600
and make you talk.

656
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:01,919
Wait.

657
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,879
You said you received a carried pigeon
this morning.

658
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,360
But I was in the Imperial Guards Camp
last night.

659
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,239
I never went back home.

660
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,919
And this morning, I came to the palace
directly from the camp.

661
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,719
I was escorted by my guards.

662
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,159
I couldn't send out any carrier pigeons.

663
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,600
If you don't trust me,

664
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:20,080
verify it with the Imperial Guards Camp.

665
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,080
Check

666
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,439
if there's a spot for pigeon raising
in the camp too while you're at it.

667
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,959
Are we mistaken?

668
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,280
If he's not the spy,

669
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,719
then it falls to either Eunuch Liu
or Grand Preceptor.

670
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,399
One of them saw through our plan

671
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,199
and framed Imperial Commander Yan.

672
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:44,159
Wait.

673
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,399
If the person saw through our plan

674
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,959
and knows we're after him,

675
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,439
the best way to hide himself

676
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,199
is to stay put

677
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:54,959
and not send out any info.

678
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,280
Sending out info confirms the fact

679
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,639
that one of them is the spy.

680
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,600
Framing Imperial Commander Yan

681
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,399
will only expedite the revelation.

682
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:07,719
There's one less suspect now

683
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,120
so he's even more vulnerable.

684
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:12,159
If this will expose him,

685
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:14,159
why did he do this?

686
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:16,800
Imperial Commander Yan.

687
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,439
What is on Eunuch Liu's and
Grand Preceptor's itinerary today?

688
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,560
Sorry for the mishap,
Imperial Commander Yan.

689
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:25,560
This concerns the safety of His Majesty

690
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:26,760
and I ask for your understanding.

691
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,120
Last night,

692
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:37,919
Grand Preceptor said he managed
to concoct a new pill.

693
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:40,239
He invited His Majesty over
for the ritual and its consumption.

694
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:42,600
This morning, the Grand Preceptor
and Eunuch Liu

695
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,719
escorted His Majesty
to the Chinese alchemy room.

696
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,320
Perhaps the Grand Preceptor
wishes to harm His Majesty?

697
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,239
The Northern Liangs can only execute

698
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,919
their plan after His Majesty's demise.

699
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:55,439
Now that the snitch

700
00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:56,919
knows he's about to be exposed,

701
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,600
he's executing the plan preemptively.

702
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:00,639
So

703
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,560
the Chinese alchemy room is the trap.

704
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,000
Let's go now.
